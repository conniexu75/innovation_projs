https://openalex.org/W2160327135,"A soluble DNA carrier system was used to target a foreign gene specifically to liver in vivo via asialoglycoprotein receptors. The DNA carrier was prepared consisting of a galactose-terminal (asialo-)glycoprotein, asialoorosomucoid (AsOR), covalently linked to poly-L-lysine. The conjugate was complexed in a 2:1 molar ratio (based on AsOR content of the conjugate) to the plasmid, pSV2 CAT, containing the gene for the bacterial enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Intravenous injection of [32P]plasmid DNA complexed to the carrier demonstrated specific hepatic targeting with 85% of the injected counts taken up by the liver in 10 min compared to only 17% of the counts when the same amount of [32P]DNA alone was injected under identical conditions. Targeted pSV2 CAT DNA was detected at a level of 1.0 ng/g liver by hybridization of a [32P]pSV2 CAT cDNA probe to rat liver DNA extracted 24 h after intravenous injection of AsOR-poly-L-lysine-DNA complex containing 1.0 mg of DNA. Homogenates of livers taken 24 h after injection of the complex revealed that the targeted CAT gene was functional as reflected by the detection of CAT activity (approximately 4 microunits/mg protein). Livers from control animals that received individual constituents of the complex produced no CAT activity. Simultaneous injection of excess AsOR to compete with the AsOR-poly-L-lysine-DNA complex for uptake by the liver inhibited CAT gene expression. Assays for CAT activity in other organs (spleen, kidney, lungs) failed to demonstrate any activity in these organs. This new soluble DNA carrier system can permit targeted delivery of foreign genes specifically to liver with resultant foreign gene expression in vivo."

In this report, the effect of cytokines on the production of one of these strains that shows a tropism for mononuclear phagocytes, designated HIV-1JR-FL, was studied. Primary peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes infected with HIV-1JR-FL were treated with the hematopoietic factors: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). The M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and gamma-IFN were able to alter HIV-1 production under different conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2052728159,"Kidney organ culture was used to study the conversion of embryonic mesenchymal cells into a polarized, differentiated kidney epithelium. We examined the expression of laminin, a basement membrane glycoprotein, during this conversion. The B chains of laminin were constitutively expressed, whereas the appearance of the A chain of laminin was dependent on embryonic induction and coincided with the onset of cell polarization. Antisera against the carboxy-terminal end of laminin inhibited polarization but did not affect the developmental events that precede polarization. Antisera against N-terminal parts of laminin failed to inhibit morphogenesis. Since the fragments at the carboxy-terminal end contain parts of the A chain, we suggest that the appearance of this chain is fundamental for initiation of cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2088903986,"During the early stages of its developmental program, Dictyostelium discoideum expresses cell surface cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) receptors. It has been suggested that these receptors coordinate the aggregation of individual cells into a multicellular organism and regulate the expression of a large number of developmentally regulated genes. The complementary DNA (cDNA) for the cyclic AMP receptor has now been cloned from lambda gt-11 libraries by screening with specific antiserum. The 2-kilobase messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the receptor is undetectable in growing cells, rises to a maximum at 3 to 4 hours of development, and then declines. In vitro transcribed complementary RNA, when hybridized to cellular mRNA, specifically arrests in vitro translation of the receptor polypeptide. When the cDNA is expressed in Dictyostelium cells, the undifferentiated cells specifically bind cyclic AMP. Cell lines transformed with a vector that expresses complementary mRNA (antisense) do not express the cyclic AMP receptor protein. These cells fail to enter the aggregation stage of development during starvation, whereas control and wild-type cells aggregate and complete the developmental program within 24 hours. The phenotype of the antisense transformants suggests that the cyclic AMP receptor is essential for development. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor reveals a high percentage of hydrophobic residues grouped in seven domains, similar to the rhodopsins and other receptors believed to interact with G proteins. It shares amino acid sequence identity and is immunologically cross-reactive with bovine rhodopsin. A model is proposed in which the cyclic AMP receptor crosses the bilayer seven times with a serine-rich cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, the proposed site of ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2049488119,"Yeast histone H4 function was probed in vivo by deleting segments of this extremely conserved 102 amino acid protein. Deletions in the hydrophobic core of H4 are lethal and block chromosomal segregation. In contrast, deletions at the hydrophilic N terminus (residues 4-28) and C terminus (residues 100-102) are viable. However, N-terminal deletion alters normal chromatin structure and lengthens the cell cycle, especially G2. Surprisingly, removal of the H4 N terminus also derepresses the silent mating type loci, HML alpha and HMRa, disrupting mating. This activation is specific since other regulated genes (GAL10, PHO5, CUP1) are repressed and induced normally in these cells. Deletions of the hydrophilic N termini of H2A or H2B do not show this effect on mating. These experiments allow us to define a unique H4 function that is not shared by other histones (H2A and H2B)."
https://openalex.org/W2060061842,"The posttranscriptional regulator (p27x-III) of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is located predominantly in the cell nucleolus. A highly basic aminoterminal sequence (NH2-Met-Pro-Lys-Thr-Arg-Arg-Arg-Pro-Arg-Arg-Ser-Gln-Arg-Lys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro) in this protein, when fused to the amino termini of β-galactosidase and p40x of HTLV-I, acts as an autonomous signal capable of directing the hybrid proteins to the cell nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W1988282349,"In the proposed ""zinc finger"" DNA-binding motif, each repeat unit binds a zinc metal ion through invariant Cys and His residues and this drives the folding of each 30-residue unit into an independent nucleic acid-binding domain. To obtain structural information, we synthesized single and double zinc finger peptides from the yeast transcription activator ADR1, and assessed the metal-binding and DNA-binding properties of these peptides, as well as the solution structure of the metal-stabilized domains, with the use of a variety of spectroscopic techniques. A single zinc finger can exist as an independent structure sufficient for zinc-dependent DNA binding. An experimentally determined model of the single finger is proposed that is consistent with circular dichroism, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, and visual spectroscopy of the single-finger peptide reconstituted in the presence of zinc."
https://openalex.org/W1510611530,"Based upon a consideration of two mutational hot spots produced during DNA synthesis by a eukaryotic DNA repair polymerase, we suggested that certain base substitution errors result not from direct miscoding but from correct coding by a transiently misaligned template-primer (Kunkel, T. A., and Alexander, P. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 160-166). This model, which we called dislocation mutagenesis, has been directly tested. Introducing a single, phenotypically silent G—-A base change into the template switches the base substitution specificity at the immediately adjacent hot spot, a T residue, from T—-G transversions to T—-A transversions. The cumulative change in frequency, represented by the disappearance of the T—-G events and the appearance of the T—-A events, is greater than 300-fold. These data demonstrate that during DNA synthesis in vitro, a base at one position can code a mutation at another position. This mechanism can operate over greater distances to produce complex mutations as well. We present one example in which a 123-base deletion containing three base changes at one end of the deletion can be precisely explained by transient misalignment. It remains to be established whether mutagenesis by dislocation operates in vivo to produce biologically significant changes in genetic information."
https://openalex.org/W1577603732,"We have examined the effects of a variety of chemical modifications to recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) on its pharmacokinetic behavior in rats. Unmodified rIL-2 is cleared from plasma with half-lives of 3 and 44 min for the alpha and beta phases. Modification of rIL-2 with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol or polyoxyethylated glycerol increased the half-lives as much as 20-fold, although the volume of distribution remained unchanged at 88 +/- 13 ml/kg. The clearance rates correlated with the effective molecular size of the modified protein determined by size exclusion chromatography. Clearance decreased rapidly as the effective molecular size increased from 19.5 to 70 kDa, whereas above 70 kDa the clearance decreased more slowly. This abrupt change at 70 kDa may be related to the permeability threshold of the kidney glomerular membrane which retains proteins larger than albumin in the plasma. Using the relationship between clearance and effective molecular size, the clearance rates of mixtures of modified rIL-2 could be predicted based on their average effective molecular size. Since the effectiveness of rIL-2 therapy is likely to be related to its pharmacokinetic behavior, the ability to design a molecule with a predictable time course in plasma provides a means to study this relationship."

https://openalex.org/W2149665324,"Three antipeptide antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthesized short peptides corresponding to residues 215-226, 466-479, and 478-492 predicted from the cDNA of both the human hepatoma HepG2 and rat brain glucose transporters. All three antibodies were found to precipitate quantitatively the [3H]cytochalasin B photoaffinity-labeled human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Each antibody also recognized the rat brain protein of Mr 45,000 on immunoblots, and a similar molecular weight protein was labeled with [3H]cytochalasin B in a D-glucose-inhibitable manner, suggesting that this protein is glucose transporter. However, only up to 30% of the labeled rat brain glucose transporters were precipitated, even by repeated rounds of immunoprecipitation. In addition, these antibodies were observed to be unable to immunoprecipitate significantly the [3H]cytochalasin B-labeled rat adipocyte glucose transporter. Further, one-dimensional peptide maps of [3H]cytochalasin B-labeled human erythrocyte and adipocyte glucose transporters generated distinct tryptic fragments. Although Mr 45,000 protein in rat adipocyte low density microsomes was detected on immunoblots and its amount was decreased in insulin-treated cells, the rat adipocyte low density microsomes were much less reactive on immunoblots than the rat brain membranes in spite of the fact that the rat adipocyte low density microsomes contained more [3H]cytochalasin B-labeled glucose transporters. In addition, the ratio of cytochalasin B-labeled glucose transporter per unit HepG2-type glucose transporter mRNA was more than 10-fold higher in rat adipocyte than in rat brain. These results indicate that virtually all the human erythrocyte glucose transporters are of the HepG2 type, whereas this type of glucose transporter constitutes only approximately 30 and 3% of all the glucose transporters present in rat brain and rat adipocyte, respectively; and the rest, of similar molecular weight, is expressed by a different gene."
https://openalex.org/W1549134654,"Cysteines are substituted at six positions in the aspartate receptor, and these mutant proteins are used to investigate three major facets of receptor structure. 1) The surface of the receptor is examined through measurement of the rate constants for chemical modification of the cysteines by aqueous reagents. Different positions exhibit a range of accessibility (for example, Cys-128 most exposed, Cys-36 most buried). 2) The transmembrane structure of the receptor is determined by reaction of the cysteines with a membrane-impermeant reagent. 3) The spatial proximities in the folded structure of specific pairs of cysteines are investigated by disulfide bond formation. These studies illustrate the usefulness of site-directed sulfhydryl chemistry in the analysis of protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1527983973,"Proline porter II is rapidly activated when nongrowing bacteria are subjected to a hyperosmotic shift (Grothe, S., Krogsrud, R. L., McClellan, D. J., Milner, J. L., and Wood, J. M. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 166, 253-259). Proline porter II was active in membrane vesicles prepared from bacteria grown under optimal conditions, nutritional stress, or osmotic stress. That activity was: (i) dependent on the presence of the energy sources phenazine methosulphate plus ascorbate or D-lactate; (ii) observed only when a hyperosmotic shift accompanied the transport measurement; (iii) inhibited by glycine betaine in a manner analogous to that observed in whole cells; and (iv) eliminated by lesions in proP. Membrane vesicles were able to transport serine but not glutamine and serine transport was reduced by the hyperosmotic shift. In whole cells, proline porter II activity was supported by glucose and by D-lactate in a strain defective for proline porters I and III and the F1F0-ATPase. Glucose energized proline uptake was eliminated by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and KCN as was serine uptake. These results suggested that proline porter II was respiration-dependent and probably ion-linked. Activation of proline porter II in whole cells by sucrose or NaCl was sustained over 30 min, whereas activation by glycerol was transient. Proline porter II was activated by NaCl and sucrose with a half-time of approximately 1 min in both whole cells and membrane vesicles. Thus, activation of proline porter II was reversible. It occurred at a rate comparable to that of K+ influx and much more rapid than the genetic regulatory responses that follow a hyperosmotic shift."
https://openalex.org/W1502797485,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between putative chloroplast RNA polymerase subunit genes and known chloroplast transcriptional activities. We have prepared fusion polypeptide genes from fragments of chloroplast DNA homologous to bacterial RNA polymerase subunit genes and expression vectors carrying portions of the anthranilate synthetase gene (trpE). Fusion proteins for chloroplast homologs of the RNA polymerase alpha (rpoA), beta (rpoB), and beta' (rpoC) subunits were obtained from these genes. The fusion polypeptides synthesized by Escherichia coli in vivo were purified and used as antigens for production of rabbit polyclonal anti-RNA polymerase subunit-specific antibodies. The purified antibodies were able to immobilize chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from spinach, pea, and Euglena gracilis. In addition, the soluble chloroplast RNA polymerase activity in tRNA and mRNA synthesis was strongly inhibited by these antibodies under conditions which had little effect on transcription by the chloroplast transcriptionally active chromosome that preferentially transcribed rRNA genes (Greenberg, B. M., Narita, J. O., DeLuca-Flaherty, C., Gruissem, W., Rushlow, K. A., and Hallick, R. B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259: 14880-14887). From these data we conclude that the chloroplast genes homologous to bacterial RNA polymerase subunit genes are expressed in vivo and that the protein products specify at least three of the components of the chloroplast RNA polymerase(s) involved in tRNA and mRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1521150511,"Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi were killed by two novel lytic peptides (SB-37 and Shiva-1) in vitro. Human erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum, and Vero cells infected with T. cruzi, were exposed to these peptides. The result, in both cases, was a significant decrease in the level of parasite infection. Furthermore, the peptides had a marked cytocidal effect on trypomastigote stages of T. cruzi in media, whereas host eukaryotic cells were unaffected by the treatments. In view of the worldwide prevalence of these protozoan diseases and the lack of completely suitable treatments, lytic peptides may provide new and unique chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of these infections."
https://openalex.org/W1521751079,"In order to determine if the cognate transit peptide of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) is essential for LHCP import into the chloroplast and proper localization to the thylakoids, it was replaced with the transit peptide of the small subunit (S) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, a stromal protein. Wheat LHCP and S genes were fused to make a chimeric gene coding for the hybrid precursor, which was synthesized in vitro and incubated with purified pea chloroplasts. My results show that LHCP is translocated into chloroplasts by the S transit peptide. The hybrid precursor was processed; and most importantly, mature LHCP did not remain in the stroma, but was inserted into thylakoid membranes, where it normally functions. Density gradient centrifugation showed no LHCP in the envelope fraction. Hence, the transit peptide of LHCP is not required for intraorganellar routing, and LHCP itself contains an internal signal for localization to the correct membrane compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1596987991,"We have proposed (Randall, L. L., and Hardy, S. J. S. (1986) Cell 46, 921-928) that during export of protein from Escherichia coli, there is a kinetic partitioning between the pathway that leads to productive translocation and the pathway that leads to folding of precursors into a stable conformation that is incompatible with export. This model predicts that a decrease in rate along the productive pathway resulting from a defect in the leader sequence could be partially overcome by slowing the folding of the precursor and thereby increasing the time during which that polypeptide would be competent to enter the export pathway. Here it is shown that a change in the mature portion of maltose-binding protein that is known to suppress a mutation in the leader sequence (Cover, W. H., Ryan, J. P., Bassford, P. J., Jr., Walsh, K. A., Bollinger, J., and Randall, L. L. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 1794-1800) also decreases the rate of folding of the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2035100616,"Yeast U2 snRNA (1175 nucleotides) is six times larger than its mammalian counterpart (188 nucleotides). Using deletion analysis, we show that the molecule can be divided into three phenotypically distinct domains. As expected, the highly conserved 5' domain (approximately 120 nucleotides) is absolutely essential for viability. Surprisingly, however, deletion of the central 945 nucleotides has no effect on growth rate. In contrast, removal of sequences in the 3' terminal 110 nucleotides results in low numbers of slow-growing colonies; these cells contain U2 with altered 3' ends. This domain can be folded into a secondary structure that strongly resembles the 3' terminal stem-loop IV of human U2. We conclude that yeast U2 contains two functionally important elements. While the 5' domain is known to be directly involved in the splicing reaction, the 3' domain may function primarily in the generation of stable small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles."
https://openalex.org/W1584526531,"A soluble form of the specific alpha-mannosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which catalyzes the following reaction, was purified at least 100,000-fold by conventional chromatography procedures: (Formula: see text). The purified enzyme migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band of about 60 kDa in the absence of reducing agent, and as two bands of about 44.5 kDa and 22.5 kDa in the presence of reducing agent. The apparent molecular weight of the soluble enzyme is about 75,000 by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The specific alpha-mannosidase does not require the addition of divalent cation for activity, but it is inhibited by Tris, EDTA, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+. The inhibition caused by EDTA can be reversed completely by Ca2+ and partially by Mg2+, but not by other divalent cations. The soluble alpha-mannosidase arises from a larger hydrophobic form of the enzyme which is found in the detergent phase during partition in Triton X-114. The formation of the soluble enzyme, which is recovered in the aqueous phase during partition in Triton X-114, is time- and temperature-dependent and is prevented by pepstatin, but not by other protease inhibitors. These results indicate that the purified soluble alpha-mannosidase represents the catalytically active domain of the enzyme which has been proteolytically released from its membrane-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W1589567223,"Whereas it is widely accepted that the transit peptide of the precursor for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (preLHCP) is responsible for targeting this polypeptide to chloroplasts, the signals which govern its intraorganellar targeting appears to be transit peptide-mediated for plastocyanin (Smeekins, S., Bauerle, C., Hageman, J., Keegstra, K., and Weisbeek, P. (1986) Cell 46, 365-375) and several other nuclear-encoded, thylakoid luminal proteins. To determine whether a similar mechanism operates for LHCP (an integral thylakoid protein), we have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to delete the proposed transit sequence from a petunia precursor of this polypeptide. Intact preLHCP and the deletion mutant product have been expressed in vitro, and their abilities to integrate into purified thylakoids have been compared. We have found that both polypeptides insert into thylakoids correctly, provided the latter are supplemented with a membrane-free stromal extract and Mg.ATP. Our results clearly demonstrate that whereas the transit peptide is required for transport into chloroplasts, thylakoid integration of preLHCP is determined by mature portions of the polypeptide. In addition, we note that transit peptide removal has little effect on the apparent solubility of the in vitro translation products."

https://openalex.org/W1501632503,"The stomach is stimulated by an enterooxyntin factor in a delayed response to feeding, resulting in an increase in both gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion. We have previously reported on the identity of such a factor from the porcine ileum (Wider, M. D., Vinik, A. I., and Heldsinger, A. (1984) Endocrinology 115, 1484-1491). This protein, termed gastrotropin, is localized to the distal region of the ileum where it constitutes less than 0.1% of the cytosolic protein. We have completed the primary structure of porcine gastrotropin by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Gastrotropin (Mr = 14,054) contains 127 amino acid residues and has a blocked (acetylated) alanine at its NH2 terminus. The sequence of porcine gastrotropin is similar to rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), with 44 of 127 residues being identical (35%). Homology with other members of the FABP family is significantly less apparent, with the order of similarity being liver FABP greater than heart FABP greater than retinol-binding protein greater than intestine FABP. The sequences of the NH2-terminal regions of these proteins account for virtually all of the homology; there are 9 conserved residues common to all five proteins. Gastrotropin represents the first member of the FABP family which has an extracellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1574817088,"Membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) consist of branched substituted beta-glucan chains and are present in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. A procedure for the isolation of mutants defective in MDO synthesis is described. Their phenotype was compared with a mdoA mutant previously identified, and they are mapped in the mdoA region. Mutants lacking MDO showed imparied chemotaxis on tryptone swarm plates, a reduced number of flagella, and an enhanced expression of the OmpC porin. Revertants able to form swarm rings again had regained the ability to synthesize MDO and showed the wild-type porin pattern. A second group of chemotactic revertants were mutated in the ompB gene region involved in osmoregulation, and they were still devoid of MDO. These findings provide evidence for a link between MDO biosynthesis and other functions of E. coli related to its adaptation to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1544239338,"Abstract Lipid A disaccharide synthase of Escherichia coli catalyzes the reaction 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P + UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN----2',3'-diacyl-GlcN (beta,1'----6)2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P + UDP (Ray, B. L., Painter, G., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4852-4859). Using a strain that overproduces the enzyme about 200-fold we have devised a simple purification to near homogeneity, utilizing two types of dye-ligand resins and heparin-agarose. The overall purification starting with membrane-free extracts was 54-fold (16,000-fold relative to wild-type extracts) with a 31% yield. The subunit molecular mass determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis is approximately 42,000 daltons, and the native enzyme appears to be a dimer. The amino-terminal sequence is (X)-(Thr)-Glu-Gln-(X)-Pro-Leu-Thr-Ie-Ala..., consistent with the results predicted from the DNA sequence, Met-Thr-Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Leu-Thr-Ile-Ala.... The purified enzyme displays a strong kinetic preference for sugar substrates bearing two fatty acyl moieties, but it is, nevertheless, very useful for the semisynthetic preparation of many lipid A analogs. Gel filtration studies demonstrate that the natural substrates (2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P and UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN) form micelles (n approximately equal to 300), rather than bilayers, under conditions used to assay the enzyme. Unlike most enzymes of glycerophospholipid synthesis, the lipid A disaccharide synthase does not require the presence of a detergent for catalytic activity. At 1 mM UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN the Vmax and Km values for 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P are 14,028 +/- 513 nmol/min/mg and 0.27 +/- 0.02 mM. When 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P is maintained at 1 mM, they are 12,368 +/- 472 nmol/min/mg and 0.11 +/- 0.01 mM for UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN."
https://openalex.org/W1551984692,"Abstract Escherichia coli can overcome the toxicity of environmental cyanate by hydrolysis of cyanate to ammonia and bicarbonate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme cyanase, encoded by the cynS gene. The nucleotide sequence of cynS has been reported (Sung, Y.-c., Anderson, P. M., and Fuchs, J. A. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 5224-5230). The nucleotide sequence of the complete cyn operon has now been determined. The cyn operon is approximately 2600 base pairs and includes cynT, cynS, and cynX, which encode cyanate permease, cyanase, and a protein of unknown function, respectively. Two cyanate-inducible transcripts of 1500 and 2500 nucleotides, respectively, were detected by Northern blot analysis. S1 nuclease mapping experiments indicated that two different cyn mRNAs have a common 5'-end and two different 3'-ends. One 3'-end was located within the coding region of cynX, whereas the other 3'-end includes the entire DNA sequence of cynX. The longer transcript contained 98 nucleotides complementary to lac mRNA produced by the predominant lac transcription termination sequence. Termination vectors were used to show that both 3'-ends were generated by sequences that caused transcriptional termination in vivo. Expression vectors were used to demonstrate that a protein corresponding to the expected size was synthesized from the DNA fragment containing the open reading frame designated cynX. The predicted amino acid sequence of cynX indicates that it is a very hydrophobic protein. The level of cynX expression was significantly less than that of cynT or cynS expression."
https://openalex.org/W1497339736,"The design and characterization of a six-amino acid-containing peptide that binds insulin is described. The amino acid sequence of the insulin-binding peptide (IBP) was determined from the strand of DNA complementary to the strand of DNA coding for the insulin molecule in the domain of the insulin monomer believed to interact with the insulin receptor. The IBP (Cys-Val-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ser) binds specifically to insulin in a saturable manner with a Kd of 3 nM. This process is time dependent and slightly temperature dependent, and the peptide appears to interact with insulin near the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain of insulin. Incubation of insulin with the peptide decreases insulin to the insulin receptor by 50%, with no effect on the affinity of insulin for the receptor and no effect on cellular insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake. A polyclonal antibody produced against the IBP will inhibit specific insulin to intact cells by approximately 50%, with no effects on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. From this data, we suggest that there are at least two domains of the insulin molecule through which it interacts with its receptor, the binding region of insulin, which is the domain blocked by the IBP, and the message region of insulin, through which insulin not only binds to the receptor, but also generates the cellular signal."
https://openalex.org/W2098638197,"The expression level of an ice nucleation gene (inaZ) was varied in Escherichia coli to observe the relationship between activity and gene product. The ice nucleation activity increased as the 2nd to 3rd power of the membrane concentration of the inaZ gene product, implying that molecules of InaZ protein interact cooperatively in groups of two to three at the rate-limiting step of ice nucleus assembly. The 2nd to 3rd power relationship was independent of the threshold temperature at which ice nucleation was measured and was consistent over a 500-fold range of protein concentration. Such a relationship indicates that the same rate-limiting step must be common to the formation of ice nuclei displaying all the various threshold temperatures within a bacterial population. Observations of Pseudomonas syringae, expressing the inaZ gene at various levels, were consistent with a similar relationship and hence a similar mechanism of ice nucleus assembly in Pseudomonas."
https://openalex.org/W1480069256,"The organization of the lux structural genes (A-E) in Photobacterium phosphoreum has been determined and a new gene designated as luxF discovered. The P. phosphoreum luminescence system was cloned into Escherichia coli using a pBR322 vector and identified by cross-hybridization with Vibrio fischeri lux DNA. The lux genes were located by specific expression of P. phosphoreum DNA fragments in the T7-phage polymerase/promoter system in E. coli and identification of the labeled polypeptide products. The luxA and luxB gene products (luciferase subunits) were shown to catalyze light emission in the presence of FMNH2, O2, and aldehyde. The luxC, luxD, and luxE gene products (fatty acid reductase subunits) responsible for aldehyde biosynthesis could be specifically acylated with 3H-labeled fatty acids. The order of the lux genes in P. phosphoreum was found to be luxCDABFE with luxF coding for a new polypeptide of 26 kDa. The presence of a new gene in the P. phosphoreum luminescence system between luxB and luxE as compared to the organization of the lux structural gene in V. fischeri and Vibrio harveyi (luxCDABE) demonstrates that the luminescent systems in the marine bacteria have significantly diverged. The discovery of the luxF gene provides the basis for elucidating the role of its gene product in the expression of luminescence in different marine bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W221422854,"Site-specific mutagenesis in combination with low temperature UV/visible difference spectroscopy has been used to investigate the role of individual amino acids in the structure and function of bacteriorhodopsin (bR). We examined the effects of eight single amino acid substitutions, all in the putative F helix, on the absorption of bR as well as formation of the K and M intermediates. Both the absorbance spectra and the photocycle difference spectra of Escherichia coli expressed bR as well as the mutants S183A, P186G, and E194Q all closely resembled the corresponding purple membrane spectra. In contrast the Pro-186—-Leu substitution resulted in the loss of the normal photocycle and a large blue shift in the bR state lambda max. Thus, Pro-186 appears to play a critical role in maintaining the normal protein-chromophore interactions, although the pyrrolidine ring is not essential since proline could be replaced by glycine at this position. The mutants W182F, W189F, and S193A did not appear to be directly involved in the bathochromic shift of bR since they all had lambda max's close to that of purple membrane and produced intermediates similar to K and M. However, alterations in the UV and visible difference spectra as well as the appearance of some irreversibility in the photoreactions indicate that these mutants have altered protein-chromophore interactions during the photocycle. Unlike the other mutants examined, Y185F exhibited a red-shifted form of bR and K raising the possibility that Tyr-185 is directly involved in color regulation. In addition, UV difference peaks previously associated with a tyrosine deprotonation were absent in Y185F indicating that Tyr-185 undergoes protonation changes during the photocycle in agreement with recent Fourier transform infrared difference measurements (Braiman, M.S., Mogi, T., Stern, L. J., Hackett, N., Chao, B. H., Khorana, H.G., and Rothschild, K. J. (1988) Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 3, 219-229). Our results suggest that Trp-182, Tyr-185, Pro-186, Trp-189, and Ser-193, all of which are within a 100 degrees segment of the F helix, are part of a retinal-binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1534033808,"We have used an in vitro transcription-translation system to study initial protein processing events of the rat substance P/neurokinin A gene products. cDNA clones for three different mRNA species, which are derived by differential RNA splicing, were subcloned into a plasmid, pGEM1, which contains the promoter for the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase. In vitro synthesized mRNAs for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-preprotachykinin were translated in a wheat germ or rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the translated protein products migrate consistent with the deduced molecular masses of alpha (13,035 Da)-, beta (15,003 Da)-, and gamma (13,343 Da)-preprotachykinin. The addition of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes to either cell-free translation system causes the production of a protease-resistant form of each of the three preprotachykinins which migrates with an apparent increase in molecular mass of approximately 2,000 Da. Each of these modified preprotachykinins lacks the putative signal peptide of the prepro- form, with signal peptidase cleavage occurring after the alanine residue at position 19. Both the prepro- and proforms of each tachykinin precursor molecule are recognized by antiserum R-140, an antiserum specific for the mid-portion of the undecapeptide substance P. The most likely explanation for the apparent increase in molecular mass is anomalous electrophoretic migration, since beta-preprotachykinin mRNA lacking the signal peptide encoding sequence is translated, in the absence of microsomal membranes, into a protein with the same apparent molecular mass as the modified form of beta-preprotachykinin. Therefore, each of the three preprotachykinin mRNAs are translatable, and their products are targeted to the secretory pathway by the presence of a cleavable signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1487852502,"The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor binds to the upstream promoters of both the chicken ovalbumin and the rat insulin II genes, even though the two binding sites have no obvious sequence similarity (Hwung, Y.-P., Crowe, D. T., Wang, L.-H., Tsai, S. Y., and Tsai, M.-J. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 2070-2077). Comparison of the contact points and important nucleotides in the two binding sites suggests that the COUP transcription factor binds to them in different ways. The purine contacts in the two promoters are limited to one face of the DNA helix; however, studies on phosphate contacts suggest that the COUP transcription factor wraps around the ovalbumin promoter, while it binds to only one face of the DNA helix in the insulin promoter. In addition, the binding factor makes a more extended contact on the insulin promoter as compared to the ovalbumin promoter. The potential significance of this novel finding is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565762460,"Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor and transported into the chloroplast where the amino-terminal portion, the transit peptide, is removed proteolytically. To obtain chloroplast delivery of the 43-kDa 5-enolpyruvyl 3-phosphoshikimate (EPSP) synthase of Salmonella typhimurium, we constructed fusion proteins between the bacterial EPSP synthase and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit. A fusion protein consisting of the transit peptide fused to the EPSP synthase was not transported in vitro or in vivo into chloroplasts. A second fusion protein consisting of the transit peptide and 24 amino acids of the mature small subunit fused to the EPSP synthase was transported both in vitro and in vivo into chloroplasts. It was processed into two polypeptides of 46 and 47 kDa, respectively. This heterogeneity in processing was not caused by the presence of the aroA start codon, since its removal resulted in the same pattern. Substituting 24 different amino acids for the 24 amino acids of the mature small subunit resulted in a fusion protein that was not transported into the chloroplast. It was concluded that a portion of the mature small subunit was needed for efficient chloroplast delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1525850727,"Photosystem I-deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants M18 and F27 lack mature mRNA for the psaA1 gene of photosystem I but accumulate unspliced and partially spliced psaA1 transcripts. Analysis of these transcripts indicate that 1) exon 1 of psaA1 is transcribed separately from exon 2, 2) exon 2 is cotranscribed with the psbD gene, and 3) at least two nuclear gene products are required for exon 1-exon 2 trans-splicing. In addition, analysis of chloroplast transcription in permeabilized cells shows that exon 3 is near the 5' end of a separate transcription unit, indicating that exon 2-exon 3 ligation also occurs by a trans-splicing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1565819194,"The rplJL-rpoBC operon of Escherichia coli is regulated in part at the level of translation by an autogenous mechanism (feedback regulation) that involves ribosomal protein L10-L7/L12. Feedback regulation occurs as the result of L10-L7/L12 binding to a site on the untranslated leader region of the rplJ mRNA that is located more than 100 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. Previous studies have indicated that the secondary structure of the rplJ leader region is important for efficient translation and feedback regulation. We have done chemical modification experiments to examine the secondary structure of approximately 200 nucleotides of the rplJ leader region, and we propose a secondary structure that is consistent with the experimental data. RNA structure was probed in vitro by treating samples of total cellular RNA with diethyl pyrocarbonate and in vivo by treating log-phase cultures with dimethyl sulfate. Modified bases were detected by primer extension using three different oligonucleotide primers. The proposed structure includes five double-stranded regions designated I to V, separated by single-stranded segments numbered 1 to 5. We have also identified specific nucleotides in the rplJ mRNA leader that are protected by purified L10-L7/L12 from methylation by dimethyl sulfate in vitro. The protected bases are located within a bulge-loop of region IV, a portion of the mRNA that has been shown genetically to be necessary for feedback regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1575909156,"A protein from mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that catalyzes homologous pairing and strand exchange was analyzed for the ability to catalyze other related reactions. The protein was capable of renaturing complementary single-stranded DNA as evidenced by S1 nuclease assays and analysis of the reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Incubation of the yeast protein with complementary single-stranded DNA resulted in the rapid formation of large aggregates which did not enter agarose gels. These aggregates contained many branched structures consisting of both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. These reactions required stoichiometric amounts of protein but showed no ATP requirement. The protein formed stable complexes with both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, showing a higher affinity for single-stranded DNA. The binding to single-stranded DNA resulted in the formation of large protein:DNA aggregates. These aggregates were also formed in strand-exchange reactions and contained both substrate and product DNAs. These results demonstrate that the S. cerevisiae strand-exchange protein shares additional properties with the Escherichia coli recA protein which, by analogy, gives further indication that it might be implicated in homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1605105053,"Messenger RNA orients on the small ribosomal subunit by base pairing with a complementary sequence in ribosomal RNA. We have positioned this ribosomal RNA segment and thus oriented the mRNA using a new technique–localization of an antibody-recognizable modified complementary oligodeoxynucleotide by electron microscopy. A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the message-positioning ribosomal RNA sequence was modified at either or both ends with different antigenic markers. Electron microscopy of subunit-oligodeoxynucleotide-antibody complexes allowed separate placement of each terminal marker of the oligodeoxynucleotide probe. The 5′-end of the complementary sequence contacts the subunit at the platform tip (rRNA nucleotide 1542). The message then extends along the interior side of the platform to the level of the fork of the cleft separating the platform from the subunit body, and displaced slightly to the convex side of the platform (rRNA nucleotide 1531). Based on our results and data from other laboratories, we propose a model for the positioning of messenger RNA on the 30 S subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1606008831,"In order to better understand the role of the -35 sequence motif in transcription initiation by Escherichia coli sigma 70 RNA polymerase holoenzyme, -35 promoter elements of limited nucleotide composition have been selected from random DNA sequences. Functional promoter elements have been identified that are composed of just two nucleotide species (A,T; G,C; T,C; and T,G) and one nucleotide species (poly(dT)). From this study of 81 promoter mutations, two conclusions can be made. First, given a population of random DNA sequences, there exist sequences that form stronger -35 promoter elements than the consensus sequence. These sequences lack some features of the consensus sequence and reveal unexpected homology in the ordinarily nonconserved spacer sequence. Second, the sequence requirements at the -35 site may suggest a possible role for DNA secondary structure in the recognition of promoters by RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1567128643,"GH3 cells are a rat pituitary-derived cell line in which the expression of the growth hormone and prolactin genes is controlled by a variety of hormones including thyroid hormone. Since these cells contain insulin receptors, we explored whether these cells can be used to analyze the mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression by insulin. When GH3 cells were incubated with serum-free media, insulin stimulated prolactin production rates about 3-fold after 72 h and 10-fold after 96 h of incubation. Insulin stimulated prolactin mRNA levels and gene transcription rates to the same extent as the prolactin production rates. In contrast, insulin did not stimulate the rate of growth hormone production or growth hormone mRNA levels. As previously reported, thyroid hormone stimulated growth hormone production and mRNA levels. In these cells, thyroid hormone also stimulated prolactin synthesis and prolactin mRNA levels. Prolactin production and mRNA levels in cells incubated with both insulin and thyroid hormone showed a synergistic response which was about 5- to 10-fold greater than with either hormone alone. In contrast, growth hormone production rates in cells cultured with insulin and thyroid hormone was only slightly greater than cells incubated with only thyroid hormone. Half-maximal stimulation of prolactin production in cells incubated with insulin or with both insulin and thyroid hormone occurred between 2 and 5 nM insulin, suggesting that the response is mediated by the insulin receptor. These results indicate that GH3 cells should be useful in analyzing the mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1598431212,"Rat 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase, an enzyme of the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle, is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Unlike most mitochondrial matrix proteins, the thiolase is synthesized with no transient presequence and possesses information for mitochondrial targeting and import in the mature protein of 397 amino acid residues. cDNA sequences encoding various portions of the thiolase were fused in frame to the cDNA encoding the mature portion of rat ornithine transcarbamylase (lacking its own presequence). The fusion genes were transfected into COS cells, and subcellular localization of the fusion proteins was analyzed by cell fractionation with digitonin. When the mature portion of ornithine transcarbamylase was expressed, it was recovered in the soluble fraction. On the other hand, the fusion proteins containing the NH2-terminal 392, 161, or 61 amino acid residues of the thiolase were recovered in the particulate fraction, whereas the fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal 331 residues (residues 62-392) was recovered in the soluble fraction. Enzyme immunocytochemical and immunoelectron microscopic analyses using an anti-ornithine transcarbamylase antibody showed mitochondrial localization of the fusion proteins containing the NH2-terminal portions of the thiolase. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal 61 amino acids of rat 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase function as a noncleavable signal for mitochondrial targeting and import of this enzyme protein. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the ornithine transcarbamylase precursor and the thiolase traveled from the cytosol to the mitochondria with half-lives of less than 5 min, whereas the three fusion proteins traveled with half-lives of 10-15 min. Interestingly, in the cells expressing the fusion proteins, the mitochondria showed abnormal shapes and were filled with immunogold-positive crystalloid structures."
https://openalex.org/W2160529079,We have studied a very unusual strong polar mutant in the intercistronic barrier between the second (hisD) and third (hisC) cistrons of the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium to obtain further insights into the molecular mechanisms leading to transcription termination within cistrons. We have performed a detailed transcriptional analysis in vivo and have found that the his mRNA in this polar mutant is reduced in size as a result of premature termination of transcription at a cryptic Rho-dependent site within the proximal region of the hisC cistron.
https://openalex.org/W1503796494,"Induction of translatable mRNA for serine dehydratase (SDH) in primary cultured rat hepatocytes requires both dexamethasone and glucagon or cAMP (Noda, C., Tomomura, M., Nakamura, T., and Ichihara, A. (1986) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 95, 37-45). This unique hormone requirement was studied further with a cDNA probe complementary to SDH mRNA in primary cultured hepatocytes of adult rats. Dot-blot hybridization analysis of RNA showed that SDH mRNA was induced by dexamethasone and glucagon together, but not by either alone. Insulin or epinephrine caused 40% inhibition of this induction of SDH mRNA. Cycloheximide prevented the induction of SDH mRNA by dexamethasone and glucagon, suggesting that ongoing protein synthesis is required for the induction by glucocorticoids and glucagon. In vitro transcription experiments using nuclei isolated from cultured hepatocytes showed that transcription of the SDH gene was not affected by either dexamethasone or glucagon alone, but markedly enhanced by both hormones together, and that this enhancement was inhibited by insulin or epinephrine. These results indicate that the inhibition of SDH induction by epinephrine or insulin was due to effects of these hormones on the transcriptional rate of the SDH gene."
https://openalex.org/W1587551937,"The leader peptide stop codon (UGA) of the Escherichia coli trp operon was replaced by UAA and UAG. The transcriptional behavior of the mutated leader regions in vitro and the extent of transcription termination observed with each in vivo were virtually identical to that of the wild type leader region. Introduction of a release factor 1 (UAA- and UAG-specific) mutation into strains with the different stop codons caused increased termination in strains with UAA and UAG, but not with UGA (in cells grown in the presence of tryptophan). This finding provides evidence for the view that ribosome release from the leader peptide stop codon is an important event in setting the basal level of transcription readthrough at the trp attenuator."
https://openalex.org/W1592141385,"An expression plasmid containing a hybrid gene encoding a protein having the primary amino acid sequence of the adenylate cyclase from Escherichia coli was constructed. When the gene was induced, the adenylate cyclase could be expressed at high levels in a cya- strain of E. coli. The majority of the enzymatic activity and protein (having a molecular weight of 95,000) induced was insoluble. However, treatment of the insoluble fraction of cell lysates with trypsin resulted in both an increase in and solubilization of the total amount of adenylate cyclase activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the soluble protein produced by treatment with trypsin revealed a polypeptide having a molecular weight of 30,000. This soluble, catalytically active fragment of adenylate cyclase was purified and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analyses; two amino-terminal sequences were identified beginning at residue 82 and at residue 342 of the intact enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified fragment followed by either silver or Coomassie Blue staining revealed the presence of only a single polypeptide having a molecular weight of 30,000; a short oligopeptide associated with the amino terminus at residue 342 could not be detected. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to place a stop codon at residue 341; the truncated enzyme was catalytically active, so the short oligopeptide is not necessary for catalysis. The Km for ATP, the Ka for Mg2+, and the Vmax determined for the product containing the 30,000-dalton fragment were similar to the values reported for the intact enzyme from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1517912045,"Overexpression of the Escherichia coli sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase, an integral membrane protein, causes formation of ordered arrays of the enzyme in vitro. The formation of these tubular structures did not occur in an E. coli strain bearing a mutation in the htpR gene, the regulatory gene for the heat shock response. The htpR165 mutation was shown by genetic analysis to be the lesion responsible for blockage of tubule formation. Similar amounts of glycerol-P acyltransferase were produced in isogenic htpR+ and htpR165 strains, ruling out an effect of htpR165 on expression of glycerol-P acyltransferase. Further, phospholipid metabolism was not altered in either strain after induction of glycerol-P acyltransferase synthesis. Increased glycerol-P acyltransferase synthesis caused a partial induction of the heat shock response which was dependent upon a wild type htpR gene. The heat shock proteins induced were identified as the groEL and dnaK gene products on two-dimensional gels. These two proteins have been implicated in the assembly of bacteriophage coats. These heat shock proteins appear essential for tubule formation."
https://openalex.org/W1575839608,"Abstract Two ribonucleases H (RNases H) were purified to apparent homogeneity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzymes were separated from the previously described yeast ribonuclease H (RNase H(70), Karwan, R., Blutsch, H., and Wintersberger, U. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5500-5507) by chromatography on Mono Q and blue-Sepharose columns and from each other on a Mono S column. The two proteins, RNase H(55) of molecular weight around 55,000 and RNase H(42) of molecular weight around 42,000, exhibit distinct enzymatic properties: RNase H(55) acts as a 5'-exonuclease of low specific activity and produces predominantly monoribonucleotides from the synthetic hybrid poly(rA)-poly(dT). RNase H(42) efficiently releases oligoribonucleotides from the same substrate. Polyclonal antibodies against these proteins do not cross-react with RNase H(70), and thus, these two RNases H probably do not represent proteolytic breakdown products of RNase H(70). Peptide maps obtained by total digestion of RNase H(55) and RNase H(42) with trypsin reveal several common peptides and, therefore, suggest that the two enzymes are related to each other. We tentatively conclude that RNase H(55) is proteolytically processed to RNase H(42) in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1536157345,"The synthesis of manganese-superoxide dismutase in response to hydrogen peroxide and to paraquat was examined in strains of Escherichia coli with different mutations in the oxyR gene. Hydrogen peroxide treatment did not induce manganese-superoxide dismutase, but did induce the oxyR regulon. Paraquat induced this enzyme in a strain compromised in its ability to induce the defense response against oxidative stress (oxyR deletion) as well as in a strain that is constitutive and overexpresses the oxyR regulon. Catalase (HPI), but not manganese-superoxide dismutase, was over-expressed under anaerobic conditions in a strain harboring a constitutive oxyR mutation. The data clearly demonstrate that the induction of manganese-superoxide dismutase is independent of the oxyR-controlled regulon."
https://openalex.org/W1507899262,"Frameshift pseudo-revertants of Escherichia coli RTEM beta-lactamase were obtained by a selection procedure, starting from frameshift mutants at the signal-processing site. These pseudo-revertant proteins, which have a totally altered COOH-terminal part of the signal sequence, are attached to the outer face of the inner membrane. The mutant proteins are enzymatically active in vitro and in vivo, and the membrane localization has no deleterious effect on cell growth. We conclude that initiation of transport across the membrane does not require the COOH-terminal part of the signal, but this part of the sequence determines whether the protein is released to the periplasm either with or without cleavage of the signal, or whether the protein remains anchored to the membrane. Mutants with two signals in series were used to show that a truncated signal is not refractory to transport per se. If neither signal contains a functional cleavage site, the protein is at least partially found on the outer face of the inner membrane. If both signals contain functional cleavage sites, both are removed and the protein is released to the periplasm. If only the first signal contains a cleavage site, a longer fusion protein is transported and released. The results presented here show that a pre-beta-lactamase-like protein can fold properly even as a membrane-bound species."
