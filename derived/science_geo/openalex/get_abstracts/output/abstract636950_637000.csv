As the electronic density is tuned by gating, the system goes through several exotic phases, including superconductivity. Now, Sharpe et al. show that, at a particular electronic density, magic-angle graphene becomes magnetic (see the Perspective by Pixley and Andrei). The finding is supported by the observation of a large anomalous Hall effect. Science , this issue p. 605 ; see also p. 543"

Ren et al. now show that design of the surrounding electrochemical cell can substantially boost both features. They directly exposed a known molecular catalyst, cobalt phthalocyanine, to gaseous CO 2 in a flow cell architecture, rather than an aqueous electrolyte. The configuration accommodated current densities exceeding 150 milliamperes per square centimeter, with longevity limited by local proton concentration rather than catalyst stability.

Ghosh et al. used a semiconductor catalyst to activate two reactants at once by quenching both an excited electron and the residual positive hole (see the Perspective by Swift). As such, two different reactive carbon or halide fragments could be appended to separate sites on an aryl ring. The catalyst also tolerated strong nucleophiles such as cyanide and could be recovered easily and reused. Science , this issue p. 360 ; see also p. 320"

This gravitational redshift does not exist in the Newtonian theory of gravity. Do et al. monitored the position and spectrum of the star S0-2 as it passed Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Around the closest part of S0-2's 16-year orbit, they detected the effect of gravitational redshift on its spectrum. These results are more consistent with general relativity than Newtonian gravity at the 5σ level. Science , this issue p. 664"

This feature of Hydra allowed Siebert et al. to identify the transcriptional signatures of stem cells, progenitors, and terminally differentiated cells using single-cell RNA sequencing of adult Hydra (see the Perspective by Reddien). From these data, they built differentiation trajectories for all cell lineages, identified gene modules expressed along these trajectories, and identified putative regulators of genes within these modules. In addition, they identified candidate markers for elusive cell populations (such as multipotent stem cells and germline stem cells) and built a molecular map of the nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W2963132797,"The microbiota influences obesity, yet organisms that protect from disease remain unknown. During studies interrogating host-microbiota interactions, we observed the development of age-associated metabolic syndrome (MetS). Expansion of Desulfovibrio and loss of Clostridia were key features associated with obesity in this model and are present in humans with MetS. T cell-dependent events were required to prevent disease, and replacement of Clostridia rescued obesity. Inappropriate immunoglobulin A targeting of Clostridia and increased Desulfovibrio antagonized the colonization of beneficial Clostridia. Transcriptional and metabolic analysis revealed enhanced lipid absorption in the obese host. Colonization of germ-free mice with Clostridia, but not Desulfovibrio, down-regulated genes that control lipid absorption and reduced adiposity. Thus, immune control of the microbiota maintains beneficial microbial populations that constrain lipid metabolism to prevent MetS."
https://openalex.org/W2963495948,"Studies of patients afflicted by neurodegenerative diseases suggest that misfolded proteins spread through the brain along anatomically connected networks, prompting progressive decline. Recently, mouse models have recapitulated the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic proteins and neuron death observed in patients. However, the factors regulating the spread of pathogenic proteins remain a matter of debate due to an incomplete understanding of how vulnerability functions in the context of spread. Here we use quantitative pathology mapping in the mouse brain, combined with network modeling to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of spread. Patterns of α-synuclein pathology are well described by a network model that is based on two factors: anatomical connectivity and endogenous α-synuclein expression. The map and model allow the assessment of selective vulnerability to α-synuclein pathology development and neuron death. Finally, we use quantitative pathology to understand how the G2019S LRRK2 genetic risk factor affects the spread and toxicity of α-synuclein pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2963313115,"Cryptic alleles make a bridge for adaptation Protein function is generally constrained by selective parameters that can inhibit evolutionary potential. It has thus been difficult to determine how novelties arise. Zheng et al. allowed bacterial populations to accumulate mutations and then used directed evolution to evolve green fluorescent protein function from a gene that expressed yellow fluorescent protein (see the Perspective by Lee and Marx). Protein alternatives could evolve in cases where cryptic alleles—selectively neutral or mildly deleterious genetic variants with no apparent phenotypic differences—were present in the population. Thus, cryptic alleles provide an evolutionary bridge between diversity and selection and facilitate the generation of novel adaptations. Science , this issue p. 347 ; see also p. 318"

To address this issue, we experimentally manipulated how participants represented sequences of finger presses at the levels of individual movements, chunks, and entire sequences. Using representational fMRI analyses, we then examined how this hierarchical structure was reflected in the fine-grained brain activity patterns of the participants while they performed the 8 trained sequences. We found clear evidence of each level of the movement hierarchy at the representational level. However, anatomically, chunk and sequence representations substantially overlapped in the premotor and parietal cortices, whereas individual movements were uniquely represented in the primary motor cortex. The findings challenge the common hypothesis of an orderly anatomical separation of different levels of an action hierarchy and argue for a special status of the distinction between individual movements and sequential context.

The findings challenge the common hypothesis of an orderly anatomical separation of different levels of an action hierarchy and argue for a special status of the distinction between individual movements and sequential context. The ability to learn and to produce complex sequences of movements is essential to many everyday skills, such as speaking or playing an instrument. Recent evidence from human fMRI studies has suggested that a widespread network of brain regions is involved in the learning and production of complex sequences, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd/v), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the precuneus, areas along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), basal ganglia (BGs), and the cerebellum (Doyon et al., 2002Doyon J.

Differential recruitment of the sensorimotor putamen and frontoparietal cortex during motor chunking in humans.Neuron. 2012; 74: 936-946Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, exactly how these areas contribute to sequential behavior (Hikosaka et al., 1999Hikosaka O. Nakahara H. Rand M.K. Sakai K. Lu X. Nakamura K. Miyachi S. Doya K. Parallel neural networks for learning sequential procedures.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 464-471Google Scholar). A prevalent idea is that such movement sequences are organized in a hierarchical fashion, where several elementary movements are combined into units, often called “motor chunks” (Lashley, 1951Lashley K.S. The problem of serial order in behavior. In.in: Jeffress L.A. Cerebral Mechanisms in Behavior. John Wiley & Sons, 1951: 112-146Google Scholar). These motor chunks can then activate the generating circuits for each elementary movement, allowing faster and more accurate execution (Rosenbaum et al., 1983Rosenbaum D.A. Kenny S.B. Derr M.A. Hierarchical control of rapid movement sequences.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1983; 9: 86-102Google Scholar) as well as computational efficiency (Ramkumar et al., 2016Ramkumar P. Acuna D.E. Berniker M. Grafton S.T. Turner R.S. Kording K.P. Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12176Google Scholar). Production of an entire sequence could then be achieved by sequential activation of the corresponding chunks, and new sequences could be generated by recombination of learned chunks (Sakai et al., 2003Sakai K. Kitaguchi K. Hikosaka O. Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 152: 229-242Google Scholar). Practice of specific sequences would eventually result in the formation of a more abstract representation that combines chunks (Figure 1A). Thus, the core idea of a multi-level action hierarchy is that each level combines elements in the hierarchically lower level, facilitating the transition between lower-level elements. Each hierarchically higher level would lose some of the fine temporal details encoded at the lower level and, hence, represent the action at a more abstract level (Cooper and Shallice, 2000Cooper R. Shallice T. Contention scheduling and the control of routine activities.Cogn. Neuropsychol. 2000; 17: 297-338Google Scholar, Fuster, 2008Fuster J. The Prefrontal Cortex.

Although there is substantial behavioral evidence (Rosenbaum et al., 1983Rosenbaum D.A. Kenny S.B. Derr M.A. Hierarchical control of rapid movement sequences.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1983; 9: 86-102Google Scholar, Sakai et al., 2003Sakai K. Kitaguchi K. Hikosaka O. Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 152: 229-242Google Scholar) for such hierarchical structure, we still know very little about how these hierarchies are represented in the human brain (Krakauer et al., 2019Krakauer J.W. Hadjiosif A.M. Xu J. Wong A.L. Haith A.M. Motor Learning.Compr. Physiol. 2019; 9: 613-663Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that some neurons show differential firing rates during the same elementary movement, depending on the sequential context, such as preceding or following movement (Baldauf et al., 2008Baldauf D. Cui H. Andersen R.A. The posterior parietal cortex encodes in parallel both goals for double-reach sequences.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10081-10089Google Scholar, Tanji and Shima, 1994Tanji J. Shima K. Role for supplementary motor area cells in planning several movements ahead.Nature. 1994; 371: 413-416Google Scholar). Other neurons have been found to be active at both initiation and termination of a sequence (Fujii and Graybiel, 2003Fujii N. Graybiel A.M. Representation of action sequence boundaries by macaque prefrontal cortical neurons.Science. 2003; 301: 1246-1249Google Scholar) or were selective for specific categories of sequences (Shima et al., 2007Shima K. Isoda M. Mushiake H. Tanji J. Categorization of behavioural sequences in the prefrontal cortex.Nature. 2007; 445: 315-318Google Scholar). However, the use of relatively short and simple sequences in these studies precludes further assessment of different hierarchical levels of sequence representations. There are two extreme views of how such a hierarchical representation could be implemented in the neocortex. The first and most dominant view assumes a clear anatomical separation of different levels of the behavioral hierarchy in the brain (Cooper and Shallice, 2000Cooper R. Shallice T. Contention scheduling and the control of routine activities.Cogn. Neuropsychol. 2000; 17: 297-338Google Scholar, Fuster, 2008Fuster J. The Prefrontal Cortex. Elsevier Science, 2008Google Scholar, Koechlin and Jubault, 2006Koechlin E. Jubault T. Broca’s area and the hierarchical organization of human behavior.Neuron. 2006; 50: 963-974Google Scholar, Miller et al., 1960Miller G.A. Galanter E. Pribram K.H. Plans and the Structure of Behavior. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1960Google Scholar; Figure 1A). Such an organization could emerge from the fact that different regions have different intrinsic timescales on which they can learn and represent sequential dependencies. It has been suggested that basic sensory areas can represent sequences of events on the order of a few hundred milliseconds, with higher-order association areas being able to represent sequences lasting multiple seconds or even minutes (Chaudhuri et al., 2015Chaudhuri R. Knoblauch K. Gariel M.A. Kennedy H. Wang X.J. A Large-Scale Circuit Mechanism for Hierarchical Dynamical Processing in the Primate Cortex.Neuron. 2015; 88: 419-431Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2015Chen J. Hasson U. Honey C.J. Processing Timescales as an Organizing Principle for Primate Cortex.Neuron. 2015; 88: 244-246Google Scholar, Hasson et al., 2015Hasson U. Chen J. Honey C.J. Hierarchical process memory: memory as an integral component of information processing.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2015; 19: 304-313Google Scholar). Based on this idea, one would predict that the anatomical separation of motor sequence representation is determined by the differences in the timescale of individual elementary movements, chunks, and entire sequences. An alternative view advocates that hierarchical behavior can be learned by a single recurrent network without separating different levels of representation (Botvinick and Plaut, 2004Botvinick M. Plaut D.C. Doing without schema hierarchies: a recurrent connectionist approach to normal and impaired routine sequential action.Psychol. Rev. 2004; 111: 395-429Google Scholar, Botvinick, 2007Botvinick M.M. Multilevel structure in behaviour and in the brain: a model of Fuster’s hierarchy.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2007; 362: 1615-1626Google Scholar). Therefore, chunks and entire sequences could be represented in the same network (Figure 1B). Although this hypothesis would also predict that levels of individual movements and sequential context are intermingled, we have recently shown a clear neuroanatomical separation of these two (Yokoi et al., 2018Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Diedrichsen J. The Role of Human Primary Motor Cortex in the Production of Skilled Finger Sequences.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 1430-1442Google Scholar). To test the prediction of a clear anatomical separation between levels of representation, we designed a new behavioral paradigm in which human participants learned to produce long motor sequences that were explicitly organized on three levels; each sequence consisted of four chunks, and each chunk contained 2–3 finger presses. We then investigated the neural correlates of these three levels using representational fMRI analysis (Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017Diedrichsen J. Kriegeskorte N. Representational models: A common framework for understanding encoding, pattern-component, and representational-similarity analysis.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005508Google Scholar). Rather than analyzing the increases or decreases of spatially smoothed activity, representational fMRI analysis makes inferences based on the similarity (or dissimilarity) of multivariate activity patterns across multiple experimental conditions (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008Kriegeskorte N. Mur M. Bandettini P. Representational similarity analysis - connecting the branches of systems neuroscience.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2008; 2: 4Google Scholar, Yokoi et al., 2018Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Diedrichsen J. The Role of Human Primary Motor Cortex in the Production of Skilled Finger Sequences.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 1430-1442Google Scholar). Our paradigm therefore allowed us to experimentally manipulate the structure of motor sequence representations across three hierarchical levels and then to directly infer the representational content of each cortical area with respect to these levels. Our paradigm was aimed at inducing a stable motor hierarchy by manipulating how participants built up their explicit, declarative memory of the sequence. During the fMRI experiment, we required participants to produce sequences with their right hand completely from memory, provided only with a sequence cue (Figures 2A–2C). The training taught participants to remember 8 sequences (Figure 2B; for more details, see Behavioral Training in the STAR Methods). On day 1, they practiced to produce 8 different chunks of 2 or 3 items (Figure 2C) and to associate these with a specific letter (A–H). On the second day, participants started to learn 8 different sequences, each a combination of four learned chunks. At the end of this training, participants could reliably recall most of the sequences. The number of incorrect presses they made in each sequence execution had reduced dramatically; the error rate per press was 9% ± 8% (Figure 2D). The inter-press intervals (IPIs) within each chunk quickly reduced on the first day and remained relatively stable for the following days. In contrast, IPIs for the boundaries between two successive chunks were much longer and reduced only slowly over the course of training days (Figure 2D). Even on the fifth day, the between-chunk IPIs were executed more slowly (386 ± 93 ms) than the within-chunk intervals (220 ± 62 ms, t11 = −5.73, p = 0.0001; Figure 2D). The longer between-chunk IPI is commonly taken as a behavioral indicator that the two sequence elements are represented as separate units. Although this result provided clear evidence for chunking, it remains unclear to what degree the longer between-chunk IPIs were caused by memory retrieval and/or stable motor representation (i.e., planning ahead successive movements). To test this, we asked participants to perform a follow-up session after the fMRI scan in which the sequences were instructed not by the sequence cue but, rather, directly using digits (e.g., 13524232514; Figure 3A). This frees participants from the requirement of explicit memory recall. Nonetheless, on trained sequences, the between-chunk intervals were still longer than the within-chunk intervals (348 ± 124 ms versus 280 ± 122 ms, t11 = −5.00, p = 0.0004; Figure 3E, trained), clearly showing that the induced chunking affected motor performance over and beyond explicit recall. Importantly, our data also show that the observed effect is not driven by differences in the biomechanical difficulty of finger transitions. The sequence design (Figure 2B) was such that 5 of the 8 sequences were the same across the two experimental groups, with the difference that they learned them using a different chunking structure. The normalized press intervals for those sequences showed a pattern that clearly reflected the original instruction (Figure 3B). The inter-subject correlation of these patterns was significantly higher for within-group than between-group comparisons (Figure 3C; t11 = 9.22, p = 1.66 × 10−6). If participants acquire a motor representation of the chunks, then they should also be able to use this knowledge when producing the chunk in a novel context (Sakai et al., 2003Sakai K. Kitaguchi K. Hikosaka O. Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 152: 229-242Google Scholar). To test this, the participants additionally executed 3 sets of novel sequences (Figure 3D). These new sequences either consisted of trained chunks in a new order (“Chunk”), 2 trained chunks embedded in an otherwise random sequence (“Chunk+New”), or completely untrained sequences with no relation to learned chunks (“New”). As expected, IPIs in the New sequences were executed considerably slower than IPIs in trained sequences. For the other two sequence types, the intervals that lay within a learned chunk were performed significantly faster than novel intervals (t11 = −4.86, p = 0.0005 for Chunk; t9 = −4.25, p = 0.0021 for Chunk+New; Figure 3D). Overall, these results suggest that the originally declaratively (i.e., cognitively) imposed chunk structure left a reliable imprint in the motor behavior and was generalized to novel contexts. Importantly, we also observed that the between-chunk IPIs of the trained sequences were faster than the between-chunk IPIs of the Chunk sequences (t11 = −6.35, p = 5.46×10−5). This advantage may have two reasons. First, participants may have acquired a higher-order sequence representation that facilitated the transitions between chunks. Alternatively, it may be due to a form of non-hierarchical association learning (Hunt and Aslin, 2001Hunt R.H. Aslin R.N. Statistical learning in a serial reaction time task: access to separable statistical cues by individual learners.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2001; 130: 658-680Google Scholar, Reber, 1967Reber A.S. Implicit learning of artificial grammars.J. Verbal Learn. Verbal Behav. 1967; 6: 855-863Google Scholar, Stadler, 1992Stadler M.A. Statistical Structure and implicit serial learning.J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn. 1992; 18: 318-327Google Scholar, Verwey and Abrahamse, 2012Verwey W.B. Abrahamse E.L. Distinct modes of executing movement sequences: reacting, associating, and chunking.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 2012; 140: 274-282Google Scholar) at the level of the individual elements; finger transitions that had been encountered in practice would frequently become associated and, therefore, be performed faster. To disentangle these possibilities, we built a linear model for all IPIs of the follow-up session for each individual. We tested three effects of interest: whether the IPI was within or between chunks, whether a chunk transition was within a known sequence, and the frequency with which a specific finger transition was practiced. The model also contained three effects of no interest (see STAR Methods for details). The results of Bayesian model averaging provided clear evidence of both a chunk and sequence effect, accompanied by poor evidence of a finger transition effect (Figure 3F; Table S1). These results suggest that the motor system has formed a representation of the trained chunks as well as a representation of the overall sequences, which, in turn, activate these chunks. With this behavioral evidence, we next assessed where and how these different representations are implemented in the human neocortex. In the fMRI session, the participants received a brief visual cue for the sequence type and then executed the sequence twice (Figure 4A). The activation associated with each sequence was estimated for each voxel by averaging the task-evoked blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity over the two executions. We then applied a representational fMRI analysis to study the cortical sequence representation. Using a searchlight approach (Figure 4B), we first determined whether the activation patterns had any information about the executed sequences. For this, we computed a cross-validated estimate of the Mahalanobis distance (crossnobis distance estimator; Diedrichsen et al., 2016Diedrichsen J. Zareamoghaddam H. Provost S. On the distribution of crossvalidated mahalanobis distances.arXiv. 2016; (arXiv:1607.01371)https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01371Google Scholar, Walther et al., 2016Walther A. Nili H. Ejaz N. Alink A. Kriegeskorte N. Diedrichsen J. Reliability of dissimilarity measures for multi-voxel pattern analysis.Neuroimage. 2016; 137: 188-200Google Scholar) between any possible pairs of the sequences. Systematically positive crossnobis estimates indicate reliable differences between the activity patterns for different sequences. Because all sequences consisted of the same finger presses arranged in a different order (Figure 2B), and because we averaged the activity across two sequence executions, any differences in activity patterns must reflect some dependency of the activity on the sequential context. Figure 4C shows the resultant group searchlight map displayed on the flattened cortical surface. Consistent with other studies (Kornysheva and Diedrichsen, 2014Kornysheva K. Diedrichsen J.

The area also included the SMA and pre-SMA, a small part of the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ; Picard and Strick, 1996Picard N. Strick P.L. Motor areas of the medial wall: a review of their location and functional activation.Cereb. Cortex. 1996; 6: 342-353Google Scholar), the lateral PFC, and the precuneus, although the signal from these areas was weak compared with other areas such as the PMd or IPS (Kornysheva and Diedrichsen, 2014Kornysheva K.

Although some areas showed bilateral representations, they were consistently stronger in the left contra-lateral hemisphere. Although Figure 4C tells us that we can decode sequence identity from the activation patterns in this area, it does not reveal which specific representation contributed to the pattern differences. We therefore tessellated the area with significantly positive dissimilarities using a discrete set of surface patches and looked in detail into the representational structure characterized by the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM; Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017Diedrichsen J.

Biol. 2017; 13: e1005508Google Scholar) within each patch (Figure 5B). Based on our behavioral results, we considered three levels of sequence representation (sequence, chunk, and single finger). At the highest level, we propose a sequence representation with a unique neuronal activity pattern for each of the 8 trained sequences. Because we assume that all sequences are equally strongly encoded, such a representation would predict that all possible pairwise distance are equal. At the next level, we have distinct neural activity patterns for each learned chunk. A region with a pure chunk representation would therefore transition, during the sequence, through the four activity states associated with the four chunks. The resultant RDM is therefore predicted by how many chunks different sequences have in common. For instance, sequences 1 and 2 consist of the same chunks in a different order (Figure 2B) and are therefore predicted to elicit highly similar activity patterns. At the lowest hierarchical level, we considered representations of single fingers. Because all sequences consisted of exactly the same presses arranged in a different order, a single-finger representation should lead to identical activity patterns for all sequences. In a recent study, however, we found that the activity pattern for a sequence is strongly determined by the first finger (Yokoi et al., 2018Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Diedrichsen J. The Role of Human Primary Motor Cortex in the Production of Skilled Finger Sequences.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 1430-1442Google Scholar). Therefore, this representation predicts that sequences starting with the same finger should be very similar to each other (Figure 5A). We then estimated the contribution of each candidate representational model to the observed activity patterns using pattern component modeling (PCM; Diedrichsen et al., 2011Diedrichsen J. Ridgway G.R. Friston K.J. Wiestler T. Comparing the similarity and spatial structure of neural representations: a pattern-component model.Neuroimage. 2011; 55: 1665-1678Google Scholar, Diedrichsen et al., 2018Diedrichsen J. Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Pattern component modeling: A flexible approach for understanding the representational structure of brain activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2018; 180: 119-133Google Scholar). PCM is a powerful Bayesian approach to test combinations of representational models (Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017Diedrichsen J. Kriegeskorte N. Representational models: A common framework for understanding encoding, pattern-component, and representational-similarity analysis.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13: e1005508Google Scholar). We evaluated the likelihood of the data in each surface patch under each possible combination of the 3 candidate models. The relative weight of each model component was fitted. Because different combination models had different numbers of free parameters, we used “leave one subject out” cross-validation (Diedrichsen et al., 2018Diedrichsen J. Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Pattern component modeling: A flexible approach for understanding the representational structure of brain activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2018; 180: 119-133Google Scholar), fitting each model to all participants except one, and then evaluated the likelihood of the data from the left-out participant under the model (see STAR Methods for more detail). Using the resultant cross-validated (log) likelihood for each model, we could compute a log-Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995Kass R.E. Raftery A.E. Bayes Factors.J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1995; 90: 773-795Google Scholar), which assesses how much more (or less) likely the observed data are under the candidate model compared with the null model (see STAR Methods). For a full model evaluation, however, it is not enough to know that a specific model can explain the data better than chance. It is also important to know how much of the systematic variation in the data the model can explain. Before testing any candidate models, we therefore fitted a fully flexible “noise ceiling” model. A positive log-Bayes factor (logBF) for the noise ceiling model (versus the null model) indicates that the structure of sequence representation was consistent across individuals. The map (Figure 5C) clearly indicates that the representational structure of the primary sensorimotor areas showed the highest inter-individual consistency, followed by parietal and frontal premotor areas. Because this model can capture any representational structure, it constitutes an estimate of how well the true model should be able to predict the representational structure (Diedrichsen et al., 2018Diedrichsen J. Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Pattern component modeling: A flexible approach for understanding the representational structure of brain activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2018; 180: 119-133Google Scholar, Nili et al., 2014Nili H. Wingfield C. Walther A. Su L. Marslen-Wilson W. Kriegeskorte N. A toolbox for representational similarity analysis.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003553Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of the 3 candidate model components, we fitted all possible combination of components and then determined the model-averaged log-Bayes factor as a measure of evidence for the presence of each component in the context of the others (STAR Methods). Replicating our previous results (Yokoi et al., 2018Yokoi A. Arbuckle S.A. Diedrichsen J. The Role of Human Primary Motor Cortex in the Production of Skilled Finger Sequences.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 1430-1442Google Scholar), the representational structure in M1 and S1 was almost fully determined by the first finger in each sequence. The model-averaged log-Bayes factor (logBFc) revealed strong evidence of the first finger component (Figure 6A). Within the s"

We hypothesize that reduced SCFA levels are associated with systemic inflammation, endotoxemia, and more severe hemodynamic alterations in cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis referred for a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement (n = 62) or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (n = 12) were included. SCFAs were measured in portal (when available), hepatic, and peripheral blood samples by GC-MS. Serum endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, and NO levels were quantified. SCFA levels were significantly higher in portal vs. hepatic and peripheral blood. There were inverse relationships between SCFAs and the severity of disease. SCFAs (mainly butyric acid) inversely correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score and were further reduced in patients with history of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There was an inverse relationship between butyric acid and HVPG values. SCFAs were directly related with systemic vascular resistance and inversely with cardiac index. Butyric acid inversely correlated with inflammatory markers and serum endotoxin. A global reduction in the blood levels of SCFA in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a more advanced liver disease, suggesting its contribution to disease progression.—Juanola, O., Ferrusquía-Acosta, J., García-Villalba, R., Zapater, P., Magaz, M., Marín, A., Olivas, P., Baiges, A., Bellot, P., Turon, F., Hernández-Gea, V., González-Navajas, J.

https://openalex.org/W2963956499,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a complication of diabetes connected with morbidity and mortality. DPN presents deterioration of peripheral nerves with pain, feebleness, and loss of sensation. Particular medications might display their remedial potential by controlling neuroinflammation. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an autacoid local injury antagonist distinguished for its neuroprotective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties in numerous experimental models of neuroinflammation. Based on these findings, the goal of this work was to better test the neuroprotective effects of a formulation of micronized PEA (PEA-m) and the probable mechanism of action in a mouse model of DPN induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Diabetic and control animals received PEA-m (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage daily starting 2 wk from STZ injection. After 16 wk, the animals were euthanized, and blood, urine, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve tissues were collected. Our results demonstrated that after diabetes induction, PEA-m was able to reduce mechanical, thermal hyperalgesia, and motor alterations as well as reduce mast cell activation and nerve growth factor expression. In addition, PEA-m decreased neural histologic damage, oxidative and nitrosative stress, cytokine release, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Moreover, spinal microglia activation (IBA-1), phospho-P38 MAPK, and nuclear factor NF-κB inflammatory pathways were also inhibited. The protective effects of PEA-m could be correlated at least in part to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation. In summary, we demonstrated that PEA-m represents a new therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammation pain associated with mixed neuropathies.—Impellizzeri, D., Peritore, A.

https://openalex.org/W2965391757,"The assembly of collagen VI microfibrils is a multistep process in which proteolytic processing within the C-terminal globular region of the collagen VI α3 chain plays a major role. However, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Moreover, C5, the short and most C-terminal domain of the α3 chain, recently has been proposed to be released as an adipokine that enhances tumor progression, fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance and has been named endotrophin. Serum endotrophin could be a useful biomarker to monitor the progression of such disorders as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic sclerosis, and kidney diseases. Here, using biochemical and isotopic MS-based analyses, we found that the extracellular metalloproteinase bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) is involved in endotrophin release and determined the exact BMP-1 cleavage site. Moreover, we provide evidence that several endotrophin-containing fragments are present in various tissues and body fluids. Among these, a large C2-C5 fragment, which contained endotrophin, was released by furin-like proprotein convertase cleavage. By using immunofluorescence microscopy and EM, we also demonstrate that these proteolytic maturations occur after secretion of collagen VI tetramers and during microfibril assembly. Differential localization of N- and C-terminal regions of the collagen VI α3 chain revealed that cleavage products are deposited in tissue and cell cultures. The detailed information on the processing of the collagen VI α3 chain reported here provides a basis for unraveling the function of endotrophin (C5) and larger endotrophin-containing fragments and for refining their use as biomarkers of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2963566842,"Climate change is negatively affecting many species. The increase in mean air temperature is often associated with shifts in distribution, changes in phenology, and local extinctions. Other factors that only partially correlate with air temperature, like water shortage, may also contribute to the negative consequences of climate change. Although the effect of temperature on lizards' ecophysiology is highly studied, many lizards are also at risks of increased water loss and dehydration, which are predicted to increase under climate change. Here we aimed for the first time to explore if lacertid lizards exposed to dehydration thermoregulate less precisely than hydrated lizards and if dehydrated lizards are less active, change the daily pattern of thermoregulation and balance water balance against thermoregulation. We exposed four lizard species with differences in the thermal preference to thermal gradients with or without a source of water. We measured preferred body temperatures, daily pattern of thermoregulation, and the use of space. Dehydration negatively affected thermoregulation in all investigated species. Dehydrated lizards reduced their preferred body temperature and showed a species-specific pattern of hourly change in thermal preference. Furthermore, they more frequently used the colder parts of the gradients and spent more time hidden. Lizards experiencing dehydration may suffer a reduction in survival and fitness because of poor thermoregulation. Similarly, they may spend more time hidden, waiting for more favourable weather conditions. Such inactivity may carry ecological costs especially in those regions that undergo either short or prolonged periods of droughts."
https://openalex.org/W2962821611,"Mammalian cell expression systems are the most commonly used platforms for producing biotherapeutic proteins. However, development of recombinant mammalian cell lines is often hindered by the unstable and variable transgene expression associated with random integration. We have developed an efficient strategy for site-specific integration of genes of interest (GOIs). This method enables rapid and precise insertion of a gene expression cassette at defined loci in mammalian cells, resulting in homogeneous transgene expression. We identified the Hipp11 (H11) gene as a ""safe harbor"" locus for gene knock-in in CHO-S cells. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated homologous recombination, we knocked in a DNA cassette (the landing pad) that includes a pair of PhiC31 bacteriophage attP sites and genes facilitating integrase-based GOI integration. A master cell line, with the landing pad inserted correctly in the H11 locus, was established. This master cell line was used for site-specific, irreversible recombination, catalyzed by PhiC31 integrase. Using this system, an integration efficiency of 97.7% was achieved with green fluorescent protein (GFP) after selection. The system was then further validated in HEK293T cells, using an analogous protocol to insert the GFP gene at the ROSA26 locus, resulting in 90.7% GFP-positive cells after selection. In comparison, random insertion yielded 0.68% and 1.32% GFP-positive cells in the CHO-S and HEK293T cells, respectively. Taken together, these findings demonstrated an accurate and effective protocol for generating recombinant cell lines to provide consistent protein production. Its likely broad applicability was illustrated here in two cell lines, CHO-S and HEK293T, using two different genomic loci as integration sites. Thus, the system is potentially valuable for biomanufacturing therapeutic proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2963561338,"Direction-selective neurons respond to visual motion in a preferred direction. They are direction-opponent if they are also inhibited by motion in the opposite direction. In flies and vertebrates, direction opponency has been observed in second-order direction-selective neurons, which achieve this opponency by subtracting signals from first-order direction-selective cells with opposite directional tunings. Here, we report direction opponency in Drosophila that emerges in first-order direction-selective neurons, the elementary motion detectors T4 and T5. This opponency persists when synaptic output from these cells is blocked, suggesting that it arises from feedforward, not feedback, computations. These observations exclude a broad class of linear-nonlinear models that have been proposed to describe direction-selective computations. However, they are consistent with models that include dynamic nonlinearities. Simulations of opponent models suggest that direction opponency in first-order motion detectors improves motion discriminability by suppressing noise generated by the local structure of natural scenes."

However, there is lack of a physiological context linking Hspa8 and Mef2 proteins in skeletal muscle. Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) transfer a methyl group (CH3) from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to lysine residuals of substrates (16Lanouette S. Mongeon V. Figeys D. Couture J.F.

Methylation alters the hydrophobic and steric properties of a lysine residue, leading to changes in protein stability, protein-protein interactions, and protein-DNA interactions (17Hamamoto R.

Histone lysine methylation regulates chromatin structures and thus modulates gene expression (18Black J.C. Van Rechem C. Whetstine J.R.

Recently, a group of 10 nonhistone protein lysine methyltransferases was characterized as methyltransferase family 16 (MTF16). Among this family METTL21A-D forms a subgroup based on phylogenetic analysis (20Falnes P.Ø. Jakobsson M.E. Davydova E. Ho A. Małecki J.

Intriguingly, METTL21C is identified as a pleiotropic gene for both skeletal muscle and bone through a genome-wide association study (22Huang J. Hsu Y.H. Mo C. Abreu E. Kiel D.P. Bonewald L.F.

A recent study identifies that Mettl21c is a type I myofiber–specific protein and functions to trimethylate valosin-containing protein (Vcp/p97), a protein required for autophagy (23Wiederstein J.L.

Mettl21c−/− mice have normal muscle patterning, but dysregulated autophagy and muscle weakness (23Wiederstein J.L. Nolte H. Günther S. Piller T. Baraldo M. Kostin S. Bloch W. Schindler N. Sandri M. Blaauw B. Braun T. Hölper S. Krüger M.

In human cells, METTL21C physically interacts with heat shock 70 kDa (HSPA) proteins (21Cloutier P. Lavallee-Adam M. Faubert D. Blanchette M. Coulombe B. A newly uncovered group of distantly related lysine methyltransferases preferentially interact with molecular chaperones to regulate their activity.PloS Genet. 2013; 9 (23349634): e100321010.1371/journal.pgen.1003210Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether the HSPA proteins are bona fide substrates of METTL21C. In this study, we used the Mettl21cLacZ knockin/knockout mouse model to track the developmental expression of Mettl21c. We found that Mettl21c was absent during myogenesis and was only expressed in mature type I myofibers. We then demonstrated that Mettl21c methylates and stabilizes Hspa8, thereby reducing the level of Hspa8 client proteins Mef2A and Mef2D. These data demonstrate an in vivo physiological function of Mettl21c and reveal the biological significance of nonhistone methylation in the skeletal muscle. We tracked the expression of Mettl21c using Mettl21cLacZ/+ mice, which contain the β-gal reporter targeted to replace exon 2–5 of Mettl21c (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence staining of the slow (type I) myofiber–specific myosin heavy chain (Myh7) and X-Gal staining in serial sections of adult soleus (SOL) muscle indicate type I myofiber–specific expression of Mettl21c (Fig. 1B). We also isolated single myofibers from WT mice and detected the expression of Mettl21c specifically in type I myofibers expressing Myh7 in a separate study (25Wang C. Zhang B. Ratliff A.C. Arrington J. Chen J. Xiong Y. Yue F. Nie Y. Hu K. Jin W. Tao W.A. Hrycyna C.A. Sun X. Kuang S. Methyltransferase-like 21e inhibits 26S proteasome activity to facilitate hypertrophy of type IIb myofibers.FASEB J. 2019; 33 (31162944): 9672-968410.1096/fj.201900582RCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which confirms X-Gal signal as a reporter of Mettl21c expression. We then investigated the developmental expression of Mettl21c. Whole-mount X-Gal staining showed no discernible positive signals in limb muscles of E18.5 embryos (data not shown). Additionally, there were no X-Gal signals in SOL muscle of postnatal day 3 (P3) mice, although Myh7+ (type I) myofibers were readily detectable at the same stage (Fig. 1C), indicating that the expression of Myh7 precedes that of Mettl21c and excluding a possible role of Mettl21c in type I myofiber specification. X-Gal signals were first shown in a group of Myh7+ myofibers in SOL muscles of P7 mice (Fig. 1D). The X-Gal signals became stronger and nearly all Myh7+ myofibers had positive X-Gal staining in SOL muscle of P10 mice (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the X-Gal staining patterns, mRNA levels of Mettl21c were low from E18.5 to P3, then up-regulated at P7, reaching the plateau levels at P10 in hind limb muscles (Fig. 1F). Hence, Mettl21c is expressed after the establishment of Myh7+ myofiber and the expression level is increased with the maturation of Myh7+ myofibers. To further confirm the absence of Mettl21c expression during myogenesis, we cultured primary myoblasts isolated from the Mettl21cLacZ/+ (HET) or Mettl21cLacZ/LacZ (KO) mice and induced the cells to differentiate. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that the mRNA levels of Mettl21c in the HET myotubes were identical to those of KO myotubes (both were nearly undetectable), indicative of the lack of Mettl21c expression in the HET myotubes (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the level of Mettl21c in the adult SOL muscles of HET was over 100 times higher than that in the KO muscles (Fig. 1G). In addition, there were no morphological differences between HET and KO myotubes (Fig. 1H), suggesting that Mettl21c is dispensable for myogenic differentiation. These results suggest that Mettl21c mainly functions in mature type I myofibers. We next studied the function of Mettl21c in vivo using KO mice models. To exclude the potential influence of β-gal, we compared KO mice with Mettl21cLacZ/+ mice. KO mice were indistinguishable from HET and WT mice in gross morphology, body weight, and SOL muscle weight (Fig. 2, A and B). Total numbers and sizes of myofibers in SOL muscles were comparable between HET and KO mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Immunostaining of Myh isoforms showed that the percentage of type I myofibers in SOL muscle was comparable between HET and KO mice (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting that Mettl21c KO does not affect slow myofiber development or maintenance. However, KO mice run shorter distance and had lower speed than HET mice (Fig. 2G), indicating that Mettl21c is necessary for proper functioning of skeletal muscles. To understand the function of Mettl21c, we first attempted to identify Mettl21c-associated proteins. We used FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate (IP) protein complexes from myocytes transduced with Mettl21c-FLAG or GFP-FLAG adenoviral vectors. SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins obtained by IP revealed an ∼70 kDa protein co-purified with Mettl21c but not with GFP (Fig. 3A). Using affinity purification-MS (AP-MS), we identified several chaperone proteins specifically in Mettl21c-associated complexes, but not in GFP-associated complexes (Fig. 3B). Among these chaperone proteins, Hspa5 and Hspa8 have a molecular mass at ∼70 kDa. IP analysis confirmed that Mettl21c binds with Hspa8 (Fig. 3C), but not with Hspa5 in myocytes (Fig. 3C). These results indicate a physical association between Mettl21c and Hspa8. We further performed in vitro methyltransferase assay to determine whether Hspa8 is methylated by Mettl21c. Various concentrations of recombinant Mettl21c and Hspa8 proteins were reacted in the presence of [14C]SAM, and the incorporation of methyl groups into substrates was measured as TCA-insoluble radioactivity. To establish the validity of the assay, we used recombinant Vcp as a positive control, which was recently shown to be methylated by Mettl21c (23Wiederstein J.L. Nolte H. Günther S. Piller T. Baraldo M. Kostin S. Bloch W. Schindler N. Sandri M. Blaauw B. Braun T. Hölper S. Krüger M. Skeletal muscle-specific methyltransferase METTL21C trimethylates p97 and regulates autophagy-associated protein breakdown.Cell Rep. 2018; 23 (29719249): 1342-135610.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that Vcp was dose-dependently methylated by Mettl21c, with a Km at ∼0.0075 (Fig. 3D). We next held the Mettl21c at a constant concentration (1 μm) with varying concentration (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 μm) of Hspa8, and found that Hspa8 was dose-dependently methylated by Mettl21c, with a Km at ∼0.03 (Fig. 3E). The Km of Mettl21c on Hspa8 was slightly higher than that on Vcp, indicating that Mettl21c-Hspa8 had a relatively lower reaction rate than that of Mettl21c-Vcp. These data provide compelling biochemical evidence that Hspa8 is a new substrate of Mettl21c. Then we utilized AP-MS to characterize methylated peptides enriched by IP using a pan-methyl lysine antibody in myocytes transduced with Mettl21c (Mettl21cOE) or GFP (as control) adenoviral vectors (Fig. 4A). This led to the identification of lysine (K) 561 in Hspa8 that was highly trimethylated in primary myoblasts transduced by Mettl21c-expressing adenovirus in relative to cells transduced by GFP control (Fig. 4B). Specifically, the abundance of the trimethylated Hspa8 peptide was 5-fold higher in Mettl21cOE myocytes than in control myocytes (Fig. 4B), indicating that Mettl21c is responsible for the Lys-561 trimethylation. To verify the methylation site, we mutated the Lys-561 to nonmethylatable alanine (A) and used the recombinant K561A-Hspa8 mutant as a substrate with increasing concentrations of Mettl21c in the methyltransferase assay. Whereas the WT Hspa8 was robustly methylated by Mettl21c, the K561A mutation abolished the dose-dependent incorporation of radioactivity and methylation by Mettl21c (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that Lys-561 was the only site in Hspa8 that can be methylated by Mettl21c. We further utilized the same AP-MS assay to investigate methylated peptides in SOL muscles of HET and KO mice. We did not detect any Lys-561 monomethylation in Hspa8, and only detected either dimethylation or trimethylation of Lys-561 (Fig. 4E). Importantly, loss of Mettl21c decreased the abundance of trimethylated Hspa8 peptide by 51%, compensated by 11% increase in the abundance of dimethylated Hspa8 peptide (Fig. 4E). Our data demonstrate that Mettl21c trimethylates Hspa8 at Lys-561. We next investigated the biological consequences of Lys-561 methylation. It has been reported that the methylation perturbs interaction between Hspa8 and an E3 ubiquitin ligase C terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP), leading to decreased ubiquitination on Hspa8 (26Zhang H. Amick J. Chakravarti R. Santarriaga S. Schlanger S. McGlone C. Dare M. Nix J.C. Scaglione K.M. Stuehr D.J. Misra S. Page R.C. A bipartite interaction between Hsp70 and CHIP regulates ubiquitination of chaperoned client proteins.Structure. 2015; 23 (25684577): 472-48210.1016/j.str.2015.01.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the Lys-561 methylation prevents Hspa8 from degradation. We transfected 293A cells with K561R or K561A mutant pcDNA5–GFP-Hspa8 plasmids to mimic methylated or unmethylated Lys-561, and treated the 293A cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to observe the degradation of the two mutants (Fig. 5A). Although the protein level of K561A mutant was decreased within 8 h after CHX treatment, the protein level of K561R mutant was unchanged within 24 h after CHX treatment (Fig. 5A), indicating that Lys-561 methylation increased the stability of Hspa8. It has been reported that Hspa8 targets Mef2A and Mef2D to lysosome for degradation through CMA in neurons (14Yang Q. She H. Gearing M. Colla E. Lee M. Shacka J.J. Mao Z. Regulation of neuronal survival factor MEF2D by chaperone-mediated autophagy.Science. 2009; 323 (19119233): 124-12710.1126/science.1166088Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Zhang L.

We therefore examined how Hspa8 affects Mef2 proteins in myotubes. We transduced myotubes by adenovirus expressing Hspa8-GFP (Hspa8OE) or GFP only (control), and found that Hspa8OE reduced the levels of Mef2A and Mef2D in myotubes (Fig. 5B). Consistently, Hspa8OE decreased the transcriptional activities of Mef2A and Mef2D, but not Mef2C (Fig. 5C). Notably, K561A-Hspa8 similarly inhibited the activity of Mef2A and Mef2D (Fig. 5C), indicating that K561 methylation was not required for the inhibition of Mef2A and Mef2D. We further investigated the effect of Lys-561 trimethylation on Hspa8 stability. We detected the level of Hspa8 and its target proteins Mef2A and Mef2D in SOL muscles of Mettl21cKO mice. Mettl21cKO reduced the Lys-561 trimethylation and the level of Hspa8 in sarcoplasm and increased the protein levels of Mef2A and Mef2D in myonuclei (Figs. 4E and 5D). To examine the effect of Mettl21c-mediated Lys-561 trimethylation on Hspa8 level and function, differentiated myoblasts were transduced with Mettl21c (Mettl21cOE) or GFP (as control) adenoviral vectors. The expression of Mettl21c was over 2000-fold higher in Mettl21cOE myotubes than in control myotubes (Fig. 5E). Mettl21cOE increased the trimethylation and the level of Hspa8, concomitant with a decrease in the level of Mef2A and Mef2D (Figs. 4B and 5F). These results provide compelling evidence that Lys-561 methylation stabilizes Hspa8. As Mettl21c trimethylates and maintains the level of Hspa8, which was shown to function as carrier to facilitate degradation of Mef2A and Mef2D through the CMA pathway, we hypothesize that the regulation of Mef2A and Mef2D by Mettl21c is CMA-dependent. To test this hypothesis, we selectively blocked CMA by silencing Lamp2a using lentiviral shRNA (27Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M. Consequences of the selective blockage of chaperone-mediated autophagy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103 (16585521): 5805-581010.1073/pnas.0507436103Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Lamp2a shRNA efficiently reduced the level of Lamp2a, accompanied by an accumulation of Mef2A and Mef2D (Fig. 5G). Importantly, Lamp2a silencing prevented Mettl21cOE-mediated reduction of Mef2A and Mef2D (Fig. 5, F and G), indicating that the CMA pathway mediates the degradation of Mef2A and Mef2D in Mettl21cOE myotubes. These results together establish a model in which Mettl21c methylates Hspa8 to facilitate degradation of its client proteins such as Mef2A and Mef2D (Fig. 5H). Although high levels of Mef2 proteins are detrimental to mature muscles (6Wüst S. Dröse S. Heidler J. Wittig I. Klockner I. Franko A. Bonke E. Günther S. Gärtner U. Boettger T. Braun T. Metabolic maturation during muscle stem cell differentiation is achieved by miR-1/133a-mediated inhibition of the Dlk1-Dio3 mega gene cluster.Cell Metab. 2018; 27 (29606596): 1026-1039.e610.1016/j.cmet.2018.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Mef2 transcription factors are required for muscle regeneration (3Liu N. Nelson B.R. Bezprozvannaya S. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Requirement of MEF2A, C, and D for skeletal muscle regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As Mettl21c regulates the levels of Mef2A and Mef2D, we predict that Mettl21c expression should be down-regulated during muscle regeneration to allow accumulation of Mef2 proteins. We thus examined the expression of Mettl21c using the Mettl21cLaz/+ reporter mice during SOL muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced injuries. We performed immunofluorescence and X-Gal staining on sections of regenerated SOL muscles. At day 7 post CTX injection, only a small number of regenerating Myh7+ myofibers had weak X-Gal signals (Fig. 6A), indicating that Mettl21c is not expressed in newly regenerated type I myofibers. At day 14 post CTX injection, a substantial number of regenerated myofibers expressed Myh7, accompanied by increased levels of X-gal signal specifically in Myh7+ myofibers (Fig. 6B). In parallel, Mettl21c mRNA levels was sharply decreased by more than 90% within 3 days after CTX-induced muscle degeneration, and gradually increased in the following 2 weeks, reaching the maximal levels at day 14 post CTX injury (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that Mettl21c expression is down-regulated during muscle regeneration and suggests that Mettl21c is dispensable for muscle regeneration. We also investigated the regeneration of SOL muscles in HET and KO mice after CTX injury. Consistently, the regeneration of KO muscles was comparable to that of HET muscles at day 7 post CTX injury (Fig. 6D). These results ensure the notion that Mettl21c mainly functions in mature type I myofibers. In this study we dissect the dynamic expression and in vivo function of a type I myofiber-specific methyltransferase Mettl21c. The expression of Mettl21c is absent during myogenesis, indicating that Mettl21c is not required for the development of skeletal muscle, inconsistent with the normal muscle morphology in KO mice. Despite the normal muscular morphology, KO mice have decreased motor activity. Wiederstein et al. (23Wiederstein J.L. Nolte H. Günther S. Piller T. Baraldo M. Kostin S. Bloch W. Schindler N.

https://openalex.org/W2963791341,"The gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in most cancers. p53 expression is known to be tightly controlled by several E3 ligases. Here, we show that F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7α (FBW7α), the substrate-recognition component of the SCFFBW7 multiprotein E3 ligase complex, targets both WT and tumor-derived mutants of p53 for proteasomal degradation in multiple human cancer cell lines (HCT116 and U2OS). We found that lack of FBW7α stabilizes p53 levels, thereby increasing its half-life. p53 ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation require the F-box and the C-terminal WD40 repeats in FBW7α. The polyubiquitylation of p53 occurred via Lys-48 linkage and involved phosphorylation on p53 at Ser-33 and Ser-37 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), respectively. These phosphorylation events created a phosphodegron that enhanced p53 binding to FBW7α, allowing for the attachment of polyubiquitin moieties at Lys-132 in p53. FBW7α-dependent p53 polyubiquitylation apparently occurred during and immediately after DNA double-strand breaks induced by either doxorubicin or ionizing radiation. Accordingly, in cells lacking FBW7α, p53 induction was enhanced after DNA damage. Phosphodegron-mediated polyubiquitylation of p53 on Lys-132 had functional consequences, with cells in which FBW7α-mediated p53 degradation was abrogated exhibiting enhancement of their tumorigenic potential. We conclude that p53, which previously has been reported to transactivate FBW7, is also targeted by the same E3 ligase for degradation, suggesting the presence of a regulatory feedback loop that controls p53 levels and functions during DNA damage."

Little is known, however, about the lung cancer risk associated with different emphysema phenotypes. We assessed the risk of lung cancer based on the presence, type and severity of emphysema, using visual assessment.Seventy-two consecutive lung cancer cases were selected from a prospective cohort of 3,477 participants enrolled in the Clínica Universidad de Navarra's lung cancer screening program. Each case was matched to three control subjects using age, sex, smoking history and body mass index as key variables. Visual assessment of emphysema and spirometry were performed. Logistic regression and interaction model analysis were used in order to investigate associations between lung cancer and emphysema subtypes.Airflow obstruction and visual emphysema were significantly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.8, 95%CI: 1.6 to 5.2; OR = 5.9, 95%CI: 2.9 to 12.2; respectively). Emphysema severity and centrilobular subtype were associated with greater risk when adjusted for confounders (OR = 12.6, 95%CI: 1.6 to 99.9; OR = 34.3, 95%CI: 25.5 to 99.3, respectively). The risk of lung cancer decreases with the added presence of paraseptal emphysema (OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 3.6 to 34.9), losing this increased risk of lung cancer when it occurs alone (OR = 0.7, 95%CI: 0.5 to 2.6).Visual scoring of emphysema predicts lung cancer risk.

https://openalex.org/W2963491687,"Objectives Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist that has anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism by which DEX protects against myocardial I/R. Methods Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to either sham operation or myocardial I/R, which was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min. Rats were treated with either DEX or saline prior to surgery. We measured heart infarct size, serum cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), cardiac High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) expression, myocardial apoptosis and cytokine production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Besides, we evaluated the heart function at 4 weeks post-reperfusion by echocardiography. Unilateral vagotomy or inhibition of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) with methyllycaconitine (MLA) was applied to investigate whether DEX-induced cardioprotection is mediated via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Cardiac-selective overexpression of HMGB1 was administered to further confirm if HMGB1 is a key anti-inflammatory target during DEX-induced cardioprotection. Results DEX pretreatment significantly attenuated I/R-induced cardiac damage, as evidenced by decreases in short-term injury indicators including myocardial infarct size, cTnI release, myocardial apoptosis, cardiac HMGB1 expression, IL-6 and TNF-α production, as well as improvement on long-term cardiac function at 4 weeks post-reperfusion. These effects were partially reversed by either unilateral vagotomy or methyllycaconitine treatment. Besides, cardiac HMGB1-overexpression nearly abolished DEX-induced cardioprotection. Conclusions DEX pretreatment protects against myocardial I/R by inhibiting cardiac HMGB1 production and activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway."

Their survival rates were higher at the medium fluctuation frequency than at the low and high frequencies, suggesting beneficial effects of the medium frequency. In the experiment comparing the fluctuation ranges, A. calamus and I. wilsonii could maintain the capacity for asexual propagation and accumulate higher biomass compared with the control plants, while biomass of the other six species dramatically decreased. In the experiment comparing fluctuation frequency, species with relatively high survival rates (≥ 50%) maintained or increased the capacity of asexual propagation, and A. calamus and I. wilsonii allocated relatively more biomass to roots, which may enhance plant growth and survival. In contrast, these species did not show increased biomass allocation to shoots in response to both fluctuation range and frequency, presumably because shoots are prone to mechanical damage caused by streaming floodwater. Taken together, biomass accumulation in roots rather than in shoots and the ability to asexually propagate are important for the survival of these species during water fluctuation."

Microtubule-associated Ser/Thr kinase 2 (MAST2) inhibits neurite outgrowth, and its inhibition therefore represents a potential therapeutic strategy. We previously reported that a viral protein (G-protein from rabies virus) capable of interfering with protein–protein interactions between the PDZ domain of MAST2 and the C-terminal moieties of its cellular partners counteracts MAST2-mediated suppression of neurite outgrowth. Here, we designed peptides derived from the native viral protein to increase the affinity of these peptides for the MAST2–PDZ domain. Our strategy involved modifying the length and flexibility of the noninteracting sequence linking the two subsites anchoring the peptide to the PDZ domain. Three peptides, Neurovita1 (NV1), NV2, and NV3, were selected, and we found that they all had increased affinities for the MAST2–PDZ domain, with Kd values decreasing from 1300 to 60 nm, while target selectivity was maintained. A parallel biological assay evaluating neurite extension and branching in cell cultures revealed that the NV peptides gradually improved neural activity, with the efficacies of these peptides for stimulating neurite outgrowth mirroring their affinities for MAST2–PDZ. We also show that NVs can be delivered into the cytoplasm of neurons as a gene or peptide. In summary, our findings indicate that virus-derived peptides targeted to MAST2–PDZ stimulate neurite outgrowth in several neuron types, opening up promising avenues for potentially using NVs in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2963901741,"The active phase of conventional static composting systems varies dramatically, ranging from several weeks to several months. Therefore, this study was to examine the effect of a combined continuous aeration-rotation process on shortening the active phase of composted material. A mixture of tomato plant residues with 20%-chicken manure (v/v) was composted in two identical pilot-scale bioreactors. One of them was static, and the other was continuously rotated at 3 rpm; each was supplied with continuous aeration. Compost temperatures (Tc) were measured throughout the composting process; the moisture content (MC) and carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. The quality and stage of compost were evaluated at the end of the experiment using Dewar, Solvita, and visual tests. Continuous aeration-rotation significantly reduced the active phase period to 4.5 days, increased the compost temperature (Tc) to 60°C after 3 days of operation, and remained at 50–65°C for approximately 3 consecutive days (thermophilic stage). In contrast, compost in the static bioreactor remained in the mesophilic stage (Tc < 45°C). During the composting process, the C/N ratio was reduced from 30/1 to 23/1 in the rotating bioreactor, while it remained at 30/1 in the static bioreactor, indicating that the nitrogen content was not a limiting factor affecting the composting process. The MC was within the optimum range for microorganisms (58–61%) for both bioreactors. After the active phase had ended in the rotating bioreactor, the compost was inactive and ready for further maturation, while compost from the static bioreactor was still immature and active. These results show that the proposed method can be done on a commercial scale to significantly reduce the composting period and to enhance the compost stability and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2962705053,"Resistance of pathogenic bacteria to standard antibiotics is an issue of great concern, and new treatments for bacterial infections are needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic, and amphipathic molecules expressed by metazoans that kill pathogens. They are a key part of the innate immune system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Due to their low toxicity and broad antimicrobial activities, there has been increasing attention to their therapeutic usage. Our previous research demonstrated that four peptides-DAN1, DAN2, HOLO1 and LOUDEF1-derived from recently sequenced arthropod genomes exhibited potent antimicrobial effects in-vitro. In this study, we show that DAN2 protected 100% of mice when it was administered at a concentration of 20 mg/kg thirty minutes after the inoculation of a lethal dose of E. coli intraperitoneally. Lower concentrations of DAN2-10mg/kg and 5mg/kg protected more than 2/3s of the mice. All three dose levels reduced bacterial loads in blood and peritoneal fluid by 10-fold or more when counted six hours after bacterial challenge. We determined that DAN2 acts by compromising the integrity of the E. coli membrane. This study supports the potential of DAN2 peptide as a therapeutic agent for treating antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2963550523,"Multiple DNA repair pathways may be involved in the removal of the same DNA lesion caused by endogenous or exogenous agents. Although distinct DNA repair machinery fulfill overlapping roles in the repair of DNA lesions, the mechanisms coordinating different pathways have not been investigated in detail. Here, we show that Ku70, a core protein of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, can directly interact with DNA polymerase-β (Pol-β), a central player in the DNA base excision repair (BER), and this physical complex not only promotes the polymerase activity of Pol-β and BER efficiency but also enhances the classic NHEJ repair. Moreover, we find that DNA damages caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or etoposide promote the formation of Ku70-Pol-β complexes at the repair foci. Furthermore, suppression of endogenous Ku70 expression by small interfering RNA reduces BER efficiency and leads to higher sensitivity to MMS and accumulation of the DNA strand breaks. Similarly, Pol-β knockdown impairs total-NHEJ capacity but only has a slight influence on alternative NHEJ. These results suggest that Pol-β and Ku70 coordinate 2-way crosstalk between the BER and NHEJ pathways.-Xia, W., Ci, S., Li, M., Wang, M., Dianov, G. L., Ma, Z., Li, L., Hua, K., Alagamuthu, K.

In rheumatoid arthritis research, this has led to the discovery of important candidate genes which offered novel insights into mechanisms and their possible roles in the cure of the disease. In the last years, data generation has outstripped data analysis and while many studies focused on specific aspects of the disease, a global picture of the disease is not yet accomplished. Here, we analyzed and compared a collection of gene expression information from healthy individuals and from patients suffering under different arthritis conditions from published studies containing the following clinical conditions: early and established rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthralgia. We show comprehensive overviews of this data collection and give new insights specifically on gene expression in the early stage, into sex-dependent gene expression, and we describe general differences in expression of different biotypes of genes. Many genes that are related to cytoskeleton changes (actin filament related genes) are differently expressed in early rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to healthy subjects; interestingly, eight of these genes reverse their expression ratio significantly between men and women compared early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. There are some slighter changes between men and woman between the conditions early and established rheumatoid arthritis. Another aspect are miRNAs and other gene biotypes which are not only promising candidates for diagnoses but also change their expression grossly in average at rheumatoid arthritis and arthralgia compared to the healthy condition. With a selection of intersecting genes, we were able to generate simple classification models to distinguish between healthy and rheumatoid arthritis as well as between early rheumatoid arthritis to other arthritides based on gene expression."

However, the role of clock gene products in various pathological lower urinary tract conditions is unknown. The present study examined the relationship between clock genes and voiding dysfunction in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). The voluntary voiding behavior study using metabolic cages was performed in 18-weeks old male Wistar rats (control group, n = 36) and SHR (SHR group, n = 36) under 12-h light/12-h dark conditions. Bladders were harvested every 4 h at six time points (n = 6 for each time point for each group), and we analyzed the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of several clock genes: period 2 (Per2), cryptochrome 2 (Cry2), brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1), circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Rev-erbα), mechanosensors: transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV1), TRPV4, Piezo1, and vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Though 24-h urination frequency for both light and dark periods was significantly higher in the SHR group, urine volume per voiding was significantly lower versus control. In controls, urine volume per voiding was significantly lower during the dark period (active phase) than the light period (rest phase); this parameter did not significantly differ between active and rest phases for SHR. SHR bladders showed significantly higher expression of Cry2 and Clock during the active phase compared to controls. In the SHR group, TRPV1, TRPV4, Piezo1, and VNUT mRNA levels were significantly higher during the active phase compared to the control group. We speculate that Cry2 and Clock may be contributing factors in the decrease of bladder capacity during the active phase in SHR through increase of TRPV1, TRPV4, Piezo1, and VNUT expression, but further research will be necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2962847970,"As humans continue moving to urban areas, there is a growing need to understand the effects of urban intensification on native wildlife populations. Forest species in remnant habitat are particularly vulnerable to urban intensification, but the mechanisms behind these effects are poorly understood. An understanding of how species traits, as proxies for mechanisms, mediate the effects of urban intensification on forest species can help fill this knowledge gap. Using a large point count dataset from the Second Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas, we tested for the effects of species traits on the magnitude and spatial scale of the responses of 58 forest bird species to urbanization intensity in landscapes surrounding count locations. Average urbanization intensity effect size across species was -0.36 ± 0.49 (SE) and average scale of effect of urbanization intensity was 4.87 ± 5.95 km. Resident forest bird species that are granivorous or frugivorous, cavity-nesting, and have larger clutch sizes and more fledglings per clutch had more positive associations with increasing urbanization intensity in landscapes. In addition, the effect of urbanization intensity on forest birds manifested most strongly at larger spatial scales for granivorous, frugivorous, or omnivorous species that are cavity-nesting, have larger clutch sizes and longer wingspans, and flock in larger numbers. To our knowledge, the present study represents the first direct tests of the effects of species traits on both the magnitude and spatial scale of the effect of urbanization on forest birds, as well as the first evidence that migratory status, clutch size, wingspan, and fledglings per clutch are important determinants of the responses of forest birds to urbanization. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying our results and their implications for forest bird conservation in urbanizing landscapes."

Here, we present evidence that RD3 protects photoreceptors from degeneration by competing with guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs), which are calcium sensor proteins for retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC). RetGC activity in rd3/rd3 retinas was drastically reduced but stimulated by the endogenous GCAPs at low Ca2+ concentrations. RetGC activity completely failed to accelerate in rd3/rd3GCAPs−/− hybrid photoreceptors, whose photoresponses remained drastically suppressed compared with the WT.

Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection is considered an independent predictor for meningitis and death. Since 2011, the World Health Organization recommends CrAg screening for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) with CD4 counts <100-200 cells/μl. Its implementation is still limited in low-middle-income countries. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and predictors of CrAg positivity in PLHAs. We also evaluated outcomes among those who were CrAg-positive.Prospective cohort conducted at an infectious diseases hospital, in Brazil. Adults with CD4 <200 cells/μl, without previous cryptococcal disease and regardless of symptoms, were enrolled from 2015 to 2018. CrAg tests were performed by LFA. Lumbar puncture was done in CrAg+ individuals and pre-emptive therapy was offered for those without meningitis.Of 214 individuals recruited, 88% were antiretroviral experienced, of which only 11.6% with viral suppression. Overall, CrAg prevalence was 7.9% (95% CI, 4.7-12.4). In CD4 ≤100 cells/μl group it was 7.5% (95% CI, 4.1-12.6) and 9.1% (95% CI, 3.4-19.0) in the group with CD4 101 to 199 cells/μl (p = 0.17). Prevalence in asymptomatic subjects was 5.3% (95% CI, 1.4-13.1). One among 17 CrAg+ participants had documented meningoencephalitis and no subclinical meningitis was detected. Adherence to pre-emptive treatment was 68.7% (11/16). There were no statistically significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical or laboratory characteristics to predict CrAg positivity. No case of cryptococcal disease was diagnosed among CrAg + subjects, followed by a median of 12 months.CrAg screening for severely immunosuppressed PLHAs in Brazil yielded a prevalence of 7.9%. No difference was found in the prevalence of CrAg stratified by CD4 values (CD4 <100 versus CD4 101-199 cells/μl). No clinical nor laboratory factors predicted CrAg positivity, corroborating the need for the implementation of universal CrAg screening for PLHAs with CD4 <200 cells/μl in similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W2965341301,"Absolute and relative dispersion are fundamental quantities employed in order to assess the mixing strength of a basin. There exists a time scale called Lagrangian Integral Scale associated to absolute dispersion that highlights the occurrence of the transition from a quadratic dependence on time to a linear dependence on time. Such a time scale is commonly adopted as an indicator of the duration needed to lose the influence of the initial conditions. This work aims to show that in a semi-enclosed basin the choice of the formulation in order to calculate the absolute dispersion can lead to different results. Moreover, the influence of initial conditions can persist beyond the Lagrangian Integral Scale. Such an influence can be appreciated by evaluating absolute and relative dispersion recursively by changing the initial conditions. Furthermore, finite-size Lyapunov exponents characterize the different regimes of the basin."

In this study, 1,145 B. tabaci MED females from 35 tomato greenhouses in different geographic regions were collected from 2016 to 2018 (17 populations in 2016, 13 in 2017, and five in 2018) and analyzed to investigate their population genetic structures using eight microsatellite markers. The average number of alleles per population (NA) ranged from 2.000 to 5.875, the expected heterozygosity (HE) ranged from 0.218 to 0.600, the observed heterozygosity (HO) ranged from 0.061 to 0.580, and the fixation index inbreeding coefficient (FIS) ranged from -0.391 to 0.872 over the three years of the study. Some significant correlation (p < 0.05) was present between genetic differentiations (FST) and geographical distance, and a comparatively high proportion of variation was found among the B. tabaci MED populations. The B. tabaci MED populations were divided into two well-differentiated genetic clusters within different geographic regions. Interestingly, its genetic structures converged into one genetic cluster during just one year. The reasons for this genetic change were speculated to arise from different fitness, insecticide resistance, and insect movement by human activities."
https://openalex.org/W2964157662,"Seminal amyloid fibrils are made up of naturally occurring peptide fragments and are key targets for the development of combination microbicides or antiviral drugs. Previously, we reported that the polysulfonic compound ADS-J1 is a potential candidate microbicide that not only inhibits HIV-1 entry, but also seminal fibrils. However, the carcinogenic azo moieties in ADS-J1 preclude its clinical application. Here, we screened several ADS-J1–like analogs and found that the antiparasitic drug suramin most potently inhibited seminal amyloid fibrils. Using various biochemical methods, including Congo red staining, CD analysis, transmission EM, viral infection assays, surface plasmon resonance imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated suramin's inhibitory effects and its putative mechanism of action. We found that by forming a multivalent interaction, suramin binds to proteolytic peptides and mature fibrils, thereby inhibiting seminal fibril formation and blocking fibril-mediated enhancement of viral infection. Of note, suramin exhibited potent anti-HIV activities, and combining suramin with several antiretroviral drugs produced synergistic effects against HIV-1 in semen. Suramin also displayed a good safety profile for vaginal application. Moreover, suramin inhibited the semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI)/semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 transcytosis through genital epithelial cells and the subsequent infection of target cells. Collectively, suramin has great potential for further development as a combination microbicide to reduce the spread of the AIDS pandemic by targeting both viral and host factors involved in HIV-1 sexual transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2963204240,"Mammalian inner hair cells (IHCs) transduce sound into depolarization and transmitter release. Big conductance and voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels are responsible for fast membrane repolarization and small time constants of mature IHCs. For unknown reasons, they activate at around -75 mV with a voltage of half-maximum activation (Vhalf) of -50 mV although being largely insensitive to Ca2+ influx. Ca2+-independent activation of BK channels was observed by others in heterologous expression systems if γ subunits leucine-rich repeat-containing protein (LRRC)26 (γ1) and LRRC52 (γ2) were coexpressed with the pore-forming BKα subunit, which shifted Vhalf by -140 and -100 mV, respectively. Using nested PCR, we consistently detected transcripts for LRRC52 but not for LRRC26 in IHCs of 3-wk-old mice. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed synchronous up-regulation of LRRC52 protein with BKα at the onset of hearing. Colocalization of LRRC52 protein and BKα at the IHC neck within ≤40 nm was specified using an insitu proximity ligation assay. Mice deficient for the voltage-gated Cav1.3 Ca2+ channel encoded by Cacna1d do not express BKα protein. LRRC52 protein was neither expressed in IHCs of BKα nor in IHCs of Cav1.3 knockout mice. Together, LRRC52 is a γ2 subunit of BK channel complexes and is a strong candidate for causing the Ca2+-independent activation of BK currents at negative membrane potentials in mouse IHCs.-Lang, I., Jung, M., Niemeyer, B. A., Ruth, P., Engel, J. Expression of the LRRC52 γ subunit (γ2) may provide Ca2+-independent activation of BK currents in mouse inner hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2963331570,"Introduction Disasters can disrupt the existing health system affecting the whole population, but especially vulnerable people such as pregnant women, new mothers and their babies. Despite the global progress in maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) programmes over the years, emergency responses after a disaster are often poor. Post-disaster health promotion could play an important role in improving MNCH outcomes. However, evidence remains limited on the effect of post disaster health promotion activities in low-income countries such as Nepal. Methods This is an uncontrolled before and after study conducted in Dhading district which was severely affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The study participants were mothers who had a child in the previous 12 months. The intervention was implemented between 2016 and 2018 and included community-engagement health promotion activities where the local stakeholders and resources were mobilized. The outcome variables included: knowledge of danger signs of pregnancy, childbirth and in newborns; and behaviours including ever attending antenatal care (ANC), a minimum of four ANC sessions and having an institutional delivery. Data were analysed using chi-squared tests, independent sample t-tests and multiple logistic regression models. Results In total 364 mothers were recruited in the pre-intervention group and 377 in the post-intervention group. The post-intervention group was more likely to have knowledge of at least three danger signs in pregnancy (AOR [Adjusted Odds Ratio] = 2.96, P<0.001), at least three danger signs in childbirth (AOR = 3.8, P<0.001), and at least five danger signs in newborns (AOR = 1.56, P<0.001) compared to the pre-intervention group. The mothers in the post-intervention group were also more likely to ever attend ANC (AOR = 7.18, P<0.001), attend a minimum of four ANC sessions (AOR = 5.09, P<0.001), and have institutional deliveries (AOR = 2.56, P<0.001). Religious minority groups were less likely to have knowledge of all danger signs compared to the majority Hindu group. Mothers from poorer households were also less likely to attend four ANC sessions. Mothers with higher education were more likely to have knowledge of all the danger signs. Mothers whose husbands had achieved higher education were also more likely to have knowledge of danger signs and have institutional deliveries. Conclusion Health promotion intervention helped the disaster-affected mothers in improving the knowledge and behaviours related to MNCH. However, the vulnerable population would need more support to gain benefit from such intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2963800475,"Calreticulin (CRT) is an important molecular chaperon crucial to survival of organisms under adverse conditions. In this study, the potential roles of CRT in the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain, were investigated. Firstly, SpCRT gene expression was detected in various tissues of S. paramamosain with the highest expression found in the hepatopancreas. To evaluate potential role of SpCRT in cold adaption, sub-adult crabs were subjected to temperatures of 10, 15, 20 and 25°C and the profiles of SpCRT gene were determined in the hepatopancreas, chela muscle and gills. The results showed that the expressions of SpCRT mRNA in these tissues were significantly higher for those crabs exposed to low temperatures of 10 and 15°C as compared to those exposed to the higher temperatures, indicating SpCRT was involved in cold adaptation—probably through facilitating protein folding. When low temperature 10°C or 15°C was further combined with high and low salinity stress, the expression of SpCRT mRNA at low salinity (10 ppt) was in most cases significantly higher than that at high salinity (35 ppt), suggesting that under low temperatures, low salinity may represents a more stressful condition to the crab than high salinity. It was also shown that when crabs challenged by 10°C, Ca2+ concentration increased rapidly in the hepatopancreas and an in vitro experiment further showed that the expression of SpCRT mRNA increased concurrently with added Ca2+ concentration; these results together imply that Ca2+ probably plays a major role in low temperature signaling, which induces expression of genes related to cold adaption, such as CRT."

Austria, a central European country, has an instituted mandatory prenatal care system and therein two anemia screening tests (before end of week 16 and in weeks 25-28) are scheduled. Epidemiological data on the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women in Austria are missing.We analysed data from Styria, an Austrian federal state, to determine the prevalence of anemia diagnosed in pregnant women aged 15-45 years with at least one examination in the first and second time period using the cut-off hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 11 g/dl as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Sensitivity analyses for cut-off values with 10.5 and 7 g/dl (severe anemia) were performed. The STROBE checklist was applied for this retrospective cohort study.The study included anemia screening tests from 25,922 women during 31,429 pregnancies from 2006-2014. Anemia was diagnosed in either time period in 13.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-14.1) of pregnancies, in the first time period in 2.2% (95% CI 2.0-2.2), and in the second time period in 13.0% (95% CI 12.6-13.4). The annual age-adjusted anemia prevalence showed no change over time. Reducing the cut-off value to 10.5 g/dl resulted in an anemia prevalence in either time period of 5.6% (95% CI 5.3-5.8). The pattern of a higher prevalence in the second time period remained unchanged. Severe anemia (Hb <7 g/dl) was diagnosed in four pregnancies (0.01%).The estimated anemia prevalence of around 14% in pregnant women in Styria (Austria) is stable over the observed time window (2006-2014) and almost all are diagnosed in the second test period (in weeks 25-28). It seems that in a developed country like Austria the first examination (before week 16) is not mandatory for pregnancy care. However, in other countries where a high prevalence of anemia is common due to risk factors such as malaria and HIV, early screening in pregnancy might be very important."

Host factor SPRY domain- and SOCS box-containing protein 2(SPSB2) belongs to SPSB family, and it recruits target proteins by the SPRY domain and forms E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes by the SOCS box. As an adaptor protein, it can regulate the host’s response to infection, but little is known about whether SPSB2 plays a role in HCV replication. In the present study, we found that HCV infection significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of SPSB2 in HCVcc-infected cells. Exogenous expression of SPSB2 in hepatoma cells decreased HCV RNA and protein levels which depended on the SOCS box, while knockdown of endogenous SPSB2 increased HCV RNA and protein levels. Additionally, we demonstrated that SPSB2 interacted with HCV structural protein E1 and nonstructural protein protein 5A (NS5A) via the C-terminal portion of the SPSB2 SPRY domain. Furthermore, SPSB2 induced NS5A ubiquitination and mediated NS5A degradation.

Potential uptake rates of different financial incentives and relative importance scores of the included attributes were estimated. Included attributes and levels were: form of the incentive (cash money and different types of vouchers), value of the incentive (ranging from 15 to 100 euros), moment the incentive is received (start, halfway, after finishing the intervention) and prerequisite for receiving the incentive (registration, attendance or results at group or individual level).Prerequisites for receiving the financial incentive were the most important attribute, according to the respondents. Potential uptake rates for different financial incentives ranged between 37.9% and 58.8%. The latter uptake rate was associated with a financial incentive consisting of cash money with a value of €100 that is handed out after completing the lifestyle program with the prerequisite that the participant attended at least 75% of the scheduled meetings.The potential uptake of the different financial incentives varied between 37.9% and 58.8%. The value of the incentive does not significantly influence the potential uptake.

> “I knew how to pull my parachute cord and land safely.” 

My parents and I immigrated to the United States from Cuba when I was barely old enough to start school. Like many Cuban immigrants, I was led to believe that the only acceptable career options were doctor or lawyer. I enjoy science, so I entered college with my sights set on medicine. In the course of exploring career options in the medical field and participating in a summer research internship, I discovered the Ph.D. track, and I seized on the idea of a career in biomedical research.

A postbaccalaureate research program dampened my enthusiasm, however. I learned a lot in those 2 years, but I found the culture and expectations of biomedical research to be frustrating. Ultimately, I decided it wasn't the right career direction for me after all. I gave up on Ph.D. programs or anything related to medicine. Part of me felt that I had made the right decision. The weight of expectation had been lifted off my shoulders and I felt free for the first time in my life. At the same time, I had never felt such shame and failure. I was half sure I was being naive and ruining my life. I still loved science; would I be able to go back if I changed my mind down the road?

I was also scared—directionless and on my own in an unknown place. The postbaccalaureate program had taken me to Arizona, where the heat was stifling and the mountains were glorious—very different from my flat and swampy South Florida. I had two options: I could give in to the fear and go back to the safety of what I knew—Florida, science, academia—or I could explore the unknown.

I faced my fears. I stayed in Arizona and took a nonscience job outside my comfort zone. I began to explore the mountains around me—and I learned how afraid of heights I was. Going up was easy enough, but descending required mental gymnastics to convince myself that I wouldn't fall to my death. But the fear was nothing compared with the joy of accomplishment. I took pleasure in pushing my boundaries. I began to rock climb, and I made my first skydive.

This exploration helped prepare me for another leap: A year ago, I went back to science, starting a master's program in environmental engineering. It's not the type of graduate degree I envisioned pursuing 5 years ago. Instead, it is a culmination of many of my interests, including my consistent love of science as well as my newer passions for making the outdoors accessible to all and trying to address the disproportionate impacts of environmental problems on some communities, especially disadvantaged ones.

So far, my new path has felt like the first time I skydived: It has exceeded expectations and delivered new thrills and challenges. But the thing about fears is that they never go away. On my third skydive, I froze up on exit and cannonballed out of the plane. Hurtling through space, I thought I was going to careen straight into the propeller. All I could see was swirling blue sky. I closed my eyes, reminding myself that all that mattered was that I knew how to pull my parachute cord and land safely. The 60 seconds before my chute opened were the longest of my life, but I regained my confidence and trust in my abilities and made it down in one piece.

Some days I still feel lost. But when that happens, I listen to the voice inside me—the one that knows how to land safely on her feet. That allows me to appreciate the free fall, confident that I have the skills necessary to save myself.
