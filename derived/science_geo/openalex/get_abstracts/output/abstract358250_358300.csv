https://openalex.org/W2169773990,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping are essential to genetic mapping. There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations. Here we describe the sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) tags, which identified more than 13,000 SNPs, and mapped three traits in two model organisms, using less than half the capacity of one Illumina sequencing run. We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2058915525,"About 4% of the cells in the adult rodent brain are PDGFRA+ NG2+ glia, derived from the oligodendrocyte lineage. Rivers and colleagues constructed a transgenic mouse to fate map the PDGFRA+ glia. In the adult corpus callosum, these cells generated substantial numbers of late-myelinating oligodendrocytes. In the cortex, little late myelination was observed; instead, PDGFRA+ precursors seemed to continuously generate small numbers of projection neurons mainly in piriform cortex. Platelet-derived growth factor α receptor (PDGFRA)/NG2–expressing glia are distributed throughout the adult CNS. They are descended from oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs) in the perinatal CNS, but it is not clear whether they continue to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes or other differentiated cells during normal adult life. We followed the fates of adult OLPs in Pdgfra-creERT2/Rosa26-YFP double-transgenic mice and found that they generated many myelinating oligodendrocytes during adulthood; >20% of all oligodendrocytes in the adult mouse corpus callosum were generated after 7 weeks of age, raising questions about the function of the late-myelinating axons. OLPs also produced some myelinating cells in the cortex, but the majority of adult-born cortical cells did not appear to myelinate. We found no evidence for astrocyte production in gray or white matter. However, small numbers of projection neurons were generated in the forebrain, especially in the piriform cortex, which is the main target of the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2081837126,"The enormous complexity of the human brain ultimately derives from a finite set of molecular instructions encoded in the human genome. These instructions can be directly studied by exploring the organization of the brain's transcriptome through systematic analysis of gene coexpression relationships. We analyzed gene coexpression relationships in microarray data generated from specific human brain regions and identified modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. These modules provide an initial description of the transcriptional programs that distinguish the major cell classes of the human brain and indicate that cell type-specific information can be obtained from whole brain tissue without isolating homogeneous populations of cells. Other modules corresponded to additional cell types, organelles, synaptic function, gender differences and the subventricular neurogenic niche. We found that subventricular zone astrocytes, which are thought to function as neural stem cells in adults, have a distinct gene expression pattern relative to protoplasmic astrocytes. Our findings provide a new foundation for neurogenetic inquiries by revealing a robust and previously unrecognized organization to the human brain transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2005720817,"Memories are dynamic, rather than static, in nature. The reactivation of a memory through re-exposure to salient training stimuli results in its destabilization, necessitating a restabilization process known as reconsolidation, a disruption of which leads to amnesia. I found that one normal function of hippocampal memory reconsolidation in rats is to modify the strength of a contextual-fear memory as a result of further learning."
https://openalex.org/W2035669903,"Within their natural habitat plants are subjected to a combination of different abiotic stresses, each with the potential to exacerbate the damage caused by the others. One of the most devastating stress combinations for crop productivity, which frequently occurs in the field, is drought and heat stress. In this study we conducted proteomic and metabolic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to a combination of drought and heat stress. We identified 45 different proteins that specifically accumulated in Arabidopsis in response to the stress combination. These included enzymes involved in reactive oxygen detoxification, malate metabolism, and the Calvin cycle. The accumulation of malic enzyme during the combined stress corresponded with enhanced malic enzyme activity, a decrease in malic acid, and lower amounts of oxaloacetate, suggesting that malate metabolism plays an important role in the response of Arabidopsis to the stress combination. Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) protein and mRNA accumulated during the stress combination. When exposed to heat stress combined with drought, an APX1-deficient mutant (apx1) accumulated more hydrogen peroxide and was significantly more sensitive to the stress combination than wild type. In contrast, mutants deficient in thylakoid or stromal/mitochondrial APXs were not more sensitive to the stress combination than apx1 or wild type. Our findings suggest that cytosolic APX1 plays a key role in the acclimation of plants to a combination of drought and heat stress.

Our findings suggest that cytosolic APX1 plays a key role in the acclimation of plants to a combination of drought and heat stress. Unraveling the response of plants to environmental stress conditions is one of the key challenges facing modern biological research (1Cushman J.C. Bohnert H.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Often in the field plants have to endure a combination of different abiotic stresses such as drought and heat, drought and high light, or drought and salinity (2Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Several studies showed that the effects of prolonged drought was exacerbated by periods of high temperature, and that the combination of drought and heat had a significant effect on the productivity and growth of different plants and crops (2Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). A survey of all major U.S. weather disasters between 1980 and 2004 revealed that the damage caused by a combination of a heat wave and prolonged drought was severalfold higher than that caused by drought alone (2Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis identified several hundred Arabidopsis transcripts that specifically accumulated in response to a combination of drought and heat (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Very little overlap was found between transcripts that accumulated in Arabidopsis in response to heat or drought (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), but certain drought- or heat-response-specific transcripts were elevated by the combined stress (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that, in addition to transcripts that are specific to the stress combination, components of each independent response are activated during the stress combination (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). A dual role in drought and heat stress was proposed for at least two transcriptional regulators, MBF1 and DREB2A (4Suzuki N. Bajad S. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9269-9275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki N. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R.

A. 2006; 103: 18822-18827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). One of the stress-related transcripts that showed enhanced expression in response to the combined drought and heat stress was cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (Apx1) (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). APX1 plays a key role in regulating H2O2 levels and H2O2 signaling in plant cells (7Asada K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 601-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar, 8Apel K. Hirt H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8375) Google Scholar, 9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). APX1 is one of several APXs found in Arabidopsis; at least two of which (APX1 and APX2) are found in the cytoplasm (10Panchuk I. Volkov R.A. Schoffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Whereas APX1 mRNA can be found in many plant tissues even in the absence of any stress (11Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), APX2 mRNA is mainly observed in response to high light intensities, heat stress, or wounding (10Panchuk I. Volkov R.A. Schoffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 12Mullineaux P.M. Karpinski S. Baker N.R. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Chang C.C. Ball L. Fryer M.J. Baker N.R. Karpinski S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant J. 2004; 38: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Expression of both APX1 and APX2 depends on a signal generated by the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain in the chloroplasts (14Karpinski S. Escobar C. Karpinska B. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Despite its cytoplasmic localization, APX1 is required for the protection of chloroplasts against reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; tylAPX, thylakoid APX; ME, NADP-dependent malic enzyme; DAVID, Data base for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. and in its absence the ROS scavenging machinery in the chloroplast is significantly compromised (15Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Ascorbate peroxidases use ascorbate as a reducing agent to catalyze the conversion of H2O2 to water; in this reaction ascorbate is oxidized to monodehydroascorbate. The later is then reduced back to ascorbate by monodehydroascorbate reductase while converting NAD(P)H to NAD(P) (8Apel K. Hirt H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8375) Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested that NADPH is also required for the activity of NTRC, a plastid localized protein that contains an N-terminal thioredoxin reductase and a C-terminal thioredoxin. NTRC can reduce 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, yet another H2O2-detoxifying system (16Spinola M.C. Perez-Ruiz J.M. Pulido P. Kirchsteiger K. Guinea M. Gonzalez M. Cejudo F.J. Physiol. Plant. 2008; 133: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One source of NADPH could be the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate by NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40). The activity of a cytoplasmic ME is enhanced in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in response to NaCl, and transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the rice ME have a higher NDAPH/NADP ratio than wild type and are more tolerant to salt (17Cheng Y. Long M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2007; 29: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work we describe a proteomic and metabolic analysis of Arabidopsis plants subjected to a combination of water withholding and high temperature. Several of the proteins that accumulated in response to the combined stress were previously suggested to be involved in the response of plants to oxidative stress, including APX1. Other proteins were involved in malic acid metabolism and CO2 assimilation. A mutant lacking APX1 (9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was significantly more sensitive to the combined stress suggesting that APX1 plays a key role in regulating H2O2 levels in plants under conditions of stress combination. Plant Material—Wild-type (Col-0 or WS) and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under a 14/10 light/dark cycle (100 ;mol-2.s-1), and drought, heat, and drought and heat combination were applied as previously described (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 18Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). For heat treatment plants were transferred to 42 °C for 6, 24, or 48 h (for protein extraction or survival assays). Survival was determined following a recovery period of 72–96 h at 22 °C. For ROS measurements, plants (WS and apx1) were surface-sterilized and grown on ½MS plates, with or without 150 mm sorbitol for 5 days at 21 °C and then exposed to 42 °C for 6 h. ROS levels in seedlings were measured as described (19Song L. Ciftci-Yilmaz S. Harper J. Cushman J.C. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll levels were determined using 80% buffered acetone (20Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Analysis of microarray data obtained from Rizhsky et al. (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) were performed as described (21Miller G. Mittler R. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2006; 98: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed as described (5Suzuki N. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Relative water content was calculated as previously described (4Suzuki N. Bajad S. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9269-9275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Water potential of whole plants was measured using a WP4 Dewpoint PotetiaMeter (Decagon, Pullman, WA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteomic Analysis—Protein extraction, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, imaging and sampling of spots, and protein digestion and mass spectrometry are described in the supplemental materials. Pathway Analysis—Pathway analysis was performed using “Data base for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery” (DAVID) version 2006 (niaid.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) (22Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to discover GO categories and KEGG pathways that are significantly represented in each group. The p value cutoff for this pathway analysis was 0.01. Enzymatic Assays—Ascorbate peroxidase and malic enzyme activities were determined as described (23Mittler R. Zilinskas B.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Winter K. Foster J.G. Edwards G.E. Holtum J.A. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 300-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four-week-old seedlings were collected after 6 h of heat stress, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground using a chilled mortar and pestle. All reactions were performed at 25 °C. Enzymes were extracted in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2 (for APX) or 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (for NADP-malic enzyme). Both buffers were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Protein concentration was measured using a Bradford reagent (Sigma). Extraction and Quantification of Metabolites—Ten milligrams of freeze-dried tissue was ground using 3.2-mm chrome-steel beads in a Retsch mixer mill, followed by extraction with 500 ;l of 50:50 methanol:water spiked with 2 ;g/ml of the internal standards. After the extraction buffer was added the mixture was stirred on the Retsch mill for 1 min at 30 reps/s, sonicated for 1 min in ultrasonic bath, and incubated on dry ice for 5 min. Three cycles of sonication and dry ice incubation were carried out before spinning out the extract 15 min at 18,000 × g. Clear supernatant was transferred into limited volume high-performance liquid chromatography vials and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Extracted metabolites were measured using hydrophilic interaction LC-MS/MS as previously described (25Bajad S.U. Lu W. Kimball E.H. Yuan J. Peterson C. Rabinowitz J.D. J. Chromatogr A. 2006; 1125: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS was performed on an LC-10ADvp chromatographic system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) coupled to a mass spectrometer. LC separation was performed on a Phenomenex 250 × 2 mm Luna 5-;m aminopropyl column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Metabolite quantitation was performed using calibration curves with isotopically labeled internal standards malate-2,3,3-d3 acid and citric-2,2,4-d4 acid (CDN Isotopes, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), which were added to each sample. Commercially available pure forms of the following compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used to prepare calibration curves and estimate the amounts of each one of them in the plant extract: oxaloacetate, malate, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADP, pyruvate, lactate, glycerate 3-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, ribulose 5-phosphate, succinate, ADP, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, erytrose 4-phosphate, fructose 1,6-biphosphate, and ;-ketoglutarate. Starch content was determined as described in a previous study (26Smith A.M. Zeeman S.C. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1342-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Combination of Drought and Heat Stress in Arabidopsis—To subject Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants to a combination of drought and heat stress we used the same experimental procedure described previously (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 18Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To follow the progression of drought, we monitored the water potential and relative water content of plants. Heat stress was applied 9 days following water withdrawal. At that time the leaf water potential of drought-stressed plants was >3-fold lower than that measured for control plants (Fig. 1A). Relative water content of drought-stressed plants was also lower than that of control, well watered plants, but this difference was smaller (supplemental Fig. S1). After exposing plants to heat stress for 6 h the leaf water potential of control plants was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 1B), indicating that well watered heat-stressed plants lost water during the 6-h period. In contrast, no significant decrease was observed for the drought-stressed plants subjected to heat stress during this period (Fig. 1B), suggesting that drought-stressed plants exposed to heat stress could not benefit from the cooling effect of evaporation (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 18Rizhsky L. Liang H. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Regardless of the treatment applied, leaf water potential of all plants returned to control levels within 24 h of recovery from stress, and plants were fully recovered (data not shown). Proteomic Analysis of Plants Subjected to Drought, Heat, or a Combination of Drought and Heat—Soluble proteins from plants subjected to drought (water withholding for 9 days), heat (42 °C for 6 h), or a combination of the two, in three biological replications (for a total of 12 two-dimensional gels), were subjected to proteomics analysis as described in the supplemental materials. As indicated above, the stress treatments were not lethal to plants. In accordance, no evidence was found in our two-dimensional gel for extensive protein degradation in response to either treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). Out of 123 protein spots that accumulated in response to at least one stress, 53 spots (for a total of 45 different proteins) were found to be unique to the combined drought and heat (Fig. 1C, supplemental Tables S1 and S2). When the proteomics results obtained in this study were compared with our previous microarray study, corresponding changes in steady-state transcript levels were identified for ∼25% of the proteins (supplemental Table S2) (2Mittler R. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The differences between the microarray and proteomic data could be a result of detection threshold or differences in RNA stability and post-transcriptional regulation. It should also be noted that RNA for the microarray and proteins for the proteomics experiments were obtained from plants exposed to the different stresses in two independent experiments. As could be expected (27Baerenfaller K. Grossmann J. Grobei M.A. Hull R. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Yalovsky S. Zimmermann P. Grossniklaus U. Gruissem W. Baginsky S. Science. 2008; 320: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), low abundance proteins involved in processes such as transcriptional regulation and signaling were underrepresented (data not shown). The average size of proteins in our study was 39.7 kDa and was lower than that reported in a large scale Arabidopsis proteomics analysis (27Baerenfaller K. Grossmann J. Grobei M.A. Hull R. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Yalovsky S. Zimmermann P. Grossniklaus U. Gruissem W. Baginsky S. Science. 2008; 320: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Chloroplast proteins are over-represented in our study (16 of the 45 proteins listed in supplemental Table S2 are predicted to be chloroplast-localized proteins), suggesting that the chloroplast might be involved in many of the plants' responses to the combined stress. Accumulation of Oxidative Stress-related Proteins—Several proteins that accumulated in response to the combined stress were previously implicated in the response of plants to oxidative stress (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). These included mitochondrial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (28Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), chloroplastic chaperonin 60; (LEN1) (29Ishikawa A. Tanaka H. Nakai M. Asahi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cytosolic isoflavone reductase (30Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Belles-Boix E. Van Montagu M. Inze D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26224-26231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), allene oxide (31Stenzel I. Hause B. Miersch O. Kurz T. Maucher H. Weichert H. Ziegler J. Feussner I. Wasternack C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and cystine lyase (32Maeda H. Song W. Sage T.L. Dellapenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2710-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a germin-like protein was also induced by the combined stress. This extracellular protein has an enzymatic activity of oxalate oxidase and was suggested to be involved in generating H2O2 as part of the plants' defense pathways (33Carter C. Graham R.A. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) was yet another protein that accumulated in response to the combined stress. Although no significant accumulation of APX1 was observed under each of the independent stresses, the combined stress resulted in accumulation of APX1 (Fig. 2A). APX1 belongs to a small gene family that includes cytosolic, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and chloroplastic isozymes (34Mittler R. Vanderauwera S. Gollery M. Van Breusegem F. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 490-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). We examined therefore the accumulation of nine APX transcripts in response to the different stresses using microarray data (3Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Davletova S. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Of the nine transcripts examined, four showed a significant response to drought (APX1, -2, and -3 and stromal/mitochondrial APX; s/mAPX). In contrast, only APX1 and APX2 responded to heat stress (both accumulated). The combination of drought and heat resulted in an increased level of four transcripts (APX1, -2, -3, and -6) and reduced amounts of thylakoid APX (tylAPX; Fig. 2B). Although APX2 showed a large -fold increase in response to the different stresses (Fig. 2B), the total amounts of its transcript were low (data not shown). Interestingly, although APX4 levels decreased in response to the combined heat and drought stress (Fig. 2B) protein levels of APX4 actually increased in response to both heat and the combined stress (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 2A, total APX activity increased in response to all stresses. In general the majority of APX activity in protein extracts obtained without ascorbic acid is attributed to APX1 (35Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 36Mittler R. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21802-21807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect each treatment had on APX activity correlated with the effect it had on transcript levels and protein spot intensity for APX1 with the smallest effect being in plants exposed to heat only and the largest in plants exposed to the combined stress (Fig. 2A). In the absence of stress APX activity was low, probably because the majority of APX protein found in unstressed cells is inactive (37Mittler R. Zilinskas B.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Knock-out Apx1 Plants (apx1) Are More Sensitive to a Combination of Drought and Heat Stress—We used an Apx1-deficient Arabidopsis mutant (9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Pnueli L. Liang H. Rozenberg M. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), to further characterize the role of APX1 in the response of plants to a combination of drought and heat stress. We subjected wild-type and apx1 plants grown side-by-side in the same pots to drought, heat stress, and a combination of drought and heat stress and scored plants for survival. When wild-type and apx1 plants were exposed to a short heat stress (6 or 24 h), with or without prior water withholding, and allowed to recover, no differences were observed between wild-type and apx1 (data not shown). When we extended the heat stress period to 48 h we observed a significant reduction in the recovery of apx1 plants subjected to a combination of drought and heat stress (Fig. 3). In contrast, we did not observe a significant decrease in the recovery of wild-type plants or mutants deficient in tylAPX (tylapx; At1g77490 21), subjected to the same stress conditions (Fig. 3A). Similar to tylapx, a mutant deficient in s/mAPX (15Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) did not show enhanced sensitivity to the combined stress (data not shown). Compared with wild-type plants, apx1 plants that recovered from the combined stress had lower chlorophyll content (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that, although they survived the combined stress, their photosynthetic apparatus was affected. To test whether the enhanced sensitivity of the apx1 mutant to stress combination corresponded with accumulation of ROS we measured hydrogen peroxide in wild-type and apx1 plants subjected to heat, osmotic stress (caused by 150 mm sorbitol in the growth media, which reduced the water potential by 0.53 MPa), and a combination of heat and osmotic stress (Fig. 3B). In the absence of stress, apx1 seedlings accumulated significantly higher amounts of ROS; this is in agreement with the role of APX1 in maintaining ROS levels in the cell (15Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). When exposed to a single stress (osmotic or heat) wild-type seedlings accumulated higher amounts of ROS than non-treated seedlings, whereas apx1 seedlings had lower ROS amounts than non-treated apx1 seedlings (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that the lack of APX1 could trigger the expression of other stress-response mechanism as was previously demonstrated for apx1 during salinity stress (38Ciftci-Yilmaz S. Morsy M.R. Song L. Coutu A. Krizek B.A. Lewis M.W. Warren D. Cushman J. Connolly E.L. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9260-9268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, when exposed to a combined osmotic and heat stress apx1 seedlings accumulated higher amounts of ROS compared with wild-type suggesting that the alternative mechanisms enhanced in apx1 by the lack of APX1 were not sufficient to prevent ROS accumulation during the stress combination. The reduced ROS amounts in wild-type seedlings exposed to the combined stress compared with either individual stresses is in agreement with the accumulation of APX1 and the increase in APX activity in response to the combined stress. Accumulation of Carbon Fixation-related and Malate Metabolism Proteins—When the proteins that accumulated in response to the combined stress were superimposed on maps of different metabolic pathways we observed an accumulation of proteins involved in carbon fixation (Fig. 4). This was further emphasized when we added to the analysis proteins that were not unique to the combined drought and heat stress, but were also induced by all the stress conditions tested (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 4). Among these were enzymes involved in the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin-Benson) cycle, including fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a putative ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, and Rubisco (all located in the chloroplast). Interestingly, many of the enzymes identified were related to either C4 or CAM carbon fixation (39Cushman J.C. Bohnert H.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These included a chloroplast NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, the cytoplasmic NADP-dependent malic enzyme 2, putative alanine aminotransferase, and a cytoplasmic/mitochondrial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

The planar cell polarity genes Vangl2 and Celsr1 are essential for hair follicle polarization and orientation. Mammalian body hairs align along the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis and offer a striking but poorly understood example of global cell polarization, a phenomenon known as planar cell polarity (PCP). We have discovered that during embryogenesis, marked changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal polarization occur as nascent hair follicles become anteriorly angled, morphologically polarized and molecularly compartmentalized along the A–P axis. Hair follicle initiation coincides with asymmetric redistribution of Vangl2, Celsr1 and Fzd6 within the embryonic epidermal basal layer. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in Vangl2 and Celsr1 show that they have an essential role in hair follicle polarization and orientation, which develop in part through non-autonomous mechanisms. Vangl2 and Celsr1 are both required for their planar localization in vivo, and physically associate in a complex in vitro. Finally, we provide in vitro evidence that homotypic intracellular interactions of Celsr1 are required to recruit Vangl2 and Fzd6 to sites of cell–cell contact."
https://openalex.org/W1980718338,"The transcription factor AP-1 plays key roles in tumorigenesis, by regulating a variety of protein-coding genes, implicated in multiple hallmarks of cancer. Among non-coding genes, no AP-1 target has been described yet in tumorigenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative post-transcriptional regulators of protein-coding genes. miRNA expression signatures are highly relevant in cancer and several tumor-associated miRNAs (oncomirs) play critical roles in oncogenesis. Here, we show that the miRNA miR-21, which represents the most frequently upregulated oncomir in solid tumors, is induced by AP-1 in response to RAS. By analyzing validated miR-21 targets, we have found that the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4 are downregulated by RAS in an AP-1- and miR-21-dependent fashion. We further show that, given the role of PDCD4 as negative regulator of AP-1, the miR-21-mediated downregulation of PDCD4 is essential for the maximal induction of AP-1 activity in response to RAS. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of positive autoregulation of the AP-1 complex in RAS transformation and disclose the function of oncomirs as critical targets and regulators of AP-1 in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971411291,"NKp30, a natural cytotoxicity receptor expressed on NK cells is critically involved in direct cytotoxicity against various tumor cells and directs both maturation and selective killing of dendritic cells. Recently the intracellular protein BAT3, which is involved in DNA damage induced apoptosis, was identified as a ligand for NKp30. However, the mechanisms underlying the exposure of the intracellular ligand BAT3 to surface NKp30 and its role in NK-DC cross talk remained elusive. Electron microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrate that exosomes released from 293T cells and iDCs express BAT3 on the surface and are recognized by NKp30-Ig. Overexpression and depletion of BAT3 in 293T cells directly correlates with the exosomal expression level and the activation of NK cell-mediated cytokine release. Furthermore, the NKp30-mediated NK/DC cross talk resulting either in iDC killing or maturation was BAT3-dependent. Taken together this puts forward a new model for the activation of NK cells through intracellular signals that are released via exosomes from accessory cells. The manipulation of the exosomal regulation may offer a novel strategy to induce tumor immunity or inhibit autoimmune diseases caused by NK cell-activation."

These cells may be a valuable source in the repair of spinal cord injury.We examine the effects of HUMSC transplantation after complete spinal cord transection in rats. Approximately 5x10(5) HUMSCs were transplanted into the lesion site. Three groups of rats were implanted with either untreated HUMSCs (referred to as the stem cell group), or HUMSCs treated with neuronal conditioned medium (NCM) for either three days or six days (referred to as NCM-3 and NCM-6 days, respectively). The control group received no HUMSCs in the transected spinal cord. Three weeks after transplantation, significant improvements in locomotion were observed in all the three groups receiving HUMSCs (stem cell, NCM-3 and NCM-6 days groups). This recovery was accompanied by increased numbers of regenerated axons in the corticospinal tract and neurofilament-positive fibers around the lesion site. There were fewer microglia and reactive astrocytes in both the rostral and caudal stumps of the spinal cord in the stem cell group than in the control group. Transplanted HUMSCs survived for 16 weeks and produced large amounts of human neutrophil-activating protein-2, neurotrophin-3, basic fibroblast growth factor, glucocorticoid induced tumor necrosis factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 in the host spinal cord, which may help spinal cord repair.Transplantation of HUMSCs is beneficial to wound healing after spinal cord injury in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2141730948,"Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes synthesize nitric oxide, a signal for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations and a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations. The high active site conservation among all three NOS isozymes hinders the design of selective NOS inhibitors to treat inflammation, arthritis, stroke, septic shock and cancer. Our crystal structures and mutagenesis results identified an isozyme-specific induced-fit binding mode linking a cascade of conformational changes to a new specificity pocket. Plasticity of an isozyme-specific triad of distant second- and third-shell residues modulates conformational changes of invariant first-shell residues to determine inhibitor selectivity. To design potent and selective NOS inhibitors, we developed the anchored plasticity approach: anchor an inhibitor core in a conserved binding pocket, then extend rigid bulky substituents toward remote specificity pockets, which become accessible upon conformational changes of flexible residues. This approach exemplifies general principles for the design of selective enzyme inhibitors that overcome strong active site conservation."

Early development of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia was grossly normal in the absence of Islet1. From E12.5 onward, however, Isl1 mutant embryos showed a loss of the nociceptive markers TrkA and Runx1 and a near absence of cutaneous innervation. Proprioceptive neurons characterized by the expression of TrkC, Runx3 and Etv1 were relatively spared. Microarray analysis of Isl1 mutant ganglia revealed prolonged expression of developmental regulators that are normally restricted to early sensory neurogenesis and ectopic expression of transcription factors that are normally found in the CNS, but not in sensory ganglia. Later excision of Isl1 did not reactivate early genes, but resulted in decreased expression of transcripts related to specific sensory functions. Together these results establish a central role for Islet1 in the transition from sensory neurogenesis to subtype specification."

https://openalex.org/W2118393368,"Lafora disease is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy with onset in the teenage years followed by neurodegeneration and death within 10 years. A characteristic is the widespread formation of poorly branched, insoluble glycogen-like polymers (polyglucosan) known as Lafora bodies, which accumulate in neurons, muscle, liver, and other tissues. Approximately half of the cases of Lafora disease result from mutations in the EPM2A gene, which encodes laforin, a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase family that is able to release the small amount of covalent phosphate normally present in glycogen. In studies of Epm2a–/– mice that lack laforin, we observed a progressive change in the properties and structure of glycogen that paralleled the formation of Lafora bodies. At three months, glycogen metabolism remained essentially normal, even though the phosphorylation of glycogen has increased 4-fold and causes altered physical properties of the polysaccharide. By 9 months, the glycogen has overaccumulated by 3-fold, has become somewhat more phosphorylated, but, more notably, is now poorly branched, is insoluble in water, and has acquired an abnormal morphology visible by electron microscopy. These glycogen molecules have a tendency to aggregate and can be recovered in the pellet after low speed centrifugation of tissue extracts. The aggregation requires the phosphorylation of glycogen. The aggregrated glycogen sequesters glycogen synthase but not other glycogen metabolizing enzymes. We propose that laforin functions to suppress excessive glycogen phosphorylation and is an essential component of the metabolism of normally structured glycogen."

We show that expression of a pivotal negative regulator of T-cell function, B7-H1, correlates with PI(3) kinase activation in breast and prostate cancer patients. B7-H1-mediated immunoresistance can be attenuated by inhibitors of the PI(3) kinase pathway, and is dependent on S6K1-mediated translational regulation of B7-H1 protein. Breast and prostate carcinoma cells with activated PI(3) kinase lose the immunoresistant phenotype after treatment with B7-H1 siRNA. Conversely, breast and prostate carcinoma cells with minimal PI(3) kinase activation adopt an immunoresistant phenotype when engineered to overexpress B7-H1 protein. These observations describe a mechanism for immune escape from tumor dormancy in humans that relates to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2098435943,"Background CD44 splice variants are long-known as being associated with cell transformation. Recently, the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) was shown to be part of the signature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in colon, breast, and in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). This is somewhat in contradiction to previous reports on the expression of CD44s in HNSCC. The aim of the present study was to clarify the actual pattern of CD44 expression in head and neck epithelia. Methods Expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was analysed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies in primary head and neck tissues. Scoring of all specimens followed a two-parameters system, which implemented percentages of positive cells and staining intensities from − to +++ (score = %×intensity; resulting max. score 300). In addition, cell surface expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was assessed in lymphocytes and HNSCC. Results In normal epithelia CD44s and CD44v6 were expressed in 60–95% and 50–80% of cells and yielded mean scores with a standard error of a mean (SEM) of 249.5±14.5 and 198±11.13, respectively. In oral leukoplakia and in moderately differentiated carcinomas CD44s and CD44v6 levels were slightly increased (278.9±7.16 and 242±11.7; 291.8±5.88 and 287.3±6.88). Carcinomas in situ displayed unchanged levels of both proteins whereas poorly differentiated carcinomas consistently expressed diminished CD44s and CD44v6 levels. Lymphocytes and HNSCC lines strongly expressed CD44s but not CD44v6. Conclusion CD44s and CD44v6 expression does not distinguish normal from benign or malignant epithelia of the head and neck. CD44s and CD44v6 were abundantly present in the great majority of cells in head and neck tissues, including carcinomas. Hence, the value of CD44s as a marker for the definition of a small subset of cells (i.e. less than 10%) representing head and neck cancer stem cells may need revision."

The effects of hypoxia in tumor suppressor gene (TSG) transcription are largely unknown. Here, we investigated hypoxia-induced silencing mechanisms of RUNX3. The expression of RUNX3 was downregulated in response to hypoxia in human gastric cancer cells at the transcriptional level. This downregulation was abolished following treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) and cytosine methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), suggesting that an epigenetic regulatory mechanism may be involved in RUNX3 silencing by hypoxia. DNA methylation PCR and bisulfite-sequencing data revealed that hypoxia did not affect the methylation of RUNX3 promoter. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed increased histone H3-lysine 9 dimethylation and decreased H3 acetylation in the RUNX3 promoter following hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in the upregulation of G9a histone methyltransferase (HMT) and HDAC1; additionally, overexpression of G9a and HDAC1 attenuated RUNX3 expression. The overexpression of G9a and HDAC1, but not their mutants, inhibited the nuclear localization and expression of RUNX3. Diminished mRNA expression and nuclear localization of RUNX3 during hypoxia was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of G9a and HDAC1. This study suggests that hypoxia silences RUNX3 by epigenetic histone regulation during the progression of gastric cancer."

The current study examined the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in ischemia-induced pathological angiogenesis called neovascularization during postnatal development. IL-10 deficiency resulted in significantly reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis. In contrast to the choroicapillaris where IL-10 interferes with macrophage influx, IL-10 did not prevent anti-angiogenic macrophages from migrating to the retina in response to hypoxia. Instead, IL-10 promoted retinal angiogenesis by altering macrophage angiogenic function, as macrophages from wild-type mice demonstrated increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) compared to IL-10 deficient macrophages. IL-10 appears to directly affect macrophage responsiveness to hypoxia, as macrophages responded to hypoxia with increased levels of IL-10 and STAT3 phosphorylation as opposed to IL-10 deficient macrophages. Also, IL-10 deficient macrophages inhibited the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in response to hypoxia while wild-type macrophages failed to do so. These findings suggest that hypoxia guides macrophage behavior to a pro-angiogenic phenotype via IL-10 activated pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2041302861,"Skeletal muscle nNOSmu (neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu) localizes to the sarcolemma through interaction with the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (DAG) complex, where it synthesizes nitric oxide (NO). Disruption of the DAG complex occurs in dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies, two genetically distinct classes of muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness and increased fatigability. DAG complex instability leads to mislocalization and downregulation of nNOSmu; but this is thought to play a minor role in disease pathogenesis. This view persists without knowledge of the role of nNOS in skeletal muscle contractile function in vivo and has influenced gene therapy approaches to dystrophinopathy, the majority of which do not restore sarcolemmal nNOSmu. We address this knowledge gap by evaluating skeletal muscle function in nNOS knockout (KN1) mice using an in situ approach, in which the muscle is maintained in its normal physiological environment. nNOS-deficiency caused reductions in skeletal muscle bulk and maximum tetanic force production in male mice only. Furthermore, nNOS-deficient muscles from both male and female mice exhibited increased susceptibility to contraction-induced fatigue. These data suggest that aberrant nNOSmu signaling can negatively impact three important clinical features of dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies: maintenance of muscle bulk, force generation and fatigability. Our study suggests that restoration of sarcolemmal nNOSmu expression in dystrophic muscles may be more important than previously appreciated and that it should be a feature of any fully effective gene therapy-based intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2055456174,"Tumor hypoxia induces the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α), which in turn induces the expression of genes including VEGF to recruit new blood vessel outgrowth, enabling tumor growth and metastasis. Interference with the Hif-1 pathway and neoangiogenesis is an attractive antitumor target. The hydroxylation of Hif-1α by prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) proteins during normoxia serves as a recognition motif for its proteasomal degradation. However, under hypoxic conditions, hydroxylation is inhibited and furthermore, PHD proteins are themselves polyubiquitylated and degraded by Siah ubiquitin ligases. Our data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of the interaction between Siah and PHD proteins using a fragment derived from a Drosophila protein (phyllopod) interferes with the PHD degradation. Furthermore, cells stably expressing the phyllopod fragment display reduced upregulation of Hif-1α protein levels and Hif-1-mediated gene expression under hypoxia. In a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, the phyllopod fragment reduced tumor growth and neoangiogenesis and prolonged survival of the mice. In addition, levels of Hif-1α and its target Glut-1 are reduced in tumors expressing the phyllopod fragment. These data show, in a proof-of-principle study, that Siah protein, the most upstream component of the hypoxia pathway yet identified, is a viable drug target for antitumor therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2014068257,"Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is currently recommended as a safe smoking cessation aid for pregnant women. However, fetal and neonatal nicotine exposure in rats causes mitochondrial-mediated beta cell apoptosis at weaning, and adult-onset dysglycemia, which we hypothesize is related to progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in the pancreas. Therefore in this study we examined the effect of fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine on pancreatic mitochondrial structure and function during postnatal development. Female Wistar rats were given saline (vehicle control) or nicotine bitartrate (1 mg/kg/d) via subcutaneous injection for 2 weeks prior to mating until weaning. At 3-4, 15 and 26 weeks of age, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed, and pancreas tissue was collected for electron microscopy, enzyme activity assays and islet isolation. Following nicotine exposure mitochondrial structural abnormalities were observed beginning at 3 weeks and worsened with advancing age. Importantly the appearance of these structural defects in nicotine-exposed animals preceded the onset of glucose intolerance. Nicotine exposure also resulted in significantly reduced pancreatic respiratory chain enzyme activity, degranulation of beta cells, elevated islet oxidative stress and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to saline controls at 26 weeks of age. Taken together, these data suggest that maternal nicotine use during pregnancy results in postnatal mitochondrial dysfunction that may explain, in part, the dysglycemia observed in the offspring from this animal model. These results clearly indicate that further investigation into the safety of NRT use during pregnancy is warranted."

The FUS-DDIT3 protein induces increased expression of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-controlled gene IL8, and the N-terminal FUS part is required for this activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that FUS-DDIT3 binds the IL8 promoter. Expression studies of the IL8 promoter harboring a C/EBP–NF-κB composite site pinpointed the importance of NF-κB for IL8 expression in FUS-DDIT3-expressing cells. We therefore probed for possible interaction of FUS-DDIT3 with members of the NF-κB family. The nuclear factor NFKBIZ colocalizes with FUS-DDIT3 in nuclear structures, and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FUS-DDIT3 binds the C-terminal of NFKBIZ. We also report that additional NF-κB-controlled genes are upregulated at the mRNA level in FUS-DDIT3-expressing cell lines and they can be induced by NFKBIZ. Taken together, the results indicate that FUS-DDIT3 deregulates some NF-κB-controlled genes through interactions with NFKBIZ. Similar mechanisms may be a part of the transformation process in other tumor types carrying FUS, EWSR1 and TAF15 containing fusion oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2069269493,"Background Despite intensive insulin treatment, many patients with type-1 diabetes (T1DM) have longstanding inadequate glycaemic control. Metformin is an oral hypoglycaemic agent that improves insulin action in patients with type-2 diabetes. We investigated the effect of a one-year treatment with metformin versus placebo in patients with T1DM and persistent poor glycaemic control. Methodology/Principal Findings One hundred patients with T1DM, preserved hypoglycaemic awareness and HaemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) ≥8.5% during the year before enrolment entered a one-month run-in on placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to treatment with either metformin (1 g twice daily) or placebo for 12 months (double-masked). Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and their usual outpatient clinical care. The primary outcome measure was change in HbA1c after one year of treatment. At enrolment, mean (standard deviation) HbA1c was 9.48% (0.99) for the metformin group (n = 49) and 9.60% (0.86) for the placebo group (n = 51). Mean (95% confidence interval) baseline-adjusted differences after 12 months with metformin (n = 48) versus placebo (n = 50) were: HbA1c, 0.13% (−0.19; 0.44), p = 0.422; Total daily insulin dose, −5.7 U/day (−8.6; −2.9), p<0.001; body weight, −1.74 kg (−3.32; −0.17), p = 0.030. Minor and overall major hypoglycaemia was not significantly different between treatments. Treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions/Significance In patients with poorly controlled T1DM, adjunct metformin therapy did not provide any improvement of glycaemic control after one year. Nevertheless, adjunct metformin treatment was associated with sustained reductions of insulin dose and body weight. Further investigations into the potential cardiovascular-protective effects of metformin therapy in patients with T1DM are warranted. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00118937"

In the peripheral nervous system, menthol regulates sensory transduction by activating TRPM8 channels residing specifically in primary sensory neurons. Although behavioral studies have implicated menthol actions in the brain, no direct central target of menthol has been identified. Here we show that menthol reduces the excitation of rat hippocampal neurons in culture and suppresses the epileptic activity induced by pentylenetetrazole injection and electrical kindling in vivo. We found menthol not only enhanced the currents induced by low concentrations of GABA but also directly activated GABAA receptor (GABAAR) in hippocampal neurons in culture. Furthermore, in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, menthol enhanced tonic GABAergic inhibition although phasic GABAergic inhibition was unaffected. Finally, the structure-effect relationship of menthol indicated that hydroxyl plays a critical role in menthol enhancement of tonic GABAAR. Our results thus reveal a novel cellular mechanism that may underlie the ambivalent perception and psychophysical effects of menthol and underscore the importance of tonic inhibition by GABAARs in regulating neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000738994,"The tetraspanin CD151 forms a stoichiometric complex with integrin α3β1 and regulates its endocytosis. We observed that down-regulation of CD151 in various epithelial cell lines changed glycosylation of α3β1. In contrast, glycosylation of other transmembrane proteins, including those associated with CD151 (e.g. α6β1, CD82, CD63, and emmprin/CD147) was not affected. The detailed analysis has shown that depletion of CD151 resulted in the reduction of Fucα1–2Gal and bisecting GlcNAc-β(1→4) linkage on N-glycans of the α3 integrin subunit. The modulatory activity of CD151 toward α3β1 was specific, because stable knockdown of three other tetraspanins (i.e. CD9, CD63, and CD81) did not affect glycosylation of the integrin. Analysis of α3 glycosylation in CD151-depleted breast cancer cells with reconstituted expression of various CD151 mutants has shown that a direct contact with integrin is required but not sufficient for the modulatory activity of the tetraspanin toward α3β1. We also found that glycosylation of CD151 is also critical; Asn159 → Gln mutation in the large extracellular loop did not affect interactions of CD151 with other tetraspanins or α3β1 but negated its modulatory function. Changes in the glycosylation pattern of α3β1 observed in CD151-depleted cells correlated with a dramatic decrease in cell migration toward laminin-332. Migration toward fibronectin or static adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix ligands was not affected. Importantly, reconstituted expression of the wild-type CD151 but not glycosylation-deficient mutant restored the migratory potential of the cells. These results demonstrate that CD151 plays an important role in post-translation modification of α3β1 integrin and strongly suggest that changes in integrin glycosylation are critical for the promigratory activity of this tetraspanin. The tetraspanin CD151 forms a stoichiometric complex with integrin α3β1 and regulates its endocytosis. We observed that down-regulation of CD151 in various epithelial cell lines changed glycosylation of α3β1. In contrast, glycosylation of other transmembrane proteins, including those associated with CD151 (e.g. α6β1, CD82, CD63, and emmprin/CD147) was not affected. The detailed analysis has shown that depletion of CD151 resulted in the reduction of Fucα1–2Gal and bisecting GlcNAc-β(1→4) linkage on N-glycans of the α3 integrin subunit. The modulatory activity of CD151 toward α3β1 was specific, because stable knockdown of three other tetraspanins (i.e. CD9, CD63, and CD81) did not affect glycosylation of the integrin. Analysis of α3 glycosylation in CD151-depleted breast cancer cells with reconstituted expression of various CD151 mutants has shown that a direct contact with integrin is required but not sufficient for the modulatory activity of the tetraspanin toward α3β1. We also found that glycosylation of CD151 is also critical; Asn159 → Gln mutation in the large extracellular loop did not affect interactions of CD151 with other tetraspanins or α3β1 but negated its modulatory function. Changes in the glycosylation pattern of α3β1 observed in CD151-depleted cells correlated with a dramatic decrease in cell migration toward laminin-332. Migration toward fibronectin or static adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix ligands was not affected.

Transmembrane proteins from the tetraspanin superfamily are assembled in microdomains (referred to as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERM) 2The abbreviations used are:TERMtetraspanin-enriched microdomain(s)DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibody ) which also incorporate a number of tetraspanin-interacting receptors (e.g. integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases) (1Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). It has been shown that tetraspanins regulate the activity of the associated receptors via various mechanisms involving ligand binding, clustering, and trafficking (1Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The role of glycosylation in regulation of protein stability, folding, and dimerization and trafficking to and from the plasma membrane as well as between intracellular organelles is documented in numerous reports (4Helenius A.

Furthermore, earlier studies have shown that glycosylation of a number of transmembrane proteins, which would be later identified as tetraspanin-associated partners, regulate their functions. Glycosylation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and components of major histocompatibility class I complex is important for interactions of the proteins with their respective receptors (9Shen L. Kane K.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9502-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was found that glycosylation of H,K-ATPase β subunit, a partner for tetraspanin CD63, regulates internalization and subsequent degradation of the protein (12Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39026-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A number of reports have described that surface expression, conformation, ligand binding, dimerization, and endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor are regulated by glycosylation (13Fernandes H.

The N-linked glycan on ErbB3 prevents spontaneous heterodimerization and activation of the receptor (16Yokoe S. Takahashi M. Asahi M. Lee S.H. Li W. Osumi D. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There is a substantial body of evidence indicating that glycosylation of integrins plays a critical role in their function. Early experiments have shown that differential glycosylation of β2 integrin subunit is critical for its pairing with either αL or αM (17Dahms N.M. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13186-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altered glycosylation of β1 integrins correlated with differences in attachment of cells to fibronectin and laminin (18Oz O.K. Campbell A. Tao T.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, binding of α5β1 integrin to its ligand was decreased in cells treated with 1-deoxymannojirimycin, a compound that inhibits conversion of the high mannose to hybrid and complex glycosylated species of the protein (19Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work from various laboratories has extended these observations to other integrins, including α6β1 (20Chammas R. Veiga S.S. Travassos L.R. Brentani R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, it has been proposed that glycosylation-dependent interactions of integrins with their ligands involve gangliosides (26Hakomori S. Handa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Zheng M. Tsuruoka T. Tsuji T. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Together, α3 and β1 integrin chains have 27 potential N-linked glycosylation sites: 14 on the α3 subunit and 13 on the β1 subunit. Detailed analyses of N-glycans by mass spectrometry have revealed significant diversity of oligosaccharides that decorate α3β1 integrin purified from various cell types (22Zhao Y. Itoh S. Wang X.

Importantly, specific changes in glycosylation of α3β1 observed in tumor cells correlated with their migratory and invasive potential (25Pochec E. Litynska A. Amoresano A. Casbarra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1643: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Litynska A. Przybylo M. Ksiazek D. Laidler P. Acta Biochim.

Rajapaksa R. Kuo C.C. Haimovich J. Levy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of CD19, the region responsible for this activity was mapped to the predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic portion of the protein (30Shoham T. Rajapaksa R. Kuo C.C. Haimovich J. Levy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, modulation in the expression levels of CD82/KAI-1 affected maturation and surface expression of β1 integrin subunit in lung carcinoma cells (32Jee B.K. Lee J.Y. Lim Y. Lee K.H. Jo Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). α chains of canonical laminin-binding integrins (i.e. α3β1, α6β1/β4, and α7β1) are post-translationally cleaved in Golgi by proprotein convertases to form light and heavy chains that are held together by a single disulfide bond and β subunit (33Belkin A.M. Stepp M.A. Microsc. Res. Technol. 2000; 51: 280-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It is thought that cleavage of α subunits is required for “inside-out” activation of integrin heterodimers (34van der F.A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). There are two splice variants of the light chains described for α3 subunit, each having three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (35de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tetraspanin CD151 forms stable and highly stoichiometric complexes with α3β1, α6β1/β4, and α7β1 integrin heterodimers (36Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol.

We have also established that the direct interaction of CD151 with α3β1 is necessary but not sufficient for the modulatory activity of the tetraspanin. Finally, we provide strong evidence that changes in integrin glycosylation are important for the α3β1-dependent promigratory function of CD151.

To generate stable MDA-MB-231/CD151(–) and HeLa/CD151(–) cell lines, transfections were carried out using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) for HeLa or GeneJammer (Stratagene) for MDA-MB-231 cells. Transfected cells were selected and maintained in DMEM containing 0.5–1.0 μg/ml puromycin. CD151 knockdown was confirmed by flow cytometry analyses (COULTER Epics XL). CD151-positive and -negative populations were selected by cell sorting (BDFACSVantage SE) and confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. MDA-MB-231/CD9(–), MDA-MB-231/CD63(–), and MDA-MB-231/CD81(–) cell lines were established using the same approach.

CD151glyco(–) and 63-N-151 mutants were generated using a standard PCR approach; in CD151glyco(–) mutant, a predicted glycosylation site (Asn159) was substituted to glutamine, and in 63-N-151 mutant, the N-terminal cytoplasmic sequence of CD151 was substituted to a corresponding region of CD63. Semiconfluent cells were detached using Cell Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen), incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mouse mAb for 1 h on ice, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. Surface labeling was analyzed by flow cytometry using COULTER Epics XL. For sorting, cells were prepared as above except that all the solutions were sterilized by filtration. Cells were lysed overnight at 4 °C in 1! Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Equal amounts of protein lysates were resolved by 12! SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with appropriate primary Ab. Protein bands were visualized after subsequent incubations with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab and Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell lysates were prepared as above (except when the analysis of tetraspanin-tetraspanin association was performed) and precleared by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with agarose beads conjugated with goat anti-mouse antibodies (mIgG-beads; Sigma). Immune complexes were collected using appropriate mAbs prebound to the mIgG-beads and washed four times with the immunoprecipitation buffer. The complexes were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane, and developed with the appropriate Ab. For the analysis of α3β1-tetraspanin (other than CD151) and tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, cell lysis and immunoprecipitation was carried out in 1! Brij 96 in the presence of aforementioned inhibitors. Migration was analyzed using a standard Boyden Chamber protocol. In brief, 1–2 × 105 cells were detached using Cell Dissociation Solution (Invitrogen) and suspended in 500 μl of serum-free DMEM. Cells were subsequently added into the inner compartment of Nunc's tissue culture inserts with polycarbonate membranes (8-μm pores), the bottom sides of which were coated with 2 μg/ml Laminin-332 or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). Cells were allowed to migrate toward serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 8 h. Nonmigrated cells were removed, and nuclei of migrating cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Membranes were mounted on glass slides and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Up to seven random fields per membrane were photographed and scored using ImageJ nuclear/cell counter program. Each of the experiments was done in quadruplicates, and 2–3 independent experiments were carried out for each cell line. Protein lysate (∼100 μg) was boiled for 10 min in the presence of 0.5! SDS before deglycosylation. The denatured lysate or immunoprecipitated complexes eluted in 0.2× Laemmli buffer were deglycosylated overnight at 37 °C with either peptide:N-glycanase F in Buffer G7 or endoglycosidase H in Buffer G5 (New England Biolabs). Samples were then resolved by 12! SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with Abs for various proteins. Deglycosylation was performed in both reducing (in the presence of 40 mm dithiothreitol) and nonreducing conditions. A standard static adhesion assay (30–35 min) was carried out as previously described (55Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)carboxyfluorescein-labeled cells aliquoted into 96-well plates precoated overnight with various concentrations of laminin-332 or fibronectin. CD151 Regulates Glycosylation of α3β1 Integrin—The tetraspanin CD151 forms stoichiometric complexes with various laminin-binding integrins, including α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1. To investigate whether CD151 affects biosynthetic processing of integrins, we established two epithelial cell lines in which expression of the tetraspanin was decreased, using a specific short hairpin RNA construct (45Winterwood N.E. Varzavand A. Meland M.N. Ashman L.K. Stipp C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2707-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); MDA-MB-231/CD151(–) and HeLa/CD151(–) lines express CD151 at levels of <5! of the corresponding parental cells (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry and Western blotting have shown that down-regulation of CD151 did not affect surface and total levels of α3β1 and α6 integrins (α7β1 is not expressed in epithelial cells). Interestingly, we consistently observed that the protein band corresponding to the α3 integrin subunit runs slower in SDS-PAGE. This was particularly evident when we compared the positions of the α3 light chains. Light chains of α3 resolved as closely spaced three bands with the top, slower migrating band being more prominent in MDA-MB-231/CD151(–) than MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) cells (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the intensity of the lowest band was higher in the CD151-positive cells. The observed differences can be explained by one of the following: 1) differences in the furin-dependent cleavage; 2) differences in splicing; 3) differences in glycosylation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the mobility of α3 light chains in SDS-PAGE after the treatment of protein lysates with peptide:N-glycanase. Since peptide:N-glycanase completely removes N-linked glycans from the protein backbone, this treatment would negate both qualitative and quantitative differences in glycosylation of the integrin in CD151-positive and CD151-negative cells. Indeed, we observed comparable patterns of the α3 light chains in the peptide:N-glycanase-treated lysates from the MDA-MB-231 and HeLa pairs (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 9 and 10). To examine differences in the integrin glycosylation in more detail, we analyzed mobility of the α3 light chains after treatment with endoglycosidase H, which specifically cleaves high mannose and hybrid forms of N-linked glycans. Although all three major glycoforms of the α3 light chain were sensitive to the endoglycosidase H treatment, the products of the digestion run slower in SDS-PAGE than completely deglycosylated species (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that the light chain of the α3 integrin subunit, which has three putative glycosylation sites, is modified by both complex and hybrid/high mannose oligosaccharides. Importantly, depletion of CD151 changed relative abundance of various endoglycosidase H-resistant glycoforms in MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 7 and 8). To gain further insight into the role of CD151 in maturation of α3β1, we analyzed glycosylation of the integrin in cells treated with swainsonine and deoxymannojirimycin. These chemicals block activities of trimming glycosidases and, thereby, inhibit processing of N-linked oligosaccharides to complex (swainsonine) and hybrid/complex forms (deoxymannojirimycin). Although less pronounced, differences between CD151(+) and CD151(–) cells were still visible after treatment with either swainsonine or deoxymannojirimycin (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results demonstrated that CD151 influences glycosylation of α3β1 at the relatively early stages of the maturation process.FIGURE 2Down-regulation of CD151 changes glycosylation of α3 integrin subunit. A, cells were lysed in Triton X-100, and proteins were deglycosylated overnight with either peptide:N-glycanase F (PNG; lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10) or endoglycosidase H (EnH; lanes 5–8). Samples"
https://openalex.org/W2080502795,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been connected with cancer progression in vivo and the generation of more aggressive cancer cell lines in vitro. EMT has been induced in prostate cancer cell lines, but has previously not been shown in primary prostate cells. The role of EMT in malignant transformation has not been clarified.In a transformation experiment when selecting for cells with loss of contact inhibition, the immortalized prostate primary epithelial cell line, EP156T, was observed to undergo EMT accompanied by loss of contact inhibition after about 12 weeks in continuous culture. The changed new cells were named EPT1. EMT of EPT1 was characterized by striking morphological changes and increased invasion and migration compared with the original EP156T cells. Gene expression profiling showed extensively decreased epithelial markers and increased mesenchymal markers in EPT1 cells, as well as pronounced switches of gene expression modules involved in cell adhesion and attachment. Transformation assays showed that EPT1 cells were sensitive to serum or growth factor withdrawal. Most importantly, EPT1 cells were not able to grow in an anchorage-independent way in soft agar, which is considered a critical feature of malignant transformation.This work for the first time established an EMT model from primary prostate cells. The results show that EMT can be activated as a coordinated gene expression program in association with early steps of transformation. The model allows a clearer identification of the molecular mechanisms of EMT and its potential role in malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1996785365,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is an important regulator of cellular signaling that has been implicated in a broad range of cellular processes. Cell exposure to a wide array of growth factors, cytokines, and other cell agonists can result in a rapid and transient increase in SK activity via an activating phosphorylation. We have previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) as the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of human SK1 at Ser225, but the corresponding phosphatase targeting this phosphorylation has remained undefined. Here, we provide data to support a role for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the deactivation of SK1 through dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser225. The catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) was found to interact with SK1 using both GST-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Coexpression of PP2Ac with SK1 resulted in reduced Ser225 phosphorylation of SK1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. In vitro phosphatase assays showed that PP2Ac dephosphorylated both recombinant SK1 and a phosphopeptide based on the phospho-Ser225 region of SK1. Finally, both basal and tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated cellular SK1 activity were regulated by molecular manipulation of PP2Ac activity. Thus, PP2A appears to function as an endogenous regulator of SK1 phosphorylation.

S1P has been implicated in a broad range of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, angiogenesis, and vascular maturation (1.Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2461) Google Scholar). This diverse range of actions of S1P may be due in part to the ability of this lipid mediator to function as both an intracellular second messenger and a ligand for cell surface receptors (2.Spiegel S. Kolesnick R. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cellular S1P levels are largely controlled by the actions of sphingosine kinases, which catalyze the formation of S1P from sphingosine (3.Leclercq T.M. Pitson S.M. IUBMB Life. 2006; 58: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although low cellular levels of S1P are present under basal conditions, growth factor and other agonist stimulation of cells can result in a rapid and transient increase in S1P levels as a direct consequence of SK1 activation (4.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation state of SK1 is critical in the control of cellular S1P levels and the cellular effects of this bioactive phospholipid. A basal level of SK activity has been proposed to play a “housekeeping” role in maintaining relatively low levels of sphingosine and ceramide in the cell (5.Wattenberg B.W. Pitson S.M. Raben D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1128-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, agonist stimulation can result in a rapid and transient increase in SK1 activity, as a result of an activating phosphorylation. We have previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) as the kinases responsible for this phosphorylation, which occurs at Ser225 in human SK1 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this phosphorylation results not only in increased SK1 activity, but is also crucial for agonist-induced translocation of SK1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and subsequent oncogenic signaling by this enzyme (7.Pitson S.M. Xia P. Leclercq T.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Wattenberg B.W. Vadas M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cellular proteins is a reversible process and the transient activation/phosphorylation of SK1 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) suggests that levels of SK1 phosphorylation at Ser225 are governed by the competing actions of the protein kinases and protein phosphatases that mediate SK1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. As noted above, we have previously identified ERK1/2 as the protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of SK1 at Ser225 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Despite its likely importance in the regulation of SK1, and SK1-mediated cell signaling, the protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of this residue has, however, remained undefined. In this study we report that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) deactivates SK1 through dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser225. Materials—Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle was obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Protein phosphatase 2A1 (PP2A1) purified from bovine kidney, okadaic acid, human recombinant protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 (I-2), and fostriecin were obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, anti-HA antibody and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were obtained from Sigma. Anti-His antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PP2A antibody, recognizing the PP2A catalytic subunit, was obtained from Upstate/Millipore (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody (DM1A) to α-tubulin was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The phosphopeptide based on the SK1 phospho-Ser225 region (phospho-SK1 peptide) was synthesized by Auspep (Victoria, Australia) and had the sequence CGSKTPApSPVVVQQ, where pS denotes phospho-Ser. Protein G-Sepharose was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Generation of Expression Constructs—The generation of mammalian expression vectors for FLAG-epitope-tagged wild-type human SK1 and a truncated version of SK1 (SK1ΔCT) lacking 17 residues (368–384) at the C terminus have been previously described (9.Pitson S.M.

Human PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_002715) was amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase chain reaction from placenta cDNA with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TAGAATTCCAATGGACGAGAAGGTGTTCAC-3′ and 5′-TAGGTACCTTACAGGAAGTAGTCTGGGGT-3′. The resultant product was cloned into pCMV(HA) (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA) with EcoRI and KpnI to allow expression of N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PP2Ac in mammalian cells. To generate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PP2Ac fusion protein in bacteria, PP2Ac was also subcloned into pGEX4T2 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) following digestion with EcoRI and NotI. Human protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit (PP4c) (GenBank™ accession number BC001416) was amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase chain reaction from placenta cDNA with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TAGAATTCCCATGGCGGAGATCAGCG-3′ and 5′-TAGAATTCTCACAGGAAGTAGTCGGCC-3′. The resultant product was cloned into pCMV(HA) and pGEX4T2, with EcoRI for mammalian and bacterial expression, respectively. The HA-tagged catalytically inactive versions of PP2Ac (10.Ogris E.

DNA sequencing verified the integrity and orientation of all cloned cDNAs. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO® Invitrogen), containing 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 2 mm glutamine, 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm HEPES, penicillin (1.2 mg/ml), and streptomycin (1.6 mg/ml). Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were harvested and lysed 24 h post-transfection. For immunoprecipitations, transfected cells were lysed by sonication in a Bioruptor™ (Diagenode, NY) (4 × 25 s pulses with 25 s breaks, 200 watts) in extraction buffer composed of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Sciences). Where samples were used for coimmunoprecipitation, transfected cells were lysed in extraction buffer containing no dithiothreitol, and drawn 5 times through a 26.5-gauge needle rather than being sonicated. All lysates were clarified by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) prior to subsequent analyses. Lysates for use in in vitro phosphatase assays were prepared in a modified format, as described in detail below. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and Pulldown Analyses—GST fusion proteins were prepared and purified as described previously (12.Sutherland C.M. Moretti P.A. Hewitt N.M. Bagley C.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11693-11701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except that after growth and induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacteria were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™). For pulldown analyses, 2 μg of each fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant His-tagged SK1 protein (13.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

Protein complexes were then washed three times in extraction buffer and bound SK1 resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting via its His epitope. Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For coimmunoprecipitation analyses, lysates from transfected cells were incubated in the presence of the appropriate antibody (anti-FLAG or anti-HA) with mixing for 1.5 h at 4 °C, prior to addition of protein G-Sepharose and further incubation with mixing (1 h, 4 °C). Immunocomplexes were washed three times in extraction buffer prior to SDS-PAGE, transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting. Following incubation with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) as appropriate, an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. In Vitro Phosphatase Assays—Phosphorylase b was 32P-labeled by phosphorylase kinase to form 32P-phosphorylase a as previously described (14.Tung H.Y. Pelech S. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This labeled phosphorylase a was then used as a substrate to standardize the activities of the commercial PP1 and PP2A phosphatases via scintillation counting of 32P released, such that 1 unit of each protein phosphatase could be included in subsequent experiments. A unit of phosphatase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 nmol of 32P/min from [32P]phosphorylase a. Assays to detect endogenous phosphatase activity were performed as previously described (15.Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Ohkura H. Ferrigno P. Andjelkovic N. Shiomi K. Uemura T. Glover D.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2609-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts from cells overexpressing SK1 were incubated at 37 °C in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Tween 20) in a 10-μl total reaction volume. Phosphatase inhibitors (1 μm I-2, 1.6 μm fostriecin) were added, as specified in individual experiments. Control reactions were carried out in the presence of the relevant vehicle solutions. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer with boiling, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Dephosphorylation of SK1 was quantitated by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing phospho-Ser225 of SK1 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), with total SK1 levels assessed by anti-FLAG antibodies. Where overexpressed phosphatases were immunoprecipitated prior to use in in vitro phosphatase assays, transfected HEK293 cells were lysed by sonication in modified extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and overexpressed phosphatases were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation complexes were washed three times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) prior to use in in vitro phosphatase assays with either p-nitrophenyl phosphate (0.9 mg/ml) or phospho-SK1 peptide (625 μm) substrates, as per the manufacturer's protocols for Ser/Thr assay kit 1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA) and as described previously (16.Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Van Hooser A. Hu M.C. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sphingosine Kinase Assays—Sphingosine kinase activity was routinely determined using d-erythro-sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates, as described previously (9.Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A unit of sphingosine kinase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 pmol of S1P/min. siRNA Silencing—The siGENOME SMART pool (M-003598) targeting human PP2A catalytic subunit, α isoforms (NM_ 002715) was purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO). The Stealth universal negative control siRNA reagent and transfection reagents (Lipofectamine™ 2000 and Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX) were purchased from Invitrogen. For transfection of siRNA into HEK293 cells, Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX was used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For cotransfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA into HEK293 cells, Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 10 nm. Cells were harvested 72–96 h post-transfection and lysed as described above. Cell Fractionation—For analyses of soluble versus membrane localization of SK1, cells were lysed first by sonication as described above, but in extraction buffer containing no Triton X-100. These whole cell extracts were then clarified by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) yielding the supernatant as the soluble fraction. The cell pellets were then sonicated as above in extraction buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and clarified as above, yielding the supernatant as the membrane fraction. PP2A-family Phosphatases Dephosphorylate SK1—A number of growth factors and cytokines induce a rapid and transient activation of SK1 (4.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the case of TNFα, we have previously shown that this correlated with the rapid phosphorylation and subsequent rapid dephosphorylation of SK1 at Ser225 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Because this dephosphorylation and deactivation of SK1 suggested the importance of a protein phosphatase in SK1 regulation, we sought to establish the identity of this enzyme. To do this, we initially exploited the observation that overexpression of SK1 in HEK293 cells results in the detectable phosphorylation of this protein at Ser225 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Assay conditions were then established to follow SK1 dephosphorylation in vitro due to endogenous protein phosphatase activity. Specifically, lysates were prepared from cells overexpressing SK1 and incubated under conditions that permitted phosphatase activity. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody that specifically detects phospho-Ser225 of SK1 (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) revealed a noticeable decrease in phospho-SK1 levels over time, while levels of total SK1 protein remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). Human Ser/Thr-specific phosphatases can be grouped into five broad classes, comprising the PP1, PP2/4/6, PP3, PP5, and PP7 subfamilies (17.Cohen P.T. Philp A. Vazquez-Martin C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the PP1 and PP2/4/6 subclasses have been reported to contribute most of the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity in cells (18.Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PP2A is by far the best-characterized member within the PP2/4/6 subclass, given that its catalytic, structural, and regulatory subunits have been sequenced and identified, and its susceptibility to inhibition by compounds such as okadaic acid and fostriecin is well known (19.Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Although the related PP4 and PP6 proteins are known to be similarly susceptible to active site inhibitors (20.Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30503-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), considerably less is known about their component subunits. Using the conditions we established to follow SK1 dephosphorylation, we assessed the relative contributions to this activity from endogenous PP1- and PP2A-family phosphatases, given that these are known to constitute the majority of cellular phosphatase activity. In order to distinguish between these phosphatase subclasses, we included I-2 and fostriecin in the assay, which are selective inhibitors of the PP1- and PP2A-family phosphatases, respectively. Fostriecin displayed noticeable inhibition of SK1 dephosphorylation under these conditions, whereas I-2 showed no such effect (Fig. 1B), supporting a role for the PP2A-family phosphatases, but not PP1-family phosphatases, in regulating levels of phospho-SK1. Direct Association of PP2Ac and Recombinant SK1—The previous assays demonstrated that PP2A activity reduced phospho-SK1 levels in cell lysates, but did not demonstrate a direct interaction between the proteins. To address whether PP2A exerted direct or indirect effects on phospho-SK1 levels, we prepared the catalytic subunit of PP2A as a GST fusion protein (GST-PP2Ac) and used this in pulldown analyses with purified recombinant human SK1 generated in insect cells (13.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49545-49553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We found that this purified recombinant SK1 specifically associated with GST-PP2Ac, but not GST alone (Fig. 2), indicating a direct interaction between PP2Ac and SK1. To reinforce the role of PP2A in SK1 dephosphorylation, we examined the ability of commercial preparations of PP1 and PP2A to dephosphorylate purified recombinant SK1 (13.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

Johnson K.R. Obeid L.M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43030-43038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting to detect levels of phospho-SK1 indicated that PP2A treatment resulted in substantial SK1 dephosphorylation, while, in contrast, PP1 had no effect on phospho-SK1 levels (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PP2A-treated recombinant SK1 demonstrated reduced catalytic activity in vitro (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with observations that phosphorylation of SK1 at Ser225 correlates with an increase in the activity of the protein (6.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and thus dephosphorylation of this site results in reduced SK1 activity. Coimmunoprecipitation of PP2Ac and SK1—The GST pulldown analysis above indicated that protein complexes of SK1 and PP2Ac could form in vitro. Next, we investigated whether similar protein complexes could form within cells by performing coimmunoprecipitation analysis using lysates from HEK293 cells coexpressing HA-tagged PP2Ac and FLAG-tagged SK1. We found that PP2Ac could be detected in SK1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A), and additionally, SK1 was detected in equivalent PP2Ac immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that the catalytic subunit of PP2A could interact with SK1 protein not only in vitro, but also in a more physiologically relevant cellular context. Role of the Pro-rich C Terminus of SK1 in Regulation by PP2Ac—Thus far, our data indicated a direct interaction between SK1 and PP2Ac, but did not highlight the binding interface(s) between these proteins. It seemed most likely that the PP2A catalytic subunit would interact with the phospho-Ser225 motif of SK1, given that its activity was directed toward this region of the protein. However, it seemed likely that other regions of the protein might also participate in the interaction, given previous reports of the interactions of the related PP2A-family member, PP4, and its substrates. The PP4 substrate hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, an upstream activating kinase in the pathway leading to c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, binds PP4c through a Pro-rich region in its C terminus (23.Zhou G. Boomer J.S. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49551-49561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because SK1 also possesses a Pro-rich C-terminal region (13.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49545-49553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate its significance for the SK1-PP2Ac interaction. For these studies, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with PP2Ac and a truncated version of SK1, lacking the 17 extreme C-terminal residues, which constitutes the Prorich region (SK1ΔCT) (Fig. 5A). We found that while PP2Ac coimmunoprecipitated with both SK1 and SK1ΔCT, the amount of PP2Ac detected in SK1ΔCT immunoprecipitates was substantially reduced (Fig. 5B). This prompted us to examine whether this reduced interaction with PP2Ac also had implications for the levels of phosphorylated SK1ΔCT in cells. We found that similar to wildtype SK1, coexpression of PP2Ac reduced levels of SK1ΔCT phosphorylated at Ser225 (Fig. 5C). Strikingly, however, in the absence of PP2A coexpression, the basal levels of Ser225 phosphorylation were found to be considerably higher for SK1ΔCT compared with wild-type SK1 (Fig. 5C). In light of the reduced amount of PP2Ac detected in SK1ΔCT immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B), it is possible that this could result from a reduced ability of this mutant to interact with endogenous PP2A. Taken together, these results suggest that while the Pro-rich C terminus of SK1 is not essential for the interaction with PP2Ac, it may contribute to both the affinity of the PP2Ac-SK1 interaction and also the ability of PP2Ac to dephosphorylate SK1 at Ser225. Implications of PP2A Activity for Cellular Phospho-SK1 Levels—Thus far, our overexpression studies strongly suggested that PP2A regulated cellular levels of phospho-SK1. We next performed complementary experiments using a catalytically inactive form of PP2A, given that the use of such a dominant-negative is a more physiological tool than overexpression of an active phosphatase. Thus, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with SK1 and catalytically inactive forms of either PP2Ac, or the related PP4c (PP2AcR89A or PP4cR236L, respectively). Immunoblotting analysis on these cell lysates for phospho-SK1 indicated that PP2AcR89A expression resulted in hyperphosphorylation of SK1 compared with the control cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, coexpression of PP4cR236L had no effect on cellular phospho-SK1 levels (Fig. 6A). This again supported a role for PP2A in the regulation of SK1 phosphorylation, rather than its related family members, such as PP4. To further confirm this finding, we expressed PP2Ac and the related PP4c in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated the active phosphatases, and assessed their activities toward a phosphopeptide substrate based on the phospho-Ser225 region of SK1 (phospho-SK1 peptide) using an in vitro assay measuring phosphate release. PP2Ac dephosphorylated the phospho-SK1 peptide, whereas PP4c had no noticeable activity toward the substrate (Fig. 6B), despite both protein phosphatases displaying activity against a generic substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 6B). Notably, even when 3.5-fold more PP4c was used in these assays, dephosphorylation of the phospho-SK1 peptide substrate remained undetectable, while activity toward the pNPP substrate increased proportionately (data not shown). Thus, it appeared that PP2Ac, but not the related PP4c, had the ability to directly dephosphorylate the phospho-SK1 peptide. These results were in keeping with the above coexpression studies, and provided further evidence supporting a role for PP2A, rather than the related PP4, in regulating cellular levels of phospho-SK1. PP2A Mediates Deactivation of SK1 following TNFα Stimulation—Although our findings indicated a role for PP2A activity in SK1 regulation, all cellular experiments thus far relied on ectopic expression of SK1 and PP2Ac. We next chose to investigate the potential for PP2A to participate in the regulation of SK1 phosphorylation in"

We performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis to document the interactions taking place among different 4q35 markers. We found that the reduced number of D4Z4 repeats in FSHD myoblasts was associated with a global alteration of the three-dimensional structure of the 4q35 region. Indeed, differently from normal myoblasts, the 4qA/B marker interacted directly with the promoters of the FRG1 and ANT1 genes in FSHD cells. Along with the presence of a newly identified transcriptional enhancer within the 4qA allele, our demonstration of an interaction occurring between chromosomal segments located megabases away on the same chromosome 4q allows to revisit the possible mechanisms leading to FSHD."
https://openalex.org/W2137888287,"Bone resorption by osteoclasts is thought to promote the proliferation of prostate cancer cells disseminated to the skeleton (Mundy, 2002). Using a mouse model of experimental metastasis, we found that although late-stage metastatic tumors were indeed surrounded by osteoclasts, these cells were spatially unrelated to the small foci of cancer cells in early-stage metastases. This is the first evidence that survival and growth of disseminated prostate cancer cells immediately after their extravasation may not depend on osteoclast involvement. Interestingly, prostate cancer cells expressing the α-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRα) progress during early-stages of skeletal dissemination, whereas cells expressing lower levels or lacking this receptor fail to survive after extravasation in the bone marrow. However, non-metastatic cells acquire bone-metastatic potential upon ectopic overexpression of PDGFRα. Finally, functional blockade of human PDGFRα on prostate cancer cells utilizing a novel humanized monoclonal antibody—soon to undergo phase-II clinical trials—significantly impairs the establishment of early skeletal metastases. In conclusion, our results strongly implicate PDGFRα in prostate cancer bone tropism through its promotion of survival and progression of early-metastatic foci, providing ground for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or containing the initial progression of skeletal metastases in patients affected by prostate adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2074746922,"The misfolding and self-assembly of proteins into amyloid fibrils that occurs in several debilitating and age-related diseases is affected by common components of amyloid deposits, notably lipids and lipid complexes. We have examined the effect of the short-chain phospholipids, dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) and dihexanoylphosphatidylserine (DHPS), on amyloid fibril formation by human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II). Micellar DHPC and DHPS strongly inhibited apoC-II fibril formation, whereas submicellar levels of these lipids accelerated apoC-II fibril formation to a similar degree. These results indicate that the net negative charge on DHPS, compared with the neutrally charged DHPC, is not critical for either the inhibition or activation process. We also investigated the mechanism for the submicellar, lipid-induced activation of fibril formation. Emission data for fluorescently labeled apoC-II indicated that DHPC and DHPS stimulate the early formation and accumulation of oligomeric species. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments using a new fluorescence detection system identified a discrete lipid-induced tetramer formed at low apoC-II concentrations in the absence of significant fibril formation. Seeding experiments showed that this tetramer was on the fibril-forming pathway. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments established that this tetramer forms rapidly and is stabilized by submicellar, but not micellar, concentrations of DHPC and DHPS. Several recent studies show that oligomeric intermediates in amyloid fibril formation are toxic.

Our results indicate that lipids promote on-pathway intermediates of apoC-II fibril assembly and that the accumulation of a discrete tetrameric intermediate depends on the molecular state of the lipid. Amyloid fibrils are formed by the self-assembly of naturally occurring proteins that misfold and aggregate into structures that share a number of common properties. The defining characteristics include increased β-structure compared with the native form of the protein, a fibrillar cross-β-morphology, and the ability to interact with the dyes thioflavin T and Congo Red (1.Sipe J.D. Cohen A.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The presence of specific fibrils in amyloid deposits associated with common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, has drawn considerable attention to the factors that affect amyloid fibril formation and the role of these fibrils in disease. Several factors within amyloid plaques exert effects on fibril formation, including metal ions, glycosaminoglycans, and proteins, such as serum amyloid P and apolipoprotein E (2.Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One important factor is the presence of lipids and lipid complexes, which are common components of all amyloid deposits.

Lipid bilayers composed of negatively charged phosphatidylserine or other anionic phospholipids accelerate amyloid fibril formation by several proteins relative to control neutral lipids (6.Zhao H.

ApoC-II is a normal component of very low density lipoproteins, where it plays an important physiological role as an activator of lipoprotein lipase. In the absence of lipids and under physiological conditions, apoC-II readily self-associates to form twisted ribbon-like fibrils with all of the hallmarks of amyloid (12.Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E.

However, in the presence of low concentrations of lipid complexes, apoC-II slowly forms amyloid fibrils, albeit with a distinctly different rodlike morphology compared with the twisted ribbon morphology of lipid-free apoC-II fibrils (18.Griffin M.D. Mok M.L.

To investigate the role of individual lipid molecules, we explored the effects of the model short-chain phospholipid dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) on apoC-II amyloid fibril formation (18.Griffin M.D. Mok M.L.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These studies showed that apoC-II amyloid fibril formation is accelerated by submicellar levels of DHPC but strongly inhibited by micellar DHPC (18.Griffin M.D. Mok M.L. Wilson L.M. Pham C.L.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results indicated that individual lipid molecules play an important role in amyloid fibril self-assembly. The initial aim of our study was to compare the activating effects of submicellar concentrations of the neutral phospholipid, DHPC, with the structurally related negatively charged phospholipid, dihexanoylphosphatidylserine (DHPS). Interest in the structural details of intermediates involved in amyloid fibril formation arises from the postulate that small oligomeric species mediate the disease-related effects of amyloid fibrils (20.Kirkitadze M.D. Bitan G. Teplow D.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 21.Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). However, a major difficulty in defining these species is the low steady-state concentrations of intermediates in amyloid fibril-forming pathways. Studies on the kinetics of fibril formation generally indicate a distinct lag phase attributed to a slow nucleation event that provides the seed for subsequent fibril elongation. Our recent studies of the size distribution of apoC-II fibrils and concentration dependence of apoC-II fibril formation led to the development of a reversible kinetic model involving an initial nucleation event followed by elongation, coupled with fibril breaking and joining (23.Binger K.J. Pham C.L. Wilson L.M. Bailey M.F. Lawrence L.J. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 1116-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Within the limits of our analysis, the size of the amyloidogenic nucleus involved in apoC-II amyloid fibril formation could not be unequivocally assigned. The recent development of a new fluorescence detection system for the analytical ultracentrifuge (24.MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) afforded a unique opportunity to explore the existence of stable populations of oligomeric intermediates formed at low apoC-II concentrations where fibril formation does not occur. Using this approach, in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that submicellar levels of DHPC and DHPS promote the rapid formation of a stable tetramer that is on the pathway for amyloid fibril formation. Materials—DHPS and DHPC were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and Alexa488 C5 maleimide and Alexa594 C5 maleimide were obtained from Invitrogen. ApoC-II was expressed and purified as described previously (12.Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Purified apoC-II stocks were stored in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, at a concentration of ∼45 mg/ml. ApoC-IIS61C was provided by Dr. Chi Pham (University of Melbourne). ApoC-IIS61C was conjugated with Alexa dyes, as described by the product manual. Briefly, the sample was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of Alexa488 or Alexa594 C5 maleimide for 90 min at room temperature. Free Alexa maleimide was removed by gel filtration with a G25 Sephadex column (GE Healthcare). The labeling efficiency was determined spectrophotometrically, assuming molar extinction coefficients of Alexa488 at 495 nm of 71,000 m -1 cm-1, Alexa594 at 590 nm of 95,000 m-1 cm-1, and apoC-II at 280 nm of 11,000 m-1 cm-1. Labeling efficiencies were typically >95%, and labeled samples were stored as a 1.8 mg/ml stock at -20 °C in 5 m GdnHCl. Aliquots of phospholipid in chloroform (2 mg/ml) were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas and used to prepare aqueous solutions by the addition of the required buffer. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the unlabeled short-chain phospholipids was determined using Rayleigh light scattering measurements, as described previously (25.Edwards K. Chan R.Y. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13304-13311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ApoC-II Amyloid Fibril Formation—ApoC-II was refolded by dilution to 0.3 mg/ml from a stock solution into refolding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.4). ApoC-II amyloid fibril formation was monitored by taking sample aliquots, in triplicate, at selected time points and determining the change in thioflavin T (ThT; 10 μm) fluorescence intensity measured in an fmax fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with 444-nm excitation and 485-nm emission filters. A centrifuge-based assay was also used to monitor the rate of Alexa488 apoC-II assembly into amyloid fibrils. Labeled apoC-II was refolded in refolding buffer, and residual GdnHCl was removed using an NAP5 desalting column (GE Healthcare). At intervals, 100-μl aliquots were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 rpm (350,000 × g) in an OptimaMax centrifuge using a TL-100.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The pellet was washed with refolding buffer and dissolved in 100 μl of 5 m GdnHCl. The emission spectrum of the sample was recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog-τ 2 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) using an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and collecting the emission over the range 495-700 nm using a 495-nm long pass filter. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were made using an Aviv model 62 DS CD spectrometer (Aviv Associates Inc., Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C with a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette, a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm, a signal averaging time of 2 s, and a data interval of 0.5 nm. The spectra presented are the average of two duplicates and corrected using a reference solution lacking apoC-II. Data were analyzed using CDPro (26.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar). Time Course of Alexa488-labeled ApoC-II Fluorescence—Refolded Alexa488-labeled apoC-II in the presence or absence of lipids was transferred to a 96-well fluorescence plate, and 30 μl of mineral oil was layered on top of each sample to reduce evaporation. The fluorescence emission and anisotropy of the samples was measured using a Paradigm fluorescence plate reader (Beckman Coulter Instruments) equipped with 485-nm excitation and 538-nm emission filters. Control experiments showed that oil overlay did not affect the lipid-induced fluorescence changes of the Alexa488-labeled apoC-II. Sedimentation Analysis—Sedimentation experiments were conducted using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Instruments), an An-Ti60 rotor, and double-sector 12-mm path length cells containing sapphire windows and charcoal-filled epon centerpieces. A fluorescence detection system (FDS; Aviv Biomedical) was used to monitor the fluorescence of labeled apoC-II derivatives. The FDS uses a 488-nm frequency doubled 13-milliwatt solid state laser and confocal optics to excite a small spot in the solution column. The emission is directed through a 505-nm cut-off filter and into a photomultiplier tube for signal digitization (24.MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data for Alexa488-labeled apoC-II were obtained at 20 °C using a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm (200,000 × g). Fluorescence data were collected at 1-min intervals from 6 to 7.25 cm with the excitation laser focused at a spot 20 μm in diameter, 31 μm below the surface of the sapphire window. Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected using the FDS attachment for samples of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II and rotor speeds of 26,000 and 38,000 rpm (54,500 × g and 116,000 × g, respectively). Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using the c(s) program SEDFIT 9.4 (27.Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and maximum entropy regularization to convert the experimental data into a continuous size distribution. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed assuming a noninteracting species model using the SEDPHAT program (28.Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—Emission spectra of samples, in triplicate, containing a 1:4 mixture of Alexa488- and Alexa594-labeled apoC-II in the presence of a range of DHPS concentrations were recorded on an SPEX Fluorolog-τ 2 spectrofluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm (2-nm bandwidth) and collecting the emission intensity over the range 495-750 nm with a 495-nm long pass filter. Seeding of Amyloid Fibril Formation—ApoC-II (50 μg/ml) was incubated in refolding buffer in the presence or absence of 10 mm DHPS. At 15-min intervals, 100 μl of these solutions were withdrawn and diluted with buffer (1.9 ml) containing freshly refolded apoC-II (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml), and the rate of fibril formation was monitored using the ThT assay. The Effect of DHPC and DHPS on ApoC-II Fibril Formation—The time course for apoC-II fibril formation in the presence of various concentrations of DHPC and DHPS was monitored by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1). In the absence of added phospholipid, ThT fluorescence increased with a small but discernable lag phase, as previously reported (23.Binger K.J. Pham C.L. Wilson L.M. Bailey M.F. Lawrence L.J. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 1116-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The addition of submicellar DHPC (5 and 10 mm) increased the rate of fibril formation, whereas micellar DHPC inhibited fibril formation, consistent with previous studies (18.Griffin M.D. Mok M.L. Wilson L.M. Pham C.L. Waddington L.J. Perugini M.A. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19.Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The addition of the negatively charged derivative, DHPS, gave similar results; DHPS at concentrations of 5 and 10 mm accelerated the rates of apoC-II fibril formation, whereas 20 mm DHPS inhibited fibril formation. In view of the potential for the negative charge on DHPS to affect ThT fluorescence measurements, we also conducted a centrifugal pelleting assay using Alexa488-labeled apoC-II. The results show similar trends with low concentrations of DHPC and DHPS accelerating fibril formation and high concentrations causing inhibition. Electron microscopy confirmed that the morphologies of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II fibrils and fibrils formed in the presence of DHPS were similar to unlabeled apoC-II fibrils (supplemental material). The kinetic data for fibril formation were fitted empirically to a three-parameter Hill equation (solid lines) to obtain estimates for the time to reach half-maximal fibril formation (t50), as shown previously (29.Hatters D.M. Minton A.P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The rates of fibril formation, expressed as the reciprocal of t50, are plotted in Fig. 1. The ThT data show maximum rate increases for DHPC and DHPS of ∼7- and 10-fold, respectively, whereas the data for the pelleting assay show corresponding increases of 2.5- and 4.5-fold. Comparison of the results for DHPC and DHPS indicates that the negative charge on DHPS, compared with DHPC, does not exert a major effect on the rate of apoC-II fibril formation. The Micellar State of DHPC and DHPS—To further interpret the DHPC and DHPS-mediated effects, we examined the micellar state of these lipids. Critical micelle concentrations of DHPC and DHPS were estimated using light scattering measurements. Two distinct linear phases in light scattering for the two phospholipids were observed (Fig. 2). The breakpoints in the two phases provide estimates of 10.1 and 15.2 mm for the CMCs of DHPC and DHPS, respectively. The value obtained for DHPC is in good agreement with previous estimates obtained under similar conditions (30.Atcliffe B.W. MacRaild C.A. Gooley P.R. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31.Tausk R.J. Karmiggelt J. Oudshoorn C. Overbeek J.T. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The increase in the CMC for DHPS compared with DHPC is consistent with the higher concentrations of DHPS required to attain the maximum increase in the rate of apoC-II fibril formation (Fig. 1). NMR spectroscopy, sedimentation equilibrium, and microcalorimetry data indicate that DHPC micelle formation proceeds via the formation of a dimeric intermediate (30.Atcliffe B.W. MacRaild C.A. Gooley P.R. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32.Johnson R.E. Wells M.A. Rupley J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4239-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out to provide a more complete analysis of the micellar state of DHPS (Fig. 2). The results obtained for DHPS were incompatible with a simple monomer-micelle equilibrium but were consistent with a monomer-dimer-micelle equilibrium. Global fits using this model (solid lines), with assigned values for the molecular weights of the DHPS monomer and dimer, yielded best fit values for the molecular mass of the DHPS micelle (17,700 Da) and the equilibrium constants for the interactions. This allowed the concentration of the three species to be calculated as a function of DHPS concentration (Fig. 2). The results confirm a CMC for DHPS of ∼15 mm and a concentration-dependent increase in the dimeric intermediate over the 0-15 mm range. These results may be compared with those reported for DHPC, where the dimer concentration increases over the 0-10 mm range and the CMC is ∼10 mm (30.Atcliffe B.W. MacRaild C.A. Gooley P.R. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data closely follow the activation profiles for DHPC and DHPS on apoC-II fibril formation. Circular Dichroism of ApoC-II—The effect of DHPC and DHPS on the secondary structure of apoC-II was examined by CD spectroscopy. These experiments were carried out using freshly refolded apoC-II (50 μg/ml) under conditions where fibril formation is negligible. DHPS increased the negative ellipticities in the 205-240 nm region, indicative of an increase in secondary structure (Fig. 3). Analysis of the data, assuming the presence of α, β, and random structure, allowed the proportions of these elements to be determined as a function of DHPS concentration. Submicellar concentrations of DHPS increased the proportion of β-structure relative to α-structure, whereas micellar concentrations of DHPS promote increased α-structure. Similar changes in apoC-II secondary structure were also observed with DHPC with an increase in the proportion of β-structure over the concentration range 0-10 mm DHPC and subsequent increase in α-structure in the presence of micellar DHPC (results not shown). The increase in α-structure induced by micellar DHPC and DHPS is consistent with the predominantly α-helical structures determined for apoC-II in lipid micelles (16.MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5414-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17.MacRaild C.A. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8084-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Alexa488-labeled ApoC-II—A continuous, fluorescence-based assay using Alexa488-labeled apoC-II was developed to provide more detailed information on the kinetics of fibril formation. Fluorescence spectra for both freshly refolded and fibrillar Alexa488-labeled apoC-II show characteristic maxima at 520 nm (Fig. 4). The fluorescence intensity of freshly refolded apoC-II is ∼2-fold higher than the fibrillar form, demonstrating that the Alexa488 probe is quenched upon fibril formation. The addition of 10 mm DHPS to freshly refolded and fibrillar Alexa488-labeled apoC-II resulted in an increase in the 520-nm emission. DHPC also increased the fluorescence intensity of freshly refolded and fibrillar Alexa488-labeled apoC-II (supplemental material). Control experiments showed that DHPS and DHPC had no effect on the fluorescence intensity of free Alexa488 dye. The sensitivity of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II fluorescence to fibril formation provided a convenient and continuous assay for fibril formation. Time-dependent changes in Alexa488-labeled apoC-II fluorescence emission and anisotropy under fibril-forming conditions (0.3 mg/ml) were monitored in the absence and presence of DHPS (Fig. 4). In the absence of phospholipid, there was a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity and a coincident increase in fluorescence anisotropy corresponding to fibril formation. In contrast, the time-dependent changes in fluorescence emission for Alexa488-labeled apoC-II in the presence of 10 mm DHPS showed complex kinetics with an initial very rapid increase in fluorescence intensity within the dead time of the measurement. This fluorescence increase was accompanied by a similar rapid increase in fluorescence anisotropy (dotted lines). These immediate rapid changes were followed by a time-dependent biphasic response. This involved an increase in intensity over a period of 1-2 h with no significant change in anisotropy, followed by a dominant decrease in fluorescence intensity and increase in anisotropy, corresponding to fibril formation. The complex fluorescence kinetics observed under these conditions indicated the accumulation of lipid-induced intermediates. The nature of the lipid-induced intermediate(s) was examined by determining the biphasic fluorescence profile as a function of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II concentration in the presence of 10 mm DHPS (Fig. 5). Over the concentration range of 50-400 μg/ml apoC-II, all samples showed an initial increase in fluorescence intensity. Samples with apoC-II concentrations of >100 μg/ml showed a subsequent decrease attributable to fibril formation, whereas, for the 50 μg/ml sample, the initial increase in fluorescence intensity reached a plateau value with no subsequent decrease, consistent with the observation that fibrils are not formed at this concentration. A similar concentration dependence of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II fluorescence emission was also observed with 5 mm DHPC, showing biphasic responses at apoC-II concentrations of >100 μg/ml and a plateau value obtained at 50 μg/ml (supplemental material). Analysis of the increase in fluorescence intensity of Alexa488-labeled apoC-II concentration in the presence of 10 mm DHPS over the first 1 h showed that the initial rate of change was independent of apoC-II concentration (Fig. 5). Sedimentation Velocity Analysis—The data in Figs. 4 and 5 provide evidence for a stable, lipid-induced species that forms at 50 μg/ml Alexa488-labeled apoC-II in th"
https://openalex.org/W2121312618,"In nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) the FMN can exist as the fully oxidized (ox), the one-electron reduced semiquinone (sq), or the two-electron fully reduced hydroquinone (hq). In NOS and microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase the sq/hq redox potential is lower than that of the ox/sq couple, and hence it is the hq form of FMN that delivers electrons to the heme. Like NOS, cytochrome P450BM3 has the FAD/FMN reductase fused to the C-terminal end of the heme domain, but in P450BM3 the ox/sq and sq/hq redox couples are reversed, so it is the sq that transfers electrons to the heme. This difference is due to an extra Gly residue found in the FMN binding loop in NOS compared with P450BM3. We have deleted residue Gly-810 from the FMN binding loop in neuronal NOS (nNOS) to give ΔG810 so that the shorter binding loop mimics that in cytochrome P450BM3. As expected, the ox/sq redox potential now is lower than the sq/hq couple. ΔG810 exhibits lower NO synthase activity but normal levels of cytochrome c reductase activity. However, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the cytochrome c reductase activity of ΔG810 is insensitive to calmodulin binding. In addition, calmodulin binding to ΔG810 does not result in a large increase in FMN fluorescence as in wild-type nNOS. These results indicate that the FMN domain in ΔG810 is locked in a unique conformation that is no longer sensitive to calmodulin binding and resembles the “on” output state of the calmodulin-bound wild-type nNOS with respect to the cytochrome c reduction activity.

Flavin-containing (FMN or FAD) enzymes catalyze a wide range of reactions and can be classified, according to their functions and reactivity with molecular oxygen, into oxidases, monooxygenases, dehydrogenases, oxidoreductases, and electron transferases (1.Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The versatility of flavoprotein-catalyzed reactions is attributed to the rich chemistry of the flavin isoalloxazine ring system. Free flavin can exist in three different redox states: oxidized (ox), 3The abbreviations used are: ox, oxidized; sq, semiquinone; hq, hydroquinone; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase; CaM, calmodulin; CPR, microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase.3The abbreviations used are: ox, oxidized; sq, semiquinone; hq, hydroquinone; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase; CaM, calmodulin; CPR, microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase. one-electron reduced semiquinoid (sq), and two-electron reduced hydroquinoid (hq) species (3.Ghisla S.

The semiquinone radical can have two forms depending on whether or not the N5 atom is protonated (5.Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anionic semiquinone is red, whereas the neutral semiquinone is blue, each with its own distinct UV-visible absorption features (6.Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The negative charge on the anionic form of the semiquinone or hydroquinone is localized on the N1–C2=O group (3.Ghisla S. Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potentials of the ox/sq and sq/hq couples are -314 mV and -124 mV, respectively, for free FMN (7.Anderson R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although the FMN redox potentials and the pKa of N5 can vary dramatically from one flavoprotein to another. It is the variations of flavin-protein interactions in different flavoproteins that give rise to the versatility of flavin redox properties tailored to the specific chemical reaction catalyzed by the particular flavoenzyme (2.Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before being identified as a heme-containing enzyme (8.McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 9.White K.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) was first recognized as a flavoprotein (11.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 12.Hevel J.M. White K.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22789-22791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of rat neuronal NOS shares high sequence identity with microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) that also contains one molecule each of FMN and FAD. The catalytic center, heme group, and a nearby cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, reside in the N-terminal domain. The biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is carried out by binding of the substrate, l-arginine (l-Arg), on the distal side of heme where one of the guanidino nitrogen atoms of l-Arg is oxidized to give NO in a two-step reaction with Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine as an intermediate and citrulline as a byproduct (13.Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Raman C.S. Martasek P. Masters B.S.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 293-339Google Scholar). Reaction 1 requires molecular oxygen and NADPH-supplied reducing equivalents. Similar to CPR, electron flow in the NOS reductase domain starts from NADPH, through FAD to FMN. The FMN in NOS forms an air-stable, blue neutral semiquinone. Only the lower potential hydroquinone of FMN is capable of transferring electrons to heme. In addition, electron transfer in NOS is regulated by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to a linker peptide between the heme- and flavin-containing domains. The activity of both endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS (nNOS) is, therefore, regulated by the Ca2+-CaM binding to the enzyme (15.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16.Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NOS has its two functional domains fused into a single polypeptide. This domain architecture is similar to that seen in cytochrome P450BM3, a well characterized bacterial P450 system isolated from Bacillus megaterium (17.Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6683-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal reductase domain of P450BM3 highly resembles the mammalian microsomal CPR, its FMN exhibits very different redox properties. Based on kinetic and anaerobic redox titration studies, Sevrioukova et al. (18.Sevrioukova I. Shaffer C. Ballou D.P. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7058-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) determined that the one-electron reduced FMN semiquinone in P450BM3 is a transient, red anionic form rather than the air-stable, blue neutral radical seen in mammalian CPR. The FMN hydroquinone is the more stable, high potential species, thus incapable of reducing the heme. The red anionic FMN semiquinone instead plays the role of the lower potential species donating electrons to the P450 heme. The presence of the anionic flavin semiquinone is also detected by EPR (19.Murataliev M.B. Klein M. Fulco A. Feyereisen R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8401-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Redox potential measurements (20.Hanley S.C. Ost T.W. Daff S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) confirmed that the ox/sq is indeed the lower potential couple at -240 mV compared with -160 mV for the sq/hq couple. The reversal of FMN redox properties of P450BM3 compared with NOS and CPR was expected to derive from some major differences in the FMN binding environment between P450BM3 and mammalian CPR. The crystal structure of P450BM3 heme/FMN bidomain (21.Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) shed some light on this puzzle, as shown in Fig. 2. In P450BM3 the FMN binding loop is one-residue shorter with the backbone amide of Asn-537 donating a hydrogen bond to N5 of FMN. In flavodoxins and microsomal CPR a carbonyl in the longer loop can accept a H-bond from the protonated N5 of FMN upon reduction thereby stabilizing the blue neutral semiquinone. This carbonyl becomes available through a reduction-dependent peptide flip within the loop consistently observed in several flavodoxins from various organisms (22.Hoover D.M. Drennan C.L. Metzger A.L. Osborne C. Weber C.H. Pattridge K.A. Ludwig M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 725-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23.Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24.Watt W. Tulinsky A. Swenson R.P. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The shorter loop in P450BM3 makes this peptide flip very unlikely. Thus the proton from the protein amide nitrogen would remain in place in the semiquinoid state, which decreases the pKa of the FMN N5 (8.5 in free FMN, Fig. 1) making the protonation of N5 difficult. The FMN-binding environment in nNOS resembles that in mammalian CPR, because the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly-810 in the longer FMN binding loop can accept a H-bond from the N5 of FMN (Fig. 2). When the structure of the FMN binding loop in P450BM3 is superimposed onto that of nNOS the similarities of both the amino acid compositions and their backbone conformations are apparent even though the loop is one residue shorter in P450BM3. To test whether the redox behavior of FMN in nNOS can mimic that in P450BM3 by making a shorter FMN binding loop, we have made the Gly-810 deletion mutant of nNOS (ΔG810) in three constructs: full-length, heme/FMN bidomain, and FMN domain. The redox potentials of FMN have been determined with both the heme/FMN bidomain and the isolated FMN domain (with CaM bound). The enzymatic activities of NO synthesis, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction of the full-length mutant were compared with the wild-type protein. Materials—The QuikChange mutagenesis kit was ordered from Stratagene. Hemoglobin A0 (reduced), cytochrome c (horse heart), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were purchased from Sigma. Redox mediators, benzyl viologen, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and anthraquinone 2-sulfonate were from Sigma-Aldrich. All the other biochemical reagents were either from Fisher, VWR, or Calbiochem. Protein Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—Both the full-length rat nNOS (residues 1–1429) (25.Li H. Shimizu H. Flinspach M. Jamal J. Yang W. Xian M. Cai T. Wen E.Z. Jia Q. Wang P.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the heme/FMN bidomain (residues 299–955) (26.Li H. Igarashi J. Jamal J. Yang W. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) constructs have an N-terminal 6-His tag as described previously. The construct of the FMN domain consisting of residues 720–955 was cloned into the same pCWori vector through the NdeI and XbaI sites, thus it also has an N-terminal 6-His tag before the CaM binding motif. The ΔG810 mutant of nNOS was cloned in Escherichia coli strain DH5α using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. The wild-type full-length, heme/FMN bidomain, and FMN domain proteins were used as the templates for PCR to generate the deletion for the three different constructs, respectively. The Gly-810 deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmids. The protein expression protocol for the full-length mutant is identical to that for the wild-type protein (25.Li H. Shimizu H. Flinspach M. Jamal J. Yang W. Xian M. Cai T. Wen E.Z. Jia Q. Wang P.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13868-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using BL21(DE3) as the expression host. However, the mutant protein yields of the heme/FMN bidomain and the FMN domain were found to be higher when they were co-expressed with CaM in E. coli strain JM109 with the cell growth conditions similar to that described for the expression of the bidomain in BL21(DE3) (26.Li H. Igarashi J. Jamal J. Yang W. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

The FMN domain protein was purified through three column steps: Ni-Sepharose, HiTrap Q anion exchange, and Superdex 75 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare). The buffer for equilibrating the Ni-Sepharose column was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm FMN, and 200 mm NaCl. The same buffer plus 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A and leupeptin was used for cell resuspension before the cell rupture through a microfluidizer at a pressure of 18,000 p.s.i. The cell-free extract obtained after a 1-h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g was loaded onto the nickel column. The wild-type FMN domain protein bound to the nickel column often showed a blue color due to its air-stable semiquinone, whereas the ΔG810 mutant FMN domain exhibited a bright orange color. After sample loading the column was washed with 5 bed volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The protein elution was achieved by 10 bed volumes of 20–150 mm imidazole gradient. The peak fractions were often in good purity and, once being concentrated to a small volume, could be directly loaded onto a S75 column. Some side fractions did need to be further purified through an anion exchange column prior to the S75 column. One or two 5-ml HiTrap Q columns was(were) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 μm FMN, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions from the nickel column were diluted 2-fold with the salt-free phosphate buffer before loading onto the Q column using a peristaltic pump. After sample loading the Q column was connected to an AKTA system (GE Healthcare), being further washed with 5 bed volumes of phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl before the protein elution with 20 bed volumes of 100–350 mm NaCl gradient. The same sodium phosphate buffer with 200 mm NaCl was the running buffer for the Superdex 75 column (2.6 × 30 cm). The flow rate was set at 1 ml/min, and the fraction size was 1 ml. The colored fractions with an absorbance ratio A280 nm/A456 (A280 nm/A468 for the mutant) of < 5.0 were pooled and concentrated, stored at -80 °C. The concentration of FMN domain protein was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 9.8 mm-1 cm-1 (18.Sevrioukova I. Shaffer C. Ballou D.P. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7058-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) at 456 nm for the wild-type and 468 nm for the mutant. Calmodulin—The human CaM expression plasmid, pACYC/trc-hCaM, was a generous gift from Dr. Paul Ortiz de Montellano's laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco. The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid and plated on LB agar containing 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 ml of LB overnight culture. The large scale terrific broth cultures with chloramphenicol were inoculated with a small overnight starter (1:500) and grown at 37 °C with 220 rpm agitation until the A600 nm reached ∼0.8. The protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the incubation continued for another 20 h at 30 °C and 100 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min and then washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl before storage at -80 °C. The protocol for phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was modified from the one in the literature (27.Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pastes were resuspended with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by microfluidizer. The cell-free extract was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and loaded onto a small phenyl-Sepharose column (2.6 × 4.0 cm, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the same Tris buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of Tris buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The protein was then eluted with 100 ml of CaCl2-free Tris buffer containing 5 mm EGTA. The fractions with strong UV absorption at 280 nm were pooled and concentrated. The excess EGTA was removed by passing the purified CaM through a 10-DG de-salting column (Bio-Rad). The concentration of CaM was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 2.98 mm-1 cm-1 at 280 nm based on the chromophore content (28.Pace C. Stankovich M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2516-2522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homemade CaM was as efficient as the commercial protein purchased from Sigma in supporting NOS activity. Spectro-potentiometric Titrations—Redox titrations were carried out in a cuvette that was assembled in an anaerobic glove box (COY Laboratory Products, Inc., Grass Lake, MI). The cuvette was sealed with an air tight septum through which the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the gold working electrode, and gas-tight Hamilton syringe were inserted. A small magnetic stir bar was placed at the bottom of the cuvette to mix the reagents. The temperature was maintained at ∼25 °C. The titration buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl) was made anaerobic by flushing with ultrapure argon while stirring. The final experimental volume was 1.3 ml with an optical density = 1.0 near the main FMN visible band (near 450 nm). The following typical redox mediators were used: benzyl viologen (-374 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-145 mV), and anthraquinone 2-sulfonate (-230 mV) to a final concentration of 2 μm each. All the potentials here are reported against standard hydrogen electrode. The protein and mediator mixtures were deoxygenated under the flow of argon gas for several minutes. The protein was reduced by addition of a small excess of anaerobically prepared sodium dithionite solution (concentration was determined using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ315 = 8.05 mm-1 cm-1). The reduced protein spectrum was recorded to confirm complete reduction. The redox titration was done using Dutton's method (29.Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). A small aliquot of oxidant/reductant was added, and the solution was stirred until equilibration (stabilization of the potential) was reached (∼15–20 min), and then the spectrum (350–800 nm) was recorded using a Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The titration was continued until the sample solution was maximally oxidized by ferricyanide. The reverse electrochemical titration was done with dithionite as the reductant. The electrochemical potential was monitored using an Orion pH/mV meter (Model SA 720) coupled to a gold electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. The gold electrode was modified using 4,4′-dithiodipyridine. The electrode system was calibrated using the ferrous-ferric ammonium sulfate couple (+675 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode). The observed potential was obtained relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Hence, they were corrected (using the calibration data for the ferrous-ferric ammonium sulfate solution) to values relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Analysis of Absorbance versus Potential Data—Data analysis was done using Origin (OriginLab). For the FMN domain of the wild-type nNOS, the absorbance changes at wavelengths 456 nm and 590 nm were plotted against the measured potential of the gold electrode. 456 nm and 590 nm are the absorption maximum of the oxidized flavin and semiquinone, respectively. For the ΔG810 mutant FMN domain, there is no neutral semiquinone peak at 590 nm. Hence, the absorbance changes at 391, 408, and 468 nm were plotted against the measured potential and fit to the modified Nernst equation (Equation 1). This equation is for a two electron redox process where a, b, and c are the absorbance values of oxidized flavin, flavin semiquinone, and hydroquinone, respectively. E is the potential at the working electrode, and E1 and E2 are the midpoint potentials of the oxidized/semiquinone (ox/sq) and the semiquinone/hydroquinone (sq/hq) redox couples. All these five variables are determined by least-squares fitting. A=a+b×10E-E159+c×10E-E159×10E-E2591+10E-E159+10E-E159×10E-E259(Eq. 1) For the ΔG810 bidomain, which has both the FMN and heme domain, the absorbance changes at wavelengths 553 nm, 650 nm (heme components show maximum spectral change), 478 nm, and 501 nm (approximate FMN absorption maxima) were plotted against the measured potential and fit to another modified Nernst equation (Equation 2) for a three-electron redox process where one is an independent redox couple. In the Equation 2, a, b, and c are the absorbance values of oxidized flavin, flavin semiquinone, and hydroquinone, respectively, and d and f are the absorbance values of oxidized heme and reduced heme. E is the potential at the working electrode and E1, E2, and E3 are the midpoint potentials of the ox/sq, sq/hq, and heme redox couples. All these eight variables are determined by least-square fitting. A=a+b×10E-E159+c×10E-E159×10E-E2591+10E-E159+10E-E159×10E-E259+d×10E-E359+f10E-E359+1(Eq. 2) FMN Reduction Monitored by Stopped Flow—The reduction of FMN in the FMN domain of ΔG810 was monitored under anaerobic conditions using an SX.18MV-R stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). The 100 mm Tris/HCl buffers (100 mm NaCl) at three pH values, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0, were degassed by alternating between evacuation and purging with pure argon. The air-tight 2.5-ml syringes were assembled inside a COY glove box. Syringe A was filled with nNOS FMN domain and syringe B with dithionite solution (concentration of dithionite was calibrated by cytochrome c reduction immediately before usage). Each syringe was then connected to a three-way stopcock so that another 5-ml syringe filled with Tris buffer can be connected to each sample syringe. Two pairs of syringes were then brought out of the glove box and attached to the stopped flow apparatus. The optical cell and drive syringes were flushed with the degassed buffer before experiments. The spectral changes as a function of time upon rapid mixing of 11 μm FMN domain protein and ∼300 μm dithionite were monitored by the photodiode array detector by obtaining 400–500 spectra for 1000 s in the range of 350–700 nm. The baseline was set with the buffer containing dithionite only. Single wave-length kinetic traces (50 s per trace) were obtained by mixing 18.5 μm FMN domain and ∼1 mm dithionite at 391 nm for the formation of red anionic FMN semiquinone and its further reduction to hydroquinone, and at 468 nm for the entire 2-electron reduction process. The pseudo first order rate constants were extracted by fitting of the single wavelength scan curves with a single or double exponential equation using the Igor Pro program. Steady-state Enzymatic Activity Assays—All steady-state enzymatic activity assays were performed at room temperature on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer (Varian) in an absorbance versus time kinetic scanning mode. The heme protein content of the full-length nNOS was determined using an extinction coefficient of 75 mm-1 cm-1 for the absorbance difference ΔA444–490 nm when enzyme was reduced by dithionite and with CO bound (10.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Turnover numbers are expressed as nanomoles of product formed/min/nmol of heme enzyme. Enzyme concentration was adjusted to maintain a linear absorbance change in the first 2–3 min of the reaction. The NO synthesis activities for both the wild-type and ΔG810 mutant were measured using the hemoglobin capture assay (31.Murphy M.E. Noack E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The absorption increase at 401 nm was monitored within 1 min at room temperature using an extinction coefficient of 38 mm-1 cm-1 to estimate the amount of methemoglobin generated. The buffer components for the assay include 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 μm oxy-hemoglobin, 10 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml SOD, 5 μm FMN, 5 μm FAD, 25 μm l-Arg, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 μg/ml CaM, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 μm NADPH. 1 μg of the wild-type nNOS or 5 μg of mutant was added last to start the reaction. The NADPH oxidation assay was performed in the same phosphate buffer with the exception that 100 μm l-Arg and 250 μm NADPH were used and hemoglobin was omitted. The absorption decrease at 340 nm was tracked at room temperature for 1 min using 6.2 mm-1 cm-1 as the extinction coefficient. 5 μg of wild-type or 10 μg of mutant enzyme was used for each reaction to improve the signal to noise ratio. The cytochrome c reduction assay was conducted with 40 μm cytochrome c in the same phosphate buffer except that hemoglobin, catalase, SOD, l-Arg, and tetrahydrobiopterin were omitted. The absorbance increase at 550 nm was monitored for 1 min with 21 mm-1 cm-1 as the extinction coefficient. To achieve a stable linear trace only 0.1 μg of wild-type or mutant enzyme was needed for each reaction. Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements of both the wild-type and mutant full-length enzymes were carried out at room temperature on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The flavin (mainly FMN) fluorescence signal was excited at 450 nm and recorded from 470 to 650 nm. Two buffer systems were tested, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, or 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The changes of fluorescence intensity with 6.5 μm (wild-type) or 6.0 μm (ΔG810) of enzymes in a 100-μl cuvette were recorded twice within 3–4 min. The effects of CaM binding and removal to the fluorescence intensity change were monitored by adding 20 μm CaM plus 0.5 mm CaCl2 and then 10 mm EGTA, respectively. The total volume change was kept at <5%. The changes in fluorescence intensity were found to be ionic strength-dependent. The 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 100 mm KCl was found to be a better buffer with which the fluorescence signals were more stable with time. Titration of nNOS Wild-type FMN Domain—The redox titrations were done using Dutton's method (29.Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The proteins were initially reduced and then oxidized using small aliquots of potassium ferricyanide and then reduced with dithionite. After each addition of oxidant/reductant, equilibration was confirmed by observing a stable potential at the electrode. No hysteresis was observed during the oxidative and reductive cycle of the redox titrations. A representative spectrum of the redox titration of the nNOS wild-type FMN domain is given in Fig. 3A. The protein was completely soluble and stable during the redox titrations. The spectrum of the fully oxidized FMN domain of the wild-type has a maximum at 456 nm. When reduction proceeds from the oxidized to the semiquinone form, the intensity of the band at 590"
https://openalex.org/W2051490501,"Fonsecaea pedrosoi is the principal etiologic agent of chromoblastomycosis, a fungal disease whose pathogenic events are poorly understood. Current therapy for chromoblastomycosis is suboptimal due to toxicity of the available therapeutic agents and the emergence of drug resistance. Compounding these problems is the fact that endemic countries and regions are economically poor.In the present work, we have investigated the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) peptidase inhibitors (PIs) on the F. pedrosoi conidial secreted peptidase, growth, ultrastructure and interaction with different mammalian cells. All the PIs impaired the acidic conidial-derived peptidase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, in which nelfinavir produced the best inhibitory effect. F. pedrosoi growth was also significantly reduced upon exposure to PIs, especially nelfinavir and saquinavir. PIs treatment caused profound changes in the conidial ultrastructure as shown by transmission electron microscopy, including invaginations in the cytoplasmic membrane, disorder and detachment of the cell wall, enlargement of fungi cytoplasmic vacuoles, and abnormal cell division. The synergistic action on growth ability between nelfinavir and amphotericin B, when both were used at sub-inhibitory concentrations, was also observed. PIs reduced the adhesion and endocytic indexes during the interaction between conidia and epithelial cells (CHO), fibroblasts or macrophages, in a cell type-dependent manner. Moreover, PIs interfered with the conidia into mycelia transformation when in contact with CHO and with the susceptibility killing by macrophage cells.Overall, by providing the first evidence that HIV PIs directly affects F. pedrosoi development and virulence, these data add new insights on the wide-spectrum efficacy of HIV PIs, further arguing for the potential chemotherapeutic targets for aspartyl-type peptidase produced by this human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2130713463,"There is a pressing need for better methods to analyze specific proteins in a high-throughput manner. Current approaches involve studying only a few markers at a time. Here Kattah and his colleagues describe a new technology for multiplexed protein detection called high-throughput immunophenotyping using transcription (HIT). Use of this multianalyte, antibody-based protein array platform is demonstrated for profiling cytokines in serum, intracellular signaling molecules and cell surface markers. We have developed a multianalyte fluid-phase protein array technology termed high-throughput immunophenotyping using transcription (HIT). This method employs a panel of monoclonal antibodies, each tagged with a unique oligonucleotide sequence that serves as a molecular bar code. After staining a sample, T7 polymerase amplifies the tags, which are then hybridized to a DNA microarray for indirect measurement of each analyte. Although there are many potential applications for this technology, here we report its suitability for profiling cytokines, intracellular molecules and cell surface markers. Using HIT, we profiled 90 surface markers on human naive T helper cells activated in vitro. The markers identified in this screen are consistent with previously described activation markers and were validated by flow cytometry. Additionally, a HIT screen of surface markers expressed on T helper cells activated in the presence of transforming growth factor-β identified downregulation of CD26 in these cells. HIT arrays are an ideal platform for rapidly identifying markers for further characterization and therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2011735044,"Efforts in phylogenomics have greatly improved our understanding of the backbone tree of life. However, due to the systematic error in sequence data, a sequence-based phylogenomic approach leads to well-resolved but statistically significant incongruence. Thus, independent test of current phylogenetic knowledge is required. Here, we have devised a distance-based strategy to reconstruct a highly resolved backbone tree of life, on the basis of the genome context networks of 195 fully sequenced representative species. Along with strongly supporting the monophylies of three superkingdoms and most taxonomic sub-divisions, the derived tree also suggests some intriguing results, such as high G+C gram positive origin of Bacteria, classification of Symbiobacterium thermophilum and Alcanivorax borkumensis in Firmicutes. Furthermore, simulation analyses indicate that addition of more gene relationships with high accuracy can greatly improve the resolution of the phylogenetic tree. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of highly resolved phylogenetic tree with extensible gene networks across all three domains of life. This strategy also implies that the relationships between the genes (gene network) can define what kind of species it is."
https://openalex.org/W2032472881,"Background The typical Western diet is not balanced in methyl nutrients that regulate the level of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its derivative metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which in turn may control the activity of certain methyltransferases. Feeding rodents with amino acid defined and methyl-imbalanced diet decreases hepatic SAM and causes liver cancers. RIZ1 (PRDM2 or KMT8) is a tumor suppressor and functions in transcriptional repression by methylating histone H3 lysine 9. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that a methyl-balanced diet conferred additional survival benefits compared to a tumor-inducing methyl-imbalanced diet only in mice with wild type RIZ1 but not in mice deficient in RIZ1. While absence of RIZ1 was tumorigenic in mice fed the balanced diet, its presence did not prevent tumor formation in mice fed the imbalanced diet. Microarray and gene expression analysis showed that, unlike most of its related enzymes, RIZ1 was upregulated by methyl-balanced diet. Methyl-balanced diet did not fully repress oncogenes such as c-Jun in the absence of RIZ1. Higher RIZ1 activity was associated with greater H3 lysine 9 methylation in RIZ1 target genes as shown by chromatin immunoprecipiation analysis. Conclusions/Significance The data identify RIZ1 as a critical target of methyl-balanced diet in cancer prevention. The molecular understanding of dietary carcinogenesis may help people make informed choices on diet, which may greatly reduce the incidence of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2034671809,"Immunohistochemical staining of tissues is a powerful tool used to delineate the presence or absence of an antigen. During the last 30 years, antigen visualization in human brain tissue has been significantly limited by the masking effect of fixatives. In the present study, we have used a new method for antigen retrieval in formalin-fixed human brain tissue and examined the effectiveness of this protocol to reveal masked antigens in tissues with both short and long formalin fixation times. This new method, which is based on the use of citraconic acid, has not been previously utilized in brain tissue although it has been employed in various other tissues such as tonsil, ovary, skin, lymph node, stomach, breast, colon, lung and thymus. Thus, we reported here a novel method to carry out immunohistochemical studies in free-floating human brain sections. Since fixation of brain tissue specimens in formaldehyde is a commonly method used in brain banks, this new antigen retrieval method could facilitate immunohistochemical studies of brains with prolonged formalin fixation times."
https://openalex.org/W2155264814,"Myocardin (MYOCD) is a transcriptional co-activator that promotes cardiac or smooth muscle gene programs through its interaction with myocyte-enhancing factor (MEF2) or serum-response factor (SRF). Isoforms of MYOCD with a truncated amino terminus show increased activity when compared with those with the full-length amino terminus, but how this is achieved remains unknown. We identified a rare human sequence variation in MYOCD in a patient with congenital heart disease that resulted in a missense mutation at codon 259 (K259R). This variation created a hypomorphic cardiac isoform with impaired SRF binding and transactivation capacity but did not impair the smooth muscle isoform of MYOCD, which lacks the amino terminus. Consistent with differential effects of the amino terminus on the K259R mutation, we found that the cardiac-specific amino terminus acted in an autoinhibitory fashion to bind MYOCD via specific negatively charged residues and thereby repressed SRF-dependent MYOCD activity. This effect was exaggerated in the MYOCD-K259R mutant. The amino terminus was sufficient to impair MYOCD-dependent fibroblast conversion into smooth muscle cells as well as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Although MYOCD is constitutively nuclear, its MHD contains a binding site for myocyte-enhancing factor 2 (MEF2), which activates portions of the cardiac gene program that are distinct from the SRF-dependent program (11Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MYOCD truncations that lack the MHD show increased SRF-dependent transactivation both in vitro (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) and in vivo (13Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), but how this is achieved is unknown. Multiple transcription factors interact with and synergistically regulate the MYOCD transcriptional complex on DNA. The Jagged/Notch signal transduction pathway is able to inhibit MYOCD-dependent SRF-co-activation via HRT2, a transcriptional repressor, during smooth muscle differentiation (14Proweller A. Pear W.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8994-9004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Depending on the context, the GATA4/5/6 family of transcription factors is able to either activate or inhibit MYOCD-dependent transactivation (15Oh J. Wang Z. Wang D. Lien C. Xing W. Olson E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8519-8528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another MYOCD regulator is ELK1, which is necessary for SRF-dependent induction of MYOCD-independent immediate early genes (13Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The SRF-binding motifs in MYOCD and ELK1 show strong homology to one another, and ELK1 utilizes this motif to compete with MYOCD for SRF (13Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In this way, ELK1 is able to deactivate some MYOCD target genes in favor of growth over differentiation (13Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although these and other transcription factors are known to synergistically regulate MYOCD-dependent activity, it is unknown whether there are mechanisms that act directly on MYOCD to regulate the SRF interaction or how the MHD-dependent decrease in MYOCD activity occurs. Here, we describe how a rare human MYOCD missense mutation, resulting in a lysine to arginine substitution at codon 259 (K259R), revealed a novel mechanism by which MYOCD activity is regulated. The mutation, which occurred in a subject with thickened pulmonary valves, resulted in a hypomorphic cardiac MYOCD, but did not affect activity of the smooth muscle MYOCD lacking the MHD. In exploring how the MHD influenced the K259R effects, we found that the amino terminus regulated MYOCD activity in an autoinhibitory fashion by binding to MYOCD and disrupting SRF-dependent activation. The MYOCD K259R mutant showed a more pronounced response to the autoinhibitory activity of the MHD. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of MYOCD activity in cardiac versus smooth muscle. Plasmid Construction—FLAG-MYOCD truncations, atrial natriuretic factor-luciferase (ANF-Luc), and smooth muscle 22α-luciferase (SM22α-Luc) have been described (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). MHD truncations were created by PCR amplification of MYOCD cDNA with added 5′ end NotI and 3′ end XbaI restriction enzyme sites. K259R, R71R115 → AA, and D130E135 → AA were mutated with the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Primer sequences are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cos-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and passaged as described (16Zhao Y. Ransom J.F. Li A.

Transfections were carried out in 12-well dishes unless otherwise indicated. Cells were transfected with 50 ng of each reporter plasmid and 100 ng of each cDNA for 40-44 h and harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Total amounts of DNA were kept constant with corresponding expression vector without a cDNA insert. A CMV-LacZ plasmid was co-transfected for internal transfection efficiency control (1Wang D.

Western analysis was performed for all transfected proteins to ensure equal expression. Luciferase assays were performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor3 plate reader as described (16Zhao Y. Ransom J.F. Li A. Vedantham V. von Drehle M. Muth A.N. Tsuchihashi T. McManus M.T. Schwartz R.J. Srivastava D. Cell. 2007; 129: 303-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). CH310T1/2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and passaged as described, except that the plates were coated with 1! gelatin for 30 min before passaging (17Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Pipes G.C. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2! horse serum. Seven days later, immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time (RT) PCR (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems) were performed. For each experiment, 500 ng of each cDNA was used for each well of a six-well plate. A CMV-eGFP plasmid (100 ng, Amaxa) was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected and counted double-blind. Conversion efficiency was calculated as the number of SM-α-actin-positive cells divided by the number of green fluorescent protein-positive cells. Primary cardiomyocytes were harvested from 0-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described (18Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cardiomyocytes were enzymatically separated with 1 μg/ml pancreatin, plated on 0.1! gelatin-coated dishes, and infected 1 day later with lentivirus (pLenti6 Gateway System, Invitrogen) overexpressing protein under control of the EF1 promoter. Twenty-four hours later, phenylephrine (PE) was added to the medium (final concentration, 20 μm.) Forty-eight hours after infection, immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR were performed. Area calculations of the α-actinin-positive cells were made using the Image-Pro 5.0 software; control cells without PE were set at an arbitrary value of 100, and then each condition was set proportionate to the control cells. Cardiomyocyte infection and area calculations were performed double-blind. Quantitative RT-PCR—Whole RNA was purified with TRI Reagent (Applied Biosystems), treated with DNA-free DNase (Ambion), and synthesized into cDNA with poly(dT) primers (Superscriptase III kit, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed with Applied Biosystems 2× master mix and TaqMan primers (see supplemental Table S1) as described (16Zhao Y. Ransom J.F. Li A. Vedantham V. von Drehle M. Muth A.N. Tsuchihashi T. McManus M.T. Schwartz R.J. Srivastava D. Cell. 2007; 129: 303-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. Protein Interaction Assays—Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and electromobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). For Co-IP, 1 μg of FLAG-MYOCD and 100 ng of hemagglutinin-tagged SRF were transfected and harvested 40 h later. For EMSA, protein was translated from 1 μg of each plasmid with the Promega TnT kit. An oligonucleotide containing the c-fos CArG box (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) was 32P-labeled with the Roche Applied Science high prime labeling kit. Quantification of the binding efficiency was made using the ImageJ v1.4 software. Immunocytochemistry and Western Blot—Immunocytochemistry and Western analysis were performed as described (16Zhao Y. Ransom J.F. Li A. Vedantham V. von Drehle M. Muth A.N. Tsuchihashi T. McManus M.T. Schwartz R.J. Srivastava D.

Antibodies were diluted as follows: mouse anti-SM-α-actin (Sigma), 1:1000; mouse anti-α-actinin (Sigma), 1:200; mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) 1:5000 (Western) or 1:500 (immunocytochemistry); and mouse anti-Myc (9a7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used for Western analysis (Jackson Immunologicals). A Unique MYOCD Sequence Variant in a Patient with a Congenital Cardiac Malformation—In a genetic screen of subjects with congenital cardiovascular malformations, 3V. Garg and D. Srivastava, unpublished data. we found an adenosine-to-guanosine sequence variant in the gene encoding MYOCD (GenBank™ accession number AF532596) that resulted in an arginine substitution for a highly conserved lysine at codon 259 (A776G, supplemental Fig. 1 A). This Hispanic patient had a thickened and stenotic pulmonary valve that obstructed flow of blood from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. The frequency of the K259R sequence variation was evaluated in the Dallas Heart Study population of control subjects (19Victor R.G. Haley R.W. Willett D.L. Peshock R.M. Vaeth P.C. Leonard D. Basit M. Cooper R.S. Iannacchione V.G. Visscher W.A. Staab J.M. Hobbs H.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 2004; 93: 1473-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We found the sequence variation in 1 out of 1137 control individuals, indicating that this is an extremely rare genetic variant. This subject was also Hispanic (out of 212 total Hispanic controls). The valve morphology of the control individual is unknown, and subclinical disease could not be excluded. Sequence alignments show that Lys-259 has been evolutionarily conserved from fruit flies to humans (supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that Lys-259 is under selective pressure and may be important for MYOCD function. This residue is also conserved in MRTF-A, but MRTF-B contains an arginine at the corresponding codon (Arg-288, supplemental Fig. 1B). Interestingly, MRTF-B is transcriptionally less active than MYOCD or MRTF-A on most promoters (2Wang D.Z. Li S. Hockemeyer D. Sutherland L. Wang Z. Schratt G. Richardson J.A. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14855-14860Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cardiac but Not Smooth Muscle Myocardin K259R Is Hypomorphic and Has Reduced SRF Affinity—MYOCD Lys-259 is not contained in the SRF-binding B-box, but does lie within the lysine-rich basic domain that is necessary for SRF binding (Fig. 1A) (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that K259R might affect MYOCD-dependent promoter activation of SRF-dependent targets (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Transient co-transfection of the 935-amino acid, cardiac-specific isoform of MYOCD (MYOCD935) with luciferase reporters driven by the SM22α-Luc or ANF-Luc promoter showed that K259R MYOCD935 was hypomorphic when compared with wild type (WT) MYOCD935 (Fig. 1, B and C). The reduced activity was not due to changes in cellular localization, as WT and K259R MYOCD935 both localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1D). We tested whether the reduction in MYOCD activity was due to a corresponding reduction in binding between MYOCD and SRF. In Co-IP assays, we were unable to detect an interaction between MYOCD935 K259R and SRF, but WT MYOCD935 showed normal SRF binding (Fig. 1E). In a more sensitive test involving DNA-protein interactions, EMSA revealed that MYOCD935 K259R could interact with SRF, but this interaction was harder to detect than with WT MYOCD935 (Fig. 1F). Since MRTF-B is a weaker activator than MYOCD or MRTF-A, we hypothesized this may be due, in part, to the evolutionarily divergent arginine at codon 288. Mutation of arginine 288 to lysine (R288K), the residue present in MYOCD or MRTF-A, increased MRTF-B-dependent activation of SM22α-Luc nearly 5-fold (Fig. 1G). Although this was still well below the levels achieved with MYOCD or MRTF-A in vitro, it demonstrated that the two basic amino acids are not functionally equivalent in this domain and that an arginine at this residue of the MYOCD family of proteins is sufficient to limit the transactivation potential of MYOCD proteins. Since the cardiac (MYOCD935) and smooth muscle (MYOCDΔMHD) isoforms also have different levels of activity, we tested whether K259R affected MYOCDΔMHD in a similar fashion to the cardiac isoform. In contrast to what was observed with MYOCD935, K259R MYOCDΔMHD was functionally normal in luciferase reporter assays using the SM22α promoter (Fig. 2A). Unlike with K259R MYOCD935, K259R MYOCDΔMHD appeared to interact with SRF similar to WT MYOCD as assessed by Co-IP (Fig. 2B) and EMSA (Fig. 2C). The MYOCD MHD Inhibits MYOCD-dependent Transcription in Vitro by Binding to MYOCD and Blocking Its Interaction with SRF—Because truncating the MHD rescued the K259R hypomorph despite being in a distant domain, we hypothesized that the MHD of MYOCD might normally act as an intramolecular autoinhibitor, consistent with the increased activity of MYOCDΔMHD (20Peterson J.R. Golemis E.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Zaromytidou A.I. Miralles F. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4134-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). If this were the case, the MHD, even when separated from the rest of MYOCD, might bind to other domains in MYOCD to mask or allosterically compete for SRF binding. Consistent with this, we found that expression of amino acids 1-195 inhibited transactivation by MYOCDΔMHD on the SRF-dependent reporters described earlier. Amino acids 1-149 also inhibited MYOCD activity in a dose-dependent manner; however, amino acids 1-129 did not (Fig. 3A). Truncation of the MHD amino terminus revealed that amino acids 1-30, but not 30-60, were dispensable for inhibition of MYOCD transactivation (Fig. 3A). Thus, the minimal MYOCD inhibitory domain appeared to lie between amino acids 30 and 149. The MHD of MRTF-A has been well characterized as an actin-dependent regulator of nuclear localization (12Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 21Zaromytidou A.I. Miralles F. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4134-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, MYOCD is thought to be constitutively nuclear (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 12Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Similar to MRTF-A, MYOCD contains two conserved RPEL motifs in the minimal inhibitory MHD. In previous reports, mutation of the conserved arginines to alanine of the RPEL motif disrupted the MHD-dependent nuclear localization of MRTF-A (12Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We found that mutation of the conserved arginines (R71A, R115A) of the two RPEL motifs had no effect on the ability of the MHD to inhibit MYOCD activity, suggesting that the RPEL motifs are not necessary for autoinhibition (Fig. 3B). Another known motif within the MHD is the MEF2-binding site, located in the first 17 amino acids of MYOCD (22Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 4245-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because amino acids 1-30 were not necessary for inhibition, the MEF2-binding domain may also be dispensable for inhibition of SRF-dependent MYOCD activity (Fig. 3A). Since the RPEL- and MEF2-binding motif were not necessary and MHD1-129 was insufficient to inhibit MYOCD co-activation, we focused on amino acids 129-149. Sequence analysis identified no recognizable motifs, but revealed two acidic residues that are conserved from humans to amphibians: aspartate 130 (Asp-130) and glutamate 135 (Glu-135, supplemental Fig. 1C). Mutation of these two negatively charged residues to uncharged alanines (DE → AA) disrupted the autoinhibition, effectively mapping some of the essential residues required for inhibition (Fig. 3B). Next, we investigated whether the MHD was a true autoinhibitory domain that directly binds to MYOCD via intramolecular interactions. In Co-IP experiments, truncated MHD that contained the minimal autoinhibitory domain (30-149) was able to bind to MYOCD, although the 30-149 construct had less affinity than the 1-149 construct (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, mutation of both Asp-130 and Glu-135 disrupted MYOCD-MHD interactions, whereas mutation of the conserved RPEL motifs did not. Autoinhibitory domains generally have to retain intramolecular binding to inhibit protein activity, which may explain why the DE → AA mutations were not inhibitory in the luciferase reporter assays. To seek further evidence of a physical interaction between MYOCD and the MHD, we developed a mammalian two-hybrid assay, with the MHD-1-149 conjugated to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GAL4-MHD). We observed that MYOCD was able to co-activate the UAS-luciferase reporter in the presence of GAL4-MHD (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, SRF was able to inhibit the MYOCD-dependent activation of GAL4-MHD, which suggested that the MHD and SRF could compete for interaction with MYOCD (Fig. 3E). Since the MHD could compete with SRF for binding to MYOCD and the MHD was necessary for K259R to behave as a hypomorph, we hypothesized that K259R would confer greater autoinhibition when compared with WT MYOCD. Consistent with this hypothesis, K259R MYOCDΔMHD displayed more MHD-dependent inhibition than WT MYOCDΔMHD on the SM22α promoter (Fig. 3F). The MYOCD MHD Inhibits MYOCD-dependent Smooth Muscle Conversion and Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy—Full-length MYOCD has a limited capacity to transdifferentiate CH310T1/2 fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells (17Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Pipes G.C. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Since truncations of MYOCD lacking the MHD show greater smooth muscle conversion than MYOCD935, we hypothesized that this phenomenon might be explained by MHD autoinhibition. We therefore tested whether introduction of MHD1-149 would repress MYOCD-dependent smooth muscle conversion (Fig. 4, A and B). MYOCDΔMHD converted ∼40! of transfected CH310T1/2 fibroblasts into SM-α-actin-positive cells within 7 days. Consistent with our in vitro reporter assay results, MHD1-149 inhibited the conversion efficiency of MYOCDΔMHD by about 50! (Fig. 4, A and B). Neither the RPEL motifs nor the MEF2-binding domain were necessary, but the two acidic residues (Asp-130, Glu-135) were required for effective inhibition of conversion (Fig. 4B). We next tested the mRNA transcript levels of multiple MYOCD target genes by quantitative RT-PCR to determine whether MHD-dependent inhibition affected genes other than SM-α-actin. MHD-dependent inhibition of MYOCD extended to multiple other direct MYOCD targets such as SM22α, ANF, and smooth muscle calponin (Fig. 4C). These targets were also dependent on Asp-130 and Glu-135. We also tested whether the MHD could affect MYOCD activity in cardiomyocytes. MYOCD induces a hypertrophic response in primary cardiomyocytes (18Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Badorff C. Seeger F.H. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and a dominant-negative form of MYOCD (DN-MYOCD) inhibits hypertrophy in response to chemicals such as PE. We investigated whether the MHD might mimic the DN-MYOCD effect. Indeed, WT but not DE → AA MHD 1-149 inhibited PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as assessed by measurements of cell surface area (Fig. 5, A and B). This observation suggests that the inhibition of hypertrophy was independent of MEF2 since the DE → AA mutant retains the MEF2-binding domain. The hypertrophic response is normally accompanied by an increase in expression of the ANF, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP (Nppb)), and skeletal muscle α-actin (Sk-α-actin (ACTA1)) transcripts and a decrease in GSK3β expression (18Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Badorff C. Seeger F.H. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with the calculations of surface area, DN-MYOCD and WT MHD inhibited the PE-induced changes in hypertrophic gene expression, and the DE → AA mutant MHD (Fig. 5C) displayed diminished inhibitory activity. This study shows that MYOCD has the potential for dynamic intramolecular regulation of the SRF-dependent gene program. A rare human mutation, K259R, resulted in attenuated activity of a cardiac isoform of myocardin without affecting a smooth muscle isoform that lacked the amino terminus. This observation led to the discovery that the amino terminus acted as an inhibitor of SRF-dependent myocardin activity. Although neither the MEF2-binding site nor the RPEL motifs in the amino terminus were necessary for this effect, we did find that two evolutionarily conserved acidic residues within the amino terminus were necessary for MHD-dependent inhibition. The K259R mutation was also more responsive to MHD-dependent inhibition, consistent with the notion that the K259R hypomorph is actually a gain of MHD-dependent inhibitory function. MRTF-B, the hypoactive MYOCD family member, showed increased transactivation potential when arginine 288 was mutated to lysine. This suggests that MHD-dependent inhibition may be a general mechanism for regulating the Myocardin family by utilizing the MYOCD Lys-259 and MRTF-B Arg-288 residue. The differential effects of the human K259R mutation on the function of MYOCD with or without MHD1-149 revealed novel aspects of MYOCD regulation. One interpretation of our finding is that the amino terminus of MYOCD sterically inhibits the SRF-binding domain and that the K259R mutation strengthens this intramolecular interaction between the MHD and the SRF-binding domain. In the smooth muscle form of MYOCD, the autoinhibitory domain (MHD) is absent; therefore, the K259R mutation is inconsequential. This function of the MHD, along with the interaction with MEF2, may explain the differential effect of MYOCD in cardiac and smooth muscle. Interestingly, inclusion of amino acids 149-195 in the MHD constructs increased the binding affinity and inhibitory activity of the MHD upon MYOCD. Of those 46 amino acids 25, or 54!, are conserved to amphibians, and nine of those are acidic (e.g. Asp-130 and Glu-135; data not shown). It is interesting to speculate that a direct interaction occurs between the negatively charged acidic residues of the MHD and the positively charged lysine at 259 or even the entire lysine-rich basic domain. Alternatively, the increased length of the arginine side chain, when compared with lysine, may disrupt MYOCD folding in a way that blocks SRF binding. In vitro, MYOCD protein is responsive to extracellular hypertrophic stimuli on synthetic promoters, apparently without altered steady state protein levels (18Xing W. Zhang T.C. Cao D. Wang Z. Antos C.L. Li S. Wang Y. Olson E.N. Wang D.Z. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MYOCD is sumoylated by the PIAS1 ligase and associates with the histone acetyl-transferase p300, which also acetylates proteins (24Cao D. Wang Z. Zhang C.L. Oh J. Xing W. Li S. Richardson J.A. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both of these activities are dependent upon lysine residues, and in these instances, arginine is not able to replace the post-translationally modified lysines (24Cao D. Wang Z. Zhang C.L. Oh J. Xing W. Li S. Richardson J.A. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Li A. Wang Z. Feng X. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, MYOCD may be post-translationally modified at Lys-259 to directly or allosterically disrupt MHD binding to MYOCD. Ultimately, the protein structure of MYOCD will help resolve the precise mechanism of MHD-mediated inhibition of the activity of MYOCD in cardiac tissue. The patient with the K259R mutation had a thickened pulmonic valve. Although we cannot be certain of the contribution of this mutation, the rarity of the mutation, evolutionary conservation, and the functional consequences would suggest that it is a contributing factor. Outflow tract valves are composed of early outflow tract myocardium, neural crest, and endocardial-derived cells (26Srivastava D. Cell. 2006; 126: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). MYOCD-null mutant embryos only survive to embryonic day 10.5, before the formation of cardiac valves, precluding the ability to examine the role of MYOCD in these tissues (6Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Selective ablation of the MYOCD gene from neural crest resulted in patent ductus arteriousus but had no effect on valve morphogenesis (10Huang J. Cheng L. Li J. Chen M. Zhou D. Lu M.M. Proweller A. Epstein J.A. Parmacek M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar), although MYOCD may play a role in outflow myocardium or endocardium. To determine whether the K259R mutation contributed to the heart disease in the subject or co-segregated with the true disease-causing mutation as part of a haplotype block, further studies will be necessary, including generation of a mouse model of MYOCD K259R. If the knock-in mouse has outflow tract defects, it may provide a valuable tool for understanding valve development and disease. Most genes that are known to play a role in valve development (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, and Notch1) are expressed in the endocardium of the prevalve tissue and respond to paracrine signals, such as transforming growth factor-β family members, which are released from the muscle tissue surrounding the valves (27Schroeder J.A. Jackson L.F. Lee D.C. Camenisch T.D. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Since MYOCD is expressed in the myocardium, it may be well situated to induce such paracrine signals (1Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Myocardin expression is also induced by transforming growth factor-β, and it acts as a tumor suppressor in precancerous mesenchyme (28Milyavsky M. Shats I. Cholostoy A. Brosh R. Buganim Y. Weisz L. Kogan I. Cohen M. Shatz M. Madar S. Kalo E. Goldfinger N. Yuan J. Ron S. MacKenzie K. Eden A. Rotter V. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 133-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, MYOCD may be involved in guiding early cardiac mesenchymal progenitors into fully differentiated valve tissue, and any reduction in its activity could result in overproduction of undifferentiated valve progenitors and thickened valves.

https://openalex.org/W1989106135,"Eukaryotic cells respond to genotoxic stress by inducing cell growth arrest or apoptosis. Although the p53 tumor suppressor largely contributes to the response by regulating antiproliferative or pro-apoptotic genes, some genotoxic stresses including ultraviolet (UV) light induce apoptosis even in the absence of p53. The molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to UV in the p53-independent manner remain to be established. Here, we show that UV-induced stress promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of Tob, triggering an apoptotic signal. We found that Tob with either short deletion or a tag sequence at the C terminus was resistant to UV-induced degradation. Introduction of the degradation-resistant Tob impaired UV-induced apoptosis. Reciprocally, suppression of Tob by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in frequent induction of apoptosis irrespective of the presence of functional p53 even at UV doses that do not promote Tob degradation. Finally, tob-deficient (tob−/−) mice and primary embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from tob−/− mice exhibit increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. Thus, proteasomal clearance of Tob provides a novel p53-independent pathway for UV-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010726964,"Many developing countries promote social health insurance as a means to eliminate unmet health needs. However, this strategy may be ineffective if there are barriers to fully utilizing insurance.We analyzed the utilization of social health insurance in 30 hospital districts in the central regions of the Philippines between 2003 and 2007. Data for the study came from the Quality Improvement Demonstration Study (QIDS) and included detailed patient information from exit interviews of children under 5 years of age conducted in seven waves among public hospital districts located in the four central regions of the Philippines. These data were used to estimate and identify predictors of underutilization of insurance benefits--defined as the likelihood of not filing claims despite having legitimate insurance coverage--using logistic regression.Multivariate analyses using QIDS data from 2004 to 2007 reveal that underutilization averaged about 15% throughout the study period. Underutilization, however, declined over time. Among insured hospitalized children, increasing length of stay in the hospital and mother's education, were associated with less underutilization. Being in a QIDS intervention site was also associated with less underutilization and partially accounts for the downward trend in underutilization over time.The surprisingly high level of insurance underutilization by insured patients in the QIDS sites undermines the potentially positive impact of social health insurance on the health of the marginalized. In the Philippines, where the largest burden of health care spending falls on households, underutilization suggests ineffective distribution of public funds, failing to reach a significant proportion of households which are by and large poor. Interventions that improve benefit awareness may combat the problem of underutilization and should be the focus of further research in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2021331000,"MBP-1 acts as a general transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of MBP-1 induces cell death in a number of cancer cells and regresses tumor growth. However, the function of endogenous MBP-1 in normal cell growth regulation remains unknown. To unravel the role of endogenous MBP-1, we knocked down MBP-1 expression in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) by RNA interference. Knockdown of MBP-1 in HFF (HFF-MBPsi-4) resulted in an induction of premature senescence, displayed flattened cell morphology, and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. FACS analysis of HFF-MBPsi-4 revealed accumulation of a high number of cells in the G1-phase. A significant upregulation of cyclin D1 and reduction of cyclin A was detected in HFF-MBPsi-4 as compared to control HFF. Senescent fibroblasts exhibited enhanced expression of phosphorylated and acetylated p53, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. Further analysis suggested that promyolocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies are dramatically increased in HFF-MBPsi-4. Together, these results demonstrated that knockdown of endogenous MBP-1 is involved in cellular senescence of HFF through p53-p21 pathway."
