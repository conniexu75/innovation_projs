https://openalex.org/W2004209173,"J.B.S. Haldane proposed in 1947 that the male germline may be more mutagenic than the female germline1. Diverse studies have supported Haldane's contention of a higher average mutation rate in the male germline in a variety of mammals, including humans2,3. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first direct comparative analysis of male and female germline mutation rates from the complete genome sequences of two parent-offspring trios. Through extensive validation, we identified 49 and 35 germline de novo mutations (DNMs) in two trio offspring, as well as 1,586 non-germline DNMs arising either somatically or in the cell lines from which the DNA was derived. Most strikingly, in one family, we observed that 92% of germline DNMs were from the paternal germline, whereas, in contrast, in the other family, 64% of DNMs were from the maternal germline. These observations suggest considerable variation in mutation rates within and between families."
https://openalex.org/W2012847956,"Brassinosteroids are essential phytohormones that have crucial roles in plant growth and development. Perception of brassinosteroids requires an active complex of BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1). Recognized by the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of BRI1, brassinosteroids induce a phosphorylation-mediated cascade to regulate gene expression. Here we present the crystal structures of BRI1(LRR) in free and brassinolide-bound forms. BRI1(LRR) exists as a monomer in crystals and solution independent of brassinolide. It comprises a helical solenoid structure that accommodates a separate insertion domain at its concave surface. Sandwiched between them, brassinolide binds to a hydrophobicity-dominating surface groove on BRI1(LRR). Brassinolide recognition by BRI1(LRR) is through an induced-fit mechanism involving stabilization of two interdomain loops that creates a pronounced non-polar surface groove for the hormone binding. Together, our results define the molecular mechanisms by which BRI1 recognizes brassinosteroids and provide insight into brassinosteroid-induced BRI1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2062801286,"Polyhydroxylated steroids are regulators of body shape and size in higher organisms. In metazoans, intracellular receptors recognize these molecules. Plants, however, perceive steroids at membranes, using the membrane-integral receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Here we report the structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 ligand-binding domain, determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.5 Å resolution. We find a superhelix of 25 twisted leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an architecture that is strikingly different from the assembly of LRRs in animal Toll-like receptors. A 70-amino-acid island domain between LRRs 21 and 22 folds back into the interior of the superhelix to create a surface pocket for binding the plant hormone brassinolide. Known loss- and gain-of-function mutations map closely to the hormone-binding site. We propose that steroid binding to BRI1 generates a docking platform for a co-receptor that is required for receptor activation. Our findings provide insight into the activation mechanism of this highly expanded family of plant receptors that have essential roles in hormone, developmental and innate immunity signalling. The brassinolides are potent steroid hormones that are central to plant growth and development. They bind to the plasma membrane receptor BRI1, a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor family that also includes the mammalian Toll-like receptors, which are important in innate immunity. Two independent studies now present the crystal structure of BRI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, both in the free form and in complex with brassinolide. BRI1 is found to adopt a solenoid-like superhelical structure involving 25 leucine-rich repeats. The structure is strikingly different from that of Toll-like receptors and reveals a novel mechanism of steroid recognition. This work suggests synthetic routes to nonsteroidal mimetics of BRI1 that could have a possible use in agriculture."

https://openalex.org/W2014146744,"Here we report that the transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein H (CREB-H, encoded by CREB3L3) is required for the maintenance of normal plasma triglyceride concentrations. CREB-H-deficient mice showed hypertriglyceridemia secondary to inefficient triglyceride clearance catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), partly due to defective expression of the Lpl coactivators Apoc2, Apoa4 and Apoa5 (encoding apolipoproteins C2, A4 and A5, respectively) and concurrent augmentation of the Lpl inhibitor Apoc3. We identified multiple nonsynonymous mutations in CREB3L3 that produced hypomorphic or nonfunctional CREB-H protein in humans with extreme hypertriglyceridemia, implying a crucial role for CREB-H in human triglyceride metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1967084420,"Many estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers respond well initially to endocrine therapies, but often develop resistance during treatment with selective ER modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen. We have reported that the 14-3-3 family member and conserved protein, 14-3-3ζ, is upregulated by tamoxifen and that high expression correlated with an early time to disease recurrence. However, the mechanism by which tamoxifen upregulates 14-3-3ζ and may promote the development of endocrine resistance is not known. Our findings herein reveal that the tamoxifen upregulation of 14-3-3ζ results from its ability to rapidly downregulate microRNA (miR)-451 that specifically targets 14-3-3ζ. The levels of 14-3-3ζ and miR-451 were inversely correlated, with 14-3-3ζ being elevated and miR-451 being at a greatly reduced level in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Of note, downregulation of miR-451 was selectively elicited by tamoxifen but not by other SERMs, such as raloxifene or ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant). Increasing the level of miR-451 by overexpression, which decreased 14-3-3ζ, suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, markedly reduced activation of HER2, EGFR and MAPK signaling, increased apoptosis, and, importantly, restored the growth-inhibitory effectiveness of SERMs in endocrine-resistant cells. Opposite effects were elicited by miR-451 knockdown. Thus, we identify tamoxifen downregulation of miR-451, and consequent elevation of the key survival factor 14-3-3ζ, as a mechanistic basis of tamoxifen-associated development of endocrine resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic approaches to increase expression of this tumor suppressor-like miR should be considered to downregulate 14-3-3ζ and enhance the effectiveness of endocrine therapies. Furthermore, the selective ability of the SERM tamoxifen but not raloxifene to regulate miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ may assist in understanding differences in their activities, as seen in the STAR (Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene) breast cancer prevention trial and in other clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2168260613,"Although clathrin-mediated endocytosis is thought to be the predominant mechanism of synaptic vesicle recycling, it seems to be too slow for fast recycling. Therefore, it was suggested that a presorted and preassembled pool of synaptic vesicle proteins on the presynaptic membrane might support a first wave of fast clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study we monitored the temporal dynamics of such a 'readily retrievable pool' of synaptic vesicle proteins in rat hippocampal neurons using a new type of probe. By applying cypHer5E, a new cyanine dye-based pH-sensitive exogenous marker, coupled to antibodies to luminal domains of synaptic vesicle proteins, we could reliably monitor synaptic vesicle recycling and demonstrate the preferential recruitment of a surface pool of synaptic vesicle proteins upon stimulated endocytosis. By using fluorescence nanoscopy of surface-labeled synaptotagmin 1, we could resolve the spatial distribution of the surface pool at the periactive zone in hippocampal boutons, which represent putative sites of endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2070423416,"The authors report that TACE, the tumor necrosis factor-α–converting enzyme, regulates PNS myelination by affecting neuregulin-1 type III activity. Mice lacking TACE in motor neurons show hypermyelination. Tumor necrosis factor-α–converting enzyme (TACE; also known as ADAM17) is a proteolytic sheddase that is responsible for the cleavage of several membrane-bound molecules. We report that TACE cleaves neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III in the epidermal growth factor domain, probably inactivating it (as assessed by deficient activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway), and thereby negatively regulating peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of TACE in vitro in dorsal root ganglia neurons accelerates the onset of myelination and results in hypermyelination. In agreement, motor neurons of conditional knockout mice lacking TACE specifically in these cells are significantly hypermyelinated, and small-caliber fibers are aberrantly myelinated. Further, reduced TACE activity rescues hypomyelination in NRG1 type III haploinsufficient mice in vivo. We also show that the inhibitory effect of TACE is neuron-autonomous, as Schwann cells lacking TACE elaborate myelin of normal thickness. Thus, TACE is a modulator of NRG1 type III activity and is a negative regulator of myelination in the PNS."
https://openalex.org/W2088755150,"Striatal spiny neurons (SPNs) associate a diverse array of cortically processed information to regulate action selection. But how this is done by SPNs is poorly understood. A key step in this process is the transition of SPNs from a hyperpolarized 'down state' to a sustained, depolarized 'up state'. These transitions are thought to reflect a sustained synaptic barrage, involving the coordination of hundreds of pyramidal neurons. Indeed, in mice, simulation of cortical input by glutamate uncaging on proximal dendritic spines produced potential changes in SPNs that tracked input time course. However, brief glutamate uncaging at spines on distal dendrites evoked somatic up states lasting hundreds of milliseconds. These regenerative events depended upon both NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. Moreover, they were bidirectionally regulated by dopamine receptor signaling. This capacity not only changes our model of how up states are generated in SPNs, it also has fundamental implications for the associative process underlying action selection."
https://openalex.org/W1979733618,"Blockade of excessive Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is a therapeutic approach being actively pursued for many inflammatory diseases. Here we report a Chinese herb-derived compound, sparstolonin B (SsnB), which selectively blocks TLR2- and TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling. SsnB was isolated from a Chinese herb, Spaganium stoloniferum; its structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. SsnB effectively inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in mouse macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 ligand), Pam3CSK4 (a TLR1/TLR2 ligand), and Fsl-1 (a TLR2/TLR6 ligand) but not that by poly(I:C) (a TLR3 ligand) or ODN1668 (a TLR9 ligand). It suppressed LPS-induced cytokine secretion from macrophages and diminished phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38a, IκBα, and JNK in these cells. In THP-1 cells expressing a chimeric receptor CD4-TLR4, which triggers constitutive NF-κB activation, SsnB effectively blunted the NF-κB activity. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that SsnB reduced the association of MyD88 with TLR4 and TLR2, but not that with TLR9, in HEK293T cells and THP-1 cells overexpressing MyD88 and TLRs. Furthermore, administration of SsnB suppressed splenocyte inflammatory cytokine expression in mice challenged with LPS. These results demonstrate that SsnB acts as a selective TLR2 and TLR4 antagonist by blocking the early intracellular events in the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Thus, SssB may serve as a promising lead for the development of selective TLR antagonistic agents for inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1966526747,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway is one of the most dysregulated pathways in human cancers. The glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) transcription factor is the terminal effector of the Hedgehog pathway, frequently activated in human breast cancer and an emerging target of breast cancer therapy. While somatic mutations in the human GLI1 gene have never been reported in any cell or tumor type, we recently uncovered the existence of a novel alternatively spliced, truncated GLI1 (tGLI1) that has an in-frame deletion of 41 codons spanning the entire exon 3 and part of exon 4 of the GLI1 gene. Using glioblastoma models, we showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to promote glioblastoma migration and invasion via its gain-of-function transcriptional activity. However, the pathological impact of tGLI1 on breast cancer remains undefined. Here, we report that tGLI1 is frequently expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens we have examined to date, but is undetectable in normal breast tissues. We found for the first time that tGLI1, but not GLI1, binds to and enhances the human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene promoter, leading to its upregulation. Consequently, tGLI1-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells secret higher levels of VEGF-A and contain a higher propensity, than the isogenic cells with control vector and GLI1, to stimulate in vitro angiogenesis of human vascular endothelial cells. We further showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to enhance the motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in a proliferation-independent manner and that this functional gain is associated with increased expression of migration/invasion-associated genes, CD24, MMP-2 and MMP-9. tGLI1 has also acquired the property to facilitate anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our results define tGLI1 as a gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor and a novel mediator of the behavior of clinically more aggressive breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2013507063,"The Salvador/Warts/Hippo (Hippo) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition, organ size control, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and cancer development in mammals. The Drosophila melanogaster protein Expanded acts in the Hippo signaling pathway to control organ size. Previously, willin/FRMD6 has been proposed as the human orthologue of Expanded. Willin lacks C-terminal sequences that are present in Expanded and, to date, little is known about the functional role of willin in mammalian cells. When willin is expressed in D. melanogaster epithelial tissues, it has the same subcellular localization as Expanded, but cannot rescue growth defects associated with expanded deficiency. However, we show that ectopic willin expression causes an increase in phosphorylation of the core Hippo signaling pathway components MST1/2, LATS1 and YAP, an effect that can be antagonized by ezrin. In MCF10A cells, loss of willin expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features and willin overexpression antagonizes YAP activity via the N-terminal FERM domain of willin. Therefore, in mammalian cells willin influences Hippo signaling activity by activating the core Hippo pathway kinase cassette."
https://openalex.org/W2073296995,"β-Amyloid (Aβ), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidences suggest that soluble Aβ oligomers adversely affect synaptic function, leading to cognitive failure associated with AD. The Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction has been attributed to the synaptic removal of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the loss of AMPAR induced by Aβ at synapses are largely unknown. In this study we have examined the effect of Aβ oligomers on phosphorylated GluA1 at serine 845, a residue that plays an essential role in the trafficking of AMPARs toward extrasynaptic sites and the subsequent delivery to synapses during synaptic plasticity events. We found that Aβ oligomers reduce basal levels of Ser-845 phosphorylation and surface expression of AMPARs affecting AMPAR subunit composition. Aβ-induced GluA1 dephosphorylation and reduced receptor surface levels are mediated by an increase in calcium influx into neurons through ionotropic glutamate receptors and activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Moreover, Aβ oligomers block the extrasynaptic delivery of AMPARs induced by chemical synaptic potentiation. In addition, reduced levels of total and phosphorylated GluA1 are associated with initial spatial memory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. These findings indicate that Aβ oligomers could act as a synaptic depressor affecting the mechanisms involved in the targeting of AMPARs to the synapses during early stages of the disease. β-Amyloid (Aβ), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD).

https://openalex.org/W2102579732,"Lysyl oxidase (LOX), a matrix cross-linking protein, is known to be selectively expressed and to enhance a fibrotic phenotype. A recent study of ours showed that LOX oxidizes the PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β), leading to amplified downstream signaling. Here, we examined the expression and functions of LOX in megakaryocytes (MKs), the platelet precursors. Cells committed to the MK lineage undergo mitotic proliferation to yield diploid cells, followed by endomitosis and acquisition of polyploidy. Intriguingly, LOX expression is detected in diploid-tetraploid MKs, but scarce in polyploid MKs. PDGFR-BB is an inducer of mitotic proliferation in MKs. LOX inhibition with β-aminopropionitrile reduces PDGFR-BB binding to cells and downstream signaling, as well as its proliferative effect on the MK lineage. Inhibition of LOX activity has no influence on MK polyploidy. We next rationalized that, in a system with an abundance of low ploidy MKs, LOX could be highly expressed and with functional significance. Thus, we resorted to GATA-1(low) mice, where there is an increase in low ploidy MKs, augmented levels of PDGF-BB, and an extensive matrix of fibers. MKs from these mice display high expression of LOX, compared with control mice. Importantly, treatment of GATA-1(low) mice with β-aminopropionitrile significantly improves the bone marrow fibrotic phenotype, and MK number in the spleen. Thus, our in vitro and in vivo data support a novel role for LOX in regulating MK expansion by PDGF-BB and suggest LOX as a new potential therapeutic target for myelofibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2033194905,"Previously, our group identified a novel amplicon at chromosome 9p24 in human esophageal and breast cancers, and cloned the novel gene, GASC1 (gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1, also known as JMJD2C/KDM4C), from this amplicon. GASC1 is a histone demethylase involved in the deregulation of histone methylation in cancer cells. In the current study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the genes in the 9p24 amplicon in human breast cancer. We performed extensive genomic analyses on a panel of cancer cell lines and narrowed the shortest region of overlap to approximately 2 Mb. Based on statistical analysis of copy number increase and overexpression, the 9p24 amplicon contains six candidate oncogenes. Among these, four genes (GASC1 UHRF2, KIAA1432 and C9orf123) are overexpressed only in the context of gene amplification while two genes (ERMP1 and IL33) are overexpressed independent of the copy number increase. We then focused our studies on the UHRF2 gene, which has a potential involvement in both DNA methylation and histone modification. Knocking down UHRF2 expression inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells specifically with 9p24 amplification. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of UHRF2 in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UHRF2 has the ability to suppress the expression of key cell-cycle inhibitors, such as p16INK4a, p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. Taken together, our studies support the notion that the 9p24 amplicon contains multiple oncogenes that may integrate genetic and epigenetic codes and have important roles in human tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2156136686,"Facilities across Africa care for apes orphaned by the trade for ""bushmeat."" These facilities, called sanctuaries, provide housing for apes such as bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who have been illegally taken from the wild and sold as pets. Although these circumstances are undoubtedly stressful for the apes, most individuals arrive at the sanctuaries as infants and are subsequently provided with rich physical and social environments that can facilitate the expression of species-typical behaviors.We tested whether bonobo and chimpanzee orphans living in sanctuaries show any behavioral, physiological, or cognitive abnormalities relative to other individuals in captivity as a result of the early-life stress they experience. Orphans showed lower levels of aberrant behaviors, similar levels of average cortisol, and highly similar performances on a broad battery of cognitive tests in comparisons with individuals of the same species who were either living at a zoo or were reared by their mothers at the sanctuaries.Taken together, these results support the rehabilitation strategy used by sanctuaries in the Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA) and suggest that the orphans we examined did not show long-term signs of stress as a result of their capture. Our findings also show that sanctuary apes are as psychologically healthy as apes in other captive settings and thus represent a valuable resource for non-invasive research."
https://openalex.org/W2010185947,"Huang and Trussell show that resting potential of the calyx of Held synapse is controlled by KCNQ5 potassium channels. Unlike most KCNQ channels, which activate only on depolarization, these presynaptic channels activate negative to the resting potential. These channels set the resting conductance and control release probability of the synapse. Little is known about which ion channels determine the resting electrical properties of presynaptic membranes. In recordings made from the rat calyx of Held, a giant mammalian terminal, we found resting potential to be controlled by KCNQ (Kv7) K+ channels, most probably KCNQ5 (Kv7.5) homomers. Unlike most KCNQ channels, which are activated only by depolarizing stimuli, the presynaptic channels began to activate just below the resting potential. As a result, blockers and activators of KCNQ5 depolarized or hyperpolarized nerve terminals, respectively, markedly altering resting conductance. Moreover, the background conductance set by KCNQ5 channels, together with Na+ and hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels, determined the size and time course of the response to subthreshold stimuli. Signaling pathways known to directly affect exocytic machinery also regulated KCNQ5 channels, and increase or decrease of KCNQ5 channel activity controlled release probability through alterations in resting potential. Thus, ion channel determinants of presynaptic resting potential also control synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2049559459,"EphA2 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is highly expressed in many aggressive cancer types, including melanoma. We recently showed that EphA2 is also upregulated by ultraviolet radiation and is able to induce apoptosis. These findings suggest that EphA2 may have different, even paradoxical, effects on viability depending on the cellular context and that EphA2 mediates a delicate balance between life and death of the cell. To functionally clarify EphA2's role in melanoma, we analyzed a panel of melanoma cell lines and found that EphA2 levels are elevated in a significant fraction of the samples. Specific depletion of EphA2 in high-expressing melanoma cells using short hairpin RNA led to profound reductions in cellular viability, colony formation and migration in vitro and a dramatic loss of tumorigenic potential in vivo. Stable introduction of EphA2 into low-expressing cell lines enhanced proliferation, colony formation and migration, further supporting its pro-malignant phenotype. Interestingly, transient expression of EphA2 and/or Braf(V600E) in non-transformed melanocytes led to significant and additive apoptosis. These results verify that EphA2 is an important oncogene and potentially a common source of 'addiction' for many melanoma cells. Moreover, acute induction of EphA2 may purge genetically susceptible cells, thereby uncovering a more aggressive population that is in fact dependent on the oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1984161641,"A quantitative sensor of spatial and temporal dynamics of activity of the protein tyrosine kinase Src shows that its activity peaks 1–2 μm from the leading edge of cells undergoing lamellipodial membrane extension, and the activation is correlated with protrusion velocity. Fluorescent biosensors for living cells currently require laborious optimization and a unique design for each target. They are limited by the availability of naturally occurring ligands with appropriate target specificity. Here we describe a biosensor based on an engineered fibronectin monobody scaffold that can be tailored to bind different targets via high-throughput screening. We made this Src-family kinase (SFK) biosensor by derivatizing a monobody specific for activated SFKs with a bright dye whose fluorescence increases upon target binding. We identified sites for dye attachment and changes to eliminate vesiculation in living cells, providing a generalizable scaffold for biosensor production. This approach minimizes cell perturbation because it senses endogenous, unmodified target, and because sensitivity is enhanced by direct dye excitation. Automated correlation of cell velocities and SFK activity revealed that SFKs are activated specifically during protrusion. Activity correlates with velocity, and peaks 1–2 μm from the leading edge."
https://openalex.org/W1989189448,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-δ (C/EBP-δ), a transcription factor, is elevated in carcinoma compared with that in normal tissue. This study reports a novel function of C/EBP-δ in lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Genetic deletion of C/EBP-δ in mice resulted in a significant reduction of lymphangiogenesis and pulmonary metastases, with a dramatic reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its cognate receptor VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR3) in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). By contrast, no difference of VEGF-C in tumor tissues and bone marrow was observed between null and wild-type mice. Consistently, forced expression of C/EBP-δ increased VEGF-C and VEGFR3 expression in cultured LECs. These findings suggest a specific and important role of C/EBP-δ in the regulation of VEGFR3 signaling in LECs. Furthermore, expression of C/EBP-δ in cultured LECs significantly increased cell motility, and knockdown of C/EBP-δ inhibited cell motility and lymphatic vascular network formation in vitro. Forced expression of VEGF-C, but not recombinant VEGF-C, rescued the knockdown of C/EBP-δ-induced cell apoptosis, indicative of autonomous VEGF-C autocrine signaling essential for LEC survival. Moreover, hypoxia induces C/EBP-δ expression and C/EBP-δ regulates HIF-1α expression. Blocking HIF-1α activity totally blocked CEBP-δ-induced VEGF-C and VEGFR3 expression in LECs. Together, these findings uncover a new function of CEBP-δ in lymphangiogenesis through regulation of VEGFR3 signaling in LECs."
https://openalex.org/W1977848350,"An increase in production of reactive oxygen species resulting in a decrease in nitric oxide bioavailability in the endothelium contributes to many cardiovascular diseases, and these reactive oxygen species can oxidize cellular macromolecules. Protein thiols are critical reducing equivalents that maintain cellular redox state and are primary targets for oxidative modification. We demonstrate endothelial NOS (eNOS) oxidant-induced protein thiyl radical formation from tetrahydrobiopterin-free enzyme or following exposure to exogenous superoxide using immunoblotting, immunostaining, and mass spectrometry. Spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) followed by immunoblotting using an anti-DMPO antibody demonstrated the formation of eNOS protein radicals, which were abolished by superoxide dismutase and L-NAME, indicating that protein radical formation was due to superoxide generation from the eNOS heme. With tetrahydrobiopterin-reconstituted eNOS, eNOS protein radical formation was completely inhibited. Using mass spectrometric and mutagenesis analysis, we identified Cys-908 as the residue involved in protein radical formation. Mutagenesis of this key cysteine to alanine abolished eNOS thiyl radical formation and uncoupled eNOS, leading to increased superoxide generation. Protein thiyl radical formation leads to oxidation or modification of cysteine with either disulfide bond formation or S-glutathionylation, which induces eNOS uncoupling. Furthermore, in endothelial cells treated with menadione to trigger cellular superoxide generation, eNOS protein radical formation, as visualized with confocal microscopy, was increased, and these results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-DMPO antibody. Thus, eNOS protein radical formation provides the basis for a mechanism of superoxide-directed regulation of eNOS, involving thiol oxidation, defining a unique pathway for the redox regulation of cardiovascular function."

Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide an in vitro model of embryonic development and an alternative method for assessing developmental toxicity. Here, we evaluated 309 environmental chemicals, mostly food-use pesticides, from the ToxCast™ chemical library using a mouse ES cell platform. ES cells were cultured in the absence of pluripotency factors to promote spontaneous differentiation and in the presence of DMSO-solubilized chemicals at different concentrations to test the effects of exposure on differentiation and cytotoxicity. Cardiomyocyte differentiation (α,β myosin heavy chain; MYH6/MYH7) and cytotoxicity (DRAQ5™/Sapphire700™) were measured by In-Cell Western™ analysis. Half-maximal activity concentration (AC₅₀) values for differentiation and cytotoxicity endpoints were determined, with 18% of the chemical library showing significant activity on either endpoint. Mining these effects against the ToxCast Phase I assays (∼500) revealed significant associations for a subset of chemicals (26) that perturbed transcription-based activities and impaired ES cell differentiation. Increased transcriptional activity of several critical developmental genes including BMPR2, PAX6 and OCT1 were strongly associated with decreased ES cell differentiation. Multiple genes involved in reactive oxygen species signaling pathways (NRF2, ABCG2, GSTA2, HIF1A) were strongly associated with decreased ES cell differentiation as well. A multivariate model built from these data revealed alterations in ABCG2 transporter was a strong predictor of impaired ES cell differentiation. Taken together, these results provide an initial characterization of metabolic and regulatory pathways by which some environmental chemicals may act to disrupt ES cell growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1982606752,"Using a screen for Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors, a family of 8-hydroxyquinolone derivatives with in vivo anti-cancer properties was identified. Analysis of microarray data for the lead compound N-((8-hydroxy-7-quinolinyl) (4-methylphenyl)methyl)benzamide (HQBA) using the Connectivity Map database suggested that it is an iron chelator that mimics the hypoxic response. HQBA chelates Fe(2+) with a dissociation constant of ∼10(-19) M, with much weaker binding to Fe(3+) and other transition metals. HQBA inhibited proliferation of multiple cell lines in culture, and blocked the progression of established spontaneous cancers in two distinct genetically engineered mouse models of mammary cancer, MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-PyMT mice, without overt toxicity. HQBA may inhibit an iron-dependent factor that regulates cell-type-specific β-catenin-driven transcription. It inhibits cancer cell proliferation independently of its effect on β-catenin signaling, as it works equally well in MMTV-PyMT tumors and diverse β-catenin-independent cell lines. HQBA is a promising specific intracellular Fe(2+) chelator with activity against spontaneous mouse mammary cancers."

Here, we report that inflammatory signaling impedes the effects of IFNα/β. Melanoma cells can secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit cellular responses to IFNα/β via activating the ligand-independent pathway for the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and accelerated degradation of the IFNAR1 chain of type I IFN receptor. Catalytic activity of the p38 protein kinase was required for IFNAR1 downregulation and inhibition of IFNα/β signaling induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1). Activation of p38 kinase inversely correlated with protein levels of IFNAR1 in clinical melanoma specimens. Inhibition of p38 kinase augmented the inhibitory effects of IFNα/β on cell viability and growth in vitro and in vivo. The roles of inflammation and p38 protein kinase in regulating cellular responses to IFNα/β in normal and tumor cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1990678347,"To identify regulators of intracellular signaling, we targeted 541 kinases and kinase-related molecules with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and determined their effects on signaling with a functional proteomics reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) platform assessing 42 phospho and total proteins. The kinome-wide screen demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between phosphorylation of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) with 115 genes that, when targeted by siRNAs, demonstrated opposite effects on MAPK and AKT phosphorylation. Network-based analysis identified the MAPK subnetwork of genes along with p70S6K and FRAP1 as the most prominent targets that increased phosphorylation of AKT, a key regulator of cell survival. The regulatory loops induced by the MAPK pathway are dependent on tuberous sclerosis complex 2 but demonstrate a lesser dependence on p70S6K than the previously identified FRAP1 feedback loop. The siRNA screen also revealed novel bi-directionality in the AKT and GSK3 (Glycogen synthase kinase 3) interaction, whereby genetic ablation of GSK3 significantly blocks AKT phosphorylation, an unexpected observation as GSK3 has only been predicted to be downstream of AKT. This method uncovered novel modulators of AKT phosphorylation and facilitated the mapping of regulatory loops."
https://openalex.org/W2072869372,"Expression of the breast cancer-associated gene 1 (BRCA1) in sporadic breast cancers is usually reduced, yet the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. To identify factors that are responsible for reduced BRCA1 expression, we screened 92 known transcription factors for their ability to regulate expression of BRCA1. Among several potential regulators, the Gli-Krueppel-related transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) showed the most dramatic transactivation of the BRCA1 promoter. YY1 binds to the promoter of BRCA1, and its overexpression resulted in increased expression of BRCA1 and a number of BRCA1 downstream genes. We further showed that overexpression of YY1 in cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation, foci formation and tumor growth in nude mice. To assess the clinical relevance between YY1 and BRCA1, we studied expression of YY1 and BRCA1 from human breast cancer samples and tissue arrays, and detected a significant positive correlation between the level of YY1 and BRCA1 expression in these cancers. Taken together, these findings suggest that YY1 is a key regulator of BRCA1 expression and may be causally linked to the molecular etiology of human breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2065544787,"Cyclooxyganase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway, is overexpressed in many cancers and contributes to cancer progression through tumor cell-autonomous and paracrine effects. Regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs) reduces the risk of cancer development and progression, in particular of the colon. The COXIB celecoxib is approved for adjunct therapy in patients with Familial adenomatous polyposis at high risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) formation. Long-term use of COXIBs, however, is associated with potentially severe cardiovascular complications, which hampers their broader use as preventive anticancer agents. In an effort to better understand the tumor-suppressive mechanisms of COXIBs, we identified MAGUK with Inverted domain structure-1 (MAGI1), a scaffolding protein implicated in the stabilization of adherens junctions, as a gene upregulated by COXIB in CRC cells and acting as tumor suppressor. Overexpression of MAGI1 in CRC cell lines SW480 and HCT116 induced an epithelial-like morphology; stabilized E-cadherin and β-catenin localization at cell-cell junctions; enhanced actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation; increased cell adhesion to matrix proteins and suppressed Wnt signaling, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion in vitro. Conversely, MAGI1 silencing decreased E-cadherin and β-catenin localization at cell-cell junctions; disrupted actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation; and enhanced Wnt signaling, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion in vitro. MAGI1 overexpression suppressed SW480 and HCT116 subcutaneous primary tumor growth, attenuated primary tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in an orthotopic model of CRC, and decreased the number and size of metastatic nodules in an experimental model of lung metastasis. Collectively, these results identify MAG1 as a COXIB-induced inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with tumor-suppressive and anti-metastatic activity in experimental colon cancer."

Familial forms of hypoKPP are predominantly caused by mutations of either voltage-gated Ca2+ or Na+ channels. The pathogenic gene mutation in non-familial hypoKPP, consisting mainly of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) and sporadic periodic paralysis (SPP), is largely unknown. Recently, mutations in KCNJ18, which encodes a skeletal muscle-specific inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir2.6, were reported in some TPP patients. Whether mutations of Kir2.6 occur in other patients with non-familial hypoKPP and how mutations of the channel predispose patients to paralysis are unknown. Here, we report one conserved heterozygous mutation in KCNJ18 in two TPP patients and two separate heterozygous mutations in two SPP patients. These mutations result in V168M, R43C, and A200P amino acid substitution of Kir2.6, respectively. Compared with the wild type channel, whole-cell currents of R43C and V168M mutants were reduced by ∼78 and 43%, respectively. No current was detected for the A200P mutant. Single channel conductance and open probability were reduced for R43C and V168M, respectively. Biotinylation assays showed reduced cell surface abundance for R43C and A200P. All three mutants exerted dominant negative inhibition on wild type Kir2.6 as well as wild type Kir2.1, another Kir channel expressed in the skeletal muscle. Thus, mutations of Kir2.6 are associated with SPP as well as TPP. We suggest that decreased outward K+ current from hypofunction of Kir2.6 predisposes the sarcolemma to hypokalemia-induced paradoxical depolarization during attacks, which in turn leads to Na+ channel inactivation and inexcitability of muscles.

https://openalex.org/W2043458577,"Translation elongation in eukaryotes is mediated by the concerted actions of elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), which delivers aminoacylated tRNA to the ribosome; elongation factor 1B (eEF1B) complex, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP to GTP on eEF1A; and eEF2, which facilitates ribosomal translocation. Here we present evidence in support of a novel mode of translation regulation by hindered tRNA delivery during mitosis. A conserved consensus phosphorylation site for the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1 on the catalytic delta subunit of eEF1B (termed eEF1D) is required for its posttranslational modification during mitosis, resulting in lower affinity to its substrate eEF1A. This modification is correlated with reduced availability of eEF1A·tRNA complexes, as well as reduced delivery of tRNA to and association of eEF1A with elongating ribosomes. This mode of regulation by hindered tRNA delivery, although first discovered in mitosis, may represent a more globally applicable mechanism employed under other physiological conditions that involve down-regulation of protein synthesis at the elongation level."
https://openalex.org/W2156151330,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2C-F result from the loss of dystrophin and the sarcoglycans, respectively. Dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein, is closely associated with the membrane-bound sarcoglycan complex. Despite this tight biochemical association, the function of dystrophin and the sarcoglycan subunits may differ. The loss of dystrophin in skeletal muscle results in muscle that is highly susceptible to contraction-induced damage, but the skeletal muscle of mice lacking γ- or δ-sarcoglycan are less susceptible. Using mouse models of DMD, LGMD-2C, and LGMD-2F, we demonstrate that isolated cardiac myocytes from mice lacking either γ- or δ-sarcoglycan have normal compliance. In contrast, dystrophin-deficient myocytes display poor passive compliance and are susceptible to terminal contracture following mild passive extensions. Mice deficient in dystrophin and, less so, δ-sarcoglycan have reduced survival during in vivo dobutamine stress testing compared to controls. Catheter-based hemodynamic studies show deficits in both baseline and dobutamine-stimulated cardiac function in all of the dystrophic mice compared to control mice, with dystrophin-deficient mice having the poorest function. In contrast, histopathology showed increased fibrosis in the sarcoglycan-deficient hearts, but not in hearts lacking dystrophin. In summary, this study provides important insights into the unique mechanisms of disease underlying these different models of inherited dystrophic cardiomyopathy and supports a model where dystrophin, but not the sarcoglycans, protects the cardiac myocyte against mechanical damage.—Townsend, D., Yasuda, S., McNally, E., Metzger, J.

Conversely, targeting enzymes that hydrolyze endocannabinoids (eCBs) allows for more precise fine-tuning of cannabinoid receptor signaling, thus providing therapeutic relief with reduced side effects. Here, we report the development and characterization of an inhibitor of eCB hydrolysis, UCM710, which augments both N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels in neurons. This compound displays a unique pharmacological profile in that it inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase and α/β-hydrolase domain 6 but not monoacylglycerol lipase. Thus, UCM710 represents a novel tool to delineate the therapeutic potential of compounds that manipulate a subset of enzymes that control eCB signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2112268545,"With conserved structural scaffold and divergent electrophysiological functions, animal toxins are considered powerful tools for investigating the basic structure-function relationship of voltage-gated sodium channels. Jingzhaotoxin-III (β-TRTX-Cj1α) is a unique sodium channel gating modifier from the tarantula Chilobrachys jingzhao, because the toxin can selectively inhibit the activation of cardiac sodium channel but not neuronal subtypes. However, the molecular basis of JZTX-III interaction with sodium channels remains unknown. In this study, we showed that JZTX-III was efficiently expressed by the secretory pathway in yeast. Alanine-scanning analysis indicated that 2 acidic residues (Asp1, Glu3) and an exposed hydrophobic patch, formed by 4 Trp residues (residues 8, 9, 28 and 30), play important roles in the binding of JZTX-III to Nav1.5. JZTX-III docked to the Nav1.5 DIIS3-S4 linker. Mutations S799A, R800A, and L804A could additively reduce toxin sensitivity of Nav1.5. We also demonstrated that the unique Arg800, not emerging in other sodium channel subtypes, is responsible for JZTX-III selectively interacting with Nav1.5. The reverse mutation D816R in Nav1.7 greatly increased the sensitivity of the neuronal subtype to JZTX-III. Conversely, the mutation R800D in Nav1.5 decreased JZTX-III's IC50 by 72-fold. Therefore, our results indicated that JZTX-III is a site 4 toxin, but does not possess the same critical residues on sodium channels as other site 4 toxins. Our data also revealed the underlying mechanism for JZTX-III to be highly specific for the cardiac sodium channel.—Rong, M., Chen, J., Tao, H., Wu, Y., Jiang, P., Lu, M., Su, H., Chi, Y., Cai, T., Zhao, L., Zeng, X., Xiao, Y., Liang, S.

Circulating blood glucose levels affect ChREBP activity in hepatocytes largely by post-translational mechanisms that include phosphorylation-dependent subcellular localization. Previously, we showed that ChREBP is retained in the cytosol by phosphorylation-dependent binding to 14-3-3 protein dimers and identified the α2 helix (residues 125–135) phospho-Ser140 domain as the primary 14-3-3 binding site (Sakiyama, H., Wynn, R.

To enter the nucleus in response to high glucose, ChREBP must bind importin-α; this heterodimer then forms a complex with importin-β to interact with the nuclear pore complex. In this work, we recharacterized the importin-α binding nuclear localization signal (NLS) of rat ChREBP, identifying it as an extended classical bipartite NLS encompassing minimally residues 158–190. Replacing Lys159/Lys190 residues of ChREBP with alanine resulted in loss of importin-α binding, glucose-stimulated transcriptional activity and nuclear localization.

These results suggest an important mechanism by which importin-α and 14-3-3 control movement of ChREBP in and out of the nucleus in response to changes in glucose levels in liver and thus further suggest that the extended NLS of ChREBP is a critical glucose-sensing, glucose-responsive site.

We also examined the effects of a common genetic variant that affects chlorproguanil metabolism on risk of treatment failure.1238 children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive CD or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and followed for 28 days. The first dose was supervised, subsequent doses given unsupervised at home. G6PD genotype was determined to assess the interaction between treatment and G6PD status in their effects on anaemia. The main endpoints were clinical treatment failure by day 28, incidence of severe anaemia (Hb<5 g/dL), and haemoglobin concentration on day 3.One third of patients treated with AL, and 6% of patients treated with CD, did not complete their course of medication. 18% (109/595) of children treated with CD and 6.1% (36/587) with AL required rescue medication within 4 weeks, risk difference 12% (95%CI 8.9%-16%). 23 children developed severe anaemia (17 (2.9%) treated with CD and 6 (1.0%) with AL, risk difference 1.8%, 95%CI 0.3%-3.4%, P = 0.02). Haemoglobin concentration on day 3 was lower among children treated with CD than AL (difference 0.43 g/dL, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.62), and within the CD group was lower among those children who had higher parasite density at enrollment. Only 17 out of 1069 children who were typed were G6PD A- deficient, of these 2/9 treated with CD and 1/8 treated with AL developed severe anaemia. 5/9 treated with CD had a fall of 2 g/dL or more in haemoglobin concentration by day 3.AL was well tolerated and highly effective and when given under operational conditions despite poor adherence to the six-dose regimen. There were more cases of severe malaria and anaemia after CD treatment although G6PD deficiency was uncommon.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00118794."

The latter-also termed parity-identified mammary epithelial cells (PI-MECs)-are marked by beta-galactosidase (β Gal) expression following pregnancy and involution in whey acidic protein promoter (WAP)-Cre/Rosa26-flox-stop-flox-lacZ (WC/R26) mice, and are the targets of tumorigenic transformation in mouse mammary tumor virus-erbB2 transgenic mice. In this study, we demonstrate that an epithelial population distinct from PI-MECs is transformed during WAP-Int3 tumorigenesis. As expected, WAP-Int3/WC/R26 triple-transgenic mice failed to undergo secretory alveolar development, failed to lactate and developed mammary tumors. Following pregnancy and involution, β Gal+ mammary epithelial cells were found in the normal mammary tissue, but the resulting mammary tumors were all β Gal-. WAP-Int3/WC/R26 mammary glands contained ample estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)+ MECs, but only rare (<1%) progesterone receptor (PR)+ and RANKL+ cells. In addition, dissociated MECs from WAP-Int3/WC/R26 glands failed to regenerate a mammary tree upon transplantation into a cleared fat-pad of a nu/nu recipient mouse. However, when mixed with normal MECs, PI-MECs from WAP-Int3/WC/R26 mice contributed progeny to the resulting functional outgrowth. The WAP-Int3/WC/R26-derived PI-MECs displayed all of the properties of fully functional lobular progenitors including giving rise to ERα+, PR+, smooth muscle actin+ and RANKL+ epithelial progeny. These results demonstrate that WAP-Int3 has no oncogenic effect upon PI-MECs and that the expansion of functional lobular progenitors is required for secretory alveolar development and lactation. Furthermore, lobular progenitor function is ultimately controlled by signals within its microenvironment."

Moreover, the regulatory mechanism of these enzymes may vary. Hence, a systematic approach is most suitable for understanding highly branched pathways. We examined how currently unclear branching points on glycan biosynthesis are regulated by using a phenotype-genotype analysis.

Expression of GSL is a regulated event, as only a limited number of GSLs occur in a particular cell type in a given state (3van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The first step of GSL biosynthesis is controlled by the cytosol-facing enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase, which biosynthesizes glucosylceramide (GlcCer) from ceramide (10Lannert H. Gorgas K.

The commitment for various series of GSL biosynthesis takes place at the usage of LacCer, a common precursor for complex GSLs. Globo series GSLs are biosynthesized by CD77/Gb3 synthase (CD77Syn; encoded by A4GALT) (15Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J.

Ohta M. Watanabe Y. Matsuda K. Ishiyama K. Sakoe K. Nakamura M. Inokuchi J. Sanai Y. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31652-31655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Due to the complexity of branching at LacCer, the identification of the regulatory mechanisms of GSL expression has been a major challenge, even after identification of the enzymes involved (Fig. 1A) (19Levine T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ganglio series biosynthesis may be an efficient enzyme step because LacCerSyn and GM3Syn participate in multienzyme complexes, by which channeling of LacCer to the GM3Syn reaction may occur (20Giraudo C.G.

This complex, however, may change its sub-Golgi compartment localization in response to other expressed proteins (22Uliana A.S. Crespo P.M. Martina J.A. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32852-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Quintero C.A. Valdez-Taubas J. Ferrari M.L. Haedo S.D. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the regulatory mechanism has not yet been fully clarified. Nevertheless, GSL expression is regulated by various cellular events, such as the activation of human B cells in the germinal center (24Schwartz-Albiez R. Dörken B. Möller P. Brodin N.T. Monner D.A. Kniep B. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Different GSL species appear to function in cellular signaling events, although individual functional differences have not been fully explored. Moreover, the expressions of particular GSL species are targeted by various bacterial toxins, and thus have pathological significance. For example, the shiga toxin, cholera toxin, and heat-labile enterotoxin targets CD77, GM1, and GD1a, respectively (Fig. 1A) (25Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp.

The expressions of many cellular phenotypes are mainly controlled by the regulation of gene expression (28Barton N.H. Keightley P.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Correlation index-based responsible enzyme gene screening (CIRES) is a novel systematic strategy to quantitatively assess the phenotype-genotype correlation. This method was developed to identify genetically dominant enzyme gene(s) that may quantitatively regulate the expression of cell surface glycans (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CIRES involves the statistical comparison of multisample profiles between genotypes (glycan-related gene expression profiles obtained by DNA microarray) and cell surface phenotypes (glycan expression). Correlations found between these profiles are used to build hypotheses, and subsequent genetic manipulation of cells provides experimental verification (Fig. 1B). CIRES has been successfully used to screen glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the level of glycan expression on the cell surface (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Naito Y. Takematsu H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Yamaji T. Hashimoto Y. Itohara S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3008-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, we used CIRES to analyze other complicated GSL biosynthetic pathways, with a focus on the regulation of branching. We analyzed the branching point of LacCer in GSL biosynthesis using CIRES to understand the genetic characteristics of the branching regulatory mechanism, which is a frequent subject of biochemical studies. Our genetic analyses of B cell lines revealed that the globo series dominated the ganglio series in this biosynthetic pathway at the branching point of the common precursor, LacCer. This genetic dominance is based on LacCerSyn regulation by CD77Syn. In contrast, actual consumption of LacCer to biosynthesize Gb3/CD77 is not required for the suppression of ganglio series biosynthesis. Thus, this study proposes a novel mechanism for LacCerSyn regulation at the branching point of the biosynthetic pathway. The Namalwa and Ramos B cell lines were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS), sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and 2-mercaptoethanol. COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Retrovirus was produced by transient transfection of modified pMSCV vectors (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to Plat-A amphotropic packaging cells (31Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) using the calcium-phosphate method as previously reported (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The various plasmid DNAs used in this study are summarized under supplemental Table S2. Aspartic acid residues in the DXD motif of CD77Syn (residues 192 and 194) were point mutated to threonine residues by PCR-based mutagenesis to give rise to the CD77Syn-TXT mutant. CHO-K1 cells were successively transfected with three vectors harboring resistance genes to antibiotics obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Invivogen (San Diego, CA): G418 (1000 μg/ml), blasticidin (10 μg/ml), and zeocin (125 μg/ml). Biotin-xx-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit was obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-CD77 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 38-13) was obtained from IMMUNOTECH (Marseille, France). Anti-giantin rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) (RPB-114C) were kindly provided by Dr. H-M. Shin (Kyoto University). Anti-GM130 (clone 35) and calnexin (clone 37) were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Anti-HA mAb (HA.11) was from Covance (Berkeley, CA) and anti-HA PAb (y-11) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG mAb (M2) and anti-PDI pAb (P7496) were from Sigma. The following labeled probes were used to detect signals: anti-rat IgM (phycoerythrin, Rockland), streptavidin (phycoerythrin, Caltag), anti-mouse IgG1 (Alexa 488, Invitrogen), anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa 568, Invitrogen, or HRP, DAKO), and anti-mouse IgG (HRP, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Approximately 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of FACS buffer (1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 in PBS(−)) were incubated with anti-glycan probes at room temperature for 1 h. Secondary staining was carried out for 30 min. Data were obtained using FACScan (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tristar, San Carlos, CA). For cross-comparison of the staining signal among cell lines with different autofluorescence, the mean florescence intensity (MFI) of background staining was roughly adjusted to MFI = 10 and the relative staining signal was expressed as a ratio of staining MFI divided by control MFI as previously reported (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Other than the use of different glycan-binding probes, the correlation index analyses involved in the CIRES procedure, which included a systematic comparison of the relative profiles of gene expression obtained by cDNA microarray and glycan expression obtained by FCM in six cell lines, were essentially the same as those previously reported (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Naito Y. Takematsu H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Yamaji T. Hashimoto Y. Itohara S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3008-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A full list of the gene expression profiles used to estimate Pearson correlation coefficients is available as a supplemental table in previous reports (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Naito Y. Takematsu H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y.

MSCVs carrying the intended glycosyltransferases were prepared by transient transfection of the modified MSCV vector, pMSCV-IRES-EGFP, which bicistronically encodes an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame under control of an internal ribosomal entry site. Vectors were transiently transfected into a Plat-A packaging cell line (31Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) and culture supernatant was filtered and used for spin infection. Infected cells were cultured for 2 weeks to stabilize expression and stained with anti-glycan probe, whereby a GFP-positive population was regarded as containing gene-transferred cells and GFP-negative cells were considered controls. Thus, a mixture of both populations was stained in a single tube for two-color FCM. The resultant MFI for phycoerythrin was used as an indication of the cell-surface expression of the glycan epitope. Staining of the GFP-negative population was monitored to confirm that it was similar to that of non-infected/vector-infected cells. This method ensured reliable staining with anti-glycan probes to evaluate quantitative differences in glycan expression. The GFP-positive population of retrovirus-infected cells was sorted by FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences) to enrich glycosyltransferase-expressing cells. Cellular GSLs were isolated as previously reported (32Saito T. Hakomori S.I. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, neutral GSLs contained in the lower phase of the Folch partition were per-acetylated and purified with a Florisil column, whereas the acidic GSL fraction was prepared by repeated partitioning with the salt-containing upper phase of the Folch partition. GSL fractions equivalent to 1 mg of cellular protein were applied to a silica-based TLC plate and separated with a solvent (chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2, 60:35:8). Orcinol was used for the visualization of sugar moieties in GSLs and charring was carried out to gain sensitivity for the detection after orcinol staining (33Kyogashima M. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Ehara T. Li G. Hu R. Hara A. Aoyama T. Kannagi R. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For detection of GM1, 670 ng/ml of biotinylated CTxB was overlaid and the signal was detected with Konica Immunostain HRP-1000 (Seikagaku). This system could detect roughly 30 ng of GM1 on TLC plate. COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with C-terminal HA-tagged glycosyltransferases harboring the CMV promoter for expression with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection to avoid overexpression of glycosyltransferases. Cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Slips were blocked with 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS and stained with anti-HA tag antibody (HA.11) and organelle markers. Fluorescent images were obtained using an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus, ×100 objective lens) equipped with a CCD camera (Cool SNAP HQ/OL; Photometrics) and Methamolph software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The obtained images were subsequently processed with Photoshop software (Adobe). To avoid overexpression-induced mislocalization of glycosyltransferase, cells with moderate HA.11 signals were chosen to obtain images, although strongly stained cells also showed essentially the same staining pattern 30 h post-transfection. The use of COS-7 cells resulted in a more defined intracellular localization of the Golgi-localized enzyme when compared with that of CHO-K1, HeLa, or HT1080 cells. Thus, the images of transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed in detail. LacCerSyn-FLAG was transiently co-transfected with CD77Syn-HA or GM3Syn into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by trypsinization. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and lysed with sonication in TDE lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). Post-nuclear supernatants were ultracentrifuged (55,000 rpm for 30 min) in MLA-130 rotor (Beckman) and the resultant pellets were sonicated in TL buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture to extract the membrane fraction of the cells. The ultracentrifuge supernatants of these membrane extracts were used as membrane fractions. These were immunoprecipitated with either HA.11 (anti HA antibody) or M2 (anti-FLAG antibody) and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and co-immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with M2 or y-11, respectively. To assess competition between GM3Syn-HA and non-tagged CD77Syn/CD77Syn-TXT in complex formation with LacCerSyn-FLAG, the respective genes were successively introduced to CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells were employed because this cell line tends to stably hold introduced transgenes. To ensure polyclonality of the cells, a double transfectant clone (expressing LacCerSyn-FLAG and GM3Syn-HA) of CHO-K1 cells (selected with G418 and blasticidin) was transfected with the third constructs and polyclonally selected with zeocin. The polyclonal triple stable cells described above were metabolically pulse labeled with [35S]cysteine and methionine (EXPRE35S35S Protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min and chased in the medium containing enriched cold cysteine and methionine for the indicated times. Cells were recovered with trypsinization and frozen in a deep freezer as cell packs. Cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100 (1% each) containing lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. The amounts of cell lysate used for immunoprecipitation were adjusted according to the size of the cell pack. Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and the signals of the visualized bands were quantified with BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo) after the gels were dried. Within the biosynthetic pathway of GSLs, LacCer can be used by a variety of enzymes to give rise to various series of GSLs. Therefore, this branching point in the pathway could be interpreted as the point of lineage commitment to specific biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1A). CIRES may be useful for understanding the regulation of glycan biosynthesis at pathway branching positions given its ability to identify regulatory enzyme genes even when the enzyme reaction is not directly involved in the formation of the glycan in question (29Yamamoto H. Takematsu H. Fujinawa R. Naito Y. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The B subunits of two bacterial toxins, the shiga toxin and cholera toxin, were employed to probe CD77 and GM1, respectively, in FCM. When the relative expression of a panel of six B cell lines was compared, the staining profiles of CD77 and GM1 were distinct. CD77 was strongly expressed in the germinal center-like B lymphomas Daudi, Ramos, and Raji (Fig. 2A), whereas prominent expression of GM1 was found only in Namalwa cells (Fig. 2A) that lacked expression of CD77. Given that the shiga toxin B subunit and the anti-CD77 antibody showed identical staining patterns for these cell lines, we used anti-CD77 for the remainder of the study. The GSL expression profiles were compared with the gene expression profiles for glycan-related genes in identical sets of cell lines. The expression profile of the CD77Syn (A4GALT) gene positively correlated (r = 0.83) with that of CD77 and negatively correlated with that of GM1 (r = −0.75; Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). In contrast, none of the gene expression profiles for GM3Syn (ST3GAL5), GM2 synthase (B4GALNT4), or GM1 synthase (B3GALT4) exhibited significant positive correlations, although these are genes whose products are involved in actual GM1 biosynthesis. A full list of the correlated glycan-related genes is provided under supplemental Table S1. Here, we focus on the presence of the negative correlation because such a relationship may be attributable to unexpected regulatory mechanisms. First, we hypothesized that the CD77Syn reaction would dominate at the branching point using LacCer. Consistent with this hypothesis, retrovirus-mediated ectopic expression of CD77Syn changed the expression profile of GSL in Namalwa cells, where induction of CD77 (Fig. 2C) and concomitant reduction of GM1 was found in FCM (Fig. 2D). In this assay, we utilized a vector in which EGFP is conjugated with an internal ribosomal entry site to monitor glycosyltransferase gene expression, which provided an internal staining control in the same tube. Moreover, when GFP-positive populations were pooled by a cell sorter and their GSL fractions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), prominent induction of CD77 and reduction of GM3 were observed upon CD77Syn expression (Fig. 2E). When CTxB was overlaid, a reduction in the GM1 band was also observed (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that CD77Syn controls a global change in the GSL lineage. In contrast to the Namalwa cells, the introduction of CD77Syn to Ramos cells had a minimal effect on GSL biosynthesis (Fig. 2F). We reasoned that strong endogenous expression of CD77Syn (Fig. 2B) could be responsible for the lack of effect in Ramos cells because the total flow of GSL biosynthesis is less likely to be changed by further introduction of CD77Syn. To determine the regulatory competence of other glycosyltransferases on the GSL biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1A), we also introduced genes encoding synthases for GlcCer, LacCer, GM3, GM2, GM1, and Lc3 to Namalwa and Ramos cells (Fig. 3, A–D). GM3Syn may occur in alternatively spliced forms (34Uemura S. Yoshida S. Shishido F. Inokuchi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3088-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because RT-PCR analysis showed that both Namalwa and Ramos cells expressed the longer isoform of GM3Syn, we used the cDNA of this isoform for further examinations. Consistent with the correlation results, introduction of the CD77Syn gene had the most prominent effect on the expression of both GM1 and CD77 in Namalwa cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In Ramos cells, in which CD77Syn is endogenously expressed, overexpression of GlcCer synthase had the most prominent effect; i.e. a greater than 6-fold increase in CD77 expression was detected without altering the GM1 expression, indicating that GlcCer synthase determines the total flow of GSL biosynthesis in Ramos cells (Fig. 3C). The GSL fraction of the GlcCer synthase-infected GFP-positive pool also exhibited clear induction of CD77 by TLC analysis, whereby a subtle increase in GlcCer but not LacCer or ganglio series GSL was noted (Fig. 3E). This was consistent with the hypothesis that LacCer utilization can be determined by the expression of CD77Syn. In Ramos cells, GM3Syn increased the expression of GM1 up to 4-fold (Fig. 3D). Thus, the abundant expression of GM3Syn was somewhat able to overcome dominance to use LacCer for ganglio series GSLs. These results suggest the presence of simple competition among enzymes to utilize LacCer at the biosynthetic branch. However, previous reports have indicated that branching enzymes CD77Syn, Lc3Syn, and GM3Syn exhibit the same order of Km values toward LacCer, although the reports varied in their values, i.e. 54.5 μm for CD77Syn (15Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol.
