https://openalex.org/W3156243989,"Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan. An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines' acceptability. A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488, 95CI% = 1.834-3.375, p < .001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI% = 1.306-3.174, p = .002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 9.258, 95CI% = 6.020-14.237, p < .001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR = 19.223, 95CI% = 13.665-27.042, p < .001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR = 0.376, 95CI% = 0.233-0.607, p < .001) and employed participants (OR = 0.542, 95CI% = 0.405-0.725, p < .001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR = 0.502, 95CI% = 0.356-0.709, p < .001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR = 0.271, 95CI% = 0.183-0.400, p < .001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Systematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines' hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production."

Here, we investigate the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective autophagy shown to degrade neurodegeneration-related proteins, in neuronal proteostasis. Using mouse models with systemic and neuronal-specific CMA blockage, we demonstrate that loss of neuronal CMA leads to altered neuronal function, selective changes in the neuronal metastable proteome, and proteotoxicity, all reminiscent of brain aging. Imposing CMA loss on a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has synergistic negative effects on the proteome at risk of aggregation, thus increasing neuronal disease vulnerability and accelerating disease progression. Conversely, chemical enhancement of CMA ameliorates pathology in two different AD experimental mouse models. We conclude that functional CMA is essential for neuronal proteostasis through the maintenance of a subset of the proteome with a higher risk of misfolding than the general proteome.

We conclude that functional CMA is essential for neuronal proteostasis through the maintenance of a subset of the proteome with a higher risk of misfolding than the general proteome. All cells rely on intracellular surveillance systems to maintain their proteome’s homeostasis (proteostasis). These systems are especially important in neurons that, due to their postmitotic status, are highly sensitive to proteotoxic insults (Nixon, 2013Nixon R.A.

Decreased neuronal protein quality control with age increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (Douglas and Dillin, 2010Douglas P.M. Dillin A.

In fact, the presence of protein aggregates is a common feature in neurodegenerative patient brains (Bourdenx et al., 2017Bourdenx M. Koulakiotis N.S. Sanoudou D. Bezard E. Dehay B. Tsarbopoulos A.

The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Defective autophagy, one of the components of the proteostasis network, associates with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Menzies et al., 2017Menzies F.M.

Macroautophagy has been proven necessary for maintenance of neuronal proteostasis and protection against neurodegeneration (Hara et al., 2006Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y.

Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). This work focuses on chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a pathway for selective degradation of single proteins in lysosomes (Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018Kaushik S. Cuervo A.M. The coming of age of chaperone-mediated autophagy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Lysosomal targeting is triggered when the cytosolic chaperone heat-shock cognate 71 kDa (Hsc70) recognizes a pentapeptide (KFERQ-like motif) in the substrate protein sequence. Once at the lysosome, the substrate/chaperone complex binds the cytosolic tail of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (L2A), which triggers L2A multimerization into a translocation complex for lysosomal internalization of substrate proteins for degradation. L2A is the only isoform of the three spliced protein variants of the Lamp2 gene (Gough et al., 1995Gough N.R. Hatem C.L. Fambrough D.M. The family of LAMP-2 proteins arises by alternative splicing from a single gene: characterization of the avian LAMP-2 gene and identification of mammalian homologs of LAMP-2b and LAMP-2c.DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that participates in CMA (Cuervo and Dice, 2000Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Regulation of lamp2a levels in the lysosomal membrane.Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). CMA contributes to the degradation of pathogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as α-synuclein (α-syn) or tau (Caballero et al., 2018Caballero B. Wang Y. Diaz A. Tasset I. Juste Y.R. Stiller B. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cuervo A.M.

Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Impaired degradation of mutant alpha-synuclein by chaperone-mediated autophagy.Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Pathogenic variants of these proteins (mutations, or aberrant posttranslational modifications) are targeted to lysosomes via CMA, but they fail to translocate and ultimately block CMA (Caballero et al., 2018Caballero B. Wang Y. Diaz A. Tasset I. Juste Y.R. Stiller B. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cuervo A.M.

Abberant alpha-synuclein confers toxicity to neurons in part through inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the consequences of the reduced neuronal CMA activity observed in the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, considering that multiple types of autophagy coexist in all cells, it is not clear if there is some level of redundancy or if each of them maintains a specific subproteome. In this work, we knocked out L2A in mice systemically or specifically in neurons to analyze the contribution of CMA to maintenance of the neuronal proteome. We found that neuronal CMA loss leads to profound quantitative and qualitative alterations of the neuronal proteome that result in deregulation of important neuronal functions. Using comparative quantitative proteomics, we identified the subproteome dependent on CMA activity as different from the one depending on functional macroautophagy. We show that CMA is inhibited in experimental models of tauopathies and AD patient brains at an early disease stage and that experimental inhibition of CMA in a mouse model of AD-related proteotoxicity accelerates disease progression through a synergistic negative impact on the proteome at risk of aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chemical upregulation of CMA in two different mouse models of AD, with tau pathology or combined tau and β-amyloid pathologies, reduces brain pathology and improves disease phenotype. Our findings highlight the contribution of CMA to neuronal proteostasis, demonstrate that CMA deficiency in the aging brain is an aggravating factor in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, and provide proof of concept for the value of targeting CMA as therapeutic strategy in these conditions. We generated a neuronal-specific CMA-deficient mouse model (CKL2A−/− mice) by removing L2A in excitatory neurons (expressing calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α [CaMKIIα]). We bred L2Aflox/flox mice (Schneider et al., 2014Schneider J.L. Suh Y. Cuervo A.M.

As comparison, we used whole-body L2A knockout (hereafter named L2A−/−) mice. We confirmed the selective deletion of L2A and not other Lamp2 isoforms in both mouse models (Figures S1B–S1D; the remaining L2A signal in CKL2A−/− mice originates from other brain cell types). Both mouse models were born at Mendelian frequency and proportional male/female ratios, and only L2A−/− mice showed an initial delay in body weight gain that normalized by 6 months (Figure S1E). Transgenic mice displayed a discrete reduction in life expectancy that was more noticeable for CKL2A−/− mice (Figure S1F). Behavioral testing revealed higher scores and faster hindlimb clasping progression, a phenotype of neurological disorder models (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B.

Both mouse models showed higher latency in the negative geotaxis test, indicative of vestibular/sensorimotor dysfunction (Figure S1J) and reduced short-term memory in a Y-maze (Figures S1K and S1L). Interestingly, only L2A−/− mice displayed impaired locomotion, as evidenced by (1) hyperlocomotion in the open field, reminiscent of some AD models (Min et al., 2015Min S.-W. Chen X. Tracy T.E. Li Y.

Methods. 2002; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, CKL2A−/− mice displayed a trend toward reduced spatial working memory (Figure S1Q) and significant reduction in nest building (Figures S1R and S1S), a common phenotype of neurodegeneration in mice (Hernandez et al., 2019Hernandez I. Luna G. Rauch J.N. Reis S.A. Giroux M. Karch C.M. Boctor D. Sibih Y.E. Storm N.J.

Overall, loss of CMA in only excitatory neurons reproduced most of the behavioral outputs observed upon systemic loss of CMA. By 6 months of age, both mice with systemic or neuronal-specific CMA loss showed thicknesses of CA1, dentate gyrus, and cortex as well as hippocampal surface undistinguishable from their respective CTR littermates (Figures 1A–1D and S2A–S2D). Number of astrocytes and microglia was unchanged in the hippocampus of L2A−/− and CKL2A−/− mice (Figures S2E and S2F), and only a small increase of astrocyte area was noticeable in CKL2A−/− mice (Figure S3A).Figure S2Consequence of systemic CMA blockage in brain proteostasis, related to Figures 1 and S1Show full caption(A-D) Nuclear staining with DAPI to assess thickness and area of different brain regions in 6 months old CTR and L2A−/− mice.

Low (left) and high magnification (right) images of CKL2A−/− mice cortex to highlight accumulation of electrodense material (yellow arrows) and presence of autophagic vacuoles (green arrows) in the proximity (K). Bottom shows examples of cytosolic and membrane surrounded (inside vesicles) electrodense material (K). Scale bar: 1μm for full fields and 0.20μm for insets. Data are mean ± s.e.m. and individual values from n = 4-5 per group. Comparisons were made using unpaired t test. See also Data S1. Analysis of overall cellular proteostasis revealed lipofuscin deposits (cross-linked oxidized proteins and lipids) (Figure S2G) and K63-linked ubiquitinated proteins inclusions, which are usually targets of lysosomal degradation (Kraft et al., 2010Kraft C. Peter M. Hofmann K. Selective autophagy: ubiquitin-mediated recognition and beyond.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Figures S2H and S2I), in the hippocampus of L2A−/− mice at 6 months of age. Similar features were noticeable at this early age in excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of CKL2A−/− mice (Figures 1E and 1F; CaMKIIα staining shown in Figure S3B), but not in regions occupied mostly by interneurons (i.e., the stratum radiatum) or in glial cells (Figures S3C–S3E). Immunoblot analysis of CKL2A−/− mice cortex revealed accumulation of oxidized proteins (Figure 1G), hydroxynonenal protein adducts (Figure S3F), and ubiquitinated proteins, specifically with K63 linkage (Figure 1H), further supporting that loss of CMA results in profound disruption of neuronal proteostasis. To analyze the extent of proteome compromise upon neuronal CMA blockage, we isolated the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from the cortex of CTR and CKL2A−/− mice and performed comparative quantitative proteomics. We found a significant enrichment of proteins in the insoluble fraction of CKL2A−/− mice brains (Cohen’s d = 0.24; Figure 1I; Table S1). Most insoluble proteins (76%) contained KFERQ-like motifs, mainly those that do not require posttranslational modifications for hsc70 recognition (~52% in CKL2A−/− sarkosyl-insoluble fraction versus ~47% in the whole murine proteome; Kirchner et al., 2019Kirchner P. Bourdenx M. Madrigal-Matute J. Tiano S. Diaz A. Bartholdy B.A. Will B. Cuervo A.M. Proteome-wide analysis of chaperone-mediated autophagy targeting motifs.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17: e3000301Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Figure S3G). Prone-to-aggregate proteins bearing KFERQ-like motifs such as α-syn, tau, UCHL1, and PARK7 displayed a shift toward insolubility in CKL2A−/− brains, whereas this was not the case for SOD1, which lacks the motif (Figure 1J). The only exception was UCHL1 (Figure 1J), which, interestingly, bears a phosphorylation-generated motif. To investigate the status of the supersaturated proteome (the one at risk of aggregation due to protein concentrations close to their solubility limit; Ciryam et al., 2013Ciryam P. Tartaglia G.G.

Over 2,500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected in the United States (US) since December 2020, but the extent of establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, California, and Florida. Furthermore, we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 establishments starting in early December 2020, followed by interstate spread by the end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in many states by mid- to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response."

Public health institutions will need early warning of any uptick in cases to prepare and deploy interventions as required. Riley et al. developed a community-wide program that was designed to detect resurgence at low prevalence and has been used to track SARS-CoV-2 virus across England. In the four rounds of sampling from May to September 2020, almost 600,000 people representative of all communities were monitored. The results revealed the greatest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds, with increasing incidence among older age groups and elevated odds of infection among some communities. This testing approach offers a model for the type of real-time, country-wide population-based surveillance work that needs to be conducted to monitor SARS-CoV-2. Science , abf0874, this issue p. 990"

Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a massive global health problem. Many infected patients exhibit mild symptoms, but a substantial number of patients, in particular older patients and those with additional risk factors, develop severe disease (1Zhou P. Yang X.L.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is incorporated into the viral envelope and mediates viral entry into target cells.

Here, we tested whether ambroxol, that is, trans-4-[(2,4-dibromanilin-6-yl)-methyamino]-cyclohexanol, a drug that fits with the aforementioned structural requirements, inhibits acid sphingomyelinase and can thus be repurposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ambroxol contains a lipophilic organic ring system that is connected to a tertiary amine via a short spacer and, therefore, is a potential functional inhibitor of the acid sphingomyelinase. Ambroxol is a mucolytic drug that is used for the treatment of diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract. It has almost no side effects. As an infection system, we used replication-deficient VSV pseudoviral particles (pp-VSV) presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on their surface, abbreviated pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike (22Hoffmann M.

These events were blocked by pretreatment with low doses of ambroxol. In accordance, ambroxol prevented cellular entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. More importantly, we obtained nasal epithelial cells from volunteers prior and after inhalation with ambroxol and infected the cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. These in vivo/ex vivo experiments demonstrated that inhalation of ambroxol is sufficient to reduce acid sphingomyelinase activity in nasal epithelial cells in vivo and to prevent infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike ex vivo. Addition of purified acid sphingomyelinase or C16 ceramide restored infection of ambroxol-treated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. To test whether ambroxol inhibits the acid sphingomyelinase, we incubated Vero-E6 epithelial cells with increasing doses of ambroxol and determined the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase in cell lysates. Ambroxol induced a dose-dependent reduction of the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase in Vero-E6 cells (Fig. 1A). Ambroxol did not show toxicity until 50 μM concentration, whereas higher concentrations such as 75 μM started to show some toxicity as evidenced by flow cytometry studies of untreated and ambroxol-treated cells stained with FITC–annexin V (Roche; Fig. 1B). Next, we investigated whether pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike induces an activation of the acid sphingomyelinase in Vero-E6 cells and whether this increase is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with ambroxol. Infection of the cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike resulted in a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase that peaked 30 min after infection (Fig. 2A), consistent with previously reported data (14Carpinteiro A. Edwards M.J. Hoffmann M. Kochs G. Gripp B. Weigang S. Adams C. Carpinteiro E. Gulbins A. Keitsch S. Sehl C. Soddemann M. Wilker B. Kamler M.

Med. 2020; 1: 100142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The increase of acid sphingomyelinase activity upon infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike was prevented by preincubation with ambroxol (Fig. 2A). Ambroxol had no effect on acid ceramidase activity (not shown). We have previously shown that incubation of epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike triggers a release of ceramide that is essential for cellular infection with the virus (14Carpinteiro A. Edwards M.J. Hoffmann M. Kochs G. Gripp B. Weigang S. Adams C. Carpinteiro E. Gulbins A. Keitsch S. Sehl C. Soddemann M. Wilker B. Kamler M.

Med. 2020; 1: 100142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here, we confirm these data and show that infection of Vero-E6 cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike results in a release of C16/C18 ceramide as well as C22/C24 ceramide (Fig. 2B). The release of ceramide upon infection is prevented by pretreatment with ambroxol (Fig. 2B). We observed a complete inhibition of infection-induced ceramide formation at 25 μM, but already concentrations of 15 to 20 μM ambroxol reduced or almost abrogated ceramide formation upon infection (Fig. 2B). Ambroxol did not change basal ceramide concentrations of the cells. We have previously shown that ceramide molecules form large ceramide-enriched membrane domains that serve to trap and cluster receptor molecules, thereby facilitating signaling via these receptors (10Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. CD95 signaling via ceramide-rich membrane rafts.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that infection of Vero-E6 cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike results in the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane domains that cluster ACE2 (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that they serve as platforms to allow infection of the cells. We have previously shown that sphingosine also inhibits infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 (23Edwards M.J. Becker K.A. Gripp B. Hoffmann M. Keitsch S. Wilker B. Soddemann M. Gulbins A. Carpinteiro E. Patel S.H. Wilson G.C. Pöhlmann S. Walter S. Fassbender K. Ahmad S.A. et al.Sphingosine prevents binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike to its cellular receptor ACE2.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15174-15182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether ambroxol alters cellular sphingosine concentrations. The results demonstrate that even high concentrations of ambroxol did not change cellular sphingosine (not shown). The blockade of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike–dependent activation of acid sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide release by ambroxol promoted us to investigate whether ambroxol also inhibits entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Vero-E6 cells were pretreated with ambroxol for 60 min, washed, and then infected with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike for 60 min. The results indicate that 10 μM or 15 to 20 μM ambroxol reduced viral entry by approximately 50% or 80 to 90%, respectively, and 25 μM ambroxol completely blocked entry (Fig. 4, A and B). Infection with higher concentrations of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike was also blocked by ambroxol (Fig. 4B). Addition of purified acid sphingomyelinase that generates endogenous ceramide or 10 μM exogenous C16 ceramide restored viral entry (Fig. 4A) indicating that ambroxol acted via inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase and the release of ceramide. In contrast, addition of sphingomyelin did not alter infection with pp-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4B). Next, we neutralized ceramide with two different anti-ceramide antibodies or by incubation with ceramidase and show that these treatments also prevent viral uptake (Fig. 4B). Treatment of Caco-2 cells with ambroxol or genetic downregulation of the acid sphingomyelinase in Caco-2 cells also resulted in an inhibition of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 uptake, which was restored by C16 ceramide (Fig. 4C). Addition of ambroxol to C16 ceramide–treated acid sphingomyelinase downregulated cells did not further affect viral uptake supporting the notion that ambroxol specifically acts by targeting the acid sphingomyelinase. Controls with pp-VSV-G, which does not activate the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system and does not employ this system for cellular infection as previously shown (14Carpinteiro A. Edwards M.J. Hoffmann M. Kochs G. Gripp B. Weigang S. Adams C. Carpinteiro E. Gulbins A. Keitsch S. Sehl C. Soddemann M. Wilker B. Kamler M.

Med. 2020; 1: 100142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), demonstrated that pp-VSV-G entry was not modulated by ambroxol (Fig. 4A), indicating that ambroxol specifically blocks entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike by inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system. We next examined whether our findings made with a cell line are recapitulated with primary human respiratory epithelial cells. To this end, we isolated nasal epithelial cells from volunteers, treated them with 25 μM ambroxol for 60 min, or left the cells untreated and determined the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase and infection of the cells. Ambroxol reduced the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase in uninfected cells by approximately 50% and prevented the stimulation of the acid sphingomyelinase upon exposure to pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5A). Ambroxol blocked the entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike into freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 5B) and addition of purified acid sphingomyelinase, or 10 μM C16 ceramide restored entry of the viral particles into ambroxol-treated cells (Fig. 5B). To simulate the effects of ambroxol on infection as closely as possible to treatment of patients, we isolated nasal epithelial cells from volunteers. The volunteers then inhaled 2 ml ambroxol (7.5 mg/ml), and nasal epithelial cells were again isolated from the opposite nasal cavity 60 min after inhalation and inoculated with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike ex vivo for 60 min. Cells were washed, and infectious entry was determined after incubation for 24 h. In addition, we determined the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase in nasal epithelial cells prior and after inhalation of ambroxol. These studies revealed that inhalation of ambroxol in vivo markedly reduced the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase in nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 6A). Infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 for 30 min resulted in an activation of the acid sphingomyelinase (Fig. 6A) and a release of ceramide (Fig. 6B), events that were blocked by a previous ambroxol inhalation. Infection also resulted in clustering of ACE2"

We analyzed whether and how life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, and life meaning changed during the outbreak. First, we found that the well-being of Koreans changed daily in a cubic fashion, such that it declined and recovered during the early phase but declined substantially during the later phase (after COVID- 19 was declared world pandemic by WHO). Second, unlike other emotions, boredom displayed a distinctive pattern of linear increase, especially for younger people, suggesting that boredom might be, in part, responsible for their inability to comply with social distancing recommendations. Third, the well-being of older people and males changed less compared to younger people and females. Finally, daily well-being dropped significantly more in the hard-hit regions than in other regions. Implications and limitations are discussed."

Online social media such as Twitter, the focus of this study, provide an avenue to study public engagement and digital media dissemination related to climate change. Sharing a link to an online article is an indicator of media engagement. Aggregated link-sharing forms a network structure which maps collective media engagement by the user population. Here we construct bipartite networks linking Twitter users to the web pages they shared, using a dataset of approximately 5.3 million English-language tweets by almost 2 million users during an eventful seven-week period centred on the announcement of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Community detection indicates that the observed information-sharing network can be partitioned into two weakly connected components, representing subsets of articles shared by a group of users. We characterise these partitions through analysis of web domains and text content from shared articles, finding them to be broadly described as a left-wing/environmentalist group and a right-wing/climate sceptic group. Correlation analysis shows a striking positive association between left/right political ideology and environmentalist/sceptic climate ideology respectively. Looking at information-sharing over time, there is considerable turnover in the engaged user population and the articles that are shared, but the web domain sources and polarised network structure are relatively persistent. This study provides evidence that online sharing of news media content related to climate change is both polarised and politicised, with implications for opinion dynamics and public debate around this important societal challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3157086301,"Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). PRDX4 is the only peroxiredoxin located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is the most highly expressed H2O2 scavenger in the ER. PRDX4 has emerged as an important player in numerous diseases, such as fibrosis and metabolic syndromes, and its overoxidation is a potential indicator of ER redox stress. It is unclear how overoxidation of PRDX4 governs its oligomerization state and interacting partners. Herein, we addressed these questions via nonreducing Western blots, mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis. We report that the oxidation of PRDX4 in lung epithelial cells treated with tertbutyl hydroperoxide caused a shift of PRDX4 from monomer/dimer to high molecular weight (HMW) species, which contain PRDX4 modified with sulfonic acid residues (PRDX4-SO3), as well as of a complement of ER-associated proteins, including protein disulfide isomerases important in protein folding, thioredoxin domain–containing protein 5, and heat shock protein A5, a key regulator of the ER stress response. Mutation of any of the four cysteines in PRDX4 altered the HMW species in response to tertbutyl hydroperoxide as well as the secretion of PRDX4. We also demonstrate that the expression of ER oxidoreductase 1 alpha, which generates H2O2 in the ER, increased PRDX4 HMW formation and secretion. These results suggest a link between SO3 modification in the formation of HMW PRDX4 complexes in cells, whereas the association of key regulators of ER homeostasis with HMW oxidized PRDX4 point to a putative role of PRDX4 in regulating ER stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W3156632669,"Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor that binds substrate proteins and facilitates their proteasomal degradation. Most SPOP substrates present multiple SPOP-binding (SB) motifs and undergo liquid–liquid phase separation with SPOP.

Unlike other substrates, only one SB motif has previously been reported within the Pdx1 C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (Pdx1-C). Given this difference, we aimed to determine the specific mode of interaction of Pdx1 with SPOP and how it is similar or different to that of other SPOP substrates. Here, we identify a second SB motif in Pdx1-C, but still find that the resulting moderate valency is insufficient to support phase separation with SPOP in cells. Although Pdx1 does not phase separate with SPOP, Pdx1 and SPOP interaction prompts SPOP relocalization from nuclear speckles to the diffuse nucleoplasm. Accordingly, we find that SPOP-mediated ubiquitination activity of Pdx1 occurs in the nucleoplasm and that highly efficient Pdx1 turnover requires both SB motifs.

Among the regulatory signals that control Pdx1 stability and function is a degradation pathway wherein Pdx1 associates with a ubiquitin ligase adaptor, speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). SPOP recognizes the disordered C terminus of Pdx1 in conditions of low glucose in the β cell (12Claiborn K.C. Sachdeva M.M. Cannon C.E. Groff D.N. Singer J.D. Stoffers D.A.

Unlike Pdx1, which functions almost exclusively in β cells, SPOP is found across many tissue types and interacts with numerous substrates (14Cuneo M.J. Mittag T. The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.FEBS J. 2019; 286: 3946-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SPOP recruits the Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase, which facilitates the polyubiquination of SPOP-bound substrates (15Kwon J.E. La M. Oh K.H. Oh Y.M. Kim G.R. Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

In addition to a DNA-binding domain, Pdx1 contains two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that mediate many protein–protein interactions (Fig. 1A). Notably, many documented diabetes-linked mutations exist within the Pdx1 IDRs, not the DNA-binding domain (Table S1) (11Stoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F.

SPOP is composed of three domains: the meprin and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor homology (MATH) substrate-interaction domain and two dimerization domains, bric à brac, tramtrack, broad complex and bric à brac, tramtrack, broad complex and C-terminal Kelch (Fig. 1B). SPOP oligomerizes through sequential dimerization events (21Marzahn M.R. Marada S. Lee J. Nourse A. Kenrick S. Zhao H. Ben-Nissan G. Kolaitis R.M. Peters J.L. Pounds S. Errington W.J. Prive G.G.

To this end, SPOP substrates tend to present multiple binding motifs that individually have relatively weak affinities for SPOP, yet several motifs in a single substrate contribute to a substantially strengthened binding interaction to oligomeric SPOP (Fig. 1C) (14Cuneo M.J.

Given the numerous and diverse substrates under regulatory control by SPOP, including Pdx1, we must determine whether SPOP recognizes all substrates by the same mechanism or whether substrate-encoded differences result in their prioritization by SPOP. SPOP has recently been reported to recruit substrates via phase separation, which requires multivalent interaction (21Marzahn M.R. Marada S. Lee J. Nourse A. Kenrick S. Zhao H. Ben-Nissan G.

Given that only one SPOP-binding (SB) motif has been identified in Pdx1, we tested whether Pdx1 and SPOP engage and function in phase-separated compartments in cells and found that the two do not phase separate together. Instead, Pdx1 relocalizes SPOP to the nucleoplasm. To test whether this recruitment is indeed the result of the substrate valence for SPOP, we characterized the interaction of Pdx1-C with SPOP in vitro and found evidence for a second SB motif in Pdx1 that contributes to high-affinity binding but no additional motifs that would mediate the formation of three-dimensional networks of complexes. Notably, neither SB motif in Pdx1 conforms to the established SB consensus sequence (25Zhuang M. Calabrese M.F. Liu J. Waddell M.B. Nourse A. Hammel M. Miller D.J. Walden H. Duda D.M. Seyedin S.N.

Cell. 2009; 36: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but high-resolution structural characterization suggests that the Pdx1 SB motifs share a binding mode with other substrates. Finally, we find that the second SB motif is not required to draw SPOP out of nuclear speckles but that it does contribute to Pdx1 ubiquitination levels. Together, our results provide insight into Pdx1 turnover via SPOP and present the first example of a non–phase-separating SPOP substrate and the implications of such biophysical behavior for substrate prioritization. SPOP derives its name from the observation of SPOP localization to membraneless organelles within the nucleus. Specifically, SPOP colocalizes with nuclear speckles but has also been reported in other subnuclear compartments (24Nagai Y. Kojima T. Muro Y. Hachiya T. Nishizawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M.

Zhou P. et al.SPOP mutation leads to genomic instability in prostate cancer.Elife. 2015; 4: 1-18Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The nuclear speckles that house SPOP in the absence of high concentrations of substrate are liquid-like in nature (21Marzahn M.R. Marada S. Lee J. Nourse A. Kenrick S. Zhao H. Ben-Nissan G.

The SPOP substrate DAXX typically localizes to promyelocytic leukemia bodies (27Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Sequestration and inhibition of Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression by PML.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). When coexpressed in cells, however, SPOP and DAXX relocalize to liquid-like bodies that are distinct from nuclear speckles and promyelocytic bodies. Said new SPOP-DAXX bodies serve as the sites of ubiquitination activity (23Bouchard J.J. Otero J.H. Scott D.C. Szulc E. Martin E.W. Sabri N. Granata D. Marzahn M.R. Lindorff-Larsen K. Salvatella X.

Cell. 2018; 72: 19-36.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observation of SPOP-mediated substrate ubiquitination within liquid-like bodies, liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is gaining traction as a mechanism underlying compartmentalization of biological activities, dysregulation of which can result in disease pathologies (28Boeynaems S. Alberti S. Fawzi N.L. Mittag T. Polymenidou M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Shorter J. Wolozin B. Van Den Bosch L. Tompa P. Fuxreiter M.

Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease.Science. 2017; 357: 1-11Crossref Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Multivalent protein–protein interactions mediate LLPS, and increasing valence within each protein enhances the driving force for phase separation (30Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. Russo P.S. Jiang Q.X. Nixon B.T. Rosen M.K. Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Higher-order oligomerization of SPOP and the associated multivalency for its substrates, which themselves present several SB motifs, also drive SPOP–substrate phase separation. Given that only one SB motif was known in Pdx1, we set out to assess whether Pdx1 and SPOP undergo phase separation in cells. We overexpressed GFP–Pdx1 and V5-tagged SPOP in HeLa cells, performed immunostaining, and observed the cellular localization of the proteins by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In contrast to other SPOP substrates (23Bouchard J.J. Otero J.H. Scott D.C. Szulc E. Martin E.W. Sabri N. Granata D. Marzahn M.R. Lindorff-Larsen K. Salvatella X. Schulman B.A. Mittag T. Cancer mutations of the tumor suppressor SPOP disrupt the formation of active, phase-separated compartments.Mol. Cell. 2018; 72: 19-36.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we find that GFP–Pdx1 does not localize to punctate structures in cells (Fig. 2A, top panel). As expected, V5-SPOP localizes to nuclear speckles, which are marked by staining for a nuclear speckle scaffold protein (serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2) using the SC-35 antibody (31Ilik I.A. Malszycki M. Lubke A.K. Schade C. Meierhofer D. Aktas T. SON and SRRM2 are essential for nuclear speckle formation.Elife. 2020; 9: 1-24Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lower panel). However, when GFP–Pdx1–WT and V5-SPOP were coexpressed, SPOP relocalized from nuclear speckles into the diffuse nucleoplasm where GFP–Pdx1 resides. Importantly, Pdx1 did not undergo observable partitioning to any nuclear body (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, SPOP relocalization appears to depend on the concentration of GFP–Pdx1. In cells expressing GFP–Pdx1 at high levels (as assessed by high GFP intensity), SPOP is diffuse, whereas in cells that express GFP–Pdx1 at low levels, SPOP localizes to nuclear speckles (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that there exists a substrate concentration threshold above which SPOP is bound and relocalized by the substrate protein. To ensure that SPOP relocalization is dependent on interaction with Pdx1, we repeated the protein localization experiments using a construct of GFP–Pdx1 lacking its C terminus (GFP–Pdx1ΔC). Indeed, we found that a Pdx1 construct that is incapable of interacting with SPOP is also incapable of drawing SPOP out of nuclear speckles (Fig. 2B). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SPOP redistribution from nuclear speckles toward interaction with a substrate diffusely in the nucleus instead of in a nuclear body. Our results suggested that the valence of one Pdx1 for SPOP was not sufficient to mediate phase separation. However, given that SB motifs can have weak affinities and some sequence variability, we set out to identify potential additional SB motifs in Pdx1 that might point to a different mechanism of SPOP redistribution. Given a single motif in the Pdx1 C terminus (32Liu A. Oliver-Krasinski J. Stoffers D.A. Two conserved domains in PCIF1 mediate interaction with pancreatic transcription factor PDX-1.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6701-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Ostertag M.S. Messias A.C.

The structure of the SPOP-Pdx1 interface reveals insights into the phosphorylation-dependent binding regulation.Structure. 2019; 27: 327-334.e323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we probed this interaction by NMR spectroscopy. To identify specific residues on Pdx1 that may interact with SPOP, we used 13C direct-detect NMR experiments tailored to the biophysical characterization of IDRs. Such methods allow enhanced resolution over traditional proton-detect methods for cases, such as Pdx1-C, wherein spectral crowding and degeneracy in unique chemical shifts are barriers to data interpretation (34Gibbs E.B. Cook E.C. Showalter S.A. Application of NMR to studies of intrinsically disordered proteins.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 628: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Cook E.C. Usher G.A. Showalter S.A. The use of 13C direct-detect NMR to characterize flexible and disordered proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2018; 611: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We collected (HACA)CON spectra of 13C, 15N-Pdx1-C (residues 204–283) with and without SPOP-MATH (residues 28–166) (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1, A and B). The addition of SPOP led to marked resonance intensity loss in two specific locations: amino acids 220 to 235 (highlighted in teal) and amino acids 265 to 275 (highlighted in purple, Fig. 3B). The teal region maps to the fragment of Pdx1 that was already determined by pulldown and crystallography to interact with SPOP, and we interpret the disappearance of resonances here and at the second cluster (purple) as binding to SPOP-MATH. We are confident that the spectral changes are due to direct interaction with SPOP because Pdx1-C shows no evidence of any intramolecular interactions that would otherwise explain the observed resonance intensity changes (36Cook E.C. Sahu D. Bastidas M. Showalter S.A. Solution ensemble of the C-terminal domain from the transcription factor Pdx1 resembles an excluded volume polymer.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2019; 123: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Importantly, the amino acids in both regions of interest in Pdx1-C are highly conserved across several species, suggesting an evolutionary pressure to retain such motifs (Fig. S1C). Thus, we propose that Pdx1-C contains two distinct SB motifs, SB motif 1 (SBM1) and SB motif 2 (SBM2), the sequences of which are shown in alignment with other SPOP substrates in Figure 3C. We did not see evidence for any additional SB motifs. Addition of individual SBM1 (Pdx1 residues 224–236) and SBM2 (Pdx1 residues 265–283) peptides into 15N-SPOP-MATH showed that the resulting spectral changes are primarily localized to the substrate-binding groove (Fig. 4, A and B and Fig. S1, D and E), excluding the possibility that one SB motif preferentially interacts with another face of SPOP-MATH. Similarly, when SBM1 and SBM2 peptides were added to 15N-SPOP-MATH in equimolar ratios, the spectral changes were localized to the substrate-binding groove and largely resembled those observed with the SBM1 peptide alone (Fig. S1F). This suggests a higher SB affinity of Pdx1–SBM1 than Pdx1–SBM2 (as mentioned previously). The spectral changes correspond very well with the location of the Pdx1–SBM1 peptide in the published cocrystal structure (Fig. 4A) (33Ostertag M.S. Messias A.C. Sattler M. Popowicz G.M. The structure of the SPOP-Pdx1 interface reveals insights into the phosphorylation-dependent binding regulation.Structure. 2019; 27: 327-334.e323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we posit that the intensity changes on the SPOP surface that extend beyond the binding groove may be explained by transient contacts with SPOP that could confer additional stability and/or affinity. Upon identification of the novel binding site for SPOP within Pdx1-C, we sought to understand the molecular basis for its interaction with SPOP. Owing to unfavorable intermediate exchange kinetics and the resulting line broadening, solution NMR was not a viable strategy for structure determination. We therefore pursued crystallography of the complex between the Pdx1 peptide (human protein residues 265–283) and SPOP-MATH (Fig. 4C). We also present, to our knowledge, the first X-ray structure of SPOP-MATH without bound substrate. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics may be found in Table S2. The original consensus SB motif (Fig. 3C) was established based on the substrate sequence conservation and structural features of a substrate-binding groove that spans one of the central β-sheets in SPOP-MATH. One side is largely nonpolar with a small cavity to accommodate the aliphatic (Φ) consensus residue. On the other side, the groove is lined with polar side chain and backbone functional groups. Many of the latter arise from unsatisfied H-bonding groups in the top strand in the central β-sheet in SPOP-MATH. In the structures of puckered protein (Puc), core histone Macro-H2A, cubitus interruptus, or DAXX peptides in complex with SPOP, the peptide side chains in sites 3 to 5 of the consensus motif (conserved as Ser or Thr in non-Pdx1 substrates characterized previously) are highly complementary to the polar end of the groove (25Zhuang M. Calabrese M.F. Liu J. Waddell M.B. Nourse A. Hammel M. Miller D.J. Walden H. Duda D.M. Seyedin S.N. Hoggard T. Harper J.W. White K.P.

Cell. 2009; 36: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Most of these side chains H-bond—either directly or via water-mediated contacts—to SPOP. However, many other sequence-independent substrate backbone contacts are also present, and these may confer the ability to bind nonstandard sequences, such as those found in Pdx1 SBM1 and SBM2. The recent X-ray structure of Pdx1–SBM1 bound to SPOP-MATH provided the first atomic-level characterization of an SPOP substrate with two deviations from the consensus SB motif (33Ostertag M.S. Messias A.C. Sattler M. Popowicz G.M.

Despite these differences, the SBM1 peptide lies in the deep substrate-binding groove of SPOP, and this binding mode is stabilized by a network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Pdx1–SBM1 forms ten H-bonds to SPOP: six via its backbone and four via its side chains (Fig. 4D). Notably, only two of the side chain–mediated hydrogen bonds involve residues within the consensus binding motif, T230 and S231, positions 2 and 3, respectively. The other two intermolecular side chain H-bonds lie upstream of the consensus SB motif (Table S3). The 1.7 Å resolution cocrystal structure of Pdx1–SBM2 bound to SPOP–MATH (Fig. 4B) reported here places the Pdx1 peptide in the canonical substrate-binding site and is consistent with NMR titration data (Fig. S1F) (25Zhuang M.

Mutations in CSF3R and RUNX1 are frequently observed in CN patients, although how they drive the transition from CN to AML (CN/AML) is unclear. Here we establish a model of stepwise leukemogenesis in CN/AML using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of CN patient-derived iPSCs. We identified BAALC upregulation and resultant phosphorylation of MK2a as a key leukemogenic event. BAALC deletion or treatment with CMPD1, a selective inhibitor of MK2a phosphorylation, blocked proliferation and induced differentiation of primary CN/AML blasts and CN/AML iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) without affecting healthy donor or CN iPSC-derived HSPCs. Beyond detailing a useful method for future investigation of stepwise leukemogenesis, this study suggests that targeting BAALC and/or MK2a phosphorylation may prevent leukemogenic transformation or eliminate AML blasts in CN/AML and RUNX1 mutant BAALC(hi) de novo AML."
https://openalex.org/W3155155493,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a highly conserved proton pump responsible for the acidification of intracellular organelles in virtually all eukaryotic cells. V-ATPases are regulated by the rapid and reversible disassembly of the peripheral V1 domain from the integral membrane Vo domain, accompanied by release of the V1 C subunit from both domains. Efficient reassembly of V-ATPases requires the Regulator of the H+-ATPase of Vacuoles and Endosomes (RAVE) complex in yeast. Although a number of pairwise interactions between RAVE and V-ATPase subunits have been mapped, the low endogenous levels of the RAVE complex and lethality of constitutive RAV1 overexpression have hindered biochemical characterization of the intact RAVE complex. We describe a novel inducible overexpression system that allows purification of native RAVE and RAVE–V1 complexes. Both purified RAVE and RAVE–V1 contain substoichiometric levels of subunit C. RAVE–V1 binds tightly to expressed subunit C in vitro, but binding of subunit C to RAVE alone is weak. Neither RAVE nor RAVE–V1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of Vo subunit Vph1 in vitro. RAVE–V1 complexes, like isolated V1, have no MgATPase activity, suggesting that RAVE cannot reverse V1 inhibition generated by rotation of subunit H and entrapment of MgADP that occur upon disassembly. However, purified RAVE can accelerate reassembly of V1 carrying a mutant subunit H incapable of inhibition with Vo complexes reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs, consistent with its catalytic activity in vivo. These results provide new insights into the possible order of events in V-ATPase reassembly and the roles of the RAVE complex in each event."

There were 5,477 men included. Approximately 7% had elevated PSA. Men with an elevated PSA had statistically significantly higher levels of blood cadmium and blood lead compared to men with a normal PSA (p-values ≤ 0.02), with black men having higher levels. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, and education, there was no association found between any of the heavy metal levels and elevated PSA for the total population. In addition, there was no association found when stratified by black and white race. Further investigation is warranted in a larger cohort of men who persistently are exposed to these heavy metals."

The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central regulator of cellular redox homeostasis. It is beneficial for cytoprotection against harmful extrinsic and intrinsic insults, such as xenobiotics and oxidative stress. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 mRNA is constitutively expressed (1Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S. Alam J.

Keap1 is a cysteine-rich protein, and human Keap1 has 27 cysteine residues that function as sensors of various oxidants and electrophiles (3Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Kostov R.V. Canning P.

Homodimeric Keap1 binding to monomeric Nrf2 through the ETGE and DLG motifs promotes Nrf2 degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby maintaining low cellular levels of Nrf2. The cysteine residues in Keap1 are modified by oxidative stress, which results in conformational changes in Keap1 and releases the weaker interaction with the DLG motif (4Tong K.I. Katoh Y.

Although Keap1–ETGE binding is preserved, the ubiquitination of Nrf2 does not occur, providing time for newly synthesized Nrf2 to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf protein family members and binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) or electrophile responsive elements located in the regulatory regions of antioxidative and phase II cytoprotective genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) (6Thimmulappa R.K.

Spatola B.N. Curran S.P. WDR23 regulates NRF2 independently of KEAP1.PLoS Genet. 2017; 13e1006762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The transient activation of Nrf2 in normal cells is beneficial for cytoprotection and the prevention of pathological conditions; however, its consecutive activation in cancer cells is responsible for chemoresistance and is associated with a poor prognosis (17Wu S. Lu H. Bai Y. Nrf2 in cancers: A double-edged sword.Cancer Med. 2019; 8: 2252-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise regulation of Nrf2 levels is crucial. A somatic mutation in highly conserved Kelch or the intervening region domain of the Keap1 protein that results in the constitutive activation of Nrf2 often occurs in cancer cells (18Singh A. Misra V. Thimmulappa R.K. Lee H. Ames S. Hoque M.O. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Gabrielson E. Brock M.V. Biswal S.

A catalogue of somatic NRF2 gain-of-function mutations in cancer.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 12846Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the second layer of Nrf2 regulation is important for preventing carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. We previously reported that the knockdown (KD) of WDR23 was sufficient to increase the level and transactivity of Nrf2, whereas its overexpression only affected Nrf2 under Keap1 KD (12Siswanto F.M. Oguro A. Arase S. Imaoka S. WDR23 regulates the expression of Nrf2-driven drug-metabolizing enzymes.Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 2020; 35: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that WDR23 regulates Nrf2 under basal conditions, whereas the further induction of WDR23 activity toward Nrf2 requires the inhibition of Keap1. Therefore, WDR23 plays a major role in the regulation of Nrf2 in cancer cells bearing Keap1 mutation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk between these two independent and parallel regulators of Nrf2, particularly that by which WDR23 senses the function of Keap1, have not yet been elucidated. Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear transcription factor belonging to the C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. Sp1 regulates gene expression via protein–protein interactions, such as with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (20Meissner M. Stein M. Urbich C. Reisinger K. Suske G. Staels B.

It binds to the sequence known as the GC box (GGGCGG or CCGCCC) in the promoters of numerous genes with high affinity (24Nagaoka M.

Sp1 was initially regarded as a coordinator of the constitutive expression of housekeeping genes; however, recent studies showed that Sp1 responded to physiological and pathological stimuli (26Samson S.

Previous findings clearly demonstrated that Sp1 protein levels and transcriptional activity were induced by oxidative stress (28Ryu H. Lee J. Zaman K. Kubilis J. Ferrante R.J. Ross B.D. Neve R.

Specificity protein, Sp1-mediated increased expression of Prdx6 as a curcumin-induced antioxidant defense in lens epithelial cells against oxidative stress.Cell Death Dis. 2011; 2: e234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, we found that high glucose-induced oxidative stress increased nuclear Sp1 levels, which inhibited the expression of sEH (27Oguro A. Oida S. Imaoka S. Down-regulation of EPHX2 gene transcription by Sp1 under high-glucose conditions.Biochem. J. 2015; 470: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Increases in the level and activity of Sp1 have been widely proven to be responsible for oxidative stress-related carcinogenesis, including proliferation, the cell cycle, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and the inhibition of apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (31Tillu H. Bramhachari P.V. Role of Sp1 in liver cancer.in: Role of Transcription Factors in Gastrointestinal Malignancies. Springer Singapore, Singapore2017: 495-508Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although Sp1 plays a role in the oxidative stress response pathway, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated in detail. We herein demonstrated the role of Sp1 as a mediator of Keap1–WDR23 crosstalk for the regulation of Nrf2. The results obtained herein revealed that Keap1 directly regulates Sp1. The stabilization of Sp1 during the KD of Keap1 resulted in the transcriptional activation of Cullin4A (CUL4A) and induced the WDR23-dependent regulation of Nrf2. The identification of WDR23 as a novel regulator of Nrf2 in addition to the well-established Keap1 pathway has attracted interest because of its potential to enhance the stress response, refine the type of stress response induced, or control tissue specificity (11Lo J.Y. Spatola B.N. Curran S.P. WDR23 regulates NRF2 independently of KEAP1.PLoS Genet. 2017; 13e1006762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Keap1 and WDR23 signaling interact with each other remain unclear. Since we previously reported that WDR23 activity was limited to Keap1 (12Siswanto F.M. Oguro A. Arase S. Imaoka S. WDR23 regulates the expression of Nrf2-driven drug-metabolizing enzymes.Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 2020; 35: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we initially examined the effects of the KD of Keap1 on the expression of CRL4AWDR23 components, including WDR23, CUL4A, DDB1, and RBX1. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated KD of Keap1 significantly decreased (∼60%) Keap1 mRNA levels, suggesting successful KD (Fig. 1A). The present results showed that the KD of Keap1 upregulated the expression of CUL4A but not WDR23, DDB1, or RBX1 (Fig. 1, B–E). Similarly, the chemical inhibition of Keap1 by tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) increased CUL4A mRNA levels, whereas those of WDR23, DDB1, and RBX1 remained unchanged (Fig. 1, F–I). Because Keap1 is an intracellular sensor of oxidative and electrophilic insults, we hypothesized that the effects of the KD of Keap1 on the expression of CRL4AWDR23 components may be mimicked by hydrogen peroxide, which is an oxidizing agent that disrupts the Keap1–Nrf2 interaction. We found that the expression of CUL4A was also increased by the H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1, J–M). We then examined the effects of the KD of Keap1 on the protein levels of CUL4A and found that they were elevated (Fig. 1N). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of CUL4A expression by Keap1, we investigated CUL4A promoter activity under Keap1 KD conditions using a luciferase reporter assay. Luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL3-basic) containing −1920/+50 bp of the CUL4A genomic region were constructed and transfected into Hep3B cells. The KD of Keap1 induced a 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 1O). To identify the promoter region required for the transcriptional activation of CUL4A, a deletion analysis of the promoter was performed. Basal promoter activity was gradually decreased by the consecutive 5′-end deletion of the upstream region of CUL4A. However, the KD of Keap1 still enhanced the promoter activity of the −230/+50 construct, suggesting that the regulatory region of CUL4A by Keap1 is present within this segment. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of CUL4A, particularly with the KD of Keap1, we attempted to identify the relevant transcription factor(s) responsible for the regulation of CUL4A transcription. Nrf2 protein levels were significantly increased by the KD of Keap1 because ofdue to the depletion of Nrf2 ubiquitination, indicating that the WDR23 pathway might be activated by Nrf2 as a self-regulatory feedback mechanism. However, we found that the overexpression of WDR23 did not affect Nrf2 protein levels in Nrf2-overexpressing cells with intact Keap1 function (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the overexpression of Nrf2 alone did not change the mRNA expression of any component of CUL4A (Fig. 2B). These results support the idea that activity of the WDR23 pathway being limited to the function of Keap1. We then predicted several putative transcription factor–binding sites using the JASPAR database. We found the putative binding sites of AP2α, KLF15, EGR1, NF-κβ, and Sp1 within −230/+50 bp of CUL4A (Fig. 2C). Among all possible transcription factors, only NF-κβ has been reported as a downstream target of Keap1. Because Keap1 directly interacts with and induces the autophagic degradation of IKKβ, its depletion results in the upregulation of nuclear factor-κB (32Lee D.-F. Kuo H.-P. Liu M. Chou C.-K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.-T. Huo L. Hsu M.-C. Li C.-W. Ding Q. Liao T.-L. Lai C.-C. Lin A.-C. et al.KEAP1 E3 ligase-mediated downregulation of NF-κB signaling by targeting IKKβ.Mol.

Suppression of NF-κB signaling by KEAP1 regulation of IKKβ activity through autophagic degradation and inhibition of phosphorylation.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of p65 did not change the expression of CUL4A (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the effects of the KD of Keap1 on CUL4A were independent of NF-κβ. We then observed the protein levels of other potential transcription factors under the KD of Keap1. AP2α, KLF15, and EGR1 protein levels were unaffected by the KD of Keap1 (Fig. 2, E–G, respectively). In contrast, total and nuclear Sp1 protein levels were elevated (Fig. 2, H and I). In Keap1 KD cells, Sp1 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2J). The mRNA levels of Sp1 were unaltered by the KD of Keap1 (Fig. 2K), suggesting that the Sp1 elevation induced by the KD of Keap1 occurred at the posttranscriptional level. To confirm the involvement of Sp1 on Keap1 KD-induced CUL4A expression, we inhibited the activity of Sp1 using a genetic and chemical approach. The shRNA-mediated genetic inhibition of Sp1 in Keap1 KD Hep3B cells attenuated the upregulated expression of CUL4A (Fig. 2L). Similarly, the treatment of Keap1 KD cells with mithramycin A (100 nM, 6 h), a potent chemical inhibitor of Sp1, reduced the expression of CUL4A (Fig. 2M). This is consistent with the results showing that mithramycin A abolished Keap1 KD–induced increases in CUL4A promoter activity (Fig. 2N). Collectively, these results support the role of Sp1 in the regulation of CUL4A expression under Keap1 KD conditions. Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes. To further investigate the role of Sp1 on CUL4A gene expression, we analyzed the expression of CUL4A at the transcript and protein levels after the KD or ectopic overexpression of Sp1 (Fig. 3, A and B). We found that the KD of Sp1 significantly decreased CUL4A mRNA levels, which slightly reduced CUL4A protein levels. In contrast, the overexpression of Sp1 elevated CUL4A mRNA levels and induced an approximately 7-fold increase in the accumulation of the CUL4A protein (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that Sp1 contributes to the expression of CUL4A. These results indicate that Sp1 regulates the basal and inducible expression of CUL4A. We then performed a luciferase reporter assay to further confirm the results outlined above. Similar to the phenomena observed under Keap1 KD conditions, the overexpression of Sp1 significantly enhanced the luciferase activity of the pGL3-containing −1920/+50 bp of the CUL4A genomic region. Constructs containing a series of 5′ end deletions were all responsive to the overexpression of Sp1 (Fig. 3E). In contrast, the KD of Sp1 markedly decreased the promoter activity of pGL3-containing −810/+50 bp and −230/+50 bp of the CUL4A genomic region construct by approximately 50% (Fig. 3F). Within the CUL4A promoter −230/+50 region, four Sp1-binding sites were identified using the JASPAR database. To verify the contribution of Sp1-binding sites to the functional activity of the proximal CUL4A promoter, each Sp1 putative site within the −230/+50 construct was individually mutated (Fig. 3G). Because Sp1 is known to bind to various consensus sequences, we simply replaced the core GG sequences with TT. The mutant constructs Sp1_M1, Sp1_M2, and Sp1_M3 exhibited similar basal promoter activities to the WT construct, whereas Sp1_M4 basal promoter activity was weaker than that of the WT. The mutation in the fourth site (Sp1_M4) suppressed the activation of promoter activity by the overexpression of Sp1, suggesting its crucial role for the Sp1-activated CUL4A promoter (Fig. 3H). The mutation in the fourth site also abrogated the response of the CUL4A promoter to the KD of Keap1 (Fig. 3I), which is consistent with the results described above, suggesting that Sp1 binding to the fourth putative site plays an important role in Keap1 KD–induced CUL4A expression. We consistently found that the fourth Sp1-binding site was highly conserved in mammals, and based on multiple species alignment phylogenetic p-values, the conservation of the fourth site was significantly greater than that of the other sites (Fig. 3J). Based on the result showing that Sp1 plays an important role in the regulation of CUL4A promoter activity, we were prompted to investigate whether this transcription factor regulates the expression of CUL4A at the transcriptional level by directly binding to its promoter. The ChIP assay was conducted using the Sp1 antibody in Hep3B cells and detected CUL4A promoter-bound DNA fragments using specific primers. ChIP PCR products were identified using primers that amplified regions −230 to −42 and −41 to +160 of the CUL4A gene, but not with primers that amplified regions −810 to −610 with no potential Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 3K). The input was unfragmented chromatin as a positive control in PCR for each segment of interest. Because we found that Sp1 protein levels were increased by the KD of Keap1 and that Sp1 mediates the activation of Keap1 KD-induced CUL4A expression, we postulated that Sp1 is directly bound to and regulated by Keap1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the intracellular interaction of Sp1 with Keap1 using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. BiFC relies on the principle that interacting proteins tagged with the nonfluorescent N- or C-terminal fragments of a β-barrel fluorescent protein enable the fragments of the fluorescent protein to fuse and refold, leading to the acquisition of a fluorescent complex (34Kerppola T.K. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis as a probe of protein interactions in living cells.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 465-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). When the N-terminal fragment of Venus (VN155, I152 L) fused to the N terminal of Sp1 was co-expressed with Keap1 fused to the C-terminal fragment of Venus (VC155) in Hep3B cells, Venus fluorescent was mainly detected in the cytosol as a BiFC signal, suggesting the direct interaction of Sp1 with Keap1 (Fig. 4A). To clarify which domain of Sp1 and Keap1 contribute to this interaction, we investigated the interaction of full-length and several truncated Sp1 and Keap1 mutants using an immunoprecipitation assay. Keap1 was present in the lysate pulled down with the Myc antibody in full-length Sp1-overexpressing cells. Keap1 bound with all Sp1 truncated mutants, except for Sp1 ΔNTR, indicating that it interacts with the N-terminal region (NTR) domain of Sp1 (Fig. 4B). Further studies revealed that Sp1 bound to full-length Keap1, but not Keap1 ΔDGR (Fig. 4C), which is the Nrf2-binding domain. The direct interaction of Sp1 and Keap1 prompted us to hypothesize that Keap1 subjects Sp1 to ubiquitination because Keap1 is a substrate adaptor protein for the Cullin 3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (2Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.-C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. Increased protein stability as a mechanism that enhances Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activation of the antioxidant response element.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether Sp1 is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation. Sp1 protein levels were elevated by the treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (5 μM, 8 h), confirming that Sp1 is subjected to proteasomal degradation (Fig. 5A). We then examined the ubiquitination of Sp1 by Keap1 in the presence of MG132. Sp1 incorporated approximately 1.5-fold more ubiquitin in Keap1-overexpressing cells than in control cells, and the KD of Keap1 significantly decreased (∼70%) the ubiquitination of Sp1 (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these results showed that Keap1 directly regulated the protein stability of Sp1 via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. The relationship between Sp1 and Keap1, in addition to the role of Sp1 in the regulation of CUL4A expression, prompted us to investigate whether Sp1 correlates with the intracellular level of Nrf2. Previous studies suggested that the protein level and transcriptional activity of Sp1 are induced by oxidative stress; however, their relationship with Nrf2 remains unclear (28Ryu H. Lee J. Zaman K. Kubilis J. Ferrante R.J. Ross B.D. Neve R. Ratan R.R. Sp1 and Sp3 are oxidative stress-inducible, antideath transcription factors in cortical neurons.J.

Sichuan Province, located in Southwest China, has varied topography, providing us with natural materials to explore the determinants of health resource distribution. Materials and methods Spatial panel econometric models were constructed to explore the relationship between health resources and factors such as health care service demand and socioeconomic and demographic perspectives using data from Sichuan Province for eight consecutive years (2010–2017). Results Health care service demands were found to be a major driving force behind the distribution of health resources, showing that an increase in health care service demands draws health resources to specific counties and surrounding areas. From a socioeconomic perspective, gross domestic product per capita and the average wage show a positive association with health resources. In addition, the total population and proportion of the urban population have diverse effects in regard to health-related human resources but have the same effects on material and financial health resources. Conclusions Our results provide the Chinese government with evidence needed to formulate and promulgate effective policies, especially those aiming to tackle inequity among different regions."
https://openalex.org/W3155592261,"Myosin heavy chain 7b (MYH7b) is an ancient member of the myosin heavy chain motor protein family that is expressed in striated muscles. In mammalian cardiac muscle, MYH7b RNA is expressed along with two other myosin heavy chains, β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC) and α-myosin heavy chain (α-MyHC). However, unlike β-MyHC and α-MyHC, which are maintained in a careful balance at the protein level, the MYH7b locus does not produce a full-length protein in the heart due to a posttranscriptional exon-skipping mechanism that occurs in a tissue-specific manner. Whether this locus has a role in the heart beyond producing its intronic microRNA, miR-499, was unclear. Using cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells as a model system, we found that the noncoding exon-skipped RNA (lncMYH7b) affects the transcriptional landscape of human cardiomyocytes, independent of miR-499. Specifically, lncMYH7b regulates the ratio of β-MyHC to α-MyHC, which is crucial for cardiac contractility. We also found that lncMYH7b regulates beat rate and sarcomere formation in cardiomyocytes. This regulation is likely achieved through control of a member of the TEA domain transcription factor family (TEAD3, which is known to regulate β-MyHC). Therefore, we conclude that this ancient gene has been repurposed by alternative splicing to produce a regulatory long-noncoding RNA in the human heart that affects cardiac myosin composition.

The myosin family of motor proteins that drives striated muscle contraction consists of ten genes with distinct functions (1Weiss A. Leinwand L. The mammalian myosin heavy chain gene family.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Three of these genes are expressed in mammalian hearts (MYH6, MYH7, and MYH7b). MYH6 (α-MyHC) and MYH7 (β-MyHC) are the major sarcomeric myosin proteins expressed in mammalian hearts. In humans, >90% of the heart’s myosin protein composition is comprised of β-MyHC with the remaining <10% being α-MyHC and the two are antithetically regulated (1Weiss A. Leinwand L.

However, various conditions can shift their relative proportions. The finely tuned balance of these two motors is critical for proper cardiac function since they have very different enzymatic properties, which determine the contractile velocity of the muscle (6Krenz M.

It has been well established that disturbing the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio leads to compromised contractility in cardiomyocytes; in human heart failure, there is a shift to ∼100% β-MyHC and α-MyHC becomes undetectable (2Nakao K.

Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This suggests that maintenance of the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio is fundamental to proper cardiac function. While MYH6 and MYH7 have been studied for decades, MYH7b was not identified until the sequencing of the human genome and was initially annotated as a sarcomeric myosin based on sequence alignments with other known family members (8Desjardins P.R. Burkman J.M. Shrager J.B. Allmond L.A. Stedman H.H. Evolutionary implications of three novel members of the human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on phylogenetic analysis, MYH7b was identified as an ancient myosin, indicating that MYH7b was present before the gene duplication events that led to the other sarcomeric myosins (8Desjardins P.R. Burkman J.M. Shrager J.B. Allmond L.A. Stedman H.H. Evolutionary implications of three novel members of the human sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The human MYH7b gene is located on chromosome 20, separate from the two canonical sarcomeric myosin clusters on chromosomes 14 (cardiac myosins) and 17 (skeletal muscle myosins), supporting the idea that MYH7b may have a specialized role in muscle biology (1Weiss A. Leinwand L. The mammalian myosin heavy chain gene family.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 8Desjardins P.R. Burkman J.M. Shrager J.B.

Evol. 2002; 19: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In certain species, including snakes and birds, MYH7b is expressed as a typical sarcomeric myosin protein in the heart and skeletal muscle (9Lee L.A. Karabina A. Broadwell L.J. Leinwand L.A. The ancient sarcomeric myosins found in specialized muscles.Skelet. Muscle. 2019; 9: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, MYH7b has a unique expression pattern in mammals: the encoded protein is expressed in specialized muscles and nonmuscle tissues (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Rossi A.C. Mammucari C.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while MYH7b RNA is expressed in mammalian cardiac and skeletal muscle, an alternative splicing event skips an exon, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) that prevents full-length protein expression (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1) (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This raises the question of why MYH7b RNA expression has been conserved in the mammalian heart. One obvious hypothesis is that MYH7b transcription is preserved in mammalian heart and skeletal muscle in order to maintain the expression of an intronic MYH7b microRNA, miR-499, in those tissues (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, miR-499 knockout mice have no discernible cardiac or skeletal muscle phenotype (13van Rooij E. Quiat D. Johnson B.A. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. Richardson J.A. Kelm R.J. Olson E.N. A family of microRNAs encoded by myosin genes governs myosin expression and muscle performance.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 662-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). It is possible that the species-specific regulation of myosin isoforms complicates the interpretation of this mouse model and that miR-499 could play an important role in human muscle (6Krenz M. Robbins J. Impact of beta-myosin heavy chain expression on cardiac function during stress.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 2390-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Sadayappan S. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Lorenz J.N. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C phosphorylation in a “humanized” mouse heart.Physiology. 2010; 119: 1253-1262Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that a heretofore unknown functional molecule is expressed from the MYH7b gene, resulting in its conserved expression in the sarcomeric muscle tissue. In this report, we performed a thorough dissection of this locus in order to discern the role of MYH7b gene expression in human cardiomyocytes and found a novel long noncoding RNA (lncMYH7b) with roles in cardiac gene expression, leading to changes in cardiomyocyte beat rate and sarcomeric organization. The human MYH7b locus is complex. In certain tissues, it encodes a typical striated muscle myosin mRNA and full-length protein. In tissues where exon 7 is skipped, the locus could theoretically produce both a peptide originating from the short open reading frame preceding the PTC in exon 9 (MYH7b_sp) and the exon 7-skipped long-noncoding RNA itself (lncMYH7b, Fig. 1A). In both contexts, the microRNA miR-499 is encoded in intron 19. We analyzed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 64 healthy and diseased human heart samples and found that exon 7 (the skipped exon) of the MYH7b RNA is essentially undetectable regardless of disease state, which is consistent with our previous observation that MYH7b has a tissue-specific alternative splicing pattern (Fig. 1, B and C) (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This transcriptomic analysis suggests that the full-length MYH7b protein is not present in the human heart. This observation is also consistent with our previous results showing that forced expression of full-length MYH7b protein in the mouse heart results in cardiac dilation and dysfunction, despite roles the full-length protein is known to have in other tissues (12Rubio M.D. Johnson R.

Minobe W. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Leinwand L.A. Myosin heavy chain gene expression in human heart failure.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2362-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 3Miyata S.

Intriguingly, we observed that MYH7b RNA levels correlate with β-MyHC expression, including the known increase in β-MyHC expression in diseased human hearts (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2). This raised the possibility that there is a regulatory relationship between the MYH7b locus and β-MyHC expression. Although full-length MYH7b protein and mRNA are essentially absent in the human heart, there are several other molecules originating from the MYH7b gene locus, as mentioned above. The presence of these different molecules prompted further investigation into the locus as a whole. One hypothesis is that the MYH7b locus regulates β-MyHC through the miR-499, which is a miRNA encoded in intron 19 of the MYH7b pre-mRNA. There is no evidence to suggest that miR-499 regulates the expression of either α- or β-MyHC, and the miR-499 knockout mouse still induces β-MyHC in the heart under conditions of hypothyroidism (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 2016; 94: 107-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other microRNAs, such as miR-208a and miR-208b encoded by the α-MyHC and β-MyHC genes, respectively, have been shown to have effects on the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio in mouse models (13van Rooij E. Quiat D. Johnson B.A. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. Richardson J.A. Kelm R.J. Olson E.N. A family of microRNAs encoded by myosin genes governs myosin expression and muscle performance.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 662-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). However, the adult mouse cardiac β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio is opposite to the human one (5%:95% compared with 90%:10%), demonstrating species-specific regulation (6Krenz M. Robbins J. Impact of beta-myosin heavy chain expression on cardiac function during stress.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 2390-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Sadayappan S. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Lorenz J.N. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C phosphorylation in a “humanized” mouse heart.Physiology. 2010; 119: 1253-1262Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to investigate the β-MyHC response to changes in miR-499 activity in a human context. We employed a cellular model of human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated to cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which we treated with an anti-miR that targets miR-499 specifically. We observed no changes in MYH7b or β-MyHC levels (Fig. 2). Therefore, we conclude that miR-499 does not regulate β-MyHC expression in human cardiomyocytes. The elimination of miR-499 as a regulator of the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio left both a putative short peptide and the lncMYH7b itself to investigate (Fig. 3A). The MYH7b locus produces full-length protein in the specialized muscles, brain, and inner ear tissues and therefore encodes all of the essential signals for translation (9Lee L.A. Karabina A. Broadwell L.J. Leinwand L.A. The ancient sarcomeric myosins found in specialized muscles.Skelet. Muscle. 2019; 9: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We previously reported increased exon 7-skipped MYH7b RNA levels in C2C12 mouse myotubes after blocking translation with cycloheximide, indicating that the exon-skipped RNA is either translated or shunted to the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (10Bell M.L. Buvoli M. Leinwand L.A. Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using FISH, we determined that MYH7b RNA is localized to the cytoplasm in hiPS-CMs, consistent with translation (Fig. 3, B and C). We confirmed these results by checking for signal upon knockdown and with biochemical fractionation (Fig. S3, B and C). Furthermore, we saw very few transcripts along the nuclear envelope, which is where mRNAs undergoing NMD typically localize (Fig. 3B) (18Trcek T. Sato H. Singer R.H. Maquat L.E. Temporal and spatial characterization of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that not all exon 7-skipped MYH7b RNA is degraded by NMD. There is also precedent for small peptides being produced from “non-coding” RNAs, which affect muscle contraction (19Nelson B.R. Makarewich C.A. Anderson D.M. Winders B.R. Troupes C.D. Wu F. Reese A.L. McAnally J.R. Chen X. Kavalali E.T. Cannon S.C. Houser S.R. Bassel-duby R. Olson E.N. A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 20Anderson D.M. Anderson K.M. Chang C.L. Makarewich C.A. Nelson B.R. McAnally J.R. Kasaragod P. Shelton J.M. Liou J. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. A micropeptide encoded by a putative long noncoding RNA regulates muscle performance.Cell. 2015; 160: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Based on this, we next investigated whether the short open reading frame prior to the PTC in exon 9 is translated and, if so, whether the short peptide (MYH7b_sp) could regulate the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio in human cardiomyocytes. The putative MYH7b_sp is predicted to be 206 amino acids in length and approximately 27 kDa. It is possible that MYH7b_sp has escaped detection in previous studies simply because full-length MyHCs are approximately 250 kDa, and a 27 kDa MyHC has not been described. Therefore, we used our anti-MYH7b antibody, which is directed against an epitope that should present in both the full-length MYH7b (as shown in Fig. 3D, mouse cerebellum) and the putative MYH7b_sp to probe for MYH7b_sp expression (11Rossi A.C. Mammucari C. Argentini C. Reggiani C. Schiaffino S. Two novel/ancient myosins in mammalian skeletal muscles: MYH14/7b and MYH15 are expressed in extraocular muscles and muscle spindles.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Peter A.K. Rossi A.C. Buvoli M. Ozeroff C.D. Crocini C. Perry A.R. Buvoli A.E. Lee L.A. Leinwand L.A. Expression of normally repressed myosin heavy chain 7b in the mammalian heart induces dilated cardiomyopathy.J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2019; 8e013318Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we infected C2C12 cells with an adenovirus containing only the MYH7b_sp open reading frame and detected a protein of the right size and immunoreactivity (Fig. 3D). We probed human heart tissue from dilated cardiomyopathy patients, where MYH7b transcripts are easily detectable (Fig. 1B), but did not detect it via western blotting (Fig. 3D). In case MYH7b_sp exists at levels below the detection limit of a western blot but does have a regulatory role, we forced expression of the MYH7b_sp using adenovirus infection of hiPS-CMs and performed RNA-seq (Fig. S4). We found no difference in the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio at the RNA level, and many differentially expressed genes were chaperones, which is both consistent with an adenoviral infection and production of a foreign peptide (Fig. S4) (21Zhao H. Dahlö M. Isaksson A. Syvänen A.C. Pettersson U. The transcriptome of the adenovirus infected cell.Virology. 2012; 424: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that MYH7b_sp is not expressed at detectable levels in human cardiomyocytes and has no effect on the expression of α- or β-MyHC, even after forced expression. Having ruled out the possible regulatory roles of miR-499 and MYH7b_sp in β-MyHC expression, we hypothesized that the lncMYH7b transcript itself regulates β-MyHC. We attempted to overexpress the exon-skipped cDNA (MYH7bΔ7 cDNA) via adenoviral infection as we did with MYH7b_sp. Unfortunately, we discovered that this cDNA expresses large quantities of MYH7b_sp, which we have that shown is not produced from endogenous lncMYH7b (Fig. S5). We hypothesize that this is due to the lack of exon junction complexes that would normally trigger NMD and other RNA quality-control pathways. This led us to postulate that having a spliced transcript is essential to lncMYH7b’s function. Therefore, we decided to move forward with a loss-of-function approach. To achieve this, we knocked down MYH7b RNA with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and measured the kinetics of lncMYH7b and β-MyHC expression in hiPS-CMs. Upon treatment with 10 μM ASO, MYH7b RNA was knocked down ∼12-fold by 48 h, which was maintained through 7 days (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we observed decreased β-MyHC expression only after loss of MYH7b RNA (Fig. 4A), supporting an upstream role for the exon-skipped MYH7b RNA in regulating β-MyHC expression. To further support the idea that lncMYH7b is regulating β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratios independently of miR-499, we measured the change in myomiR levels after lncMYH7b knockdown (KD). We observed no change in miR-499 levels, nor in the other two myomiRs encoded by α-MyHC and β-MyHC (miR-208a and miR-208b, respectively) upon treatment with the MYH7b ASO (Fig. 4B). Next, we determined that the change observed in β-MyHC RNA upon MYH7b KD was recapitulated at the protein level. As independent validation, we differentiated hiPS-CMs from a different iPSC line and used a different ASO sequence. A myosin separating gel showed a significant decrease of the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio upon KD of MYH7b RNA (Fig. 4C). Together, these data demonstrate a role for lncMYH7b in regulating the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio in human cardiomyocytes. In order to elucidate the potential regulatory impacts of lncMYH7b in a more global and unbiased manner, we performed RNA-seq on MYH7b ASO-treated hiPS-CMs. We used the publicly available NF-core/RNAseq pipeline to analyze differential gene expression (22Ewels P.A. Peltzer A. Fillinger S. Alneberg J. Patel H. Wilm A. Garcia M.U. Tommaso P. Di Nahnsen S. nf-core: Community curated bioinformatics pipelines.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/610741Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Differential expression analysis revealed a large bias toward downregulation (535 downregulated versus 224 upregulated genes) with very little overlap with our MYH7b_sp dataset (Fig. 5B). As knockdown of the RNA would also prevent protein expression, this further supports the lack of MYH7b_sp translated from the endogenous locus. We found that the change in the β-MyHC/α-MyHC ratio was also evident at the RNA level, suggesting that lncMYH7b is affecting β-MyHC pretranslationally (Fig. 5A). To gain functional insight into the role of lncMYH7b in regulating cardiac gene expression, we performed a KEGG pathway analysis of our RNA-seq dataset and found that pathways associated with cardiomyopathies were regulated by the reduction in lncMYH7b expression (Fig. 5D). This is consistent with the increases in lncMYH7b levels observed in the tissue from patients with chronic heart disease (Fig. S2). Of interest, expression of two members of the TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor family, TEAD1 and TEAD3 (log2(fold change) = −0.67 and −1.68, respectively), was decreased in our lncMYH7b KD dataset. As TEAD3 was the most downregulated, and has been shown to directly regulate β-MyHC transcription, we decided to focus on that transcription factor (23Iwaki H. Sasaki S. Matsushita A. Ohba K. Matsunaga H. Essential role of TEA domain transcription factors in the negative regulation of the MYH 7 gene by thyroid hormone and its receptors.PLoS One. 2014; 9e88610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We independently confirmed a decrease in TEAD3 RNA levels using qPCR, which agrees with TEAD3 being the most downregulated transcription factor in our data (Fig. S6). TEAD family members are known to bind to and enhance transcription at the β-MyHC promoter and are upregulated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patient hearts (23Iwaki H. Sasaki S. Matsushita A. Ohba K. Matsunaga H. Essential role of TEA domain transcription factors in the negative regulation of the MYH 7 gene by thyroid hormone and its receptors.PLoS One. 2014; 9e88610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TEAD3 specifically has not been well studied, but has a cardiac-enriched expression pattern (24Jin Y. Messmer-Blust A.F. Li J. The role of transcription enhancer factors in cardiovascular biology.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2011; 21: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). TEAD family members can complex with MEF2 transcription factor family members, which are master regulators of muscle formation and are known to enhance β-MyHC transcription (25Karasseva N. Tsika G. Ji J. Zhang A. Mao X. Tsika R. Transcription enhancer factor 1 binds multiple muscle MEF2 and A/T-rich elements during fast-to-slow skeletal muscle fiber type transitions.Mol. Cell.

Moreover, further interrogation of the dataset revealed a significant decrease in the expression of PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK can also complex with MEF2 in cardiomyocytes to enhance its activity under stress conditions, and in a mouse model where FAK was knocked out in cardiomyocytes, MEF2A protein levels were downregulated (28Cardoso A.C.

To evaluate the potential of canthin-6-one in controlling plant fungal diseases, we investigated the antifungal activity of canthin-6-one isolated from A . altissima against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum ( Foc ) in vitro . The mycelial growth rate and micro-broth dilution were used to test antifungal activity. Furthermore, label-free quantitative proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) techniques were applied to analyze the antifungal mechanism. It was found that canthin-6-one significantly inhibited the growth of Foc , and had higher inhibitory action than chlorothalonil at the same concentration. Proteomic analysis showed that the expression of 203 proteins altered significantly after canthin-6-one treatment. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in amino acid biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism pathways. These results suggest that canthin-6-one significantly interferes with the metabolism of amino acids. Therefore, it affects nitrogen nutrients and disturbs the normal physiological processes of fungi, and ultimately leads to the death of pathogens. This study provides a natural plant antifungal agent and a new perspective for the study of antifungal mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3152833875,"Background Many mothers still give birth outside a health facility in Sub-Saharan Africa particularly in East African countries. Though there are studies on the prevalence and associated factors of health facility delivery, as to our search of literature there is limited evidence on the pooled prevalence and associated factors of health facility delivery in East Africa. This study aims to examine the pooled prevalence and associated factors of health facility delivery in East Africa based on evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted based on the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) conducted in the 12 East African countries. A total weighted sample of 141,483 reproductive-age women who gave birth within five years preceding the survey was included. All analyses presented in this paper were weighted for the sampling probabilities and non-response using sampling weight (V005), primary sampling unit (V023), and strata (V021). The analysis was done using STATA version 14 statistical software, and the pooled prevalence of health facility delivery with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was presented using a forest plot. For associated factors, the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was fitted to consider the hierarchical nature of the DHS data. The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), and Likelihood Ratio (LR)-test were done to assess the presence of a significant clustering effect. Besides, deviance (-2LLR) was used for model comparison since the models were nested models. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.2 in the bivariable mixed-effect binary logistic regression analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable mixed-effect analysis, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported to declare the strength and significance of the association between the independent variable and health facility delivery. Results The proportion of health facility delivery in East Africa was 87.49% [95% CI: 87.34%, 87.64%], ranged from 29% in Ethiopia to 97% in Mozambique. In the Mixed-effect logistic regression model; country, urban residence [AOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.96, 2.17], primary women education [AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.55, 1.67], secondary education and higher [AOR = 2.96, 95% CI: 2.79, 3.13], primary husband education [AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.24], secondary husband education [AOR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.45], being in union [AOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.27], having occupation [AOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.15], being rich [AOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.41], and middle [AOR = 2.14, 95% CI: 2.04, 2.23], health care access problem [AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.79], having ANC visit [AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.49, 1.59], parity [AOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.61], multiple gestation [AOR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.01] and wanted pregnancy [AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.25] were significantly associated with health facility delivery. Conclusion This study showed that the proportion of health facility delivery in East African countries is low. Thus, improved access and utilization of antenatal care can be an effective strategy to increase health facility deliveries. Moreover, encouraging women through education is recommended to increase health facility delivery service utilization."

Biosynthesis of CLs has been studied in eukaryotes and bacteria, but has been barely explored in archaea. Unlike the common fatty acyl chain–based ester phospholipids, archaeal membranes are made up of the structurally different isoprenoid-based ether phospholipids, possibly involving a different cardiolipin biosynthesis mechanism. Here, we identified a phospholipase D motif–containing cardiolipin synthase (MhCls) from the methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and its activity was characterized by LC-MS analysis of substrates/products. MhCls utilizes two archaetidylglycerol (AG) molecules in a transesterification reaction to synthesize glycerol-di-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DACL) and glycerol. The enzyme is nonselective to the stereochemistry of the glycerol backbone and the nature of the lipid tail, as it also accepts phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to generate glycerol-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DPCL). Remarkably, in the presence of AG and PG, MhCls formed glycerol-archaetidyl-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-APCL), an archaeal-bacterial hybrid cardiolipin species that so far has not been observed in nature. Due to the reversibility of the transesterification, in the presence of glycerol, Gro-DPCL can be converted back into two PG molecules. In the presence of other compounds that contain primary hydroxyl groups (e.g., alcohols, water, sugars), various natural and unique unnatural phospholipid species could be synthesized, including multiple di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin species. Moreover, MhCls can utilize a glycolipid in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol to form a glycosyl-mono-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin species, emphasizing the promiscuity of this cardiolipin synthase that could be of interest for bio-catalytic purposes.

Cardiolipin (CL) is present in lipid membranes throughout all three domains in life. This lipid class comprises lipid species that contain two pairs of lipid tails that are each linked to a glycerol(phosphate) backbone, with a bridging polar headgroup. 1,3-bis(sn-3’-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol or simply glycerol-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DPCL) is the most prominent and studied cardiolipin species. Gro-DPCL is usually a relatively minor component (<10 mol%) of the total membrane lipid composition, and its primary role appears to be supporting the function of various membrane proteins (1Bogdanov M.

Role of cardiolipin in stability of integral membrane proteins.Biochimie. 2017; 142: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unlike most naturally occurring glycerophospholipids, Gro-DPCL consists of two 1,2-diacyl-glycerolphosphate moieties esterified to the 1- and 3-hydroxyl groups of a glycerol molecule. Because of the two phosphates, it can carry up to two negative charges (3Lewis R.N.A.H. McElhaney R.N. The physicochemical properties of cardiolipin bilayers and cardiolipin-containing lipid membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the polar head group is relatively small compared with the four bulky hydrophobic tails, giving Gro-DPCL its characteristic inverted conical shape in the presence of divalent cations (4Dowhan W. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Chapter 1 - functional roles of lipids in membranes.in: Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes (Fifth Edition). 5th Ed.

Indeed, Gro-DPCL is believed to be located in lipid domains at the cell poles and division site in bacteria (5Kawai F. Shoda M. Harashima R. Sadaie Y. Hara H. Matsumoto K.

In bacteria, Gro-DPCL is often not an essential membrane constituent, and in several organisms its production is upscaled under certain specific circumstances, such as during stationary phase, or when cells are exposed to certain stressors, e.g., osmotic shock (15Hiraoka S.

Phosphatidylglycerol-derived phospholipids have a universal, domain-crossing role in stress responses.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 585: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cardiolipins have also been described in archaea, most notably in Euryarchaeota. Specifically, in halophiles the production of glycerol-di-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DACL) is influenced by changes in the ionic composition of the environment (19Corcelli A. The cardiolipin analogues of archaea.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For instance, in the halophilic organism Halorubrum sp., hypotonic stress resulted in increased production of Gro-DACL, as well as the mono-archaetidyl-cardiolipin species S-di-glycosyl-mono-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (S-2glyco-MACL), which only contains one phosphate group. This cardiolipin species (originally referred to as: S-DGD-5-PA) consists of an archaetidic acid (AA) molecule attached to a sulfated diglycosyl diphytanylglycerol diether (S-2Glyco-DGD) (20Lopalco P. Lobasso S. Babudri F. Corcelli A. Osmotic shock stimulates de novo synthesis of two cardiolipins in an extreme halophilic archaeon.J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 194-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further, a variety of other glycosyl-mono-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (glyco-MACL) species have been identified in archaea (19Corcelli A. The cardiolipin analogues of archaea.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, Halobacterium salinarum produces an S-tri-glycosyl-diether glycolipid fused to AA (S-3Glyco-MACL, originally referred to as: S-TGD-1-PA) (21Lobasso S. Lopalco P. Lattanzio V.M.T. Corcelli A. Osmotic shock induces the presence of glycocardiolipin in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2120-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), while Haloferax volcanii also contains the glycosyl cardiolipin analogue S-2Glyco-MACL (originally referred to as: S-GL-2) (22Sprott G.D. Larocque S. Cadotte N. Dicaire C.J. McGee M. Brisson J.R. Novel polar lipids of halophilic eubacterium Planococcus H8 and archaeon Haloferax volcanii.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The polar head group of these glyco-MACL species is structurally very different from the classical di-phosphatidyl/archaetidyl cardiolipin species, which raises questions on the specific function of these lipids, as well as the enzymatic mechanism of their synthesis. Whereas cardiolipin synthesis in Eukaryotes and Bacteria has been studied extensively, the mechanism of cardiolipin biosynthesis in Archaea has largely remained unexplored. Currently, two phylogenetically distinct types of enzyme families are known in Bacteria and Eukaryotes to synthesize di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin. One family is characterized by the presence of a cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase domain (Cls_cap), which catalyzes Gro-DPCL synthesis by utilizing the substrates cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (23Schlame M. Greenberg M.L. Biosynthesis, remodeling and turnover of mitochondrial cardiolipin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2017; 1862: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the first phosphate group connected to DAG is coupled to the polar glycerol head of PG, and a cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is released. Cls_cap enzymes are predominantly found in eukaryotes, but have more recently also been identified in bacteria (24Sandoval-Calderón M. Geiger O. Guan Z. Barona-Gómez F. Sohlenkamp C. A eukaryote-like cardiolipin synthase is present in Streptomyces coelicolor and in most actinobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17383-17390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second family features two phospholipase D (PLD) domains (Cls_pld), which enable Gro-DPCL synthesis by transferring the phosphatidyl group, originating from a PG molecule, to another PG, whereby a glycerol molecule is released. This type of Gro-DPCL biosynthesis is predominantly present in Bacteria, but has been found in eukaryotes as well (25Tian H.-F. Feng J.-M. Wen J.-F.

Complex evolution of two types of cardiolipin synthase in the eukaryotic lineage stramenopiles.Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2016; 101: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This latter reaction is catalyzed by the ClsA and ClsB-type cardiolipin synthases (Cls) (27Li C. Tan B.K. Zhao J. Guan Z. In vivo and in vitro synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol by an Escherichia coli cardiolipin synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25144-25153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Tropp B.E. Cardiolipin synthase from Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, an alternative synthesis method has been identified in Escherichia coli in which phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is used together with PG, to form Gro-DPCL and ethanolamine, a reaction catalyzed by the PLD-containing ClsC-type enzymes (17Tan B.K. Bogdanov M. Zhao J. Dowhan W. Raetz C.R.H. Guan Z. Discovery of a cardiolipin synthase utilizing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol as substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16504-16509Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. Bacterial membrane lipids: Diversity in structures and pathways.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Homology searches in genomes of archaea revealed Cls-like members from both Cls_pld and Cls_cap cardiolipin synthesizing families. However, until now no archaeal enzyme has been experimentally associated with any cardiolipin biosynthesis. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a PLD-containing cardiolipin synthase of the Euryarchaeote Methanospirillum hungatei. The enzyme showed a remarkable promiscuity with respect to accepted and produced lipid species, ranging from a wide variety of phospholipids and di-phosphatidyl/archaetidyl-cardiolipins to include even glycolipid and glycosyl-mono-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin species. Cardiolipins have only been identified in some archaea, most notably in halophiles: a group of organisms belonging to the phylum of the Euryarchaeota (19Corcelli A. The cardiolipin analogues of archaea.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To identify possible cardiolipin synthesizing enzymes in archaea, we performed a BLAST homology search with both Cls_cap and Cls_pld templates to the domain of Archaea. For the identification of archaeal Cls_cap candidates, the cardiolipin synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (Sco1389) was used, for which mostly hypothetical proteins were found that could only be appointed to a specific (sub-)phylum (e.g., candidatus Woesearchaeota archaeon) (data not shown) (30Sciara G. Clarke O.B. Tomasek D. Kloss B. Tabuso S. Byfield R. Cohn R. Banerjee S. Rajashankar K.R. Slavkovic V. Graziano J.H. Shapiro L. Mancia F. Structural basis for catalysis in a CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although these hypothetic proteins contain the cap-motif, no cultured individual archaeal species was identified, and therefore they were not further used in this study. Likewise, to identify putative PLD-containing archaeal cardiolipin synthases, the three Cls enzymes (ClsA, ClsB, and ClsC) of the bacterium E. coli were used as template in the BLAST search. This resulted in similar hits, with the best sequence coverage and identity with ClsA (see Supporting information). After comparing the BLAST results obtained for all three Cls_pld templates, the sequence coverage and identity with E. coli ClsA (EcClsA) were the largest, so it was decided to continue with these putative archaeal candidates. Although the crystal structure of EcClsA has not been determined, a membrane topology prediction based on the average hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequences of a family of bacterial ClsA proteins reveals the presence of two hydrophobic regions at the N-terminus of this membrane protein (corresponding to amino acids 7–29 and 39–61 in ClsA) (Fig. 1A). These could represent transmembrane segments that are linked to a C-terminal globular domain (Fig. 1B, left panel) that contains two HKD motifs (HxKx4D), which are universally present in cardiolipin synthases that belong to the phospholipase D superfamily (28Tropp B.E. Cardiolipin synthase from Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The BLAST homology search revealed two main clusters of archaeal homologs that also contain the two HKD motifs (Fig. 1C), which are discussed in more detail in the Supporting information (Figs. S1 and S2). One cluster consists of halophilic archaea and the other concerns methanogenic archaea, both groups belonging to the Euryarchaeota. The enzymes from the cluster of methanogenic archaea show about 20 to 25% sequence identity with the E. coli ClsA, including the predicted two hydrophobic regions at the N-terminus (Fig. S3). Specifically, the second predicted N-terminal hydrophobic domain contains the conserved motif: Wx7Px2Gx3Yx3G (“x” represents a hydrophobic amino acid), present also in bacterial ClsA-type proteins (Fig. 1D), but not found in enzymes belonging to the halophilic cluster (Fig. S2). The high incidence of hydrophobic amino acids suggests that this region is likely embedded in the membrane. The conserved proline and glycine (PxxG) residues are located in the middle of the hydrophobic stretch. These two amino acids are often found in turns and loops and thus may introduce flexibility in this predicted helix region (31Krieger F. Möglich A. Kiefhaber T. Effect of proline and glycine residues on dynamics and barriers of loop formation in polypeptide chains.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3346-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Jacob J.

J. 1999; 76: 1367-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this hydrophobic region is flanked on both sides by multiple positive charges, which are known to inhibit translocation across the membrane according to the positive-inside rule and thus may affect the membrane topology of this region. As a consequence, this predicted helix domain may not span across the membrane, but represent a re-entrance loop that enters and leaves the membrane at the same leaflet side (Fig. 1B, right panel). Taken together, this group of methanogenic ClsA-like proteins all appear to be promising candidates for potential archaeal cardiolipin synthases. The putative M. hungatei Cls (WP_011448254) was selected for further characterization as it is the only candidate present in this organism. Furthermore, it grows at mesophilic temperatures and a pH around 7, with an osmotic requirement that is comparable to E. coli, which was used for protein overexpression. The putative M. hungatei ClsA homologue (MhCls) was ordered as an E. coli codon-optimized synthetic gene, cloned into a His-tag containing overexpression vector, and expressed in E. coli. Overexpressed MhCls was recovered from the membrane fraction, solubilized with the detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM; 2%, w/v), and purified by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). To confirm that MhCls is indeed an archaeal cardiolipin synthase, the activity of purified enzyme toward the substrate archaetidylglycerol (AG) was tested in vitro. Since this archaeal equivalent of PG is not commercially available, both the sn1-sn1 (14) and the sn1-sn3 (14’) diastereomers of AG were chemically synthesized (Fig. 2B) (see the Supporting information; Figs. S4–S6). The bis-phytanyl glycerol core was readily synthesized from commercially available phytol and glycidol. Both enantiomers of the glycerol-phosphate headgroup were also produced by asymmetric synthesis and were individually coupled to the aforementioned chiral lipid core via a phosphor–amidite coupling. After the successful synthesis of sn1-sn1 and sn1-sn3 AG, first a mixture of both diastereomers was incubated overnight at 37 °C together with purified MhCls. LC-MS analysis revealed that the majority of AG was consumed, which coincided with the production of an ion m/z 1520.30 [M-H]−, corresponding to glycerol-di-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DACL) (Fig. 2C; for fragmentation data see Fig. S7). In the absence of MhCls, no such conversion was observed. Subsequently the activity of MhCls toward the individual AG diastereomers (sn1 and sn3) was tested and compared, but both acted as substrates in a similar manner (data not shown). Aside from producing Gro-DACL, MhCls additionally synthesized the lipid species archaetidic acid (AA) (Fig. 2C). The latter is probably the result of an unsuccessful transfer of the archaetidyl group, whereby the enzyme hydrolyzes the terminal phosphodiester bond in a phospholipase D-like manner. To verify that MhCls functions as a cardiolipin synthase in vivo, the gene was expressed in an E. coli clsABC null strain (17Tan B.K. Bogdanov M. Zhao J. Dowhan W. Raetz C.R.H. Guan Z. Discovery of a cardiolipin synthase utilizing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol as substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16504-16509Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the lipidome revealed the presence of multiple Gro-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DPCL) species (differing in acyl-chain composition), indicating that this enzyme can also utilize phosphatidyl-containing lipids (Fig. 3B). As overexpression of an empty vector resulted in the complete absence of any CL-species (Fig. 3A), it can be concluded that MhCls is a cardiolipin synthase. Next, the activity of MhCls toward the bacterial equivalents of the archaeal lipids was further tested in vitro. To perform the measurements under optimal conditions, adequate membrane reconstitution of MhCls is required for which a bacterial lipid/detergent molar ratio profile was recorded for the substrate PG (Fig. S8). Subsequently, MhCls activity was monitored in the presence of PG, which resulted in the formation of Gro-DPCL, showing again that the enzyme accepts both bacterial and archaeal phospholipids as a substrate. Similar to AG, utilization of PG resulted in the production of not only Gro-DPCL, but also phosphatidic acid (PA). Initially most of the PG is converted into Gro-DPCL, although some PA is produced as well (Fig. 4A, purple lines). Eventually the PG levels reach a plateau, and Gro-DPCL levels start to drop, concomitantly with the continuous production of PA. In the presence of a high concentration (100 mM) of glycerol (Fig. 4A, green lines), the initial conversion of PG into Gro-DPCL is similar, but production of PA is significantly reduced, while PG reaches a plateau level at a higher concentration. This indicates that glycerol most likely stimulates the formation of PG in a reverse transesterification reaction and thereby competes with the hydrolysis of Gro-DPCL (Fig. 4D). To confirm this hypothesis, the same reaction was performed with Gro-DPCL as substrate. In the presence of 100 mM glycerol (Fig. 4B, green lines), Gro-DPCL is initially predominantly converted into PG, while only low levels of PA are noted. In contrast, in the absence of glycerol, PA formation is stimulated, while lower levels of PG are observed (Fig. 4B, purple lines). These data demonstrate that PA is formed together with PG by hydrolysis of Gro-DPCL (Fig. 4D). Hydrolysis of a Gro-DPCL should yield stoichiometric amounts of PA and PG, but released PG can be directly reutilized for production of this cardiolipin species. To examine the reaction in more detail and to further address the transesterification step, PG and Gro-DPCL, both with a different acyl-chain composition, were introduced. This enables the detection of a single lipid type as a substrate or a product, based on the detected mass. Incubation of MhCls with an equimolar ratio of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG 16:0/18:1) and di-oleoyl-di-oleoyl-glycerol-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DPCL 18:1/18:1/18:1/18:1) resulted in the expected production of palmitoyl-oleoyl-palmitoyl-oleoyl-glycerol-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-DPCL 16:0/18:1/18:1/16:0), di-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG 18:1/18:1), and di-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (DOPA 18:1/18:1), but also in the production of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA 16:0/18:1), demonstrating that the enzymatic reaction occurs in both directions (Fig. 4C). Moreover, a Gro-DPCL species with the mixed 16:0/18:1 and 18:1/18:1 acyl-chain configuration could be identified as well, which is the synthesis product of POPG combined with DOPG. The latter originated from the reverse-transesterification reaction of Gro-DPCL 18:1/18:1/18:1/18:1, thereby showing the dynamic character of the PG - Gro-DPCL equilibrium (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, the accumulation of PA suggests that this reaction eventually becomes unidirectional as PA cannot be further used. Indeed, when POPA 16:0/18:1 was added to a reaction containing DOPG 18:1/18:1, the MhCls-mediated reaction resulted in the formation of only Gro-DPCL 18:1/18:1/18:1/18:1 and DOPA, whereas no POPG or Gro-DPCL 16:0/18:1/16:0/18:1 was detected, showing that PA cannot be reutilized by MhCls (Fig. S9). Like most archaeal lipids, AG consists of two isoprenoid chains that are coupled to a glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P) backbone via an ether bond, whereas PG, present in Bacteria and Eukaryotes, exists as fatty acid tails that are ester-linked to a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). This makes that the glycerol backbone of the archaeal AG has the opposite chirality compared with bacterial/eukaryotic PG. To further examine the lipid specificity of MhCls, its activity was examined in the presence of a mixture containing both PG and AG (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, not only Gro-DPCL and Gro-DACL were produced, but an additional cardiolipin species was detected: m/z 1488.16 [M-H]−, which contains one set of isoprenoid lipid tails and one set of fatty acid lipid tails (Fig. 5, B and C; for fragmentation data see Fig. S7). This lipid species represents a unique archaeal–bacterial hybrid glycerol-archaetidyl-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (Gro-APCL). Moreover, Gro-APCL seems to be the major produced CL species, while about the same amount of ions are detected for Gro-DACL and Gro-DPCL, suggesting that there is no clear preference for any of the lipid substrates PG or AG. In the MhCls-mediated conversion of Gro-DPCL, either glycerol or H2O is utilized. This raises the question: which other molecules can be used by this enzyme? Therefore, molecules structurally related to glycerol were tested in the Gro-DPCL transesterification reaction (Fig. 6A). In the presence of 1-propanol, Gro-DPCL consumption resulted in the production of substantial amounts of phosphatidyl-1-propanol (P-1-PrOH). On the other hand, the addition of 2-propanol resulted only in low levels (∼1%) of phosphatidyl-2-propanol (P-2-PrOH), illustrating the importance of a primary hydroxyl (–OH) group for the transesterification. Similar to 1-propanol, 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol functioned together with Gro-DPCL as substrates for MhCls, resulting in the formation of phosphatidyl-1,2-propanol (P-1,2-PrOH) and phosphatidyl-1,3-propanol (P-1,3-PrOH), respectively. However, in the case of 1,3-PrOH, a clear additional ion m/z 1440.20 [M-H]− could be identified, which corresponds to the molecule 1,3-propanediol-di-phosphatidyl-cardiolipin (1,3-PrOH-DPCL), a Gro-DPCL analogue containing a propanediol head group instead of a glycerol. This remarkable cardiolipin species could have only been formed if P-1,3-PrOH functioned as a phosphatid"
https://openalex.org/W3155949007,"The anti-aging gene, klotho, has been identified as a multi-functional humoral factor and is implicated in multiple biological processes. However, the effects of klotho on podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy are poorly understood. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the renoprotective effects of klotho against podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy. We examined lipid accumulation and klotho expression in the kidneys of diabetic patients and animals. We stimulated cultured mouse podocytes with palmitate to induce lipotoxicity-mediated podocyte injury with or without recombinant klotho. Klotho level was decreased in podocytes of lipid-accumulated obese diabetic kidneys and palmitate-treated mouse podocytes. Palmitate-treated podocytes showed increased apoptosis, intracellular ROS, ER stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, and these were significantly attenuated by klotho administration. Klotho treatment restored palmitate-induced downregulation of the antioxidant molecules, Nrf2, Keap1, and SOD1. Klotho inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO3a, promoted its nuclear translocation, and then upregulated MnSOD expression. In addition, klotho administration attenuated palmitate-induced cytoskeleton changes, decreased nephrin expression, and increased TRPC6 expression, eventually improving podocyte albumin permeability. These results suggest that klotho administration prevents palmitate-induced functional and morphological podocyte injuries, and this may indicate that klotho is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of podocyte injury in obese diabetic nephropathy."

There is a paucity of data on the effect of FGM practice in two generations in Africa. This study assessed the current practice of daughters’ FGM among women living in 14 FGM-prone countries in Africa as a proxy to assess the future burden of FGM in the continent. We used Demographic and Health Surveys data collected between 2010 and 2018 from 14 African countries. We analyzed information on 93,063 women-daughter pair (Level 1) from 8,396 communities (Level 2) from the 14 countries (Level 3). We fitted hierarchical multivariable binomial logistic regression models using the MLWin 3.03 module in Stata version 16 at p&lt;0.05. The overall prevalence of FGM among mothers and their daughters was 60.0% and 21.7%, respectively, corresponding to 63.8% reduction in the mother-daughter ratio of FGM. The prevalence of FGM among daughters in Togo and Tanzania were less than one per cent, 48.6% in Guinea, with the highest prevalence of 78.3% found in Mali. The percentage reduction in mother-daughter FGM ratio was highest in Tanzania (96.7%) and Togo (94.2%), compared with 10.0% in Niger, 15.0% in Nigeria and 15.9% in Mali. Prevalence of daughters’ FGM among women with and without FGM was 34.0% and 3.1% respectively. The risk of mothers having FGM for their daughters was significantly associated with maternal age, educational status, religion, household wealth quintiles, place of residence, community unemployment and community poverty. The country and community where the women lived explained about 57% and 42% of the total variation in FGM procurement for daughters. Procurement of FGM for the daughters of the present generation of mothers in Africa is common, mainly, among those from low social, poorer, rural and less educated women. We advocate for more context-specific studies to fully assess the role of each of the identified risk factors and design sustainable intervention towards the elimination of FGM in Africa."

Although the diagnostic procedure for AK has improved, further development and effective diagnostic tool utilization for AK need to continue. Chorismate mutase is a key regulatory enzyme involved in the shikimate pathway, a metabolic pathway absent in mammals but central for amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants. In this study, we describe the identification and production of a polyclonal peptide antibody targeting chorismate mutase secreted by A . castellanii , which could be used for AK diagnosis. Western blot was performed using the protein lysates and conditioned media of the human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, non-pathogenic Acanthamoeba , pathogenic Acanthamoeba , clinical isolate of Acanthamoeba spp., and other causes of keratitis such as Fusarium solani , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus aureus . Polyclonal antibodies raised against A . castellanii chorismate mutase specifically interacted with lysates of Acanthamoeba origin and their culture media, while such interactions were not observed from other samples. Acanthamoeba -specificity of chorismate mutase was also confirmed using immunocytochemistry after co-culturing Acanthamoeba with HCE cells. Specific binding of the chorismate mutase antibody to Acanthamoeba was observed, which were absent in the case of HCE cells. These results indicate that the chorismate mutase antibody of Acanthamoeba may serve as a method for rapid and differential Acanthamoeba identification."
https://openalex.org/W3157088446,"YhcB, a poorly understood protein conserved across gamma-proteobacteria, contains a domain of unknown function (DUF1043) and an N-terminal transmembrane domain. Here, we used an integrated approach including X-ray crystallography, genetics, and molecular biology to investigate the function and structure of YhcB. The Escherichia coli yhcB KO strain does not grow at 45 °C and is hypersensitive to cell wall-acting antibiotics, even in the stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septum development. The Z-ring is essential for the positioning of the septa and the initiation of cell division. We found that YhcB interacts with proteins of the divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). Seven of these interactions are also conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we mapped the amino acid residues likely involved in the interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The 2.8 Å crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric α-helical coiled-coil structure likely to be involved in linking the Z-ring to the septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing complexes. In summary, YhcB is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that plays a role in cell division and consequently affects envelope biogenesis. Based on these findings, we propose to rename YhcB to ZapG (Z-ring-associated protein G). This study will serve as a starting point for future studies on this protein family and on how cells transit from exponential to stationary survival."
https://openalex.org/W3156451337,"Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) is known to have important roles in labor, but the detailed mechanism underlying the spontaneous human labor remains unknown. Here, we examined the involvement of prostaglandin biosynthetic enzymes and transporter in the accumulation of PGE 2 in amniotic fluid in human labor. PGE 2 and its metabolites were abundant in amniotic fluid in deliveries at term in labor (TLB), but not at term not in labor (TNL). In fetal-membrane Transwell assays, levels of PGE 2 production in both maternal and fetal compartments were significantly higher in the TLB group than the TNL group. In fetal-membrane, the mRNA level of PTGES3 , which encodes cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (cPGES), was significantly higher in TLB than in TNL, but the mRNA levels of the other PGE 2 -synthase genes were not affected by labor. Moreover, the mRNA level of PTGS2 , which encodes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the amnion was significantly higher in TLB than in TNL. Western blot analyses revealed that the levels of COX-1 and COX-2 were comparable between the two groups, however, the level of cPGES was relatively higher in TLB than in TNL. COXs, cPGES, and prostaglandin transporter (SLCO2A1) proteins were all expressed in both chorionic trophoblasts and amniotic epithelium. These findings suggest that COXs, cPGES and SLCO2A1 contribute to PGE 2 production from fetal-membrane in labor."

In this study, we explored associations between salivary cortisol as a potential biomarker for stress and depressive symptoms and several self-completed psychological measurement scales among pregnant women. In total, 652 pregnant women participating in the PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised (PRAQ-R), and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS) and collected a single awakening salivary cortisol sample around gestational week 17. Odds ratios, Spearman’s correlation coefficients (ρ s ) and Cohen’s Kappa coefficients (κ) were calculated to examine the associations between the EDS, PHQ-2, PRAQ-R, TPDS, and maternal cortisol levels. The overall correlation coefficient between the score on the EDS and the salivary cortisol level was 0.01 (p = 0.89) with κ = -0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.08–0.06). We did not observe agreement between the PHQ-2 and cortisol levels either (κ = 0.06 (95% CI -0.02–0.14)). The results for the PRAQ-R and TPDS were similar with overall correlations with maternal cortisol levels of ρ s = 0.01 (p = 0.81) and ρ s = 0.06 (p = 0.35) and agreements of κ = 0.02 (95% CI -0.06–0.09) and κ = -0.02 (95% CI -0.11–0.07), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3154703777,"Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) is the main cereal crop in many Asian countries. The Asian rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (brown planthopper), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) (white-backed planthopper), and Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (small brown planthopper) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), are the most economically important pests of rice. These three rice planthopper species often co-occur in the same paddy field. Traditionally, species identification of individuals of the three rice planthopper species has relied on morphological characters, but accurate discrimination of early-instar nymphs is very difficult, even for expert researchers. In this study, we developed a rapid one-step multiplex PCR assay using conserved and species-specific 5 . 8S - ITS2 rDNA gene primers for simultaneous identification of individuals of the three rice planthopper species. The multiplex PCR results showed that the three rice planthopper species could be identified accurately based on the length of the resultant amplicon, regardless of the individual developmental stage. Furthermore, we applied this assay for the first accurate quantification of early-instar nymphs of each rice planthopper species in paddy fields. Notably, we found that the species composition of early-instar nymphs cannot be extrapolated from that of adults. Thus, the multiplex PCR assay developed here facilitates detection of each rice planthopper species at the beginning of outbreaks in paddy fields."

Currently, the relationships between CRC and serum cholesterol or statin treatment, especially in older adults under 75 years of age, remain questionable due to a lack of data. The present study evaluated the association between serum cholesterol levels and statin treatment continuity and CRC risk in older adults under 75 years of age.This study used senior cohort data obtained from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea. The selected cohort contains 131,266 participants who were enrolled from 2009 to 2011 and followed for up to 5 years. Serum cholesterol levels were classified as categorical variables, and continuity of statin treatment was evaluated based on dyslipidemia diagnosis and average medication possession ratio. We used Cox regression analysis to evaluate the associations between CRC risk and serum cholesterol level or statin use.A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) was significantly associated with high CRC risk compared to an HDL-C level in the normal range(hazard ratio [HR]: 1.197, 95% CI: 1.040-1.377). A high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) was associated with increased CRC risk compared to a normal LDL-C level, but not statistically significant. Statin use was associated with decreased CRC risk, and high medication compliance was inversely associated with CRC risk in patients with and without dyslipidemia.Statin use was associated with decreased CRC risk, and high medication compliance was inversely associated with CRC risk in patients with and without dyslipidemia compared to non-use of medication. Regular health examinations can help identify individuals who are vulnerable to CRC, and continued statin use may be associated with a reduced risk of CRC. This is particularly important in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W3156475591,"Background and aims Knowledge of the proper dry weight plays a critical role in the efficiency of dialysis and the survival of hemodialysis patients. Recently, bioimpedance spectroscopy(BIS) has been widely used for set dry weight in hemodialysis patients. However, BIS is often misrepresented in clinical healthy weight. In this study, we tried to predict the clinically proper dry weight (DW CP ) using machine learning for patient’s clinical information including BIS. We then analyze the factors that influence the prediction of the clinical dry weight. Methods As a retrospective, single center study, data of 1672 hemodialysis patients were reviewed. DW CP data were collected when the dry weight was measured using the BIS (DW BIS ). The gap between the two (Gap DW ) was calculated and then grouped and analyzed based on gaps of 1 kg and 2 kg. Results Based on the gap between DW BIS and DW CP , 972, 303, and 384 patients were placed in groups with gaps of &lt;1 kg, ≧1kg and &lt;2 kg, and ≧2 kg, respectively. For less than 1 kg and 2 kg of GapDW, It can be seen that the average accuracies for the two groups are 83% and 72%, respectively, in usign XGBoost machine learning. As Gap DW increases, it is more difficult to predict the target property. As Gap DW increase, the mean values of hemoglobin, total protein, serum albumin, creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, and the fat tissue index tended to decrease. However, the height, total body water, extracellular water (ECW), and ECW to intracellular water ratio tended to increase. Conclusions Machine learning made it slightly easier to predict DW CP based on DW BIS under limited conditions and gave better insights into predicting DW CP . Malnutrition-related factors and ECW were important in reflecting the differences between DW BIS and DW CP ."
https://openalex.org/W3156979249,"Upon pathogen infection, receptors in plants will activate a localized immune response, the effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and a systemic immune response, the systemic acquired response (SAR). Infection also induces oscillations in the redox environment of plant cells, triggering response mechanisms involving sensitive cysteine residues that subsequently alter protein function. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> thimet oligopeptidases <i>TOP1</i> and <i>TOP2</i> are required for plant defense against pathogens and the oxidative stress response. Herein, we evaluated the biochemical attributes of TOP isoforms to determine their redox sensitivity using <i>ex vivo Escherichia coli</i> cultures and recombinant proteins. Moreover, we explored the link between their redox regulation and plant immunity in wild-type and mutant <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines. These analyses revealed that redox regulation of TOPs occurs through two mechanisms: (1) oxidative dimerization of full-length TOP1 <i>via</i> intermolecular disulfides engaging cysteines in the N-terminal signal peptide, and (2) oxidative activation of all TOPs <i>via</i> cysteines that are unique and conserved. Further, we detected increased TOP activity in wild-type plants undergoing ETI or SAR following inoculation with <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> strains. Mutants unable to express the chloroplast NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) showed elevated TOP activity under unstressed conditions and were SAR-incompetent. A <i>top1top2</i> knockout mutant challenged with <i>P. syringae</i> exhibited misregulation of ROS-induced gene expression in pathogen-inoculated and distal tissues. Furthermore, TOP1 and TOP2 could cleave a peptide derived from the immune component ROC1 with distinct efficiencies at common and specific sites.

The aldolase that initiates Neu5Ac metabolism in E. coli, NanA, has been reported to act on the alpha-anomer. Surprisingly, when we performed this reaction at pH 6 to minimize spontaneous anomerization, we found NanA and its human homolog NPL preferentially metabolize the open form of this substrate. We tested whether the E. coli Neu5Ac anomerase NanM could promote turnover, finding it stimulated the utilization of both beta and alpha-anomers by NanA in vitro. However, NanM is localized in the periplasmic space and cannot facilitate Neu5Ac metabolism by NanA in the cytoplasm in vivo.

Most of the enzymes of the classical metabolic pathways are molecularly identified. Yet even in the case of widely studied organisms, such as humans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, there seem to be still many putative enzymes whose molecular function has not yet been identified (1Ellens K.W. Christian N. Singh C. Satagopam V.P. May P. Linster C.L. Confronting the catalytic dark matter encoded by sequenced genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 11495-11514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Enzymes that are likely to have been understudied (to the major exception of carbonic anhydrases) are those that accelerate spontaneous reactions. Major reasons for this oversight probably include that such enzymes may seem to be unnecessary and that they are not essential for survival under standard conditions. Furthermore, the background “activity” of the spontaneous reaction makes them difficult to investigate. The present paper is devoted to the identification of a new example of such an enzyme, catalyzing the ring opening of the pyranose form of a sugar to facilitate its metabolism by an aldolase. Sialic acids form a large family of nine carbon sugar acids, the most common of which is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Sialic acids are most often found at the extremities of glycans present on extracellular proteins and at the surface of vertebrate cells, where they serve for diverse interactions. Sialoconjugates are particularly abundant in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, where they may interact with bacteria. Many of these bacteria have acquired the capacity to metabolize sialoconjugates and/or sialic acids. Some of them, such as E. coli (2Vimr E.R. Troy F.A.

The first enzymatic step in the degradation of sialic acid is its cleavage by N-acetylneuraminate lyase, an enzyme catalyzing an aldolase type of reaction leading to pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine formation (4Comb D.G.

The latter is then phosphorylated to N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate, which is further metabolized by an epimerase.

The putative active site contains a copper ion coordinated to four amino acid side chains. The conclusion of this work, based mainly on the operon context of closely related YhcHs, was that this protein might be a sugar isomerase involved in the processing of exogenous sialic acid by possibly catalyzing an epimerase reaction. However, no experimental support was provided for this speculation.

This preference is puzzling, as the reaction mechanism involves opening of the substrate to form a Schiff’s base with a lysine in the active site (18North R.A. Watson A.J.A. Pearce F.G.

As described in the present article, we recently reinvestigated this problem with the help of the Neu5Ac anomerase NanM and concluded that in vitro, this anomerase greatly facilitates the reaction catalyzed by Neu5Ac aldolase by providing this enzyme with the open form of its substrate. As NanM is physiologically present in the periplasmic space, we wondered whether a cytosolic protein of as yet unknown function would catalyze this reaction and found that YhcH acts as an anomerase that opens the cyclic forms of Neu5Ac, thereby facilitating its utilization by the aldolase. This role of YhcH is the first example of an anomerase serving physiologically to provide another enzyme with an open sugar. Solutions of Neu5Ac contain about 7% of the alpha-anomer of sialic acid (α-Neu5Ac) (Fig. 1A) (12Deijl C.M. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Soc. 2008; 130: 11892-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To verify that α-Neu5Ac is the true substrate of Neu5Ac aldolase (NanA), we used a spectrophotometric assay in which the pyruvate formed by this enzyme is reduced by lactate dehydrogenase to L-lactate with concomitant consumption of NADH (6Kentache T. Thabault L. Peracchi A. Frédérick R. Bommer G.T. Van Schaftingen E. The putative Escherichia coli dehydrogenase YjhC metabolises two dehydrated forms of N-acetylneuraminate produced by some sialidases.Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40: 1-15Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) for the assay. These experiments were initially performed at pH 6, where spontaneous anomerization is slow (19Chan J. Sandhu G. Bennet A.J. A mechanistic study of sialic acid mutarotation: Implications for mutarotase enzymes.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2011; 9: 4818-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Adding E. coli recombinant NanA to such an assay containing 200 μM Neu5Ac did not lead to the expected rapid consumption of ≈14 μM NADH (ΔA340 = 0.084 AU), if α-Neu5Ac was rapidly consumed by the aldolase (Fig. 1B). Instead, a slow NADH consumption was observed, that was very similar at the three different NanA concentrations. This excluded both alpha and beta-anomer as primary substrate and indicated that the rate-limiting step in the assay was not the aldolase activity, but rather the supply of the true substrate to this enzyme, likely by spontaneous conversion of the beta and alpha-anomers to the linear form. Accordingly, the NADH consumption was about five times faster at pH 7 and even more so at pH 8, in agreement with the well-known effect of alkalinization on the spontaneous anomerization of Neu5Ac (19Chan J. Sandhu G. Bennet A.J. A mechanistic study of sialic acid mutarotation: Implications for mutarotase enzymes.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2011; 9: 4818-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). Remarkably, the addition of the anomerase NanM accelerated more than 20-fold the rate of the reaction at pH 6 (Fig. 1B), to a lesser extent at pH 7 (Fig. 1C), and minimally at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1D). Of note, the concentration of NanM (0.05 μM) needed to stimulate the reaction half-maximally was about 40-fold lower than the concentration (2 μM) of the aldolase NanA (Fig. 1E), indicating that the effect observed is not due to the formation of a complex between NanA and NanM. Taken together these findings hinted that the real substrate of Neu5Ac aldolase is neither the beta-anomer, nor the alpha-anomer, but most likely the linear form of Neu5Ac. NanM interconverts the alpha and the beta-anomers via the open form. Therefore, its stimulatory effect on the activity of the aldolase (NanA) in a solution containing mostly the beta-anomer could be due either to the alpha-anomer or to the linear form being the substrate for NanA. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed experiments in which the alpha-anomer is generated in the assay cuvette by hydrolysis of a sialylconjugate by Clostridium sialidase A (12Deijl C.M. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Configuration of substrate and products of N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase from Clostridium perfringens.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If the alpha-anomer is the true substrate, one would expect that addition of the anomerase would decrease the rate of the aldolase reaction, since it would reduce the concentration of alpha-anomer by converting it into the linear form and the beta-anomer. Yet, as shown in Figure 1, F–H, the opposite was observed: addition of the anomerase NanM accelerated the reaction up to ≈4 fold at pH 6, further indicating that the open form is the real substrate and that the anomerase allows its rapid reformation from the alpha-anomer as soon as it is consumed by the aldolase. Neu5Ac is transported by the carrier NanT as its beta-anomer across the inner membrane of E. coli and NanM is present in the periplasmic space to facilitate the utilization of the alpha-anomer (20Severi E. Müller A. Potts J.R. Leech A. Williamson D. Wilson K.S. Thomas G.H. Sialic acid mutarotation is catalyzed by the Escherichia coli β-propeller protein YjhT.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4841-4849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Due to its location in the periplasmic space, NanM cannot provide the aldolase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, with the linear form of Neu5Ac. Therefore, we hypothesized that another enzyme might perform this function in the cytoplasm. We focused our attention on YhcH, a protein of unknown function encoded by sialic acid operons (Fig. 2A). Producing recombinant YhcH with a His-tag at the N-terminus (as in the ASKA collection (21Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. Complete set of ORF clones of Escherichia coli ASKA library (a complete set of E. coli K-12 ORF archive): Unique resources for biological research.DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar)) did not provide satisfactory yield, presumably because the N-terminus of the protein interacts with the neighboring subunit in the dimer as in the structure of the H. influenzae homolog (11Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Toedt J. Galperin M.Y. Gilliland G.L. Crystal structure of the bacterial YhcH protein indicates a role in sialic acid catabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5520-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the recombinant protein was produced with a C-terminal His-tag. Like the anomerase NanM, recombinant E. coli YhcH increased the rate of the aldolase reaction when a solution of Neu5Ac (essentially the beta-anomer) was used as a substrate. However, we noted that about tenfold higher concentrations of YhcH than of NanM were required to reach a similar effect (Fig. 2, B and C). We also noted that YhcH stimulated the activity when the alpha-anomer of Neu5Ac was produced. However, to observe this effect, we had to use higher concentrations of YhcH than required to obtain the effect on the beta-anomer. These findings suggested that YhcH is able to catalyze a full anomerase reaction, though less efficiently than NanM. This was confirmed by using NMR to follow the formation of the beta-anomer of Neu5Ac from the alpha-anomer, as generated by the NAD+-dependent hydratase YjhC from 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminate (2,3-EN) (6Kentache T. Thabault L. Peracchi A. Frédérick R. Bommer G.T. Van Schaftingen E. The putative Escherichia coli dehydrogenase YjhC metabolises two dehydrated forms of N-acetylneuraminate produced by some sialidases.Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40: 1-15Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The alpha-anomer (Fig. 2D) and the beta-anomer (Fig. 2E) (each assessed with the shift corresponding to axial H3) appeared progressively in the absence of YhcH or NanM. The presence of 15 μM YhcH and even more so of 0.5 μM NanM reduced the accumulation of the alpha-anomer (Fig. 2D) and stimulated the appearance of the beta-anomer (Fig. 2E), thus strongly decreasing the ratio of alpha/beta anomers (Fig. 2F). Both anomerases modestly stimulated the utilization of 2,3-EN and lowered the formation of 2,7-AN (Fig. S1), presumably by reducing the inhibition exerted by α-Neu5Ac on YjhC (6Kentache T. Thabault L. Peracchi A. Frédérick R. Bommer G.T. Van Schaftingen E. The putative Escherichia coli dehydrogenase YjhC metabolises two dehydrated forms of N-acetylneuraminate produced by some sialidases.Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40: 1-15Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that YhcH catalyzes a full anomerase reaction, though less efficiently than NanM. Furthermore, the conversion of the beta-anomer to the linear form by YhcH was more efficient than the conversion of the alpha-anomer to the open form. We considered the possibility that NanM and YhcH acted by directly stimulating the activity of Neu5Ac aldolase rather than by providing the appropriate substrate. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate. This compound is a weak substrate of Neu5Ac aldolase, but, unlike Neu5Ac, it is largely present in the open form (about 30%; supplementary data in ref (22Watanabe S. Fukumori F. Nishiwaki H. Sakurai Y. Tajima K. Watanabe Y. Novel non-phosphorylative pathway of pentose metabolism from bacteria.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). If YhcH and NanM stimulated the enzymatic activity of NanA by interacting with it, this should also accelerate the reaction of NanA on 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate. Yet, no such effect was observed (Fig. 3A), supporting the conclusion that the anomerases act by providing the open substrate. In contrast, both anomerases stimulated the conversion of 2-keto-3-deoxynonanoate (KDN), the deamino analogue of Neu5Ac, which is also essentially present in cyclic forms. Of note, the latter observation also indicates that the N-acetylamino group of Neu5Ac is not essential for substrates of the anomerases NanM and YhcH. To provide further support to the idea that NanM and YhcH do not act by stimulating the activity of NanA, we tested the effect of these E. coli anomerases on the human homolog of NanA (NPL), which only shares about 30% sequence identity with the E. coli NanA. This low degree of identity and the absence of a YhcH homolog in eukaryotes make it unlikely that the human NPL would have “conserved” an ancestral binding site present in its prokaryotic homologs. We noted that both NanM and YhcH stimulated the activity of human NPL on Neu5Ac (Fig. 3B), further arguing in favor of the idea that they act by providing the appropriate form of the substrate. To confirm that NanM and YhcH can indeed provide a linear form of Neu5Ac, we took advantage of the fact that the keto group in the linear Neu5Ac can form a semicarbazone when reacting with semicarbazide (23Olson J.A. Spectrophotometric measurement of α-keto acid semicarbazones.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 85: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Incubation with semicarbazide and measurement of the absorbance at 249 nm indicated that the formation of semicarbazone was stimulated up to about threefold by NanM (Fig. S2). In the case of YhcH, the acceleration was only observed at very low concentrations of semicarbazide, presumably because semicarbazide inhibited the anomerase activity. The reaction of semicarbazide with 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate, the sialic acid analog that is 30% in its open keto form (see above) was about 180-fold faster than the reaction with sialic acid. As expected, NanM or YhcH did not have any effect on the rate of semicarbazone formation from the largely linear compound 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate (Fig. S2). Altogether, these findings indicate that the anomerases NanM or YhcH facilitate the action of Neu5Ac aldolase by producing the open form of substrate. Previous data have shown that H. influenzae YhcH, which shares about 60% sequence identity with E. coli YhcH, contains a tightly bound copper, presumably Cu2+, in its catalytic site (11Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Toedt J. Galperin M.Y. Gilliland G.L. Crystal structure of the bacterial YhcH protein indicates a role in sialic acid catabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5520-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the metal content of purified E. coli YhcH, produced on a rich medium (LB) (Table S1). The protein mostly contained Zn (0.41 mol/mol) and lower amounts of Cu (0.051 mol/mol), Ni (0.061 mol/mol), and Mn (0.021 mol/mol). No significant amount of metal was found to be associated with NanM or NanA. We tried to enrich recombinant YhcH with different metal supplements in the culture medium. Enrichment with copper (80 μM CuCl2) did not lead to a significant increase in the Cu content (0.055 mol/mol) or decrease in the Zn content (0.467 mol/mol), while addition of MnCl2 (60 μM) led to an increase of Mn content (to 0.873 mol/mol) and a decrease in Zn content (0.308 mol/mol). Enrichment with ZnCl2 (30 μM) led to an increase in the Zn content to 1.13 mol/mol. Because of the preference of the protein for Zn, the Zn-enriched YhcH was used for all enzymatic studies. We also produced recombinant H. influenzae YhcH in E. coli grown on nonmetal-enriched LB medium. The metal content was 0.89, 0.014, 0.019, and 0.052 mol/mol for Zn, Cu, Ni, and Mn, respectively. Thus, the H. influenzae YhcH also showed a marked preference for Zn, similar to the E. coli protein. We have no explanation for the contradiction with previous results (11Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Toedt J. Galperin M.Y. Gilliland G.L. Crystal structure of the bacterial YhcH protein indicates a role in sialic acid catabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5520-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also tested the ability of H. influenzae YhcH to stimulate the activity of NanA on Neu5Ac and found that as expected it behaved like E. coli YhcH (not shown). This indicated that Zn can indeed be incorporated into functional YhcH. We also determined if metal chelators would decrease the activity of E. coli YhcH. Figure 4A shows that this was indeed the case, particularly with 1,10-phenanthroline. This effect was antagonized by adding ZnCl2 or MnCl2 (Fig. S3). While trying to supplement chelator-inhibited YhcH with divalent cations, we noted that some of them stimulated the NanA activity in the absence of the anomerases YhcH or NanM, which suggested that the divalent cations also catalyzed the anomerization of Neu5Ac. The effect of different divalent cations on the cleavage of Neu5Ac by NanA is illustrated in Figure 4B. Co2+, Ni2+, and Mn2+ stimulated the reaction by up to 5- to 7-fold while Cd2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ had much lower, barely detectable effects. Zn2+ could not be tested because it markedly inhibited NanA and LDH activity at concentrations >10 μM. Mn2+ and Co2+ also stimulated the cleavage of KDN, but not of 2-keto-3-deoxyxylonate (not shown), indicating that they acted by enhancing the opening of the substrate Neu5Ac and KDN rather than as cofactors that would stimulate the aldolase NanA. Further evidence that divalent cations accelerated the formation of the open form of Neu5Ac was obtained by showing that they accelerated the rate of the reaction of Neu5Ac with semicarbazide. The most potent cation was Zn2+, followed by Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, while Ca2+ and Mg2+ were almost devoid of effect, as observed when this was determined with the help of the NanA activity (Fig. 4C). Cu2+, which was tested at a wavelength of 260 nm rather than 249 nm, had a similar effect as Co2+ (not shown). To unequivocally demonstrate the anomerase activity of divalent cations, we used NMR to follow the conversion of the alpha-anomer of Neu5Ac to the beta-anomer in the presence and absence of Zn2+. In this experiment, we chose to generate α-Neu5Ac from 3’-sialyllactose with Clostridium sialidase A, rather than 2,3-EN and its hydratase YjhC (5Vimr E.R. Kalivoda K.A. Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Diversity of microbial sialic acid metabolism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 132-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), because the latter enzyme was found to be potently inhibited by Zn2+. As shown in Figure 4, D and E, Zn2+ markedly accelerated the formation of beta-anomer (as assessed by the shift of the beta H3eq) and the disappearance of the alpha-anomer (as assessed by the shift of the alpha H3ax). Mg2+ (Fig. 4, D and E) and Ca2+ had much smaller effects. Co2+ and Ni2+ also stimulated the appearance of β-Neu5Ac, but their effects were difficult to quantify due to broadening of the NMR signal (not shown). In contrast, we could not assess the effect of Mn2+ and Cu2+ due to the complete disappearance of the NMR signals. We also tested whether YhcH inactivation affected the growth of E. coli in medium containing either glucose or Neu5Ac as carbon source. Growth of the YhcH mutant on Neu5Ac was similar to the wild-type E. coli at 37 °C and pH 7, consistent with earlier reports (24Hopkins A.P. Hawkhead J.A. Thomas G.H. Transport and catabolism of the sialic acids N-glycolylneuraminic acid and 3-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic acid by Escherichia coli K-12.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2013; 347: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Data not shown). However, it was slightly but systematically delayed (Fig. 5, A and B and Fig. S4) at pH 6 and 20 °C, and this was corrected by complementation with YhcH. No growth defect was observed on glucose. We also performed competitive fitness assays in which we mixed equal amounts of wild-type E. coli and YhcH (or NanM) deficient bacteria and submitted them to six cycles of exponential growth on medium containing either Neu5Ac or glucose. At the end of the sixth exponential growth period, we plated the cells and genotyped ≈60 colonies by PCR. This revealed that growth on Neu5Ac led to a sixfold decrease in the relative abundance of YhcH-deficient bacteria compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 5C, left panel). This decrease was not observed with NanM-deficient bacteria (Fig. 5C, right panel) or when the YhcH deficient bacteria grew on the glucose-containing media (Fig. 5C, left panel). Our results lead to the conclusion that the open form of Neu5Ac form is the best substrate nor Neu5Ac aldolase, even though this form represents less than 0.5% of Neu5Ac in solution (15Klepach T.

https://openalex.org/W3158259449,"Homologues of the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA) lectins contain a sequence repeat of ∼66 amino acids, with the number of tandem repeats varying across family members. OAA homologues bind high-mannose glycans on viral surface proteins, thereby interfering with viral entry into host cells. As such, OAA homologues have potential utility as antiviral agents, but a more detailed understanding of their structure-function relationships would enable us to develop improved constructs. Here, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of free and glycan-bound forms of Pseudomonas taiwanensis lectin (PTL), an OAA-family lectin consisting of two tandem repeats. Like other OAA-family lectins, PTL exhibited a β-barrel-like structure with two symmetrically positioned glycan-binding sites at the opposite ends of the barrel. Upon glycan binding, the conformation of PTL undergoes a more significant change than expected from previous OAA structural analysis. Moreover, the electron density of the bound glycans suggested that the binding affinities are different at the two binding sites. Next, based on analysis of these structures, we used site-specific mutagenesis to create PTL constructs expected to increase the population with a conformation suitable for glycan binding. The engineered PTLs were examined for their antiviral activity against the influenza virus. Interestingly, some exhibited stronger activity compared with that of the parent PTL. We propose that our approach is effective for the generation of potential microbicides with enhanced antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W3153794459,"Time analysis of the course of an infectious disease epidemic is a critical way to understand the dynamics of pathogen transmission and the effect of population scale interventions. Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between the rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. Insight into different rates of decline infection numbers following the wave peak was also possible which could be a useful tool to guide the reopening of societies. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large-scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3155850780,"Protein aggregation is the abnormal association of misfolded proteins into larger, often insoluble structures that can be toxic during aging and in protein aggregation-associated diseases. Previous research has established a role for the cytosolic Tsa1 peroxiredoxin in responding to protein misfolding stress. Tsa1 is also known to downregulate the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway as part of the response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in protein misfolding stress is not known. Using transcriptomics, we examined the response to protein misfolding stress and found upregulation of numerous stress gene functions and downregulation of many genes related to protein synthesis and other growth-related processes consistent with the well-characterized environmental stress response. The scope of the transcriptional response is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains, but the magnitude is dampened in the strain lacking Tsa1. We identified a direct protein interaction between Tsa1 and the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is present under normal growth conditions and explains the observed differences in gene expression profiles. This interaction is increased in a redox-dependent manner in response to nascent protein misfolding, via Tsa1-mediated oxidation of Bcy1. Oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens PKA pathway activity, leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression. Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA provides a mechanism to mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to stress caused by exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species.

Even though conformational flexibility is required for protein function, forming abnormal conformations can result in protein misfolding and aggregation (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M.

It can be caused by exposing hydrophobic residues that would otherwise be buried within native protein folds and therefore protected from aberrant protein interactions (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A.

Newly synthesized proteins are particularly vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation due to translational errors during their synthesis, as well as the necessity to fold from linear peptide chains into their final native structures (4Tyedmers J.

To maintain protein homeostasis, cells contain an arsenal of molecular chaperones able to detect non-native, misfolded proteins and act upon them to prevent aggregation or to mitigate their toxic consequences (1Hartl F.U.

Protein aggregation is also increased in response to stress conditions such as exposure to high temperatures and oxidants, which result in unfolding of the native structures of proteins (7Nystrom T.

Not surprisingly therefore, enzymes with antioxidant activity, such as peroxiredoxins (Prxs), have been extensively linked with protein aggregation. Work in bacteria has shown that the absence of a peroxiredoxin and the associated higher levels of ROS results in increased protein aggregation suggesting that the Prx normally protects against protein aggregate formation (9Ling J. Cho C. Guo L.T. Aerni H.R. Rinehart J. Soll D. Protein aggregation caused by aminoglycoside action is prevented by a hydrogen peroxide scavenger.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main cytosolic Prx, Tsa1, has been extensively linked with protein aggregation. Loss of Tsa1 results in higher levels of proteins within aggregate fractions, especially ribosomal proteins (10Rand J.D. Grant C.M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 31313-31327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking Tsa1 are also particularly sensitive to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), a proline analogue used to induce protein aggregation, suggesting that Tsa1 is required for tolerance to nascent protein misfolding stress (13Weids A.J. Grant C.M. The yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1 protects against protein-aggregate-induced oxidative stress.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein aggregates induced by protein misfolding form adjacent to mitochondria and result in ROS formation from active mitochondria (13Weids A.J. Grant C.M. The yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1 protects against protein-aggregate-induced oxidative stress.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tsa1 can become hyperoxidized in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure, which triggers its formation into high-molecular-weight structures with chaperone activity (11Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. et al.Two enzymes in one; two yeast peroxiredoxins display oxidative stress-dependent switching from a peroxidase to a molecular chaperone function.Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). More recently, overoxidation of Tsa1 has been found to extend life span by recruiting chaperones to damaged and aggregated proteins formed during aging and in response to hydrogen peroxide stress (14Hanzen S. Vielfort K. Yang J. Roger F. Andersson V. Zamarbide-Fores S. Andersson R. Malm L. Palais G. Biteau B. Liu B. Toledano M.B. Molin M. Nystrom T. Lifespan control by redox-dependent recruitment of chaperones to misfolded proteins.Cell. 2016; 166: 140-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, Tsa1 has multiple potential roles during protein aggregation stress functioning as an antioxidant and chaperone. There is increasing awareness that in addition to causing oxidative stress, ROS play important roles as signaling molecules in the regulation of many biological processes (15Winterbourn C.C. Reconciling the chemistry and biology of reactive oxygen species.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 16Veal E.A. Day A.M. Morgan B.A. Hydrogen peroxide sensing and signaling.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). This regulatory role for ROS is mediated by the oxidation of cysteine thiol groups, which are found in the catalytic or regulatory domains of enzymes. These so-called “thiol switches” can be reversibly oxidized and transiently regulate diverse biological processes such as signal transduction, wound healing, immune function, tumorigenesis, and aging (17Holmstrom K.M. Finkel T. Cellular mechanisms and physiological consequences of redox-dependent signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues react relatively slowly with hydrogen peroxide, but reactivity can be significantly enhanced by their deprotonation, which is dependent on the local protein environment. This means that some redox-regulated proteins are directly oxidized by ROS, although it is now known that most regulatory thiol oxidation is mediated by protein catalysts (18Leichert L.I. Dick T.P. Incidence and physiological relevance of protein thiol switches.Biol. Chem. 2015; 396: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Key to this regulation are thiol peroxidases including the Prx family of enzymes, which act as both hydrogen peroxide sensors and thiol oxidizers (19Rhee S.G. Woo H.A. Kil I.S. Bae S.H. Peroxiredoxin functions as a peroxidase and a regulator and sensor of local peroxides.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4403-4410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 20Perkins A. Nelson K.J. Parsonage D. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Peroxiredoxins: Guardians against oxidative stress and modulators of peroxide signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This generally involves redox relay reactions where an oxidized Prx oxidizes specific thiol residues in target proteins (21Stocker S. Maurer M. Ruppert T. Dick T.P. A role for 2-Cys peroxiredoxins in facilitating cytosolic protein thiol oxidation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Previous studies have implicated Tsa1 in moderating the response to hydrogen peroxide stress via downregulation of the highly conserved cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway (22Bodvard K. Peeters K. Roger F. Romanov N. Igbaria A. Welkenhuysen N. Palais G. Reiter W. Toledano M.B. Kall M. Molin M. Light-sensing via hydrogen peroxide and a peroxiredoxin.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, Tsa1 was shown to suppress PKA activity by oxidizing a conserved Cys residue in the Tpk1 catalytic subunit of PKA (23Roger F. Picazo C. Reiter W. Libiad M. Asami C. Hanzen S. Gao C. Lagniel G. Welkenhuysen N. Labarre J. Nystrom T. Grotli M. Hartl M. Toledano M.B. Molin M. Peroxiredoxin promotes longevity and H2O2-resistance in yeast through redox-modulation of protein kinase A.Elife. 2020; 9e60346Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this current study, we investigated how Tsa1 mediates tolerance to protein misfolding and aggregation stress by studying the transcriptomic alterations that occur in response to AZC exposure. We show that downregulation of the PKA pathway promotes tolerance to nascent protein misfolding stress and the importance of Tsa1 lies in its signalling response to proteotoxic stress. We used a proteomic screen to identify factors that interact with Tsa1 following AZC stress and identified a direct interaction with the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is increased upon protein misfolding stress in a redox-dependent manner. Tsa1-mediated oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens PKA pathway activity leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression that promotes tolerance to protein misfolding and aggregation. The Tsa1-Bcy1 interaction was not affected by the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide and no increase in Bcy1 oxidation was observed in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure. Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA therefore provides a mechanism to mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to the regulation of the catalytic subunit of PKA caused by the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. As Prxs have functions in antioxidant defense, as chaperones, and in redox signaling, it is unclear which activity is required following nascent protein misfolding stress. We therefore used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to examine how tsa1 mutant cells respond at the transcriptional level to an increase in protein misfolding. AZC is competitively incorporated into proteins in place of proline, where it alters the conformation of the polypeptide backbone resulting in decreased thermal stability and nascent protein misfolding and aggregation (24Trotter E.W. Berenfeld L. Krause S.A. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Protein misfolding and temperature up-shift cause G1 arrest via a common mechanism dependent on heat shock factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7313-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In yeast, the transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress is primarily mediated by heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) and the Msn2/4 transcription factors. Hsf1 regulates chaperones and other factors involved in protein folding and misfolding and aggregate clearance that would be required during proteostasis stress (25Solis E.J. Pandey J.P. Zheng X. Jin D.X. Gupta P.B. Airoldi E.M. Pincus D. Denic V. Defining the essential function of yeast Hsf1 reveals a compact transcriptional program for maintaining eukaryotic proteostasis.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 60-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The scope of the Msn2/4 regulon is much broader than the Hsf1 regulon and is commonly referred to as the environmental stress response (ESR) (26Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Genomic expression programs in the response of yeast cells to environmental changes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3616) Google Scholar, 27Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E.J. Ennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Remodeling of yeast genome expression in response to environmental changes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). A previous microarray-based study showed that AZC stress induces the expression of Hsf1 regulated genes, without activating the ESR (28Trotter E.W. Kao C.M. Berenfeld L. Botstein D. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Misfolded proteins are competent to mediate a subset of the responses to heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44817-44825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This study exposed cells to high concentrations of AZC (50 mM) for 5 h and we wanted to examine the response to conditions that we have established cause protein misfolding and aggregation (5 mM AZC for 2 h) without significantly decreasing cell viability (13Weids A.J. Grant C.M. The yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1 protects against protein-aggregate-induced oxidative stress.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of the transcriptome in a wild-type strain revealed that many transcripts are significantly altered by at least twofold following exposure to AZC including 1416 transcripts that are significantly increased and 1408 transcripts that are decreased in abundance compared with an untreated culture (Fig. 1A). This is a much larger response than that observed for higher AZC concentrations, where, for example, 217 transcripts were reported to be induced by greater than threefold (28Trotter E.W. Kao C.M. Berenfeld L. Botstein D. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Misfolded proteins are competent to mediate a subset of the responses to heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44817-44825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) compared with 873 transcripts that showed a similar fold change in response to the lower AZC treatment. To better understand the transcriptional response to AZC stress, we searched for significantly enriched (5% FDR) functional categories within our datasets using the MIPS Functional Catalogue (29Ruepp A. Zollner A. Maier D. Albermann K. Hani J. Mokrejs M. Tetko I. Guldener U. Mannhaupt G. Munsterkotter M. Mewes H.W. The FunCat, a functional annotation scheme for systematic classification of proteins from whole genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5539-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In contrast to the treatment with a higher concentration of AZC (28Trotter E.W. Kao C.M. Berenfeld L. Botstein D. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Misfolded proteins are competent to mediate a subset of the responses to heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44817-44825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that many of the induced genes are expected as part of the ESR (Fig. 1, B and C). This included a number of major categories that are commonly altered during diverse stress conditions including oxidative stress, heat shock, and starvation responses (26Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Genomic expression programs in the response of yeast cells to environmental changes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3616) Google Scholar). AZC stress resulted in the induction of genes affecting numerous protein folding, modification, and degradation factors, which would be required during conditions that promote protein misfolding (Fig. 1B). There was also an induction of genes involved in energy metabolism and alternative carbon source utilization, which might arise due to decreases in cellular ATP concentrations as a consequence of chaperone-dependent protein folding activity (26Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Genomic expression programs in the response of yeast cells to environmental changes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3616) Google Scholar). AZC stress caused the downregulation of gene expression for many genes related to protein synthesis (rRNA synthesis and processing, tRNA synthesis and processing, ribosome biogenesis, translation) presumably reflecting the need to conserve energy and to reduce the likelihood of further aberrant protein formation (30Warner J.R. The economics of ribosome biosynthesis in yeast.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Similarly, other growth-related processes including transcription, nucleotide, amino acid, and other metabolic processes were downregulated in response to AZC stress (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the transcriptional response to AZC stress revealed that the induced genes include known targets of Hsf1 (Fig. 1D), similar to the previous analysis of the transcriptional response to higher AZC concentrations (28Trotter E.W. Kao C.M. Berenfeld L. Botstein D. Petsko G.A. Gray J.V. Misfolded proteins are competent to mediate a subset of the responses to heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44817-44825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to this previous study, however, the induced genes also included targets of the Msn2/4 transcription factors (Fig. 1D). Despite the finding that protein misfolding stress induces ROS formation (13Weids A.J. Grant C.M. The yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1 protects against protein-aggregate-induced oxidative stress.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a less striking activation of Yap1 target genes was observed in response to AZC stress (Fig. 1D). This correlates with the finding that yap1 mutants do not show increased sensitivity to AZC stress (13Weids A.J. Grant C.M. The yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1 protects against protein-aggregate-induced oxidative stress.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a comparison of the response to AZC stress versus heat stress (Fig. S1A) or oxidative stress (Fig. S1B) revealed a modest similarity between AZC and heat stress (R2 = 0.50), whereas the similarity between AZC and oxidative stress was less strong (R2 = 0.33). Many stress conditions inhibit the expression of ribosomal protein and assembly genes (RiBi regulon) through TOR and RAS/PKA-pathway dependent signaling (31Schawalder S.B. Kabani M. Howald I.

Barash Y. Koller D. Friedman N. O'Shea E.K. Sfp1 is a stress- and nutrient-sensitive regulator of ribosomal protein gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14315-14322Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and analysis of 136 ribosomal protein transcripts revealed that they were strongly downregulated (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that AZC stress induces the upregulation of the heat shock response (Hsf1 targets) and the ESR (Msn2/4 targets) and downregulation of ribosomal biosynthesis. We next examined the transcriptional response to AZC in a tsa1 mutant to determine whether Tsa1 is required for the response to protein misfolding stress at the gene expression level. Under nonstress conditions, relatively modest numbers of transcripts are altered in abundance in a tsa1 mutant compared with a wild-type strain (Fig. S2A). This included 170 and 34 transcripts that were up- or downregulated by greater than twofold, respectively. Functional analysis of these transcripts revealed that the upregulated transcripts in a tsa1 mutant were enriched for functions related to energy and stress responses (Fig. S2B). Upregulation of stress response genes, especially those involved in the oxidative stress response, might have been expected in a tsa1 mutant, as Tsa1 is one of the main cellular antioxidants. The expression of many transcripts is altered in the tsa1 mutant in response to AZC stress including 1280 and 1220 transcripts that are increased or decreased, respectively. There was a large overlap in the transcripts identified as altered in the wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, the same functional categories were predominantly affected by AZC stress in the tsa1 mutant strain suggesting that the scope of the transcriptional response to AZC stress is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains (Fig. 1, B and C). We next assessed whether the magnitude of the transcriptional response to protein misfolding stress is similar in the wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains. For this analysis, we compared the fold change in transcript levels in a wild-type with those in the tsa1 mutant following AZC stress. This analysis identified that 505 transcripts were not as upregulated in the tsa1 mutant compared with the wild-type strain and 802 transcripts were not as downregulated. The not as upregulated transcripts included transcripts encoding factors involved in metabolism (carbohydrate metabolism and energy) and stress responses, whereas many factors affecting translation and protein synthesis were not as downregulated in response to AZC stress in the tsa1 mutant (Fig. 2A). In silico analysis searching for transcription factor binding motifs showed a strong enrichment for binding sites for Msn2/4 in the not as upregulated genes. In agreement with this finding, direct comparison of the fold change in transcript levels in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains confirmed that Msn2/4 targets were not as upregulated in response to AZC in a tsa1 mutant compared with a wild-type strain (Fig. 2B). In contrast, similar upregulation of the Hsf1 and Yap1 regulons was observed in both strains following AZC exposure (Fig. 2B). Additionally, transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins were not as downregulated in response to AZC stress in a tsa1 mutant compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 2B). We further confirmed the role of Msn2/4 in the response to protein misfolding and aggregation stress as a mutant lacking these transcription factors showed sensitivity to AZC stress, comparable to the sensitivity of a tsa1 mutant strain (Fig. 2C). The msn2 msn4 mutant was also sensitive to heat and oxidative stresses as would be expected. We questioned how Tsa1 might influence Msn2/4 activity and ribosomal protein biogenesis and hypothesized that it could do so by directly interacting with factors that affect their regulatory pathways. Previous studies have used a resolving cysteine mutant (Tsa1-Cys171S) to stabilize transient disulfide interactions with the Yap1 transcription factor (35Tachibana T. Okazaki S. Murayama A. Naganuma A. Nomoto A. Kuge S.

Additionally, the resolving cysteine mutant has been used to identify five potential Tsa1 targets under nonstress conditions (Pyk1, Vde1, Ssb1/Ssb2, Yol057w, Frd1) (36Irokawa H. Tachibana T.

However, dysfunctionality in bone healing and repair often arises in the context of aging-related chronic disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is unmet need for effective pharmacological modulators of osteogenic differentiation and an opportunity to probe the complex links between bone biology and cognitive disorders. We previously discovered the small molecule DIPQUO, which promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization in mouse and human cell culture models, and in zebrafish developmental and regenerative models. Here, we examined the detailed function of this molecule. First, we used kinase profiling, cellular thermal shift assays, and functional studies to identify glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) inhibition as a mechanism of DIPQUO action. Treatment of mouse C2C12 myoblasts with DIPQUO promoted alkaline phosphatase expression and activity, which could be enhanced synergistically by treatment with other GSK3-β inhibitors. Suppression of the expression or function of GSK3-β attenuated DIPQUO-dependent osteogenic differentiation. In addition, DIPQUO synergized with GSK3-β inhibitors to stimulate expression of osteoblast genes in human multipotent progenitors. Accordingly, DIPQUO promoted accumulation and activation of β-catenin. Moreover, DIPQUO suppressed activation of tau microtubule-associated protein, an AD-related effector of GSK3-β signaling. Therefore, DIPQUO has potential as both a lead candidate for bone therapeutic development and a pharmacological modulator of GSK3-β signaling in cell culture and animal models of disorders including AD.

Although bone fracture is among the most common tissue injuries requiring emergent care, human bone can recover integrity through scarless regeneration. Unfortunately, osteoporosis and impaired fracture healing are part of a panoply of aging-related maladies that impede the seamless regeneration of new bone with structural and biomechanical integrity. These in turn are prominent comorbidities associated with chronic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1Roos P.M. Osteoporosis in neurodegeneration.J. Trace Elem. Med.

There is therefore an unmet need for scalable and effective therapies that stimulate osteogenic recovery, regeneration, and differentiation. We recently discovered the osteogenic small molecule DIPQUO in a high-throughput chemical screen for novel activators of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker for differentiation from mesenchyme progenitors toward the bone (5Cook B.

DIPQUO additionally promotes matrix mineralization of differentiating human mesenchymal cells, ossification of larval zebrafish vertebrae, and osteoblastogenic regenerative processes in recovering adult zebrafish blastema. These properties together mark DIPQUO as a strong lead candidate bone anabolic compound.

In addition, canonical Wnt signaling through glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) plays important developmental and maintenance roles in osteogenic differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues (17Houschyar K.S.

In our previous study, the timing of p38 MAPK activation peaked between 2 and 4 h after DIPQUO treatment of myoblast cells, subsequently declining quickly back to baseline levels. This observation, combined with persistent changes in cell morphology and sustained activation of osteogenic programs, suggests additional relevant direct and/or indirect effector pathways impacted by DIPQUO treatment. In addition, structure–activity relationship studies indicated that observed osteogenic differentiation was dependent upon its unique structure and that modification of structural moieties attenuated its activity, precluding an affinity-based approach to target identification. Therefore, we hypothesized that DIPQUO would impact a biochemical effector pathway upstream of p38 with therapeutic relevance in the bone, thus substantiating continued development of DIPQUO as a lead candidate bone therapeutic, and as a platform to combine the study of bone disorders and aging-related comorbidities. In the present study, we sought to identify kinases modulated by DIPQUO in a strategy to find molecular therapeutic effectors to pursue in future lead optimization studies. Through kinase profiling, biochemical and functional studies, we have identified GSK3-β signaling as an effector of DIPQUO pro-osteogenic activity. To identify direct or indirect biochemical effectors of DIPQUO, we initiated a series of in vitro kinase assays, in which a panel of 60 kinases was selected based on published evidence of activity in osteogenesis and adipogenesis and tested for activation or inhibition by 10 μM DIPQUO. These tests were performed in duplicate, and only GSK3-β displayed 100% inhibition in both replicate assays (Fig. 1A). For clarity, only kinases that displayed positive values (inhibition) are displayed in Figure 1A, with a 70% inhibition threshold marked (dotted red line) above which they were tested for further validation with specific inhibitors. In addition to GSK3-β, the following kinases were found to be inhibited >70% by DIPQUO: AMP-activated protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 and CDK5, checkpoint kinase-1 and checkpoint kinase-2 (CHK1/2), serine/threonine kinase D2, serine/threonine protein kinase-4, -3, and -24/mammalian sterile twenty-like-1 -2 and 3 (MST1/2/3), and leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2; Fig. 1A). Subsequent experiments validated GSK3-β as a biochemical effector of DIPQUO. First, the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) (18Martinez Molina D. Jafari R. Ignatushchenko M. Seki T. Larsson E.A.

Toxicol. 2016; 56: 141-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used to measure the conformational stability imparted to GSK3-β by DIPQUO compared with an inactive chemical analog (BT344) (5Cook B. Rafiq R. Lee H. Banks K.M. El-Debs M. Chiaravalli J. Glickman J.F. Das B.C. Chen S. Evans T.

In principle, the binding of a compound to its cognate protein target increases the enthalpy required for its unfolding and denaturation, observable as an upward shift in the melting temperature (Tm), measured as the temperature at which 50 percent of measured protein remains in the solution. In practice, application of a CETSA temperature gradient results in additional stabilization of target-dependent protein–protein interactions and multiprotein complexes, such that an observed stabilization can identify a given protein as either a direct target or as a member of a functional protein complex. The dynamics of protein stabilization are dependent on the kinetics of compound–target engagement and are thus transitory, with stabilization preceding inhibition, depletion, or activation of targets and dissolution of relevant complexes. Through the CETSA, the associated chronology can be empirically determined. As shown in Figure 1B, the Tm for GSK3-β in DIPQUO-treated samples was measured to be 54.9 °C, compared with a Tm of 53.1 °C for analog-treated samples, with a statistically significant difference between respective protein levels bracketing those temperatures. Stabilization of GSK3-β occurred after 1 h of DIPQUO treatment, whereas in our published studies, p38 MAPK activation was maximal at later time points, between 2 and 4 h of treatment. Previous studies identified a role for GSK3-β in the control of ALP expression and activity (20Yamauchi K. Kurosaka A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 enhances the expression of alkaline phosphatase and insulin-like growth factor-1 in human primary dermal papilla cell culture and maintains mouse hair bulbs in organ culture.Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2009; 301: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with the common Wnt signaling activator CHIR99021 (CHIR) known to promote ALP activity in embryonic stem cells (21Ye S. Tan L. Yang R. Fang B. Qu S. Schulze E.N. Song H. Ying Q. Li P. Pleiotropy of glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibition by CHIR99021 promotes self-renewal of embryonic stem cells from refractory mouse strains.PLoS One. 2012; 7e35892Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and this activity for CHIR was confirmed in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1C). In a similar manner to CHIR, C2C12 cells were treated with the direct AstraZeneca GSK3-β-specific inhibitor AZD2858 (AZD) (22Marsell R. Sisask G. Nilsson Y. Sundgren-Andersson A.K. Andersson U. Larsson S. Nilsson O. Ljunggren O. Jonsson K.B. GSK-3 inhibition by an orally active small molecule increases bone mass in rats.Bone. 2012; 50: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and found to stimulate expression of ALP (bright purple foci; Fig. 1C). Although the reported in vitro IC50 for CHIR and AZD are 6.7 and 68 nM, respectively, treatments were titrated (not shown) to determine the dose at which positive staining would consistently be observed (10 μM for CHIR and 1 μM for AZD). Analogously, the time point of 3 days was determined to be optimal to resolve ALP staining and activity for samples treated with DIPQUO and commercial GSK3-β inhibitors (also not shown). Colorimetric ALP activity assays showed that both CHIR and AZD promoted significant ALP activity to levels comparable with DIPQUO-induced stimulation (Fig. 1D). Among the kinases identified in the profiling screen as > 70% inhibited, only GSK3-β was confirmed via functional assays using ALP expression as a readout. In these staining assays, expression of ALP is denoted by bright purple hematoxylin-positive foci (Fig. S1). Equivalent high-dosage treatment of C2C12 cells with commercially available inhibitors to all other candidate kinases failed to yield detectable ALP staining (Fig. 2A). Qualitative presence of ALP-positive hematoxylin-stained foci correlates to quantitative increase in ALP activity via colorimetric measurement of substrate digestion, as shown in Figs. 1C and 3, A–C (see below), whereas the absence of stained foci signifies lack of activity. Therefore, in experiments for which there was no ALP-positive staining in any sample, those negative samples were not subjected to quantification of activity (all of Fig. 2). For analysis of other kinase pathways, cells were treated with dorsomorphin (AMP-activated protein kinase and activin receptor-like kinase-2/3/6 inhibitor, 5 μM); PV1019 (Chk1/2 inhibitor, 10 μM); CHK2inhII (Chk2 inhibitor, 10 μM); RO-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor, 10 μM); roscovitine (CDK1/2/5 inhibitor, 10 μM); CRT006 (PKD1/2/3 inhibitor, 5 μM); XMU-MP-1 (mammalian sterile twenty-like 1/2 inhibitor, 5 μM); bosutinib (BCR-ABL and mammalian sterile twenty-like 3 inhibitor, 5 μM); and LRRK2-IN-1 or GSK2578215A (LRRK2 inhibitors, 10 μM). For all kinase inhibitors, treatments were titrated to empirically determine the highest dose resulting in the least cell depletion. In all cases, neither lowest- nor highest-dose treatment resulted in positive ALP staining (not shown). In addition, cotreatment with all possible combinations to simultaneously inhibit two kinases ruled out synergistic effects between any of these biochemical pathways to promote detectable ALP expression (Fig. 2B).Figure 3DIPQUO can synergize with other known GSK3-β inhibitors to promote osteogenic differentiation. C2C12 cells were treated for 3 days with (A) subthreshold (5 μM) DIPQUO, (5 μM) CHIR, or a combination thereof or (B) subthreshold DIPQUO, (500 nM) AZD, or a combination thereof and analyzed by staining for ALP expression and by colorimetric substrate assay for ALP activity. C, ALP expression and activation normally promoted by the full dose of DIPQUO was attenuated by cotreating C2C12 cells with 10 μM XAV-939. The scale bar in panels A–C represents 200 μm.

D, differentiating human skeletal muscle satellite cells were cotreated for 3 days with low-dose DIPQUO and CHIR (5 μM each) and then analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR for expression of transcripts associated with osteoblast specification, compared with treatment alone. Relative expression levels compared with DMSO-treated samples and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase are reported as the means ± SD; ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 in unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.

E, synergistic activation of p38 MAPK was analyzed by Western blotting after 2.5 h treatment with subthreshold concentrations of AZD (100 nM) and DIPQUO (2.5 μM), compared with cotreatment using the same concentrations. Relative phospho-p38 MAPK levels are reported as the means ± SD; ∗p < 0.05. Ordinary one-way ANOVA yielded F = 3.521 and p = 0.0686. F, C2C12 cells were either mock-transfected or transfected for 24 h with hemagglutinin-tagged GSK3-β containing a serine-to-alanine mutation (S9A), treated with DIPQUO or DMSO vehicle, and analyzed by Western blotting for construct expression. G, equivalent samples were analyzed for ALP activity using colorimetric assay for pNPP substrate after 3 days. Activity levels are normalized to the total protein and reported as the mean ± SD; ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01 in unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.

When subthreshold concentrations of the small-molecule GSK3-β inhibitors CHIR (5 μM) or AZD (500 nM) were used to treat C2C12 cells for 3 days, cell staining and activity assays failed to yield detectable ALP staining or enzymatic activity using the added p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) substrate (Fig. 3, A and B). These concentrations were determined empirically for the purposes of this study (data not shown) and are well above published EC50 values for both inhibitors, suggesting that stimulation of ALP by either molecule is secondary to its primary target. Similarly, treatment of C2C12 cells with 5 μM DIPQUO failed to yield ALP staining or significant activity (Fig. 3, A and B). However, combination of subthreshold doses of DIPQUO with CHIR (Fig. 3A) or DIPQUO with AZD (Fig. 3B) resulted in robust ALP staining and significantly increased (>10-fold) ALP activity. Because combining the subthreshold levels of individual compounds recapitulates activity found using super-threshold levels of either compound, this is good evidence that they act on the same pathway. Accordingly, attenuation of Wnt signaling with the small-molecule tankyrase inhibitor XAV-939, which effectively acts to protect GSK3-β activity, blocked the promotion of ALP expression and activity with the full effective 10 μM dose of DIPQUO (Fig. 3C). Analogous to murine C2C12 cells, human skeletal muscle satellite cells (hSkMSCs) are mesenchymal progenitors that retain potential to differentiate toward myogenic, adipogenic, or osteogenic lineages in a manner dependent on culture conditions (23Wada M.R.

Osteogenic differentiation capacity of human skeletal muscle-derived progenitor cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8e56641Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, they serve as a supporting model to re-evaluate and confirm the ability of DIPQUO to synergize with GSK3-β inhibition in human and murine cells, promoting osteogenic differentiation. In hSkMSC cultures, cotreatment for 3 days with subthreshold doses of DIPQUO and CHIR resulted in significantly increased expression of osteoblast marker genes, including DLX5, OSTERIX, OSTEOPONTIN, and GPNMB (OSTEOACTIVIN; Fig. 3D). To measure synergistic effects of DIPQUO with established GSK3-β inhibitors on a biochemical pathway indicative of osteogenic differentiation, C2C12 cells were cotreated with subthreshold doses of DIPQUO and AZD and then probed for activation of p38 MAPK, which we previously showed is required for DIPQUO-induced differentiation, and is a known conserved pathway in skeletal differentiation and patterning (5Cook B. Rafiq R. Lee H. Banks K.M. El-Debs M. Chiaravalli J. Glickman J.F. Das B.C. Chen S. Evans T.

Gygi S. et al.The p38 MAPK pathway is essential for skeletogenesis and bone homeostasis in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2457-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis showed that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is significantly increased only in response to the combinatorial application of low-dose DIPQUO and AZD (Fig. 3E). Therefore, several biological readouts, encompassing (1) expression and activity of the osteogenic enzyme ALP in murine cells; (2) transcriptional activation of osteoblast markers in human progenitors; and (3) activation of MAPK signaling through p38 indicate that combinatorial GSK3-β inhibition using DIPQUO and other commercially available inhibitors stimulates osteogenic programs in both mouse and human cell culture models. Accordingly, osteogenic outcomes are dependent on proper biological function of GSK3-β signaling. When C2C12 cells were transfected with a constitutively active GSK3-β construct containing a serine-to-alanine mutation (S9A; Fig. 3F) to compete with endogenous GSK3-β, DIPQUO induction of ALP activation was significantly suppressed (Fig. 3G). Signaling through the canonical Wnt pathway leads to deactivation and sequestration of normally constitutively active GSK3-β away from interacting partners including axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (25Nusse R. Clevers H. Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling, disease, and emerging therapeutic modalities.Cell. 2017; 169: 985-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). As a result, β-catenin is dephosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it triggers transcriptional activation of target genes that can promote cell proliferation and differentiation in many developmental contexts, including osteogenesis (26Duan P. Bonewald L.F. The role of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in formation and maintenance of bone and teeth.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2016; 77: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further validate DIPQUO as an inhibitor of GSK3-β biochemical activity, we investigated β-catenin expression and activation of transcriptional targets. In Western blotting analyses of DIPQUO-treated C2C12 cells, total β-catenin accumulated over time, increasing approximately 3-fold by 24 h of treatment compared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated samples (Fig. 4A). Accumulation of β-catenin was additionally dose dependent, with a maximum observed at the 10-μM concentration used throughout this study as a baseline for promoting osteogenic differentiation (Fig. 4B). Although there was a consistent upward dose-dependent trend, significant accumulation first occurred at the 7.5 μM dose, in a similar range as the original calculated EC50 of 6.28 μM. To measure β-catenin activity, a lentivirus containing a T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcriptional response element-conjugated GFP luciferase reporter was used to infect 293T cells (Fig. 4C). Cells treated for 24 h with 10 μM DIPQUO or CHIR were normalized to DMSO-treated controls for luminescence and were found to display significantly increased luciferase activity. DIPQUO treatment additionally showed an upward trend compared with CHIR-positive controls, with activity approximately 7.5-fold greater than DMSO-negative controls (Fig. 4C).

https://openalex.org/W3153401694,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most widely used therapeutic proteins; however, only two subtypes within the seven serotypes, BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1, are currently used for medical and cosmetic applications. Distinct catalytic properties, substrate specificities, and duration of enzymatic activities potentially make other subtypes very attractive candidates to outperform conventional BoNTs in particular therapeutic applications. For example, BoNT/A3 has a significantly shorter duration of action than other BoNT/A subtypes. Notably, BoNT/A3 is the subtype with the least conserved catalytic domain among BoNT/A subtypes. This suggests that the sequence differences, many of which concern the α-exosite, contribute to the observed functional differences in toxin persistence by affecting the binding of the substrate SNAP-25 and/or the stability of the catalytic domain fold. To identify the molecular determinants accounting for the differences in the persistence observed for BoNT/A subtypes, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of BoNT/A3 (LC/A3). The structure of LC/A3 was found to be very similar to that of LC/A1, suggesting that the overall mode of SNAP-25 binding is common between these two proteins. However, circular dichroism (CD) thermal unfolding experiments demonstrated that LC/A3 is significantly less stable than LC/A1, implying that this might contribute to the reduced toxin persistence of BoNT/A3. These findings could be of interest in developing next-generation therapeutic toxins."

Rsu-1 interacts with zinc-finger type multi-LIM domain-containing adaptor protein PINCH-1, known to be involved in the integrin-mediated consensus adhesome, but not with its highly homologous family member PINCH-2. However, the structural basis for and regulatory mechanisms of this specific interaction remain unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Rsu-1 and its complex with the PINCH-1 LIM4-5 domains. Rsu-1 displays an arc-shaped solenoid architecture, with eight LRRs shielded by N- and C-terminal capping modules. We showed that the conserved concave surface of the Rsu-1 LRR domain binds and stabilizes the PINCH-1 LIM5 domain via salt bridge and hydrophobic interactions, while the C-terminal non-LIM region of PINCH-2 sterically disfavors Rsu-1 binding. We also showed that Rsu-1 can be assembled, via PINCH-1-binding, into a heteropentamer complex comprising Rsu-1, PINCH-1, ILK, Parvin, and Kindlin-2, which constitute a major consensus integrin adhesome crucial for focal adhesion assembly. Our mutagenesis and cell biological data emphasize the significance of the Rsu-1/PINCH-1 interaction in focal adhesion assembly and cell spreading, providing crucial molecular insights into Rsu-1-mediated cell adhesion with implications for disease development."

M . tuberculosis isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR). We characterized clusters by age, sex, origin and region of living which included both foreign-born cases and those born in Finland. During 2014–2017, 1015 TB cases were notified; 814 were confirmed by culture. The proportion of foreign-born cases increased from 33.3% to 39.0%. Foreign-born TB cases were younger (median age, 28 vs. 75 years), and had extrapulmonary TB or multidrug-TB more often than Finnish-born cases (P&lt;0.01 for all comparisons). Foreign-born cases were born in 60 different countries; most commonly in Somalia (25.5%). Altogether 795 isolates were genotyped; 31.2% belonged to 80 different clusters (range, 2–13 cases/cluster). Fourteen (17.5%) clusters included isolates from both Finnish-born and foreign-born cases. An epidemiological link between cases was identified by (epidemiological) background information in two clusters. Although the proportion of foreign-born TB cases was considerable, our data suggests that transmission of TB between foreign and Finnish born population is uncommon."
https://openalex.org/W3155929771,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an established animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Inflammatory CD4 + T cell responses directed against CNS antigens, including myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), are key mediators of EAE. Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for the induction of T cell responses against infectious agents. However, the importance of DCs in priming self-reactive CD4 + T cells in autoimmune disease such as MS has been unclear. To determine the requirement of DCs in PLP-specific CD4 + T cell responses and EAE, we genetically deleted CD11c + DCs in PLP T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic SJL mice constitutively. DC deficiency did not impair the development, selection or the pathogenic function of PLP-specific CD4 + T cells in these mice, and resulted in accelerated spontaneous EAE compared to DC sufficient controls. In addition, using a genetic approach to ablate DCs conditionally in SJL mice, we show that CD11c + DCs were dispensable for presenting exogenous or endogenous myelin antigen to PLP-specific T cells and for promoting pro-inflammatory T cell responses and severe EAE. Our findings demonstrate that constitutive or conditional ablation of CD11c + DCs diminished self-tolerance to PLP autoantigen. They further show that in the absence of DCs, non-DCs can efficiently present CNS myelin antigens such as PLP to self-reactive T cells, resulting in accelerated onset of spontaneous or induced EAE."
https://openalex.org/W3156933171,"Glutamate transporters are essential for removing the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Glutamate transport across the membrane is associated with elevator-like structural changes of the transport domain. These structural changes require initial binding of the organic substrate to the transporter. Studying the binding pathway of ligands to their protein binding sites using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires micro-second level simulation times. Here, we used three methods to accelerate aspartate binding to the glutamate transporter homologue Glt ph and to investigate the binding pathway. 1) Two methods using user-defined forces to prevent the substrate from diffusing too far from the binding site. 2) Conventional MD simulations using very high substrate concentrations in the 0.1 M range. The final, substrate bound states from these methods are comparable to the binding pose observed in crystallographic studies, although they show more flexibility in the side chain carboxylate function. We also captured an intermediate on the binding pathway, where conserved residues D390 and D394 stabilize the aspartate molecule. Finally, we investigated glutamate binding to the mammalian glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), for which a crystal structure is known, but not in the glutamate-bound state. Overall, the results obtained in this study reveal new insights into the pathway of substrate binding to glutamate transporters, highlighting intermediates on the binding pathway and flexible conformational states of the side chain, which most likely become locked in once the hairpin loop 2 closes to occlude the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W3154750094,"Protein phosphorylation is regulated by the activity of enzymes generically known as kinases. One of those kinases is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK), which operate through a phosphorylation cascade conformed by members from three related protein kinase families namely MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK), MAPK kinase (MEK), and MAPK; these three acts hierarchically. Establishing the evolution of these proteins in the plant kingdom is an interesting but complicated task because the current MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK subfamilies arose from duplications and subsequent sub-functionalization during the early stage of the emergence of Viridiplantae. Here, an in silico genomic analysis was performed on 18 different plant species, which resulted in the identification of 96 genes not previously annotated as components of the MAPK (70) and MEK (26) families. Interestingly, a deeper analysis of the sequences encoded by such genes revealed the existence of putative domains not previously described as signatures of MAPK and MEK kinases. Additionally, our analysis also suggests the presence of conserved activation motifs besides the canonical TEY and TDY domains, which characterize the MAPK family."
https://openalex.org/W3155456040,"Introduction Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common during pregnancy and can result in adverse delivery and birth outcomes. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of STIs; Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among pregnant women visiting an antenatal care center in Nepal. Materials and methods We adapted and piloted the WHO standard protocol for conducting a prevalence survey of STIs among pregnant women visiting antenatal care center of Dhulikhel Hospital, Nepal. Patient recruitment, data collection, and specimen testing took place between November 2019-March 2020. First catch urine sample was collected from each eligible woman. GeneXpert platform was used for CT and NG testing. Wet-mount microscopy of urine sample was used for detection of trichomoniasis. Serological test for HIV was done by rapid and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Serological test for syphilis was done using “nonspecific non-treponemal” and “specific treponemal” antibody tests. Tests for CT, NG and trichomoniasis were done as part of the prevalence study while tests for syphilis and HIV were done as part of the routine antenatal testing. Results 672 women were approached to participate in the study, out of which 591 (87.9%) met the eligibility criteria and consented to participate. The overall prevalence of any STIs was 8.6% (51/591, 95% CI: 6.3–10.8); 1.5% (95% CI: 0.5–2.5) for CT and 7.1% (95% CI: 5.0–9.2) for trichomoniasis infection. None of the samples tested positive for NG, HIV or syphilis. Prevalence of any STI was not significantly different among women, age ≤ 24 years (10%, 25/229) compared to women age ≥ 25 years (7.1%, 26/362) (p = 0.08). Conclusions The prevalence of trichomoniasis among pregnant women in this sub-urban population of Nepal was high compared to few cases of CT and no cases of NG, syphilis, and HIV. The WHO standard protocol provided a valuable framework for conducting STI surveillance that can be adapted for other countries and populations."
https://openalex.org/W3093257119,"With the growing utility of today's conversational virtual assistants, the importance of user motivation in human-AI interaction is becoming more obvious. However, previous studies in this and related fields, such as human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction, scarcely discussed intrinsic motivation and its affecting factors. Those studies either treated motivation as an inseparable concept or focused on non-intrinsic motivation. The current study aims to cover intrinsic motivation by taking an affective-engineering approach. A novel motivation model is proposed, in which intrinsic motivation is affected by two factors that derive from user interactions with virtual assistants: expectation of capability and uncertainty. Experiments are conducted where these two factors are manipulated by making participants believe they are interacting with the smart speaker ""Amazon Echo"". Intrinsic motivation is measured both by using questionnaires and by covertly monitoring a five-minute free-choice period in the experimenter's absence, during which the participants could decide for themselves whether to interact with the virtual assistants. Results of the first experiment showed that high expectation engenders more intrinsically motivated interaction compared with low expectation. The results also suggested suppressive effects by uncertainty on intrinsic motivation, though we had not hypothesized before experiments. We then revised our hypothetical model of action selection accordingly and conducted a verification experiment of uncertainty's effects. Results of the verification experiment showed that reducing uncertainty encourages more interactions and causes the motivation behind these interactions to shift from non-intrinsic to intrinsic."

https://openalex.org/W3152957108,"ADP-ribosylation is a reversible and site-specific post-translational modification that regulates a wide array of cellular signaling pathways. Regulation of ADP-ribosylation is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, and uncontrolled accumulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation triggers a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)–dependent release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria, leading to cell death. ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolase 3 (ARH3) cleaves PAR and mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation at serine following DNA damage. ARH3 is also a metalloenzyme with strong metal selectivity. While coordination of two magnesium ions (MgA and MgB) significantly enhances its catalytic efficiency, calcium binding suppresses its function. However, how the coordination of different metal ions affects its catalysis has not been defined. Here, we report a new crystal structure of ARH3 complexed with its product ADP-ribose and calcium. This structure shows that calcium coordination significantly distorts the binuclear metal center of ARH3, which results in decreased binding affinity to ADP-ribose, and suboptimal substrate alignment, leading to impaired hydrolysis of PAR and mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated serines. Furthermore, combined structural and mutational analysis of the metal-coordinating acidic residues revealed that MgA is crucial for optimal substrate positioning for catalysis, whereas MgB plays a key role in substrate binding. Our collective data provide novel insights into the different roles of these metal ions and the basis of metal selectivity of ARH3 and contribute to understanding the dynamic regulation of cellular ADP-ribosylations during the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W3154258326,"Although many researchers and policy makers have argued that social mixing could contribute to sustainable communities, most people still prefer to live in a homogeneous rather than a diverse community. Considering the large gap between the political need for social mixing and people’s preference, it is essential to understand residents’ perceptions and preferences regarding socially-mixed neighborhoods in order to promote sustainable community development. This study explorers residents’ willingness to accept living in mixed-income communities in Korea, with attention to various levels of income mix. This study conducted an online survey of 2,000 respondents living in seven metropolitan cities in Korea, including Seoul. The study aimed to investigate residents’ comfortability and willingness to move into different mixed-income communities. The results showed that residents with higher openness to diversity are more likely to accept mixed-income communities, but frequent interaction with low-income people reduces higher-income people’s willingness to accept mixed-income communities. As both personal attitudes and experience are important determinants of individuals’ social mix preference, a more systematic community development strategy is required to achieve successful social mixing."
https://openalex.org/W3155894275,"Using a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors, natural killer (NK) cells protect against disease by eliminating cells that have downregulated class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, such as in response to cell transformation or viral infection. The inhibitory murine NK receptor Ly49C specifically recognizes the class I MHC protein H-2Kb. Unusual among NK receptors, Ly49C exhibits a peptide-dependent sensitivity to H-2Kb recognition, which has not been explained despite detailed structural studies. To gain further insight into Ly49C peptide sensitivity, we examined Ly49C recognition biochemically and through the lens of dynamic allostery. We found that the peptide sensitivity of Ly49C arises through small differences in H-2Kb-binding affinity. Although molecular dynamics simulations supported a role for peptide-dependent protein dynamics in producing these differences in binding affinity, calorimetric measurements indicated an enthalpically as opposed to entropically driven process. A quantitative linkage analysis showed that this emerges from peptide-dependent dynamic tuning of electrostatic interactions across the Ly49C–H-2Kb interface. We propose a model whereby different peptides alter the flexibility of H-2Kb, which in turn changes the strength of electrostatic interactions across the protein–protein interface. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of how peptides alter Ly49C-binding affinity, suggest the underlying mechanism, and demonstrate peptide-driven allostery at work in class I MHC proteins. Lastly, our model provides a solution for how dynamic allostery could impact binding of some, but not all, class I MHC partners depending on the structural and chemical composition of the interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W3159042227,"Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)-1 functions as a feedback modulator for calcineurin-nuclear factor for activated T cell (NFAT) signals, which are crucial for cell proliferation and inflammation. Stable expression of DSCR-1 inhibits pathological angiogenesis and septic inflammation. DSCR-1 also plays a critical role in vascular wall remodeling associated with aneurysm development that occurs primarily in smooth muscle cells. Besides, Dscr-1 deficiency promotes the M1-to M2-like phenotypic switch in macrophages, which correlates to the reduction of denatured cholesterol uptakes. However, the distinct roles of DSCR-1 in cholesterol and lipid metabolism are not well understood. Here, we show that loss of apolipoprotein (Apo) E in mice with chronic hypercholesterolemia induced Dscr-1 expression in the liver and aortic atheroma. In Dscr-1-null mice fed a high-fat diet, oxidative- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was induced, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2 production in hepatocytes was stimulated. This exaggerated ApoE−/−-mediated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subsequent hypercholesterolemia. Genome-wide screening revealed that loss of both ApoE and Dscr-1 resulted in the induction of immune- and leukocyte activation-related genes in the liver compared with ApoE deficiency alone. However, expressions of inflammation-activated markers and levels of monocyte adhesion were suspended upon induction of the Dscr-1 null background in the aortic endothelium. Collectively, our study shows that the combined loss of Dscr-1 and ApoE causes metabolic dysfunction in the liver but reduces atherosclerotic plaques, thereby leading to a dramatic increase in serum cholesterol and the formation of sporadic vasculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3153044985,"In contrast to AAV, Simian Virus 40 (rSV40) not inducing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) allowing re-treatment seems a promising vector for neonatal treatment of inherited liver disorders. Several studies have reported efficacy of rSV40 in animal models for inherited liver diseases. In all studies the ubiquitous endogenous early promoter controlled transgene expression establishing expression in all transduced tissues. Restricting this expression to the target tissues reduces the risk of immune response to the therapeutic gene. In this study a liver specific rSV40 vector was generated by inserting a hepatocyte specific promoter. This increased the specificity of the expression of hUGT1A1 in vitro . However, in vivo the efficacy of rSV40 appeared too low to demonstrate tissue specificity while increasing the vector dose was not possible because of toxicity. In contrast to earlier studies, neutralizing antibodies were induced. Overall, the lack of a platform to produce high titered and pure rSV40 particles and the induction of NAbs, renders it a poor candidate for in vivo gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3155725207,"Methylofuran (MYFR) is a formyl-carrying coenzyme essential for the oxidation of formaldehyde in most methylotrophic bacteria. In Methylorubrum extorquens, MYFR contains a large and branched polyglutamate side chain of up to 24 glutamates. These glutamates play an essential role in interfacing the coenzyme with the formyltransferase/hydrolase complex, an enzyme that generates formate. To date, MYFR has not been identified in other methylotrophs, and it is unknown whether its structural features are conserved. Here, we examined nine bacterial strains for the presence and structure of MYFR using high-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Two of the strains produced MYFR as present in M. extorquens, while a modified MYFR containing tyramine instead of tyrosine in its core structure was detected in six strains. When M. extorquens was grown in the presence of tyramine, the compound was readily incorporated into MYFR, indicating that the biosynthetic enzymes are unable to discriminate tyrosine from tyramine. Using gene deletions in combination with LC-MS analyses, we identified three genes, orf5, orfY, and orf17 that are essential for MYFR biosynthesis. Notably, the orfY and orf5 mutants accumulated short MYFR intermediates with only one and two glutamates, respectively, suggesting that these enzymes catalyze glutamate addition. Upon homologous overexpression of orf5, a drastic increase in the number of glutamates in MYFR was observed (up to 40 glutamates), further corroborating the function of Orf5 as a glutamate ligase. We thus renamed OrfY and Orf5 to MyfA and MyfB to highlight that these enzymes are specifically involved in MYFR biosynthesis.

Structure of methanofuran, the carbon dioxide reduction factor of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3636-3640Crossref Google Scholar), with which it shares a similar core structure. In the model methylotroph Methylorubrum extorquens, the core structure of MYFR differs from MFR only in the presence of a tyrosine moiety in place of the tyramine residue (6Hemmann J.L. Saurel O.

In the case of MYFR from M. extorquens, this polyglutamate chain contains up to 24 glutamate residues, which are both α- and γ-linked and form a branched chain (6Hemmann J.L. Saurel O. Ochsner A.M.

The different types of MFR are distinguished by the composition of the side chain, i.e., the number of glutamate residues and the presence of linkers (as in MFR-e) or terminal residues (as in MFR-a/c). At present, MYFR has only been identified in M. extorquens, and it is currently unknown if a similar structural diversity exists within bacteria. The unique structure of the polyglutamate side chain of MYFR also raises the question of its biosynthesis. In archaea, six enzymes (MfnA–F) have been identified that catalyze the biosynthetic steps required to form the MFR core structure linked to the first γ-glutamate (16Kezmarsky N.D. Xu H. Graham D.E.

However, the enzymes responsible for the ligation of additional glutamates (all MFRs contain at least two γ-glutamates) as well as the enzymes that introduce the linker or terminal moieties into the side chain of MFR remain to be identified. In M. extorquens and other proteobacteria, the proteins Orf22, Orf21, and Orf9 are homologs of the archaeal enzymes MfnB, MfnE, and MfnF respectively.

Analogous to MFR, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the polyglutamate side chain of MYFR have not yet been identified. However, several of the genes in the “archaeal-like” cluster in M. extorquens have an unknown function and could therefore play a role in MYFR biosynthesis. Notably, all genes in the cluster are essential for growth on methanol (5Chistoserdova L. Vorholt J.A. Thauer R.K. Lidstrom M.E.

However, prior genetic analysis was complicated by the emergence of secondary mutations and not all mutants could be complemented (21Chistoserdova L. Rasche M.E. Lidstrom M.E.

Here, we first assessed the structural diversity of MYFR by analyzing different proteobacterial strains by LC-MS to determine whether the structure of MYFR—and consequently its biosynthesis—is likely conserved. We then analyzed mutants of genes from the “archaeal-like” cluster for their ability to biosynthesize MYFR and identified three genes essential for MYFR biosynthesis. Our data suggest that two of these genes, orfY and orf5, are involved in the elongation of the polyglutamate side chain of MYFR. We thus renamed these genes to myfA and myfB, respectively, and will use these names throughout the text. To determine the structural diversity of MYFR, we selected several methylotrophic strains (Table S1, Fig. S1). The nine strains covered a diversity of classes within the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 1B) and included a methylotrophic strain from the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiome (At-LSPHERE) (22Bai Y.

After cultivation of the strains, MYFR was enriched from cell extracts using anion-exchange solid-phase extraction, assuming that MYFR in these strains would be negatively charged as in M. extorquens (6Hemmann J.L. Saurel O. Ochsner A.M. Stodden B.K. Kiefer P. Milon A. Vorholt J.A. The one-carbon carrier methylofuran from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 contains a large number of α- and γ-linked glutamic acid residues.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9042-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using LC-MS, we were able to detect MYFR, as it is present in M. extorquens, only in the two strains Methylobacterium radiotolerans and Methylomicrobium album. For the remaining strains, we then searched the LC-MS data for various derivatives of MYFR. Surprisingly, a series of features corresponded to a decarboxylated form of MYFR (i.e., with masses corresponding to MYFR–CO2) in the six strains Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii, Starkeya novella, Variovorax paradoxus, Burkholderia sp. Leaf177, Methylophilus methylotrophus, and Methylobacillus flagellatus. Most likely, such a modification would be localized in the core structure of MYFR. The only available functionality for decarboxylation of the core is the carboxylic acid group that is part of the tyrosine residue (Fig. 1A). Indeed, MS/MS fragmentation showed the presence of fragments consistent with a modified core structure containing tyramine instead of tyrosine (Table S2). The core structure of this novel MYFR type is thus identical to all known core structures of MFRs from archaea, which exclusively contain tyramine. To distinguish between the MYFR derivatives, the notation MYFRTyrosine and MYFRTyramine will be used (Fig. 1A). Notably, all strains tested that belong to the Betaproteobacteria produced MYFRTyramine, while strains with either type of MYFR were found in the Alphaproteobacteria (Fig. 1B). In Methylosinus trichosporium, none of the two MYFR derivatives could be detected. To try to identify MYFR with an unknown core structure, we used an untargeted approach to identify features in the LC-MS data that are separated by the mass of one or multiple glutamates from each other. This approach assumed that any unknown MYFR derivatives would be present as a distribution of species with different number of glutamates. Using this method, we identified the polyglutamate-containing compound p-aminobenzoyl-Glun with 3 to 5 glutamates in extracts of the bacterium, demonstrating that the approach was working in principle. However, we did not identify a novel MYFR derivative and the coenzyme might therefore be present in concentrations below our detection limit. For the strains in which MYFR was identified, the number of glutamates attached to the core structure was evaluated (Fig. 2). While most strains showed similar glutamate distributions to the one from M. extorquens (most abundant MYFR contained 16–20 glutamates), MYFR from V. paradoxus and Burkholderia sp. Leaf177 had less than 14 glutamates (most abundant MYFR contained 12 and 10 glutamates respectively). Strikingly, the distribution of MYFR from Burkholderia sp. Leaf177 (and to some extent also the one from V. paradoxus) showed a distinct gap between MYFR-Glu10 and MYFR-Glu12, i.e., MYFR-Glu11 had a much lower abundance. The discovery of MYFRTyramine prompted us to investigate the genetic and biosynthetic basis for the incorporation of tyrosine or tyramine into MYFR. In the biosynthesis of MFR, tyramine is generated from tyrosine by MfnA, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent l-tyrosine decarboxylase first identified in the methanogenic archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (16Kezmarsky N.D. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. Identification and characterization of a L-tyrosine decarboxylase in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1722: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar enzyme is present in bacteria, we used BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (56937) Google Scholar) to search for homologs of MfnA in all strains analyzed above (Table S3). As expected, no homolog of MfnA could be identified for the three strains producing MYFRTyrosine. However, for three of the six strains producing MYFRTyramine, potential mfnA genes were identified: Mfla_2033 in M. flagellatus (adjacent to the methanol dehydrogenase cluster mxa), Snov_0063 in S. novella, and VAPA_RS28950 in V. paradoxus. All three genes belong to the Pfam protein family PF00282, which contains PLP-dependent decarboxylases. It thus seems likely that these enzymes generate tyramine, which can then be integrated into MYFR. For the remaining three MYFRTyramine-producing strains (M. methylotrophus, H. zavarzinii, and Burkholderia sp. Leaf177), no MfnA homolog was found, suggesting that other tyrosine decarboxylases with weak or no homology to MfnA exist. Alternatively, tyramine might also be produced from a different precursor than tyrosine. An MfnA homolog was also found for M. trichosporium, a strain for which we have not been able to identify MYFR so far, thus predicting the presence of MYFRTyramine in this strain. In each strain producing MYFR, exclusively one type of MYFR was detected and mixtures of MYFRTyrosine and MYFRTyramine were never observed. While tyramine is a specific metabolite that does not seem to be produced in every strain, tyrosine is an indispensable amino acid that must always be present. The incorporation of tyramine into MYFRTyramine (and also MFR) must therefore be specific and no promiscuity of the responsible enzyme be tolerated. The specificity is consistent with MFR biosynthesis, for which the tyramine:l-glutamate ligase MfnD accepts only tyramine as substrate in vitro (18Wang Y. Xu H. Harich K.C. White R.H. Identification and characterization of a tyramine–glutamate ligase (MfnD) involved in methanofuran biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For strains that do not synthesize tyramine—and consequently are only able to produce MYFRTyrosine—the biosynthetic enzyme might be more relaxed. To test whether the MYFRTyrosine-producing strains would principally be able to incorporate tyramine, we cultivated M. extorquens in minimal medium supplemented with 5 mM tyramine and analyzed the cell extract for the presence of the two types of MYFR by LC-MS. Notably, M. extorquens was indeed able to take up tyramine and incorporate it into MYFR, as 64% of the total MYFR pool was made up by MYFRTyramine (Fig. 3). This result demonstrates that the biosynthetic enzyme responsible for tyrosine incorporation is unable to discriminate between tyrosine and tyramine in M. extorquens. Likely, this is also the case for the other strains producing MYFRTyrosine. Our analysis of MYFR from different methylotrophic strains revealed that its structure is largely conserved, since MYFR in all cases consisted of a core structure (containing either tyrosine or tyramine) and a polyglutamate side chain of at least ten glutamates. The biosynthesis of MYFR is thus likely also conserved, although some of the enzymes must have different specificities to distinguish between tyrosine and tyramine. To identify additional proteins involved in the biosynthesis of MYFR, we focused on the genes with unknown function in the “archaeal-like” gene cluster (5Chistoserdova L. Vorholt J.A. Thauer R.K.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2508-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We analyzed strains with deletions in the three genes myfB (orf5; in M. extorquens AM1), orf17 (in M. extorquens PA1; harboring additionally an mxaF deletion, see Experimental procedures), and myfA (orfY; in M. flagellatus KT) to determine whether MYFR biosynthesis is affected by the mutation. As the ΔmyfA mutant could not be obtained in M. extorquens and appears to be lethal, a previously described mutant in M. flagellatus was used (20Kalyuzhnaya M.G. Korotkova N. Crowther G. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Chistoserdova L. Analysis of gene islands involved in methanopterin-linked C1 transfer reactions reveals new functions and provides evolutionary insights.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4607-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), assuming that the biosynthesis will be similar in both strains. After cultivation of the strains and fractionation of the cell extracts by anion-exchange chromatography, we used LC-MS to detect MYFR. While a WT control contained MYFR as expected (with 6 up to 24 glutamates), MYFR could not be detected in all three mutants. The absence of MYFR in the deletion strains indicates the involvement of myfA, myfB, and orf17 in MYFR biosynthesis. Both MyfA and MyfB are—based on their sequence—predicted to be members of the ATP-grasp superfamily (24Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V.

A. 1995; 92: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All members of this family share the unusual ATP-grasp fold for nucleotide binding and most of them catalyze a ligation between a carboxylate and a nucleophile (usually an amine or thiol) via an acylphosphate intermediate (24Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. A diverse superfamily of enzymes with ATP-dependent carboxylate—amine/thiol ligase activity.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fawaz M.V. Topper M.E. Firestine S.M. The ATP-grasp enzymes.Bioorg. Chem. 2011; 39: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Part of the sequence of MyfA shows similarity to MfnD from the methanogen M. jannaschii. MyfA might therefore be involved in an analogous step in MYFR biosynthesis and link one or multiple glutamates with tyrosine or tyramine. Interestingly, in addition to MyfA, the strains M. flagellatus, M. album, Burkholderia sp. Leaf177, V. paradoxus, M. methylotrophus, and S. novella contain a second protein that is even more similar to MfnD and thus probably the paralog (Table S4). For M. flagellatus, it was shown that deletion of this gene (orf1, Mfla_1650) leads to increased sensitivity toward formaldehyde (20Kalyuzhnaya M.G. Korotkova N. Crowther G. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4607-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MyfB (from M. extorquens) shows a sequence identity of 33% to MptN (MJ_0620) from M. jannaschii. MptN has been characterized as an H4MPT:α-l-glutamate ligase (29Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H.
