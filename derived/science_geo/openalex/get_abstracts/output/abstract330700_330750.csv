https://openalex.org/W2057788561,"Classical reaction kinetics has been found to be unsatisfactory when the reactants are spatially constrained on the microscopic level by either walls, phase boundaries, or force fields. Recently discovered theories of heterogeneous reaction kinetics have dramatic consequences, such as fractal orders for elementary reactions, self-ordering and self-unmixing of reactants, and rate coefficients with temporal ""memories."" The new theories were needed to explain the results of experiments and supercomputer simulations of reactions that were confined to low dimensions or fractal dimensions or both. Among the practical examples of ""fractal-like kinetics"" are chemical reactions in pores of membranes, excitation trapping in molecular aggregates, exciton fusion in composite materials, and charge recombination in colloids and clouds."

With maps of chlorophyll distribution derived from remotely sensed data on ocean color as input, deduction of a suitable algorithm for primary production is a problem in applied plant physiology. An algorithm is proposed that combines a spectral and angular model of submarine light with a model of the spectral response of algal photosynthesis. To apply the algorithm at large horizontal scale, a dynamic biogeography is needed for the physiological rate parameters and the biological structure of the water column. Fieldwork to obtain this type of data should be undertaken so that the use of satellite data in modern biological oceanography may be optimized."

The unusual formability of the glasses and their structural features are pointed out. Mechanical properties including tensile fracture strength and Young's modulus are reported along with crystallization temperatures. The unusually high strengths of the aluminum glasses can be of significant importance in obtaining high-strength low-density materials.

Firstly, there is the history of the founding of the Hydrogen Energy Society which took place in Miami, Florida, in 1974 under the chairmanship of Nejat Veziroglu. Earlier, a Hindenberg society was founded by William Escher. The beginning of the official society in Miami in 1974 has been followed by several international meetings, each attended by about 1000 persons."

The extraction rates depend on corolla and bill morphologies, and the extraction efficiencies depend, in addition, on the bird weight and nectar concentration. Differential extraction efficiencies can be exploited by plants to increase pollinator specificity."

THIS PARTICULAR RARE EARTH COBALT OXIDE AGAIN HAD ACTIVITY WHICH RIVALED PLATINUM. THE COMPOUND WAS SUGGESTED AS A CANDIDATE FOR AUTO EXHAUST CATALYSIS. AS A NEXT STEP, COBALT OXIDES WITH OTHER RARE EARTHS HAVE BEEN PREPARED, AND THEIR CATALYTIC ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HAS BEEN FOUND. THIS RESULT SUGGESTED THAT A CATALYST, JUST AS EFFECTIVE, COULD BE MADE FROM THE UNSEPARATED RARE EARTHS WITH SUBSTANTIAL COST SAVINGS. TESTS WITH THE RARE EARTH MIXTURE AS MINED DID GIVE EQUALLY SATISFACTORY RESULTS. /AUTHOR/"

https://openalex.org/W2084275351,"A pair of receptors, responding tonically to pressure applied internally, occurs on the ventral body wall of abdominal segments two to five in the adult of the blood-feeding insect, Rhodnius prolixus. These receptors are located in a region of the body wall subject to forces directly related to the size and movement of the stomach, an enlarged region of the midgut which stores the blood meal, and are therefore well suited for monitoring the degree of distension there. The initiation of many endocrinological processes in Rhodnius is known to be associated with the detection, over a period of several days, of abdominal distension, and these sensory receptors are capable of responding to abdominal distension for extended periods of time."

The very small temperature difference, about 0.010°C, between the triple point and the ice point is readily calculated, and for my purposes I assume that the thermodynamic scale and the practical scale are in agreement at the ice point. 13. Table 4 of (6) includes data for the difference between thermodynamic properties on IPTS. 1968 and ITS-1948. Consider the range 0° to 100'C. From column 3 the maximum value of Cpl/Cp in the range is about 4 X 10-4. From column 2 the maximum value in this range for ,s yields (i/AT)m,, ~ 3 X 10-5. The ratio is about 10. 14. J. F. Masi, H.
