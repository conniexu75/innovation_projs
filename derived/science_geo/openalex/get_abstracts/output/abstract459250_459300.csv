https://openalex.org/W2146791037,"A ""switch"" from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation and is thought to be required to meet the metabolic demands of proliferation. However, why proliferating cells adopt this less efficient metabolism, especially in an oxygen-replete environment, remains incompletely understood. We show here that aerobic glycolysis is specifically required for effector function in T cells but that this pathway is not necessary for proliferation or survival. When activated T cells are provided with costimulation and growth factors but are blocked from engaging glycolysis, their ability to produce IFN-γ is markedly compromised. This defect is translational and is regulated by the binding of the glycolysis enzyme GAPDH to AU-rich elements within the 3' UTR of IFN-γ mRNA. GAPDH, by engaging/disengaging glycolysis and through fluctuations in its expression, controls effector cytokine production. Thus, aerobic glycolysis is a metabolically regulated signaling mechanism needed to control cellular function."

There is evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans, although whether its extent is sufficient to have functional significance has been questioned. We have assessed the generation of hippocampal cells in humans by measuring the concentration of nuclear-bomb-test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, and we present an integrated model of the cell turnover dynamics. We found that a large subpopulation of hippocampal neurons constituting one-third of the neurons is subject to exchange. In adult humans, 700 new neurons are added in each hippocampus per day, corresponding to an annual turnover of 1.75% of the neurons within the renewing fraction, with a modest decline during aging. We conclude that neurons are generated throughout adulthood and that the rates are comparable in middle-aged humans and mice, suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to human brain function.

New neurons integrate throughout life in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of most mammals. The newborn neurons have enhanced synaptic plasticity for a limited time after their differentiation (Ge et al., 2007Ge S. Yang C.H. Hsu K.S. Ming G.L. Song H.

It has long been debated whether adult neurogenesis decreased during primate evolution and whether there is sufficient generation of neurons in adult humans to contribute to brain function (Kempermann, 2012Kempermann G. New neurons for ‘survival of the fittest’.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; Rakic, 1985Rakic P. Limits of neurogenesis in primates.Science. 1985; 227: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A seminal study by Eriksson et al., 1998Eriksson P.S. Perfilieva E. Björk-Eriksson T.

Med. 1998; 4: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (5067) Google Scholar, provided the only direct evidence to date for adult neurogenesis in humans, although it did not enable researchers to assess the number of new neurons generated or the dynamics of this process. To estimate the extent of adult neurogenesis in humans, recent studies have quantified the number of cells expressing the neuronal precursor (neuroblast) marker doublecortin (DCX) in the subventricular zone, which gives rise to olfactory bulb neurons, and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Knoth et al., 2010Knoth R.

Very similar dynamics have been revealed in these two regions, which contain a large number of neuroblasts shortly after birth that decreases sharply during the first postnatal year and then declines more moderately through childhood and adult life (Göritz and Frisén, 2012Göritz C.

The decrease in neuroblast numbers in the subventricular zone and their migratory path suggested that there is negligible, if any, adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis in humans (Arellano and Rakic, 2011Arellano J.I. Rakic P. Neuroscience: Gone with the wean.Nature. 2011; 478: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Sanai et al., 2011Sanai N. Nguyen T. Ihrie R.A. Mirzadeh Z. Tsai H.H. Wong M. Gupta N.

Retrospective birth dating established that olfactory bulb neurons are as old as the individual, and, if there is any addition of neurons in the adult human olfactory bulb, less than 1% of the neurons are exchanged over a century (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O. Liebl J. Bernard S. Alkass K. Yeung M.S. Steier P. Kutschera W. Johnson L. Landén M. Druid H. et al.The age of olfactory bulb neurons in humans.Neuron. 2012; 74: 634-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It appears unlikely that adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis has any functional significance in humans. The similar decline in neuroblast numbers in the subventricular zone and the hippocampus poses the question of whether there is postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in humans to an extent that may have an impact on brain function. Analysis of the number of neuronal progenitor cells gives an indirect indication of the possible extent of neurogenesis. However, it does not provide information as to whether neuroblasts differentiate and integrate as mature neurons. This is evident from the studies of the subventricular zone and olfactory bulb, where the generation of neuroblasts does not result in the detectable integration of new neurons in the olfactory bulb (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O. Liebl J. Bernard S. Alkass K. Yeung M.S. Steier P. Kutschera W. Johnson L. Landén M. Druid H. et al.The age of olfactory bulb neurons in humans.Neuron. 2012; 74: 634-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The strategies used to study the generation of mature neurons in experimental animals are not readily applicable to humans. To be able to study cell turnover dynamics in humans, we have developed a strategy to retrospectively birth date cells (Spalding et al., 2005aSpalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This strategy takes advantage of the elevated atmospheric 14C levels caused by above-ground nuclear bomb testing in 1955–1963 during the Cold War (De Vries, 1958De Vries H. Atomic bomb effect: variation of radiocarbon in plants, shells, and snails in the past 4 years.Science. 1958; 128: 250-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; Nydal and Lövseth, 1965Nydal R. Lövseth K. Distribution of radiocarbon from nuclear tests.Nature. 1965; 206: 1029-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, atmospheric levels of 14C have declined because of uptake by the biotope and diffusion from the atmosphere (Levin and Kromer, 2004Levin I. Kromer B. The tropospheric 14CO2 level in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere (1959-2003).Radiocarbon. 2004; 46: 1261-1272Google Scholar; Levin et al., 2010Levin I. Naegler T. Kromer B. Diehl M.

Observations and modelling of the global distribution and long-term trend of atmospheric 14CO2.Tellus. 2010; 62: 26-46Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 14C in the atmosphere reacts with oxygen to form CO2, which is taken up by plants in photosynthesis. When we eat plants, or animals that live off plants, we take up 14C, meaning that atmospheric 14C levels are mirrored in the human body at all times (Harkness, 1972Harkness D.D. Further investigations of the transfer of bomb 14 C to man.Nature. 1972; 240: 302-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; Libby et al., 1964Libby W.F. Berger R. Mead J.F. Alexander G.V.

Buchholz B.A. Bergman L.-E. Druid H. Frisén J. Forensics: age written in teeth by nuclear tests.Nature. 2005; 437: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When a cell goes through mitosis and duplicates its chromosomes, it integrates 14C in the synthesized genomic DNA with a concentration corresponding to that in the atmosphere at the time, creating a date mark in the DNA (Spalding et al., 2005aSpalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The cumulative nature of 14C integration makes the method especially suited for establishing the kinetics of slowly turning over cell populations. The accuracy of individual datings is approximately ±1.5 years (Spalding et al., 2005bSpalding K.L. Buchholz B.A. Bergman L.-E. Druid H. Frisén J. Forensics: age written in teeth by nuclear tests.Nature. 2005; 437: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but higher accuracy is reached by integrating data from many independent measurements. We have retrospectively birth dated hippocampal cells, and we provide an integrated model for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans. We report that there is substantial neurogenesis in the human hippocampus throughout life, to an extent comparable to that in the middle-aged mouse, thus supporting the idea that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to human brain function. Cell nuclei were isolated by gradient centrifugation from dissected human postmortem hippocampi. The nuclei were incubated with antibodies against the neuron-specific nuclear epitope NeuN, and neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei were isolated by flow cytometry (Figure 1 and Figure S1 available online) (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O.

The 14C concentration in genomic DNA from hippocampal neurons (n = 55) and nonneuronal cells (n = 65) was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in subjects 19–92 years of age (14C data are given in Table S1).Figure S1Reanalysis of Flow-Cytometric-Sorted Hippocampal Neurons and Nonneuronal Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Reanalysis of isolated nonneuronal nuclei with a 0.1% contamination of neuronal nuclei.(B) Representative flow cytometry plot depicting the neuronal fraction with a nonneuronal contamination of 1.1%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Reanalysis of isolated nonneuronal nuclei with a 0.1% contamination of neuronal nuclei. (B) Representative flow cytometry plot depicting the neuronal fraction with a nonneuronal contamination of 1.1%. Standard AMS analysis requires samples corresponding to about 1 mg of carbon. The total amount of carbon in genomic DNA samples from hippocampal cell populations, after cell sorting and purifications steps, is typically in the range 10–20 μg, necessitating a different approach. Consequently, we developed an experimental method with a sample preparation setup and laboratory procedure to address various critical issues, including reliability and accuracy (Salehpour et al., 2013Salehpour M. Hakansson K. Possnert G. Accelerator mass spectrometry of ultra-small samples with applications in the biosciences.Nucl Instrum Meth B. 2013; 294: 97-103Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To infer the cell turnover dynamics in the adult hippocampus, we fitted several mathematical models, or scenarios, with increasing detail to the 14C data. All scenarios were based on birth and death processes by which cells can die or be added to a cell population. A scenario defines a set of rules for how cells are born, die, or renew; i.e., it sets whether there should be more, less, or equal amounts of birth and death and which cells will die preferentially or renew, etc. For each of these scenarios, a set of parameters quantifies the extent of renewal. The mathematical model tracks the chronological age of each cell and the age of the person with a variable n(t,a), with the cell density (units in cells per year) of age a in a person age t. The evolution of the cell density is given by a biological transport equation, which moves cells along age as time progresses with a loss term accounting for cell death:∂n(t,a)∂t+∂n(t,a)da=−γ(t,a)n(t,a). An initial condition describing the cell population at birth and a boundary condition describing how new cells are added are supplemented to the transport equation to solve the problem fully (equations are given in the Extended Experimental Procedures). Solving the problem allows the prediction of the 14C level for a sample by integrating the solution n(t,a) along the atmospheric 14C curve between the birth and death of the individual. By comparing the model prediction to all neuronal or nonneuronal cell data, best parameter sets for each scenario were found. The best scenarios were selected on the basis of Akaike information criterion (AIC); i.e., their goodness of fit and their level of detail. For scenario A (constant turnover) and scenario 2POP (constant turnover in a fraction of cells), individual turnover rates could also be estimated. First, we assessed the turnover dynamics of nonneuronal (NeuN−) cells in the human hippocampus. The 14C concentration in genomic DNA corresponded to time points after the birth of the individuals (Figures 2A and 2B ), establishing the turnover of nonneuronal cells in the human hippocampus. Mathematical modeling of 14C data allowed a detailed analysis of the dynamics of cell turnover (Bergmann et al., 2009Bergmann O. Bhardwaj R.D. Bernard S. Zdunek S. Barnabé-Heider F. Walsh S. Zupicich J. Alkass K.

Britton T. et al.Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans.Nature. 2008; 453: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). By fitting the models to the data, we can infer how much cell renewal is needed to reproduce the observed 14C levels and whether the renewal is restricted to a subpopulation (see Figure S2 and the Extended Experimental Procedures). The best model, based on AIC, was scenario 2POP, in which a fraction of the population is renewing and the other is not. In this scenario, cells within the renewing fraction are set to turn over at a constant rate throughout life. This scenario indicated that a large proportion of the nonneuronal cells (51%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [22%–88%]) are continuously exchanged. The median turnover rate within the subpopulation of nonneuronal cells undergoing exchange is 3.5% per year (Figure 2C and Table S2). Individual turnover estimates suggest that there is a decline in the turnover of nonneuronal cells during aging (r = −0.35, p = 0.04). The average age of nonneuronal cells within the renewing fraction at different ages of an individual is shown in Figure 2D.Figure S2Markov Chain Monte Carlo Parameter Estimation for Nonneuronal Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Scenario E: Colored dots are accepted values (blue: low likelihood, red: high likelihood, gray: rejected guesses).

According to the MCMC simulations, the acceptable range for g0 is g0 > 0.05 per year, g1 between 0.1 and 0.5 (interpreted as the fraction with high turnover) and a hill coefficient above 3.

Number of iterations: 3 × 105. Next, we analyzed the 14C concentration in neuronal genomic DNA. One can draw several conclusions regarding hippocampal neurogenesis from the raw data (Figure 3). First, the 14C concentration in genomic DNA of hippocampal neurons corresponds to the concentration in the atmosphere after the birth of the individual, confirming the postnatal generation of hippocampal neurons in humans (Eriksson et al., 1998Eriksson P.S.

This finding is in contrast to cortical and olfactory bulb neurons, which are not exchanged postnatally to a detectable degree in humans, and 14C levels correspond to the time around the birth of the individual (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O.

Second, the oldest studied subjects had higher 14C concentrations in neuronal DNA than were present in the atmosphere before 1955 (Figure 3). This finding establishes that there has been DNA synthesis after 1955, indicating hippocampal neurogenesis into at least the fifth decade of life (the oldest individual was 42 years old in 1955). Third, the rather uniformly elevated levels of 14C in individuals born before the onset of the nuclear bomb tests indicate that there can be no dramatic decline in hippocampal neurogenesis with age; if there was a substantial decrease in neurogenesis during aging, then individuals born longer before the rise in atmospheric 14C would have incorporated less of the elevated 14C levels present after 1955. Fourth, individuals born before the onset of nuclear bomb tests have lower 14C levels in hippocampal neuron DNA than at any time after 1955, establishing that, although some neurons are generated postnatally, the hippocampus is heterogeneous, and a large subset of hippocampal neurons is not exchanged postnatally. Thus, it is evident from the raw data that there is substantial generation of hippocampal neurons in humans, restricted to a subpopulation, without any dramatic decline during adulthood. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mammals is restricted to the dentate gyrus (Kempermann, 2012Kempermann G. New neurons for ‘surv"

In addition to HLA-B*27 alleles, 12 loci have previously been identified that are associated with ankylosing spondylitis in populations of European ancestry, and 2 associated loci have been identified in Asians. In this study, we used the Illumina Immunochip microarray to perform a case-control association study involving 10,619 individuals with ankylosing spondylitis (cases) and 15,145 controls. We identified 13 new risk loci and 12 additional ankylosing spondylitis–associated haplotypes at 11 loci. Two ankylosing spondylitis–associated regions have now been identified encoding four aminopeptidases that are involved in peptide processing before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation. Protective variants at two of these loci are associated both with reduced aminopeptidase function and with MHC class I cell surface expression."

We used high-throughput histology to reconstruct the complete angioarchitecture and the positions of all neuronal somata of multiple cubic millimeter regions of vibrissa primary sensory cortex in mouse. Vascular networks were derived from the reconstruction. In contrast with the standard model of cortical columns that are tightly linked with the vascular network, graph-theoretical analyses revealed that the subsurface microvasculature formed interconnected loops with a topology that was invariant to the position and boundary of columns. Furthermore, the calculated patterns of blood flow in the networks were unrelated to location of columns. Rather, blood sourced by penetrating arterioles was effectively drained by the penetrating venules to limit lateral perfusion. This analysis provides the underpinning to understand functional imaging and the effect of penetrating vessels strokes on brain viability."
https://openalex.org/W2131781913,"By exploring the phageome in mice, antibiotic treatment is shown to lead to enrichment of phage-encoded genes that are related to antibiotic resistance. Phages naturally coexist in abundance with their bacterial hosts in the mammalian gut. Antibiotic treatment can negatively affect the gut environment and cause immune and metabolic deficiencies. Previously the disruption of intestinal homeostasis has been studied mainly at the level of bacterial species, but here James Collins and colleagues use comparative metagenomics to profile gut phage populations following antibiotic treatment in mice. They find that exposure to ciprofloxacin or ampicillin enriches phage-encoded genes related to antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, phages from antibiotic-treated mice are able to increase resistance in an aerobically cultured naive microbiota. These results suggest that antibiotic treatment increases the frequency of phage integration and stimulates broad host range, which promotes a functional reservoir that is both genetically diverse and highly accessible to gut bacteria. The mammalian gut ecosystem has considerable influence on host physiology1,2,3,4, but the mechanisms that sustain this complex environment in the face of different stresses remain obscure. Perturbations to the gut ecosystem, such as through antibiotic treatment or diet, are at present interpreted at the level of bacterial phylogeny5,6,7. Less is known about the contributions of the abundant population of phages to this ecological network. Here we explore the phageome as a potential genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptation by sequencing murine faecal phage populations following antibiotic perturbation. We show that antibiotic treatment leads to the enrichment of phage-encoded genes that confer resistance via disparate mechanisms to the administered drug, as well as genes that confer resistance to antibiotics unrelated to the administered drug, and we demonstrate experimentally that phages from treated mice provide aerobically cultured naive microbiota with increased resistance. Systems-wide analyses uncovered post-treatment phage-encoded processes related to host colonization and growth adaptation, indicating that the phageome becomes broadly enriched for functionally beneficial genes under stress-related conditions. We also show that antibiotic treatment expands the interactions between phage and bacterial species, leading to a more highly connected phage–bacterial network for gene exchange. Our work implicates the phageome in the emergence of multidrug resistance, and indicates that the adaptive capacity of the phageome may represent a community-based mechanism for protecting the gut microflora, preserving its functional robustness during antibiotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2099034339,"Hox genes are major determinants of the animal body plan, where they organize structures along both the trunk and appendicular axes. During mouse limb development, Hoxd genes are transcribed in two waves: early on, when the arm and forearm are specified, and later, when digits form. The transition between early and late regulations involves a functional switch between two opposite topological domains. This switch is reflected by a subset of Hoxd genes mapping centrally into the cluster, which initially interact with the telomeric domain and subsequently swing toward the centromeric domain, where they establish new contacts. This transition between independent regulatory landscapes illustrates both the modularity of the limbs and the distinct evolutionary histories of its various pieces. It also allows the formation of an intermediate area of low HOX proteins content, which develops into the wrist, the transition between our arms and our hands. This regulatory strategy accounts for collinear Hox gene regulation in land vertebrate appendages."

https://openalex.org/W2152630268,"The linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is an E3 ligase that specifically assembles Met1-linked (also known as linear) Ub chains that regulate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are key regulators of Ub signaling, but a dedicated DUB for Met1 linkages has not been identified. Here, we reveal a previously unannotated human DUB, OTULIN (also known as FAM105B), which is exquisitely specific for Met1 linkages. Crystal structures of the OTULIN catalytic domain in complex with diubiquitin reveal Met1-specific Ub-binding sites and a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in which the proximal Ub activates the catalytic triad of the protease. Mutation of Ub Glu16 inhibits OTULIN activity by reducing kcat 240-fold. OTULIN overexpression or knockdown affects NF-κB responses to LUBAC, TNFα, and poly(I:C) and sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced cell death. We show that OTULIN binds LUBAC and that overexpression of OTULIN prevents TNFα-induced NEMO association with ubiquitinated RIPK1. Our data suggest that OTULIN regulates Met1-polyUb signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2150600032,"A key question in tuberculosis control is why some strains of M. tuberculosis are preferentially associated with resistance to multiple drugs. We demonstrate that M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 2 (East Asian lineage and Beijing sublineage) acquire drug resistances in vitro more rapidly than M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) and that this higher rate can be attributed to a higher mutation rate. Moreover, the in vitro mutation rate correlates well with the bacterial mutation rate in humans as determined by whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates. Finally, using a stochastic mathematical model, we demonstrate that the observed differences in mutation rate predict a substantially higher probability that patients infected with a drug-susceptible lineage 2 strain will harbor multidrug-resistant bacteria at the time of diagnosis. These data suggest that interventions to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis should target bacterial as well as treatment-related risk factors."

The shift from outcrossing to selfing is common in flowering plants1,2, but the genomic consequences and the speed at which they emerge remain poorly understood. An excellent model for understanding the evolution of self fertilization is provided by Capsella rubella, which became self compatible <200,000 years ago. We report a C. rubella reference genome sequence and compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor Capsella grandiflora. We found a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes, similar to that seen in Arabidopsis, in which self fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago. Comparisons of the two Capsella species showed evidence of rapid genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection in C. rubella without a concomitant change in transposable element abundance. Overall we document that the transition to selfing may be typified by parallel shifts in gene expression, along with a measurable reduction of purifying selection."

We present the duck genome sequence and perform deep transcriptome analyses to investigate immune-related genes. Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its β-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires.

Our results provide a mechanistic link between HIF1A and CDK8, two potent oncogenes, in the cellular response to hypoxia. Hypoxia is a hallmark of rapidly growing tissues such as developing embryos and solid tumors. The cellular response to hypoxic stress involves the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a group of DNA-binding proteins that induce transcription of numerous genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, metabolic adaptation, erythropoiesis, and cell survival (Semenza, 2012Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factors in physiology and medicine.Cell. 2012; 148: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the transcriptional response to hypoxia is essential for both proper embryonic development and growth of many solid tumors (Ryan et al., 1998Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. HIF-1 alpha is required for solid tumor formation and embryonic vascularization.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors composed of α and β subunits (Wang et al., 1995Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS heterodimer regulated by cellular O2 tension.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Whereas β subunits (ARNT1-3) are expressed constitutively, the expression of α subunits (HIF1A, HIF2A, and HIF3A) is tightly regulated at the level of protein turnover by an oxygen-sensing pathway. In normoxia, enzymatic hydroxylation of key asparagine and proline residues in the α subunits inhibits their transactivation potential and generates a binding surface for the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor), which triggers their degradation by the proteasome (Ivan et al., 2001Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Hydroxylation is impaired during hypoxia, leading to stabilization of α subunits, their nuclear accumulation, heterodimerization with β subunits, and consequent activation of target genes. Although the biological importance of HIFs is undisputed, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which they control RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Overexpression of HIF1A is known to drive the progression of various cancers, likely due to the adaptive advantage conferred by increased expression of target genes such as those encoding glycolytic enzymes (PGK, LDHA), proangiogenic factors (VEGF), and glucose transporters (GLUT1). Recently, HIF1A was implicated in the development of dietary obesity, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm formation (Semenza, 2012Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factors in physiology and medicine.Cell. 2012; 148: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). Thus, a detailed understanding of HIF1A-dependent RNAPII transactivation will impact diverse fields of biomedical research. Much effort has been devoted to the characterization of the HIF proteins and the DNA elements they recognize (Mole et al., 2009Mole D.R. Blancher C. Copley R.R. Pollard P.J. Gleadle J.M. Ragoussis J. Ratcliffe P.J. Genome-wide association of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and HIF-2alpha DNA binding with expression profiling of hypoxia-inducible transcripts.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16767-16775Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), but little is known about HIF coactivators. The HIF-α subunits contain an N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD) that overlaps the oxygen-dependent degradation domain and a C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) that contains a conserved asparagine whose hydroxylation impairs binding to the coactivators CBP and p300 (Kallio et al., 1998Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O’Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Signal transduction in hypoxic cells: inducible nuclear translocation and recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivator by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two lysine acetyl-transferases are often depicted as the key HIF coactivators, and, recently, PKM2 was identified as a cofactor enhancing HIF1A binding and p300 recruitment to hypoxia response elements (Luo et al., 2011Luo W. Hu H. Chang R. Zhong J. Knabel M. O’Meally R. Cole R.N. Pandey A. Semenza G.L. Pyruvate kinase M2 is a PHD3-stimulated coactivator for hypoxia-inducible factor 1.Cell. 2011; 145: 732-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the CBP/p300 CH1 domain that is required for HIF interaction impairs expression of only a minority of HIF target genes, revealing the existence of additional coactivators (Kasper et al., 2005Kasper L.H. Boussouar F. Boyd K. Xu W. Biesen M. Rehg J. Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Brindle P.K. Two transactivation mechanisms cooperate for the bulk of HIF-1-responsive gene expression.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3846-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Mediator coactivator complex is a widespread regulator of RNAPII activity conserved from yeast to humans (Bourbon, 2008Bourbon H.-M.

Conaway J.W. Function and regulation of the Mediator complex.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2011; 21: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since its early identification and characterization in yeast (Koleske et al., 1992Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A.

A multisubunit complex associated with the RNA polymerase II CTD and TATA-binding protein in yeast.Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), Mediator has been shown to interact with RNAPII, general transcription factors, diverse DNA-binding proteins, transcription elongation factors, and chromatin architecture proteins, thus serving as a signaling hub capable of integrating multiple inputs for precise control of RNAPII (Malik and Roeder, 2010Malik S. Roeder R.G. The metazoan Mediator co-activator complex as an integrative hub for transcriptional regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In mammals, Mediator is composed of 25–30 subunits assembled into distinct modules. The exact subunit composition of Mediator is variable, which may provide a mechanism for increased regulatory diversity and specificity (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. et al.A set of consensus mammalian mediator subunits identified by multidimensional protein identification technology.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The CDK module of Mediator carries the only known enzymatic activity in the complex and associates with the rest of Mediator in a facultative fashion (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. et al.A set of consensus mammalian mediator subunits identified by multidimensional protein identification technology.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the CDK module was initially characterized as a repressor, recent work has shown that it is also required for gene activation across multiple transcriptional programs (for review, see Galbraith et al., 2010Galbraith M.D. Donner A.J. Espinosa J.M. CDK8: a positive regulator of transcription.Transcription. 2010; 1: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, three subunits of this module have undergone gene duplications in the vertebrate lineage to generate the paralogous pairs CDK8/CDK19, MED12/MED12L, and MED13/MED13L (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. et al.A set of consensus mammalian mediator subunits identified by multidimensional protein identification technology.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although very little is known about the functions of the different paralogs, it is expected that they each have specialized roles in mammals. For example, CDK8, but not CDK19, has been defined as an oncogene in colorectal cancer (Firestein et al., 2008Firestein R. Bass A.J. Kim S.Y. Dunn I.F. Silver S.J. Guney I. Freed E. Ligon A.H. Vena N. Ogino S. et al.CDK8 is a colorectal cancer oncogene that regulates beta-catenin activity.Nature. 2008; 455: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In order to define specific functions for CDK8, we performed a comparative analysis of the two kinases in colorectal cancer cells. We found that they assemble into mutually exclusive Mediator complexes and regulate unique transcriptional programs. Strikingly, we found that CDK8, but not CDK19, is required for induction of many HIF1A target genes. Mechanistic studies revealed the existence of a HIF1A-dependent coactivation event acting in addition to HIF1A-induced histone acetylation. We found that HIF1A induces binding of CDK8 to its target genes during hypoxia and that its activation domain interacts with CDK8-Mediator. Prior to induction, hypoxia-inducible genes carry transcriptionally engaged, proximally paused RNAPII. Increased histone acetylation and recruitment of the BRD4 protein upon HIF1A activation does not suffice to activate paused RNAPII at these genes. Instead, we demonstrate that HIF1A employs CDK8-Mediator to recruit the super elongation complex (SEC) along with CDK9. Global analysis of active RNA polymerases revealed that nearly all HIF1A targets are actively transcribed but display pausing during normoxia, suggesting that the transition to elongation is rate limiting and fitting with the notion that CDK8 helps to stimulate pause release. Thus, our studies constitute a significant advance in our understanding of how HIF1A and CDK8 regulate transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism by which these two oncogenes can collaborate. CDK8 and CDK19 are paralogous kinases previously found to associate with the Mediator complex (Figure S1A available online) (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. et al.A set of consensus mammalian mediator subunits identified by multidimensional protein identification technology.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we observed wide coexpression of the two kinases across normal tissues, with a few sites showing higher expression for CDK8 (e.g., bladder, esophagus) or CDK19 (e.g., brain) (Figure S1B). Coexpression is also evident at the protein level in cell lines of diverse origins (Figure S1C). To investigate the possible functional specialization of CDK8 in colorectal cancer cells, we employed the well-characterized HCT116 cell line, which expresses significant amounts of both proteins (Figure S1D). Affinity complex purification of HaloTag versions of CDK8 and CDK19 revealed that the two kinases exist in mutually exclusive variants of Mediator, as CDK19 is undetectable in CDK8 complexes or vice versa (Figure 1A). Importantly, both kinases assemble with the rest of the CDK module and core Mediator carrying MED26, a subunit shown to interact with the SEC containing CDK9 (Takahashi et al., 2011Takahashi H.

With the goal of identifying gene expression networks controlled preferentially by CDK8, we performed a series of microarray analyses in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells where either kinase was stably knocked down (Figures S1D and 1B–1E; Table S1). First, we analyzed the effects on global gene expression under conditions that lead to exponential cell proliferation (Figure 1B). Importantly, the gene sets affected by each kinase are largely nonoverlapping, revealing a specialization for each kinase in gene expression control. Of note, a greater number of genes are significantly induced or repressed by CDK8 knockdown than by CDK19 knockdown, indicating that CDK8 is a more widespread regulator of gene expression under these conditions in HCT116 cells. Next, we analyzed the impact of each kinase on stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Toward this end, we subjected HCT116 cells to three different stress stimuli: 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which provokes a genotoxic stress response involving p53 and other transcription factors; glucose deprivation, which affects gene expression programs downstream of AMPK and mTOR pathways; and hypoxia, which activates adaptive pathways, including those regulated by HIF1A and HIF2A (Figures 1C–1E). In contrast to what is evident during exponential cell proliferation, CDK19 knockdown has a more pronounced effect than CDK8 depletion on the gene expression programs elicited by genotoxic stress and glucose deprivation. This indicates that the minor effects of CDK19 knockdown seen under standard culture conditions are not due to poor knockdown, but rather to a functional specialization of this kinase. Most strikingly, many more hypoxia-inducible genes show a requirement for CDK8 than for CDK19. Of 317 genes significantly induced by hypoxia, 207 (65%) showed reduced expression in CDK8-depleted cells, whereas only 39 (13%) showed reduced expression upon CDK19 knockdown. These data demonstrate that the Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 have specialized to regulate different gene expression programs, with a predominant role for CDK8 in positive control of hypoxia-inducible genes. Because CDK8 knockdown leads to reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible genes, we hypothesized that CDK8 functions as a coactivator for HIF1A. To test this, we used qRT-PCR to monitor the impact of CDK8 knockdown or HIF1A knockout on the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes that were affected by CDK8 knockdown according to our microarray analysis. Expectedly, qRT-PCR confirmed the requirement for CDK8 for full induction of all ten genes selected (ANKRD37 through CITED2, Figure 2A). For contrast purposes, we included TMEM45A and CXCR4, two genes that do not require CDK8. Importantly, HIF1A is also required for induction of most of this set of genes, with DUSP5 and CITED2 being the only exceptions (Figure 2B). Thus, CDK8 can coregulate HIF1A target genes in HCT116 cells. Knockdown of CDK8 has no effect on the stabilization of HIF1A or HIF2A upon hypoxia (Figure S2A), suggesting that CDK8 acts at downstream steps in the hypoxic response. Furthermore, CDK8 depletion has minimal impact on the basal expression of most of these genes during normoxia (Figure S2B). CDK8 knockdown using a different short hairpin RNA (shRNA) also impaired induction of HIF1A target genes (Figures S2C and S2D).Figure S2CDK8 Knockdown and CDK8 ChIP-Seq, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Western blot showing levels of CDK8, HIF1A, HIF2A and nucleolin loading control, for control and shCDK8 #1 HCT116 cells in normoxia or after 24 hr hypoxia.(B) Relative expression of hypoxia-inducible genes as measured by qRT-PCR for control and CDK8 knockdown (shCDK8 #1) HCT116 cells in normoxia to show the effect of shCDK8 on basal expression levels.

The gray lines represent a 1:1 relationship between normoxia and hypoxia enrichment values (see Experimental Procedures for details). See also Table S2. To test whether CDK8 could be acting directly at HIF1A target genes on a global scale, we performed CDK8 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in HCT116 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This global analysis of CDK8 chromatin binding revealed that ∼43% of CDK8 peaks are found within the region spanning 3 kb upstream of transcription start sites (TSSs) through to 5′ UTRs, whereas another ∼50% are found in more distal intergenic and intragenic regions (Figure S2E). During normoxia, although 74% (235/317) of hypoxia-inducible genes are associated with significant CDK8 peaks, only 5% (12/235) of these display reduced basal expression in shCDK8 cells, suggesting that CDK8 is important mostly for their induced expression. Upon hypoxia, 64% (204/317) of hypoxia-inducible genes were associated with significant CDK8 peaks, and the expression of roughly 70% (137/204) of these genes is negatively affected by CDK8 knockdown (Figure 2C; Table S2). When analyzed in a 10 kb window around TSSs, a gradient of CDK8 occupancy becomes apparent both at all RefSeq genes and at hypoxia-inducible genes, with maximum signals centered over TSSs (Figures 2D–2E). Further analysis reveals that hypoxia-inducible genes have a significantly higher level of CDK8 binding at their TSSs and also display more spreading of CDK8 into the gene body, as compared to the global average (Figures 2E and S2F). Interestingly, hypoxia leads to a general decrease of CDK8 binding throughout the genome, concurrently with equal or increased CDK8 binding at peaks associated with hypoxia-inducible genes (Figure 2F). This is also apparent when looking at TSSs and 3′ ends of genes (Figures S2G and S2H). Thus, although hypoxia does not affect overall CDK8 protein expression (Figures S2A and S2C), it does produce a global change toward binding at the genes upregulated in this scenario. Representative examples of this pattern of CDK8 binding are shown for the HIF1A target genes ANKRD37 and ALDOC in Figure 2G. To investigate the mechanism by which CDK8 contributes to expression of HIF1A target genes, we performed a detailed quantitative ChIP analysis of the ANKRD37 and STC2 gene loci (Figures 3 and S3, respectively). Both genes undergo robust HIF1A- and CDK8-dependent induction upon hypoxia but are not affected by CDK19 depletion (Figure S3A). As predicted from our ChIP-seq analysis, CDK8 is recruited to the ANKRD37 locus upon hypoxia, with peak signals around the TSS (Figure 3A). Expectedly, CDK8 ChIP signals are much reduced in shCDK8 cells. Interestingly, total RNAPII shows significant enrichment at the TSS under normoxia, when expression of ANKRD37 mRNA is 50- to 100-fold lower (Figure 3B). Upon hypoxia, a modest increase (<2-fold) in RNAPII is observed at the promoter, but a much more significant increase (up to 20-fold) in RNAPII occupancy is observed at the intragenic and 3′ regions. This RNAPII behavior is indicative of transcriptional pausing and is observed at many genes induced in response to specific stimuli (Boehm et al., 2003Boehm A.K. Saunders A. Werner J. Lis J.T.

It is currently not possible to predict which epitopes will be recognized by T cells in different individuals. This is a barrier to the thorough analysis and understanding of T-cell responses after vaccination or infection. Here, by combining mass cytometry with combinatorial peptide–MHC tetramer staining, we have developed a method allowing the rapid and simultaneous identification and characterization of T cells specific for many epitopes. We use this to screen up to 109 different peptide–MHC tetramers in a single human blood sample, while still retaining at least 23 labels to analyze other markers of T-cell phenotype and function. Among 77 candidate rotavirus epitopes, we identified six T-cell epitopes restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 in the blood of healthy individuals. T cells specific for epitopes in the rotavirus VP3 protein displayed a distinct phenotype and were present at high frequencies in intestinal epithelium. This approach should be useful for the comprehensive analysis of T-cell responses to infectious diseases or vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2007381960,"Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Overproduction of lipoproteins, a process that is dependent on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), can contribute to hyperlipidemia. We show that microRNA-30c (miR-30c) interacts with the 3' untranslated region of MTP mRNA and induces its degradation, leading to reductions in MTP activity and in apolipoprotein B (APOB) secretion. miR-30c also reduces lipid synthesis independently of MTP. Hepatic overexpression of miR-30c reduced hyperlipidemia in Western diet-fed mice by decreasing lipid synthesis and the secretion of triglyceride-rich ApoB-containing lipoproteins and decreased atherosclerosis in Apoe(-/-) mice. Furthermore, inhibition of hepatic miR-30c by anti-miR-30c increased hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Therefore, miR-30c coordinately reduces lipid biosynthesis and lipoprotein secretion, thereby regulating hepatic and plasma lipid concentrations. Raising miR-30c levels might be useful in treating hyperlipidemias and associated disorders."

Directed evolution of this construct now shows a drastic reorganization of the active site to use an alternative catalytic lysine and suggests considerations for future design efforts. Evolutionary advances are often fueled by unanticipated innovation. Directed evolution of a computationally designed enzyme suggests that pronounced molecular changes can also drive the optimization of primitive protein active sites. The specific activity of an artificial retro-aldolase was boosted >4,400-fold by random mutagenesis and screening, affording catalytic efficiencies approaching those of natural enzymes. However, structural and mechanistic studies reveal that the engineered catalytic apparatus, consisting of a reactive lysine and an ordered water molecule, was unexpectedly abandoned in favor of a new lysine residue in a substrate-binding pocket created during the optimization process. Structures of the initial in silico design, a mechanistically promiscuous intermediate and one of the most evolved variants highlight the importance of loop mobility and supporting functional groups in the emergence of the new catalytic center. Such internal competition between alternative reactive sites may have characterized the early evolution of many natural enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1997684104,"Epigenetic mechanisms underlying somatic reprogramming have been extensively studied, but little is known about the nuclear architecture of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Using circular chromosome conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we identified chromosomal regions that colocalize frequently with the Oct4 locus in PSCs. These PSC-specific long-range interactions are established prior to transcriptional activation of endogenous Oct4 during reprogramming to induced PSCs and are facilitated by Klf4-mediated recruitment of cohesin. Depletion of Klf4 leads to unloading of cohesin at the Oct4 enhancer and disrupts long-range interactions prior to loss of Oct4 transcription and subsequent PSC differentiation, suggesting a causative role for Klf4 in facilitating long-range interactions independent of its transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results delineate the basic nuclear organization at the Oct4 locus in PSCs and suggest a functional role for Klf4-mediated higher-order chromatin structure in maintaining and inducing pluripotency."

Using cultured SSCs, we show that ROS are generated via the AKT and MEK signaling pathways under conditions where the growth factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 drive SSC self-renewal and, instead, stimulate self-renewal at physiological levels. SSCs depleted of ROS stopped proliferating, but they showed enhanced self-renewal when ROS levels were increased by the addition of hydrogen peroxide, which induced the phosphorylation of stress kinases p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, ROS depletion in vivo decreased SSC number in the testis, and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1)-deficient SSCs exhibited reduced self-renewal division upon serial transplantation. These results suggest that ROS generated by Nox1 play critical roles in SSC self-renewal via the activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways."

Cows are unusual in having exceptionally long CDR H3 loops and few V regions, but the mechanism for creating diversity is not understood. Deep sequencing reveals that ultralong CDR H3s contain a remarkable complexity of cysteines, suggesting that disulfide-bonded minidomains may arise during repertoire development. Indeed, crystal structures of two cow antibodies reveal that these CDR H3s form a very unusual architecture composed of a β strand ""stalk"" that supports a structurally diverse, disulfide-bonded ""knob"" domain. Diversity arises from somatic hypermutation of an ultralong DH with a severe codon bias toward mutation to cysteine. These unusual antibodies can be elicited to recognize defined antigens through the knob domain. Thus, the bovine immune system produces an antibody repertoire composed of ultralong CDR H3s that fold into a diversity of minidomains generated through combinations of somatically generated disulfides."

Most organisms exhibit daily cycles of physiology, metabolism, and behavior, so-called circadian rhythms, which are generated by circadian clocks. The roughly 24 hr period results from gene-regulatory negative feedback loops with a spatiotemporally regulated interplay of interactions between and posttranslational modifications, synthesis, and degradation of clock proteins (Young and Kay, 2001Young M.W. Kay S.A. Time zones: a comparative genetics of circadian clocks.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding blue-light photoreceptor involved in the synchronization of the circadian rhythm with the environmental light-dark cycle (Emery et al., 1998Emery P.

CRY1 also affects glucose homeostasis by interacting with the Gsα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and thereby inhibiting cAMP-dependent CREB phosphorylation and activity (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang E.E.

Med. 2010; 16: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Additionally, CRY1 and CRY2 interact with the ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and thereby repress the GR-induced expression of the gluconeogenetic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) in the liver but do not affect glucocorticoid-induced inflammatory genes (Lamia et al., 2011Lamia K.A.

Compounds that enhance cryptochrome activity or stability could therefore be useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or limit hyperglycaemia in anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid treatments. For human CRY2, a blue-light-dependent function as a magnetoreceptor has also been reported when transformed into cry loss-of-function (cryb, D410N) Drosophila flies (Foley et al., 2011Foley L.E. Gegear R.J. Reppert S.M. Human cryptochrome exhibits light-dependent magnetosensitivity.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 356Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, human CRY is photoreduced in overexpressing Sf21 insect cells and is degraded in a light-dependent manner in living flies (Hoang et al., 2008Hoang N. Schleicher E. Kacprzak S. Bouly J.P.

Human and Drosophila cryptochromes are light activated by flavin photoreduction in living cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cryptochromes and the sequence-related DNA-repairing photolyases share a chromophore binding photolyase homology region (PHR). The PHR consists of an N-terminal αβ domain and a C-terminal helical domain, which binds FAD in a U-shaped manner with the isoalloxacine ring adjacent to the adenine (Müller and Carell, 2009Müller M. Carell T. Structural biology of DNA photolyases and cryptochromes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Photolyases also contain antenna chromophores, which funnel energy to the catalytic FAD chromophore. In addition to the PHR, cryptochromes have C-terminal regulatory tail regions of variable length and sequence (Cashmore, 2003Cashmore A.R. Cryptochromes: enabling plants and animals to determine circadian time.Cell. 2003; 114: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Purified dCRY binds oxidized FAD in its dark state, which is converted to an anionic FAD°− radical after blue-light illumination (Berndt et al., 2007Berndt A. Kottke T. Breitkreuz H. Dvorsky R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 13011-13021Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A cascade of three highly conserved tryptophanes (Trp342, Trp397, and Trp420 in dCRY) has been implicated in the electron transport required for FAD photoreduction (Hoang et al., 2008Hoang N.

Human and Drosophila cryptochromes are light activated by flavin photoreduction in living cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The PHR of dCRY interacts with TIMELESS (dTIM) and the E3-ligase JETLAG (JET) in a light-dependent manner, and the tail prevents these interactions in darkness (Busza et al., 2004Busza A. Emery-Le M.

A light-induced conformational change of the tail allows for dCRY-dTIM/JET interactions (Ozturk et al., 2011Ozturk N. Selby C.P. Annayev Y. Zhong D. Sancar A.

To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying dCRY’s photoreceptor function and to dissect the established light-independent and proposed light-dependent functions of mammalian cryptochromes, we have solved crystal structures of full-length dCRY, of a dCRY loop deletion construct, and of the PHR of mouse cryptochrome 1 (mCRY1). Comparison of our dCRY structures with a recently published structure of full-length dCRY (Zoltowski et al., 2011Zoltowski B.D. Vaidya A.T. Top D. Widom J. Young M.W. Crane B.R. Structure of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome.Nature. 2011; 480: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) revealed remarkable differences in the regulatory tail and its adjacent loops, which allowed us to further test and thereby provide insights into the photoactivation mechanism of Drosophila cryptochrome. Our mCRY1 structure may guide the design of CRY1 activating or stabilizing compounds that could be used in the therapy of type II diabetes as well as anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid treatments. It also depicts a nuclear localization signal (NLS), MAPK and AMPK phosphorylation sites, and previously analyzed mutations that affect transcriptional repression. Furthermore, our dCRY and mCRY1 structures suggest binding sites for Drosophila and mammalian clock proteins. Our mutational analyses revealed partly overlapping mCRY1 regions that are involved in FAD-independent mPER2- and FBXL3 binding and transcriptional repression. We have solved the 2.35 Å crystal structure of a dCRY construct, in which residues Arg294 to Arg298 of the so-called protrusion loop have been deleted (dCRYΔloop). Subsequently, we have solved the 3.2 Å resolution structure of full-length dCRY by molecular replacement using the refined dCRYΔloop structure as a search model (Table S1). Compared to the published dCRY structure (Zoltowski et al., 2011Zoltowski B.D. Vaidya A.T. Top D. Widom J. Young M.W. Crane B.R. Structure of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome.Nature. 2011; 480: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our dCRY structures show remarkable differences in functionally important regions, such as the regulatory tail and its adjacent loops (Figure 1; Figures S1 and S2 available online). Whereas FAD-contacting residues adopt the same positions in our structures as in the published dCRY structure (Figures S2D and S2E), our electron density does not provide evidence for the reduction of FAD in the crystal because no butterfly bending or change of the angle between the isoalloxazine ring and the ribityl chain is observed (Figures 1B and S2D). Structural differences in the tail helix (α23, Glu528 to Phe535) and the preceding linker (Leu516 to Asn527) lead to a two-amino-acid frameshift between our and the published dCRY structure throughout the tail (Figures 1B and S2C). As a result, the reported phosphorylation site at Thr518 (Zoltowski et al., 2011Zoltowski B.D. Vaidya A.T. Top D. Widom J. Young M.W. Crane B.R. Structure of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome.Nature. 2011; 480: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is not observed in our structures. Furthermore, our structures depict tail residue Phe534 instead of Trp536 in the position that is occupied by the 6-4 photolesion in DNA-repairing photolyases (Hitomi et al., 2009Hitomi K.

Compared to the published dCRY structure, we observe drastic changes within the C-terminal lid, which are correlated with the structural rearrangements in the adjacent tail region (Figures 1 and S2B).

https://openalex.org/W1972768882,"Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is widespread in the CNS, but its function remains unclear. In neocortical pyramidal neurons, adaptation manifests itself by an increase in the firing threshold and by adaptation currents triggered after each spike. Combining electrophysiological recordings in mice with modeling, we found that these adaptation processes lasted for more than 20 s and decayed over multiple timescales according to a power law. The power-law decay associated with adaptation mirrored and canceled the temporal correlations of input current received in vivo at the somata of layer 2/3 somatosensory pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that, in the cortex, SFA causes temporal decorrelation of output spikes (temporal whitening), an energy-efficient coding procedure that, at high signal-to-noise ratio, improves the information transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2115971557,"A major challenge for metazoans is to ensure that different tissues, each expressing distinctive proteomes, are nevertheless well protected at an organismal level from proteotoxic stress. We show that expression of endogenous metastable proteins in muscle cells, which rely on chaperones for proper folding, induces a systemic stress response throughout multiple tissues of C. elegans. Suppression of misfolding in muscle cells can be achieved not only by enhanced expression of HSP90 in muscle cells but as effectively by elevated expression of HSP90 in intestine or neuronal cells. This cell-nonautonomous control of HSP90 expression relies upon transcriptional feedback between somatic tissues that is regulated by the FoxA transcription factor PHA-4. This transcellular chaperone signaling response maintains organismal proteostasis when challenged by a local tissue imbalance in folding and provides the basis for organismal stress-sensing surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2024535234,"Growth cones enable axons to navigate toward their targets by responding to extracellular signaling molecules. Growth-cone responses are mediated in part by the local translation of axonal messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, the mechanisms that regulate local translation are poorly understood. Here we show that Robo3.2, a receptor for the Slit family of guidance cues, is synthesized locally within axons of commissural neurons. Robo3.2 translation is induced by floor-plate-derived signals as axons cross the spinal cord midline. Robo3.2 is also a predicted target of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. We find that NMD regulates Robo3.2 synthesis by inducing the degradation of Robo3.2 transcripts in axons that encounter the floor plate. Commissural neurons deficient in NMD proteins exhibit aberrant axonal trajectories after crossing the midline, consistent with misregulation of Robo3.2 expression. These data show that local translation is regulated by mRNA stability and that NMD acts locally to influence axonal pathfinding."
https://openalex.org/W2169818143,"The way in which cells adopt different morphologies is not fully understood. Cell shape could be a continuous variable or restricted to a set of discrete forms. We developed quantitative methods to describe cell shape and show that Drosophila haemocytes in culture are a heterogeneous mixture of five discrete morphologies. In an RNAi screen of genes affecting the morphological complexity of heterogeneous cell populations, we found that most genes regulate the transition between discrete shapes rather than generating new morphologies. In particular, we identified a subset of genes, including the tumour suppressor PTEN, that decrease the heterogeneity of the population, leading to populations enriched in rounded or elongated forms. We show that these genes have a highly conserved function as regulators of cell shape in both mouse and human metastatic melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136160202,"The bone marrow (BM) niche comprises multiple cell types that regulate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) migration out of the niche and into the circulation. Here, we demonstrate that osteocytes, the major cellular component of mature bone, are regulators of HSPC egress. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), used clinically to mobilize HSPCs, induces changes in the morphology and gene expression of the osteocytic network that precedes changes in osteoblasts. This rapid response is likely under control of the sympathetic nervous system, since osteocytes express the β2-adrenergic receptor and surgical sympathectomy prevents it. Mice with targeted ablation of osteocytes or a disrupted osteocyte network have comparable numbers of HSPCs in the BM but fail to mobilize HSPCs in response to G-CSF. Taken together, these results indicate that the BM/bone niche interface is critically controlled from inside of the bone matrix and establish an important physiological role for skeletal tissues in hematopoietic function."

Earlier sequence analyses of H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) point to amino acid changes that predicted human receptor binding and impinge on the antigenic characteristics of the HA. Here, we report that the H7N9 HA shows limited binding to human receptors; however, should a single amino acid mutation occur, this would result in structural changes within the receptor binding site that allow for extensive binding to human receptors present in the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, a subset of the H7N9 HA sequences demarcating coevolving amino acids appears to be in the antigenic regions of H7, which, in turn, could impact effectiveness of the current WHO-recommended prepandemic H7 vaccines.

In late March of 2013, an H7N9 influenza A virus subtype was identified that was found to infect humans, causing rapidly progressing severe lower respiratory tract infection and mortality (Gao et al., 2013Gao R. Cao B. Hu Y. Feng Z. Wang D. Hu W. Chen J. Jie Z. Qiu H. Xu K. et al.Human infection with a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus.N. Engl. J.

Detailed sequencing and analysis of the human isolates of H7N9 have offered insights into their potential origin and factors that govern the virus’s virulence and pathogenicity (Li et al., 2013Li Q. Zhou L. Zhou M. Chen Z. Li F. Wu H. Xiang N. Chen E. Tang F. Wang D. et al.Preliminary report: epidemiology of the avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak in China.N. Engl. J.

The transmission and pathogenicity associated with this virus is unanticipated for several reasons. First, transmission of H7 viruses from birds to mammals has been reported only rarely (Kwon et al., 2011Kwon T.Y. Lee S.S. Kim C.Y. Shin J.Y. Sunwoo S.Y. Lyoo Y.S.

Finally, human infections with other H7 viruses (primarily H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7), even with high-pathogenicity viruses containing a polybasic cleavage site in HA, have primarily resulted in conjunctivitis or uncomplicated illness, with few exceptions (Fouchier et al., 2004Fouchier R.A.

Analysis of newly arising H7N9 strains, including A/Shanghai/1/2013, A/Shanghai/2/2013, and A/Anhui/1/2013, indicates that H7N9 is a reassorted virus incorporating envelope genes from at least two H7 strains (hemagglutinin [HA] from an H7N3 strain and neuraminidase [NA] from an avian-adapted H7N9 strain) with the internal genes from at least two H9N2 avian-adapted influenza strains (Li et al., 2013Li Q. Zhou L. Zhou M. Chen Z. Li F. Wu H. Xiang N. Chen E. Tang F. Wang D. et al.Preliminary report: epidemiology of the avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak in China.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; (Published online April 24, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1304617Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the H7N9 gene segments has shown the occurrence of signature amino acids associated with adaptation to human host and virulence (summarized in Table 2 in Gao et al., 2013Gao R. Cao B. Hu Y. Feng Z. Wang D. Hu W. Chen J. Jie Z. Qiu H. Xu K. et al.Human infection with a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). H7N9 strains exhibit hallmark mutations that are thought to correlate with increased virulence and potentially transmission in animal models such as mice and ferrets, including the E627K mutation in PB2 (which is known to play a key role in human-to-human respiratory droplet transmission [Van Hoeven et al., 2009Van Hoeven N. Pappas C. Belser J.A. Maines T.R. Zeng H. García-Sastre A. Sasisekharan R. Katz J.M. Tumpey T.M. Human HA and polymerase subunit PB2 proteins confer transmission of an avian influenza virus through the air.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3366-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar]). Furthermore, genetic analysis indicates the presence of mutations, in at least some strains, within the M2 ion channel and NA that confer drug resistance to the adamantanes and oseltamivir, respectively. In contrast to the above analysis, several of the hallmark features found in highly pathogenic influenza strains (e.g., H5N1), including the N66S mutation in PB1-F2, the aforementioned polybasic sequence in the linker between HA1 and HA2, and the PDZ-binding motif in C terminus of NS1, are absent in the H7N9 human isolates analyzed to date. Within this context and given the somewhat confounding genetic and epidemiological evidence of the relative human-adaptation of H7N9, one of the most important outstanding questions is the “status” of the HA protein for these isolates. Characterization of the HA protein is important given its role in virulence (Pappas et al., 2008Pappas C. Aguilar P.V. Basler C.F. Solórzano A. Zeng H. Perrone L.A. Palese P. García-Sastre A. Katz J.M. Tumpey T.M. Single gene reassortants identify a critical role for PB1, HA, and NA in the high virulence of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and virus neutralization to pre-existing antibodies through antigenic memory (Hensley et al., 2009Hensley S.E. Das S.R. Bailey A.L. Schmidt L.M. Hickman H.D. Jayaraman A. Viswanathan K. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Hemagglutinin receptor binding avidity drives influenza A virus antigenic drift.Science. 2009; 326: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Finally, the receptor-binding properties of HA, governing a given virus’s tissue and organismic tropism, are one of the key factors that critically govern aerosol transmissibility, including human-to-human transmission (Van Hoeven et al., 2009Van Hoeven N. Pappas C. Belser J.A. Maines T.R. Zeng H. García-Sastre A. Sasisekharan R. Katz J.M. Tumpey T.M. Human HA and polymerase subunit PB2 proteins confer transmission of an avian influenza virus through the air.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3366-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that one of the key properties governing human adaptation of influenza A virus is a “switch” in the glycan receptor-binding specificities of viral HA (Skehel and Wiley, 2000Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). Therefore, together with hallmark mutations in other genes, such as PB2, describing mutations in HA that lead to such a “switch” becomes important for surveillance purposes. From the standpoint of human tissue tropism, the HA from human-adapted viruses, including pandemic strains, shows extensive binding to the apical surface of human upper respiratory tissues (such as trachea) and also shows characteristic binding to mucin-secreting nonciliated goblet cells on the apical surface and to submucosal glands in ferret respiratory tract (Matrosovich et al., 2004Matrosovich M.N. Matrosovich T.Y. Gray T. Roberts N.A. Klenk H.D. Human and avian influenza viruses target different cell types in cultures of human airway epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Through lectin staining, it has been demonstrated previously that these regions in human tracheal sections predominantly display diverse glycan receptors terminated by α2→6 sialic acid linkage (human receptors) (Srinivasan et al., 2008Srinivasan A.

We have previously demonstrated with H1, H2, and H3 subtypes that this binding property of human-adapted viruses is one of the key factors that correlates with their ability to efficiently transmit via respiratory droplets in ferrets—a well-established animal model to measure the potential for airborne human-to-human transmission (Jayaraman et al., 2011Jayaraman A.

In the case of H7N9, based on the presence of a leucine residue in the 226 position (H3 numbering) of the HA, earlier studies have predicted that this HA would have strong binding to human receptors (Gao et al., 2013Gao R. Cao B. Hu Y. Feng Z. Wang D. Hu W. Chen J. Jie Z. Qiu H. Xu K. et al.Human infection with a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar; Liu et al., 2013Liu D. Shi W. Shi Y. Wang D. Xiao H. Li W. Bi Y. Wu Y. Li X. Yan J. et al.Origin and diversity of novel avian influenza A H7N9 viruses causing human infection: phylogenetic, structural, and coalescent analyses.Lancet. 2013; Google Scholar). These recent studies note that HA-glycan receptor interaction is a critical property of the virus and that experimental characterization of this property for the H7N9 subtype is important. Here, we report the molecular and structural features of the glycan receptor-binding site (RBS) of H7N9 HA and the experimental characterization of its binding to physiological glycan receptors in the human respiratory tract. Contrary to the predicted strong binding to human receptors, H7N9 HA shows limited binding to these receptors in the human upper respiratory tract when compared to human receptor binding of other human-adapted HAs. The experimentally observed limited binding to human receptors by H7N9 HA is consistent with the analysis of its RBS structural features. The structural and sequence analyses further point to a single Gly228→Ser amino acid change, which modifies the network of interresidue contacts in the RBS for more optimal contacts with both avian and human receptors. Consequently, introducing this amino acid change in H7N9 HA RBS resulted in a mutant HA that extensively bound to the apical surface of human tracheal tissue sections in a fashion similar to that of other human-adapted HAs. Our findings therefore provide important insights into the physiological glycan receptor tropism of the current H7N9 HA. We also report an increase in human receptor binding should a single Gly228→Ser amino acid change occur in this HA in the context of monitoring the evolution of this emerging subtype, especially as it continues to circulate in humans. Finally, we report amino acid substitutions in the H7N9 HA sequences that distinguish the evolution (including antigenic sites) of this recently emerged subtype from past H7 isolates, which, in turn, has implications for vaccine development strategies. Given that H7N9 is a newly emerged subtype, there is a limited set of HA sequences available for this subtype to do a comprehensive analysis of sequence evolution of its RBS. Therefore, in order to understand glycan receptor-binding properties of H7N9 HA, we chose a representative human isolate A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anh13). Because there is no crystal structure available, we constructed a homology-based structural model of Anh13 HA and compared its RBS with H3 HA (its phylogenetically closest human-adapted HA [Figure S1 available online]). Anh13 was chosen because it shares substantial sequence identity with many other reported strains of H7N9, including A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013. Additionally, as noted previously (Gao et al., 2013Gao R. Cao B. Hu Y. Feng Z. Wang D. Hu W. Chen J. Jie Z. Qiu H. Xu K. et al.Human infection with a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar), although there are changes in the HA sequence of Anh13 compared to the HA sequence of other reported H7N9 strains, including A/Shanghai/2/2013, the HA of Anh13 contains a key Q226L mutation that has been reported to be important for altered receptor specificity for group 2 viruses, including H3 and H7. As such, Anh13 (and related viruses) are more likely than viruses such as A/Shanghai/2/2013 to be of concern from the standpoint of altered receptor specificity and, hence, human transmissibility. Earlier, we defined a framework that incorporated descriptors of the structural topology of the human glycan receptor as well as interamino acid interaction networks within the RBS to define the molecular features of the RBS of H5 HA for high-avidity/specificity binding to human glycan receptors (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008Chandrasekaran A. Srinivasan A. Raman R. Viswanathan K. Raguram S. Tumpey T.M. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Glycan topology determines human adaptation of avian H5N1 virus hemagglutinin.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar; Soundararajan et al., 2011Soundararajan V. Zheng S. Patel N. Warnock K. Raman R. Wilson I.A. Raguram S. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Networks link antigenic and receptor-binding sites of influenza hemagglutinin: Mechanistic insight into fitter strain propagation.Sci. Rep. 2011; 1: 200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the molecular features of the Anh13 RBS with those of H3 HA (from A/Aichi/1/68 or Aich68, a strain from the 1967–1968 pandemic), which was recently cocrystallized with both avian and human receptors (Lin et al., 2012Lin Y.P. Xiong X. Wharton S.A. Martin S.R. Coombs P.J. Vachieri S.G. Christodoulou E. Walker P.A. Liu J. Skehel J.J. et al.Evolution of the receptor binding properties of the influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 21474-21479Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Also of importance, because Aich68 represents a human-adapted virus, comparison of its HA to that of Anh13 provides an important benchmark to address the question of whether the HA from Anh13 shares structural characteristics with HAs of human-adapted viruses and, if not, which structural characteristics are missing. Structural analyses of both H7 and H3 HAs indicate that the structural topology of the human glycan receptor bound in the RBS of HA is such that it has a clearly defined base region consisting of the terminal Neu5Acα2→6Galβ1→ motif and an extension region consisting of at least a disaccharide →4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→. On the other hand, the topology of the avian receptor bound within the HA RBS is such that majority of the contacts with residues within the RBS involve the terminal Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→ motif in the base region (Figure 1). The 130 (residues 131–138), 140 (residues 140–145) and 220 (residues 219–228) loops in the RBS make critical contacts with the disaccharide motif in the base region and thus play a key role in dictating the avian or human receptor-binding preference (residue position numbering is based on Aichi68 HA-glycan cocrystal structure [Protein Data Bank ID: 2YPG]). Additionally, residues within the 190 helix (residues 190–196) and a part of the 150 loop (residues 156–160), if properly positioned, make critical contacts with the extension region of the human receptor. Taken together, these five loops and one helix in the RBS that make contact with the base and potentially with the extension region of the human receptor and their network of interactions with spatially proximal residues in the RBS constitute a complete set of molecular features that should be analyzed to understand the receptor-binding preference of an HA. Comparison of these features between the Anh13 and Aichi68 HA shows many similarities, as well as some important differences (Table 1). First, many of the residues in the 130 loop, 140 loop, and 220 loop are similar between the HA of Anh13 and Aichi68. Based on this level of similarity, we find that the network of interresidue contacts involving these residues is also similar (Figures 1A and 1C). The key structural differences noted in this analysis include part of the 190 helix and the 150 loop required for contact with the extension region of the human receptor. In the Aich68 HA, the residues interacting with the extension region include Q189, S193, K156, and S159 (Figure 1C), whereas, in H7 HA, these residues include K193, T158, D159, and N160 (Figure 1B). Furthermore, in the case of the H7 HA, R131 is positioned to make an additional contact with the extension region (Figure 1B). In addition to the differences in the amino acids at these positions—and also of note—are differences between Aich68 and Anh13 in the interresidue interaction network governed by the residue at position 228. This position is a Ser in Aichi68 but is a Gly in Anh13. The S228 position in H3 is critical for the interamino acid network involving S186, T187, and E190, which positions E190 to make critical contacts with the sialic acid of both avian and human receptors (Figure 1C). On the other hand, G228 in H7 HA does not possess this interamino acid network and, therefore, the network of interresidue contacts involving E190 in H7 is different from that of H3 HA and instead includes 193 (and its network) and 189 (Figure 1A).Table 1Amino Acid Differences in the RBS of Aichi68 H3 and Anh13 H7 HAsBase (Neu5Acα2→3/6Galβ1→)Extension (→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4→)HA130 loop140 loop220 loop150 loop150 loop190 helix131133136138145219221222225226227228153155156157158159160186187188189190192193194196Aichi68TNSASSPWGLSSWTKSGSTSTNQETSLVAnh13RNTASAPQGLSGWLSNTDNVSTAETKLGThe key amino acids in the 130, 140, 150, and 220 loops and 190 helix that bind to the base and extension region of the glycan receptors in Aichi68 and Anh13 are shown. The 150 loop has amino acids (positions 153 and 155) that are involved in contacts with the sialic acid in the base region and those that are involved in binding to extension region. See also Figure S3. Open table in a new tab The key amino acids in the 130, 140, 150, and 220 loops and 190 helix that bind to the base and extension region of the glycan receptors in Aichi68 and Anh13 are shown. The 150 loop has amino acids (positions 153 and 155) that are involved in contacts with the sialic acid in the base region and those that are involved in binding to extension region. See also Figure S3. Extending this analysis, the E190 in H7 HA is positioned to make additional contacts with the extension region instead of the critical contact with the sialic acid in the base region (Figure 1B). Therefore, Anh13 H7 HA lacks at least two critical contacts involving the 190 and 226 HA positions with the Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→ terminal motif as observed in avian-adapted HAs. In the case of human receptor contacts, Anh13 has lower contacts with the base region owing to the absence of the S228 residue. Our structural analysis pointed to the H7N9 HA having a substantially lower binding to avian receptors than typical avian-adapted Has, as well as lower binding to human receptors than the human-adapted H3 HAs. Furthermore, the RBS of H7N9 HA is such that a single G228→S amino acid change would modify the interamino acid network in the RBS to position the E190 and S228 residues for optimal contacts with both avian and human receptors. To validate the structural analyses, we analyzed binding of Anh13 to tissue sections, representative of the human respiratory tract, which display the physiologically relevant receptors for influenza A viruses (Figure S2A). Anh13 stained the apical surface and submucosal region of the human trachea, which express glycans known to be receptors of human-adapted viruses (Jayaraman et al., 2012Jayaraman A. Chandrasekaran A. Viswanathan K. Raman R. Fox J.G. Sasisekharan R.

Ebina M. Yamada S. Ono M. Kasai N. Kawaoka Y. Avian flu: influenza virus receptors in the human airway.Nature. 2006; 440: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). However, the intensity and the extent of tracheal apical surface staining by Anh13 were substantially lower than what is typically observed for human-adapted HAs (Figure S2A). Furthermore, Anh13 HA also showed minimal binding to deep-lung alveolar section—a region that is extensively stained by avian-adapted HAs (Figure S2B). In contrast, the G228→S mutant HA showed a dramatic and significant increase in the extent and intensity of staining to apical surface of the tracheal section, including extensive staining of nonciliated goblet cells in a fashion similar to that of other human-adapted HAs and Sambucus nigra agglutinin I (SNA I) (Figures 2 and S2C). Interestingly, the G228→S mutation also substantially increased its binding to the alveolar sections (Figure S2B). These results are consistent with the structural analyses of the RBS features of H7N9 HA.Figure 2Staining of Human Trachea with WT and G228S A/Anhui/1/13 HemagglutininShow full caption(A–D) Human paraffinized tissue sections were stained with recombinant HAs expressed and purified from 293 F cells.

Finally, in the context of H7N9 evolution, two mutations (174S and 226L) appear to be unique to the H7N9 HA sequences. As noted above, the residue at 226 is a critical determinant of the receptor-binding specificity of H7 HA, with human viruses favoring L/I and avian viruses favoring Q. These two positions are also part of a larger cluster of coevolving positions (122A, 174S, 186V, 202V, and 226L), all within the 50–230 HA region, which demarcates the virus from its previous H7 ancestors (see the Experimental Procedures). The above observations indicate that the H7N9 HA has evolved to be distinct from its predecessors. Previous H7 strains carrying single mutations (from the coevolving cluster) are predominantly from the Eurasian lineage, suggesting that viruses from this lineage have higher potential to generate variants when compared to the American lineage (Figure S3). Nucleotide analyses of the RBS-proximal region of HA (residues 50–230 of HA1) of Eurasian sequences from 1902 to 2013 show strong diversifying (positive) selection at 156 (see the Experimental Procedures). The same position has been shown to be under selection pressure in the H1 subtype as well (Li et al., 2011Li W. Shi W. Qiao H. Ho S.Y. Luo A. Zhang Y. Zhu C. Positive selection on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of H1N1 influenza viruses.Virol. J. 2011; 8: 183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, we defined a quantitative metric to compare the antigenicity of two HAs. Briefly, the metric, called antigenic intactness (AI), is directly proportional to the fraction of residues conserved in the immunodominant antigenic sites between two HAs. In our previous work, we showed good agreement between AI values and antigenic relatedness metric computed from ferret antisera HA inhibition (HI) cross-reactivity data (Tharakaraman et al., 2013Tharakaraman K. Raman R. Stebbins N.W. Viswanathan K. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Antigenically intact hemagglutinin in circulating avian and swine influenza viruses and potential for H3N2 pandemic.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that AI values could be applied to predict vaccine-induced cross-reactive antibody responses. Critically, strains that are antigenically related had AI > 80%, whereas strains that are not related to each other had AI < 80% (Tharakaraman et al., 2013Tharakaraman K. Raman R. Stebbins N.W.

https://openalex.org/W2001884049,"In this paper, Korb and colleagues find that Arc can shuttle in and out of the nucleus in an activity-dependent manner. The authors further demonstrate that the nuclear translocation of Arc participates in homeostatic plasticity by promoting the formation of PML nuclear bodies, which in turn decreases GluA1 transcription, eventually contributing to the downscaling of synaptic strength. The activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is required for long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Arc expression is robustly induced by activity, and Arc protein localizes to both active synapses and the nucleus. Whereas its synaptic function has been examined, it is not clear why or how Arc is localized to the nucleus. We found that murine Arc nuclear expression is regulated by synaptic activity in vivo and in vitro. We identified distinct regions of Arc that control its localization, including a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear retention domain and a nuclear export signal. Arc localization to the nucleus promotes an activity-induced increase in the expression of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, which decreases GluA1 (also called Gria1) transcription and synaptic strength. We further show that Arc nuclear localization regulates homeostatic plasticity. Thus, Arc mediates the homeostatic response to increased activity by translocating to the nucleus, increasing promyelocytic leukemia protein expression and decreasing GluA1 transcription, ultimately downscaling synaptic strength."

Uncertainty about whether visual deficits are causal or consequential to reading disability encumbers accurate identification and appropriate treatment of this common learning disability. Using fMRI, we demonstrate in typical readers a relationship between reading ability and activity in area V5/MT during visual motion processing and, as expected, also found lower V5/MT activity for dyslexic children compared to age-matched controls. However, when dyslexics were matched to younger controls on reading ability, no differences emerged, suggesting that weakness in V5/MT may not be causal to dyslexia.

Uncertainty about whether visual deficits are causal or consequential to reading disability encumbers accurate identification and appropriate treatment of this common learning disability. Using fMRI, we demonstrate in typical readers a relationship between reading ability and activity in area V5/MT during visual motion processing and, as expected, also found lower V5/MT activity for dyslexic children compared to age-matched controls. However, when dyslexics were matched to younger controls on reading ability, no differences emerged, suggesting that weakness in V5/MT may not be causal to dyslexia. To further test for causality, dyslexics underwent a phonological-based reading intervention. Surprisingly, V5/MT activity increased along with intervention-driven reading gains, demonstrating that activity here is mobilized through reading. Our results provide strong evidence that visual magnocellular dysfunction is not causal to dyslexia but may instead be consequential to impoverished reading. Developmental dyslexia is a common learning disability affecting 8%–12% (Rutter et al., 2004Rutter M. Caspi A. Fergusson D. Horwood L.J. Goodman R. Maughan B. Moffitt T.E. Meltzer H. Carroll J. Sex differences in developmental reading disability: new findings from 4 epidemiological studies.JAMA. 2004; 291: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) of the population, who, as a manifestation of the disorder, struggle to learn to read accurately and fluently (Peterson and Pennington, 2012Peterson R.L. Pennington B.F. Developmental dyslexia.Lancet. 2012; 379: 1997-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The causal mechanisms remain a matter of debate, and while a linguistically based theory on weakness in phonological coding (the ability to isolate and manipulate sounds within words) stands as the most widely accepted explanation for dyslexics’ reading problems (Vellutino et al., 2004Vellutino F.R. Fletcher J.M. Snowling M.J. Scanlon D.M. Specific reading disability (dyslexia): what have we learned in the past four decades?.J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry. 2004; 45: 2-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar), other theoretical models remain compelling. Specifically, early psychophysical experiments using sinusoidal gratings demonstrated impaired contrast sensitivity functions in dyslexic individuals under conditions of low-spatial and high-temporal frequency (Lovegrove et al., 1980Lovegrove W.J. Bowling A. Badcock D. Blackwood M. Specific reading disability: differences in contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency.Science. 1980; 210: 439-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), properties known to be subserved by neurons in the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; Shapley, 1990Shapley R. Visual sensitivity and parallel retinocortical channels.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1990; 41: 635-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The discovery of size discrepancies in the neurons of the magnocellular layers of the LGN between dyslexics and controls at postmortem (Livingstone et al., 1991Livingstone M.S. Rosen G.D. Drislane F.W. Galaburda A.M. Physiological and anatomical evidence for a magnocellular defect in developmental dyslexia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 7943-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) further fueled the advancement of a transient or magnocellular visual deficit theory of dyslexia (Stein, 2001Stein J. The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia.Dyslexia. 2001; 7: 12-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar; Stein and Walsh, 1997Stein J. Walsh V. To see but not to read; the magnocellular theory of dyslexia.Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 147-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). More recently, this theory has been bolstered by numerous behavioral and brain imaging studies (Boden and Giaschi, 2007Boden C. Giaschi D. M-stream deficits and reading-related visual processes in developmental dyslexia.Psychol. Bull. 2007; 133: 346-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), employing paradigms that rely on the cortical dorsal extensions to the subcortical magnocellular systems (Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982Ungerleider L.G.

Uusitalo M.A. Kiesilä P. Hari R. Visual motion activates V5 in dyslexics.Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of the visual magnocellular deficits in dyslexia is critical for the early identification and successful treatment of reading disability. As a precursor to reading problems, magnocellular integrity could serve as an early screening device for children at risk for dyslexia. As a cause of the reading problems, magnocellular function could become integral to treatment. However, the issue of causality is pivotal, as visual magnocellular dysfunction could be an epiphenomenon of the reading disorder rather than its cause. Demonstration of causality has been practiced in studies investigating phonological deficits in dyslexia and is best achieved via a two-step process (Goswami, 2003Goswami U. Why theories about developmental dyslexia require developmental designs.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2003; 7: 534-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). First, a reading level-match design is used, whereby dyslexic children are not only contrasted to chronological age-matched controls, but also younger normal readers matched to the dyslexics on reading level. Deficits manifested in the dyslexics compared to both the age-matched and reading level-matched groups would suggest a causal role in dyslexia (because the dyslexics are impaired given both their developmental and reading level). This can then be tested further by assessing the efficacy of an intervention addressing the same deficit. Such studies (behavioral and more recently, brain imaging) have been used to demonstrate not only that there is a causal relationship of phonological awareness on reading (Bradley and Bryant, 1983Bradley L. Bryant P.E. Categorizing sounds and learning to read—a causal connection.Nature. 1983; 301: 419-421Crossref Scopus (2083) Google Scholar; Frith and Snowling, 1983Frith U. Snowling M.J.

Here we first confirmed the existence of a relationship between reading ability and brain activity in area V5/MT during the perception of visual motion, allowing us to establish agreement with prior studies. Specifically, earlier work reported correlations between reading aptitude and behavioral performance on magnocellular visual tasks (Talcott et al., 2000Talcott J.B. Witton C. McLean M.F. Hansen P.C. Rees A. Green G.G. Stein J.F. Dynamic sensory sensitivity and children’s word decoding skills.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1998; 8: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and parallel work has examined the relationship between reading proficiency and brain activity collected during magnocellular tasks (Ben-Shachar et al., 2007Ben-Shachar M. Dougherty R.F. Deutsch G.K. Wandell B.A. Contrast responsivity in MT+ correlates with phonological awareness and reading measures in children.Neuroimage. 2007; 37: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Demb et al., 1997Demb J.B.

USA. 1997; 94: 13363-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The latter studies (Ben-Shachar et al., 2007Ben-Shachar M. Dougherty R.F. Deutsch G.K. Wandell B.A. Contrast responsivity in MT+ correlates with phonological awareness and reading measures in children.Neuroimage. 2007; 37: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Demb et al., 1997Demb J.B.

USA. 1997; 94: 13363-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) employed sinusoidal grating stimuli, while the former behavioral studies often employed tasks involving coherent motion random dot kinematogram stimuli. Our first experiment demonstrated consistency with this literature as we found (1) activity in area V5/MT in response to the perception of visual motion in a group of adults and children with normal reading skills and (2) a correlation between the strength of this V5/MT signal and reading proficiency as measured on standardized tests. Having verified this relationship for our task, we then used the same task to compare activity in area V5/MT between dyslexic children and their age-matched as well as reading level-matched controls. Between-group differences for both types of comparisons would suggest a causal role for the visual magnocellular deficit and pave the way for an intervention study that trains the magnocellular visual system, with the goal of improving reading skills. However, our study, while showing differences between dyslexics and controls matched on age, failed to demonstrate differences for the reading level-match comparison, thereby instead suggesting the possibility that altered visual magnocellular function represents an epiphenomenon of dyslexia. That is, magnocellular dysfunction may be a side effect of dyslexia, emerging along with other deficits that are the primary cause of the reading problem (Eden and Zeffiro, 1998Eden G.F. Zeffiro T.A. Neural systems affected in developmental dyslexia revealed by functional neuroimaging.Neuron. 1998; 21: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; Ramus, 2004Ramus F. Neurobiology of dyslexia: a reinterpretation of the data.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 720-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that magnocellular dysfunction is not actually related to dyslexia per se but merely reflects magnocellular function in the context of a person’s reading experience. In the case of dyslexia, impoverished visual magnocellular function may simply be the effect of less reading experience. This hypothesis seems reasonable given that visual motion perception improves with age in typically reading children at a time when reading acquisition occurs (Boets et al., 2011Boets B. Vandermosten M. Cornelissen P. Wouters J. Ghesquière P. Coherent motion sensitivity and reading development in the transition from prereading to reading stage.Child Dev. 2011; 82: 854-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and children exhibit poorer performance on these tasks when compared to adults (Boets et al., 2011Boets B. Vandermosten M. Cornelissen P. Wouters J. Ghesquière P.

Neville H.J. Asynchronies in the development of electrophysiological responses to motion and color.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2004; 16: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that learning to read may actually “mobilize” the visual magnocellular system. In our third experiment, we tested this specific hypothesis by providing a phonological-based reading intervention (rather than a magnocellular-based intervention) and found that in addition to the expected behavioral gains in phonological awareness and reading, children with dyslexia showed an increase in V5/MT activity after the intervention. Together, these results demonstrate that the visual magnocellular dysfunction measured via activity in V5/MT reported in dyslexia by us (Eden et al., 1996Eden G.F. VanMeter J.W. Rumsey J.M.

Thirty typically reading individuals participated in the first experiment and included 13 females and 17 males with an age span of 7.3 to 31.5 years (mean ± SD: 22.0 ± 6.1). Subjects were selected such that real word reading (Woodcock-Johnson III, WJ-III; Woodcock et al., 2001Woodcock R.W. McGrew K.S. Mather N. Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. Riverside Publishing, Itasca2001Google Scholar; Word Identification, WID) and pseudoword reading (WJ-III Word Attack, WA) were largely representative of the normal range (WID: range: 94–120; mean ± SD: 109 ± 7; WA: range: 93–120; mean ± SD: 106 ± 8). Their intelligence also was within or above the normal range, as measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler, 1999Wechsler D. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). The Psychological Corporation, San Antonio1999Google Scholar; full-scale IQ: range: 95–137; mean ± SD: 121 ± 9). fMRI data were collected during a motion direction detection task (Motion) and a static density detection control task (Static). We identified the V5/MT region of interest (ROI) bilaterally in each subject individually via the contrast of Motion versus Static (see Experimental Procedures for details) and correlated average percent signal change within these subject-specific regions for this contrast with standardized measures of real and pseudoword reading. Average Talairach coordinates of area V5/MT in these subjects were: left: −46 ± 5, −71 ± 5, 9 ± 4; right: 47 ± 5, −67 ± 5, 7 ± 5, similar to those reported in previous studies (Dumoulin et al., 2000Dumoulin S.O.

Activity in bilateral V5/MT was significantly correlated with age-referenced, standardized scores for both WID (left V5/MT: r = 0.46; p = 0.009; right V5/MT: r = 0.52; p = 0.003; two-tailed; Figure 1A) and WA (left V5/MT: r = 0.41; p = 0.024; right V5/MT: r = 0.61; p = 0.0003; two-tailed; Figure 1B). Similar correlation analyses with Static versus a resting baseline (Fixation) condition revealed no relationships with these measures of reading (all p > 0.1), providing further evidence for the specificity of the relationship between motion perception and reading ability independent of age. All subjects performed with high accuracy (ACC) on the in-scanner Motion (ACC mean ± SD: 98.8% ± 2.5%; reaction time [RT] mean ± SD: 1,079 ± 351 ms) and Static (ACC mean ± SD: 99.7% ± 1.0%; RT mean ± SD: 857 ± 203 ms) tasks.

Fourteen dyslexic and 14 control children were matched on chronological age, and 12 dyslexic and 12 control children were matched on reading level (Table 1). Between-group differences in behavior between the dyslexics and the controls for both the age-matched and reading level-matched comparisons were assessed via two-sample t tests (two-tailed). As expected, for the age-matched group comparisons, the dyslexic group (Dysage) had significantly poorer reading skills (t(26) = 11.00; p < 0.001) than their typically reading (Conage) counterparts (as measured by the WJ-III WID), despite being of the same chronological age. Also, as is inherent in the design, the dyslexics in the reading level comparison (Dysread) were significantly older (t(22) = −4.48; p < 0.001) than their reading level-matched controls (Conread). Studies in dyslexia typically match groups on performance IQ, as the verbal IQ component of the full-scale IQ is influenced by reading. All children had normal or above normal performance IQ scores on the WASI. For the critical comparison, dyslexics versus controls matched for reading level, the groups were matched on performance IQ (t(22) = 1.38; p = 0.185). This was not the case for the dyslexic and control groups matched on chronological age (t(26) = 4.44; p < 0.001), and while this is less important for the question at hand, we nevertheless examined all behavioral and functional analyses on a subset of these groups matched for performance IQ (six individuals per subgroup: controls: mean ± SD = 111 ± 5.0; dyslexics: 106 ± 4.3; two-tailed test: t(10) = 1.93; p = 0.083), to verify that all results reported here were independent of this IQ difference.Table 1Subject Demographic Information and In-Scanner Performance: Experiment 2ConageDysagep valueConreadDysreadp valueN1414–1212–Sex (female/male)5/95/9–7/56/6–Age9.1 ± 2.29.9 ± 1.30.2287.5 ± 0.910.4 ± 2.1<0.001PIQ120 ± 1698 ± 10<0.001107 ± 14101 ± 9.00.185WJ-III Word ID∗Woodcock-Johnson III Word Identification: standardized scores are presented for age-matched groups, while grade equivalencies are presented for reading level-matched groups.121 ± 1077 ± 11<0.0013.4 ± 1.43.1 ± 2.00.657Motion accuracy98.9% ± 2.9%89.9% ± 18%0.09389.8% ± 15%89.5% ± 20%0.969Static accuracy98.2% ± 4.2%96.1% ± 11%0.48894.2% ± 15%96.3% ± 12%0.702Motion − Static accuracy+Accuracy and reaction time are presented for the difference of Motion − Static, consistent with the comparison of these conditions for statistical map generation for the identification of activity i"
https://openalex.org/W1985346521,"Many feeding behaviours are the result of stereotyped, organized sequences of motor patterns. These patterns have been the subject of neuroethological studies, such as electrophysiological characterization of neurons governing prey capture in toads. However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of the functional role of these neurons, a common problem for vertebrate organisms. Complexities involved in studies of whole-animal behaviour can be resolved in Drosophila, in which remote activation of brain cells by genetic means enables us to examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify neurons that govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly target and manipulate these neurons to characterize their function. Here we show neurons that generate the feeding motor program in Drosophila. We carried out an unbiased screen using remote neuronal activation and identified a critical pair of brain cells that induces the entire feeding sequence when activated. These 'feeding neurons' (here abbreviated to Fdg neurons for brevity) are also essential for normal feeding as their suppression or ablation eliminates sugar-induced feeding behaviour. Activation of a single Fdg neuron induces asymmetric feeding behaviour and ablation of a single Fdg neuron distorts the sugar-induced feeding behaviour to become asymmetric, indicating the direct role of these neurons in shaping motor-program execution. Furthermore, recording neuronal activity and calcium imaging simultaneously during feeding behaviour reveals that the Fdg neurons respond to food presentation, but only in starved flies. Our results demonstrate that Fdg neurons operate firmly within the sensorimotor watershed, downstream of sensory and metabolic cues and at the top of the feeding motor hierarchy, to execute the decision to feed."
https://openalex.org/W2006838271,"For decades, it has been hypothesized that gene regulation has had a central role in human evolution, yet much remains unknown about the genome-wide impact of regulatory mutations. Here we use whole-genome sequences and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing data to demonstrate that natural selection has profoundly influenced human transcription factor binding sites since the divergence of humans from chimpanzees 4-6 million years ago. Our analysis uses a new probabilistic method, called INSIGHT, for measuring the influence of selection on collections of short, interspersed noncoding elements. We find that, on average, transcription factor binding sites have experienced somewhat weaker selection than protein-coding genes. However, the binding sites of several transcription factors show clear evidence of adaptation. Several measures of selection are strongly correlated with predicted binding affinity. Overall, regulatory elements seem to contribute substantially to both adaptive substitutions and deleterious polymorphisms with key implications for human evolution and disease."

The discovery that somatic cells can be converted into iPSCs by defined factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar) allows us to create patient-specific stem cells for regenerative therapy. However, there is relatively little data explaining how reprogramming factors remodel chromatin structure and activate the network of genes related to pluripotency. Moreover, the conversion of somatic cells to iPSCs is extremely inefficient; >99% of the transfected or treated donor cells are not converted into iPSCs (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A.

To discover potential epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the low efficiency of iPSC induction, we constructed polycistronic viral vectors containing OCT4-SOX2-KLF4-c-MYC-EGFP (OSKME) and OCT4-SOX2-NANOG-EGFP (OSNE) (Figure S1A available online) for inducing reprogramming into iPSCs in human fibroblasts. After their transfection with viral factors, we found that virtually all of the fibroblasts were fluorescence positive (Figure 1A, top middle panel), demonstrating efficient delivery of the viral vectors. Western blot demonstrated that each transfected gene produced a protein of the predicted size (Figure S1A). After transfer onto MEF feeder cells, some EGFP-positive cells developed into iPSCs. In HSF1 fibroblasts that had been passed for more than 15 passages, however, we very rarely observed the formation of iPSC colonies (Figure 1A, bottom middle panel). In conjunction with previous reports (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A. Yabuuchi A. Huo H. Ince T.A. Lerou P.H. Lensch M.W. Daley G.Q.

Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar), it is clear that in the vast majority of infected cells, successful expression of the defined factors did not lead to cell reprogramming. We used EGFP fluorescence-sorting to isolate “unreprogrammed cells” (URCs) that expressed the defined factors but were morphologically similar to the parent fibroblasts. By comparing them with the characterized iPSCs (Figures S1B–S1F), we proposed to identify the epigenetic barrier accounting for the failure of URCs to reprogram. OCT4 is a master regulator of the molecular circuitry that regulates embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation and differentiation. OCT4 protein contains a POU DNA binding domain and two proline-rich domains (Imagawa et al., 1991Imagawa M. Miyamoto A. Shirakawa M. Hamada H. Muramatsu M.

Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). We first used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether the virus-derived factors bind to their target genes. We found that in URCs, there was an enrichment of OCT4 binding to its own promoter (autopromoter binding) (Figure 1B, left top panel, lanes 3 and 6) as well as to the SOX2 and NANOG promoters (Figures S1G–S1H). This promoter binding was comparable to that observed in iPSCs (lanes 5 and 8) and in the ESC line H14 (lane 2). Similarly, we found that the viral NANOG proteins derived from the OSNE retroviral vector also bound equally well to their downstream target gene (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG) promoters. ChIP-qPCR data confirmed that there was enrichment of the virally expressed OCT4 and NANOG proteins bound to the three target gene promoters, but that there was no binding to the off-target site (Figures 1B, S1G, and S1H, right panels). Taken together, these data suggest that binding of virally expressed factors to the downstream target genes is not a limiting factor in the iPSC induction. We then examined if the binding of virus-derived factors could activate the endogenous target genes, an essential step for successful iPSC induction. To distinguish the virus-derived expression from endogenous gene expression, the mRNA of the virally transduced (exogenous) factors was measured by specific primer sets that cover the viral T2A sequence. The expression of the endogenous genes that are related to cell pluripotency, on the other hand, was quantitated by primer sets covering the untranslated region (UTR) RNA, which is absent in the virally induced transgenic cDNA. Both the isolated iPSCs and URCs expressed the viral transgenes. However, endogenous OCT4 expression, a key factor for iPSC induction, was detected in the iPSCs, but it was not detected at all in the URCs (Figure 1C). Similar results were also observed for the other two pluripotency genes SOX2 and NANOG. Thus, it appears that even though the virus-derived factors bound to their target promoters, they failed to induce transcription from these genes, suggesting that the activation of endogenous stemness genes may represent a critical reprogramming block preventing iPSC generation. To determine if epigenetic modifications, such as the remodeling of local chromatin structure, may be required for iPSC induction, we focused on the OCT4 locus to address the mechanism underlying the failed activation of endogenous OCT4 in URCs. It has recently been shown that DNA looping orchestrated by the cohesin-mediator complex determines the pluripotency of the stem cells (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). We used chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology (Dekker et al., 2002Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Capturing chromosome conformation.Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar) to examine whether a different chromatin structure surrounding the OCT4 gene is present in iPSCs compared to URCs. In iPSCs, the OCT4 promoter DNA interacted frequently with a DNA region that is located 10 kb downstream of the promoter (Figure 2B, right panel, lanes 1 and 2 and qPCR data). These chromatin interactions were very rarely detected in URCs or in fibroblast control cells. We also used a quantitative PCR approach to compare the 3C interaction in the OCT4 locus and a downstream off-target site (A8). For all loci we tested, there was increased interaction between the core promoter and the downstream enhancer (A3–A7) in ESCs and iPSCs (Figure 2B, left panel). We did not detect an interaction between the OCT4 promoter and the upstream sequence where the putative mouse Oct4 enhancer was reported (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), suggesting a species-specific interaction in the human OCT4. To address the role of the downstream DNA sequence, we cloned a 2.1 kb OCT4 fragment (Figure 2C, top panel) and tested its enhancer activity. As seen in Figure 2C, the 2.1 kb DNA significantly augments promoter activity as measured by luciferase activity. This fragment has much stronger enhancer activity than the enhancer that was identified in the upstream mouse Oct4 promoter (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) (Figure S2D). These data indicate that intrachromosomal looping helps hinge the downstream enhancer in close proximity to the OCT4 promoter, where it activates endogenous OCT4 as an essential step in iPSC induction. In URCs, where the intrachromosomal loop is absent, endogenous OCT4 cannot be activated because the promoter and the downstream enhancer are no longer juxtaposed. Using the same approach, we also detected intrachromosomal interactions between promoter DNAs and downstream enhancer sequences in both the SOX2 and NANOG genes in the iPSCs, but not in the URCs and the uninfected fibroblasts (Figures S2A and S2B). These data demonstrate that the formation of intrachromosomal loops in these stemness genes may constitute a critical epigenetic barrier that must be overcome for cell reprogramming to occur. In order to determine which trans chromatin modifying factors coordinate this chromatin looping, we focused on cohesin and mediator because both factor complexes have been reported to mediate chromatin looping in mouse ESCs (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Both MED12 and SMC1 (components of the mediator and cohesin complexes, respectively) bound to the OCT4 promoter and the downstream enhancer (Figure 2D) in iPSCs, but not in URCs, indicating that these factors may play a role in the formation or maintenance of the intrachromosomal interaction required for the activation of endogenous OCT4. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that SMC1 also interacted directly with MED12 (Figure S2E). Interestingly, we found that SMC1 is differentially expressed, with abundance in the order of human ESC line H14 > iPSC > URC > fibroblasts (Figure S2F). Thus, changes in the expression of SMC1 and, potentially, several other chromatin-binding factors may be needed for the formation of intrachromosomal loops in iPSC induction. We used RNAi to knock down SMC1 expression in iPSCs (Figure 2E, left panel). SMC1 knockdown abolished the intrachromosomal loops (right panel), suggesting a critical role of SMC1 in orchestrating the local OCT4 chromatin structure required for induced pluripotency. We found that knockdown of SMC1 in iPSCs also triggered cell differentiation (Figure S2G, top panel). Using the TurboGFP fluorescence as the tracker in shRNA vector, we observed that SMC1-knockdown H14 ESCs lost the capacity for self-renewal (Figure 2F). The SMC1-knockdown fibroblasts could no longer be reprogrammed into iPSCs (Figure S2G, bottom panel). Together, these data suggest that cellular reprogramming requires the formation of SMC1-dependent intrachromosomal looping. We also virally transfected SMC1 in fibroblasts and in URCs that expressed OSKM factors (Figure S2I, left panel). However, we found that SMC1 expression for 2 weeks was not able to restore the intrachromosomal looping (right panel, lanes 2 and 5). The data suggest that other chromatin-remodeling factors expressed during iPSC induction may also be necessary for the formation of intrachromosomal loops. A recent study published online while this paper was in review (Apostolou et al., 2013Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Walsh R.M. Bar-Nur O. Stadtfeld M. Cheloufi S. Stuart H.T. Polo J.M. Ohsumi T.K. Borowsky M.L. et al.Genome-wide chromatin interactions of the Nanog locus in pluripotency, differentiation, and reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) also demonstrates that several chromatin factors, including cohesin, Mediator, and pluripotency factors, are critical for induction and maintenance of pluripotency by mediating a pluripotency-specific chromatin interaction network in the NANOG locus. Future studies are needed to determine if overexpression of SMC1 in OSKM-transfected fibroblasts or in URCs for a longer period of time could induce intrachromosomal looping and thus enhance the efficiency of iPSC induction. It is also interesting to note that in URCs, where SMC1 is expressed at a very low level (Figure S2F, lane 2), the virally expressed OCT4 still binds to its target promoters (Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 6), suggesting that cohesin may not be necessary for the viral OCT4 binding to the target promoter. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decreased expression of SMC1 may also affect cell division, leading to a decrease in cell reprogramming. An enhancer deletion study may be useful to examine if the SMC1-mediated chromatin loop is a prerequisite for the induced pluripotency. We suggest a model whereby an existing intrachromosomal loop between the enhancer and promoter of certain stemness genes such as OCT4 is needed for a cell to be transformed to pluripotency (Figure S2J). A certain number of cells may undergo nuclear remodeling either spontaneously or during reprogramming. This dynamic autoremodeling builds the promoter/enhancer intrachromosomal loop and thus makes cells more susceptible to reprogramming than cells that do not demonstrate these loops. In agreement with this notion is the finding that donor cell types influence reprogramming. The efficiency of iPSC generation differs dramatically among cell types used for reprogramming (Eminli et al., 2008Eminli S. Utikal J. Arnold K. Jaenisch R. Hochedlinger K.

Theunissen T.W. Smith A. Promotion of reprogramming to ground state pluripotency by signal inhibition.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e253Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Generally speaking, a less differentiated cell is reprogrammed more easily than a well differentiated cell. It is possible that these less differentiated cells may have a larger subpopulation of cells that undergo the autoremodeling process, leading to the formation of intrachromosomal loops that activate pluripotent genes. In summary, cell reprogramming factors require the formation of intrachromosomal loops that juxtapose the enhancer and promoter regions to reactivate the endogenous pluripotent genes. The participation of SMC1 and other chromatin-modifying factors is needed to coordinate these local intrachromosomal loops. Unlike conventional somatic cell nuclear transfer and natural fertilization, where the cell undergoes chromatin decondensation and remodeling before it transits into the pluripotent stage (Burns et al., 2003Burns K.H. Viveiros M.M. Ren Y. Wang P. DeMayo F.J. Frail D.E. Eppig J.J. Matzuk M.M.

Changing cell fate by nuclear reprogramming.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the induction of iPSCs by defined factors is a shortcut compared with these conventional approaches, and omits the usual process of chromatin remodeling, a key factor that affects iPSC induction. Thus, further studies should be focused on the identification of other factors that can organize chromatin loops in order to promote iPSC induction.

https://openalex.org/W1996709598,"Spemann’s organizer plays a key role in dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning in the amphibian embryo by secreting diffusible proteins such as Chordin, an antagonist to ventralizing bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). The DV patterning is so robust that an amphibian embryo with its ventral half surgically removed can develop into a smaller but proportionally patterned larva. Here, we show that this robust patterning depends on facilitated Chordin degradation and requires the expression of the Chordin-proteinase inhibitor Sizzled on the opposite side. Sizzled, which is stable and diffuses widely along the DV axis, stabilizes Chordin and expands its distribution in the ventral direction. This expanded Chordin distribution, in turn, limits BMP-dependent Sizzled production, forming an axis-wide feedback loop for shaping Chordin’s activity. Using bisection assays, we demonstrate that Chordin degradation is dynamically controlled by embryo-size-coupled Sizzled accumulation. We propose a scaling model that enables the DV pattern to adjust proportionally to embryonic axis size."

How these substrate proteins are encapsulated within the GroEL-GroES cavity is poorly understood. Using symmetry-free, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have characterized a chemically modified mutant of GroEL (EL43Py) that is trapped at a normally transient stage of substrate protein encapsulation. We show that the symmetric pattern of the GroEL subunits is broken as the GroEL cis-ring apical domains reorient to accommodate the simultaneous binding of GroES and an incompletely folded substrate protein (RuBisCO). The collapsed RuBisCO folding intermediate binds to the lower segment of two apical domains, as well as to the normally unstructured GroEL C-terminal tails. A comparative structural analysis suggests that the allosteric transitions leading to substrate protein release and folding involve concerted shifts of GroES and the GroEL apical domains and C-terminal tails."

The X-ray structures of Rif1 and Rif2 bound to the Rap1 C-terminal domain and that of the Rif1 C terminus are presented.

Although considerable progress has been made in the understanding of self-renewal of embryonic stem and iPS cells, much less is known about the intracellular signalling proteins that regulate self-renewal of stem and progenitor cells in adult animals. Under stress conditions such as acute blood loss or chronic anaemia, glucocorticoids trigger self-renewal of erythroid burst-forming unit–erythrocyte (BFU–E) progenitors in the spleen, leading to increased numbers of self-renewal divisions. Harvey Lodish and colleagues have now identified the RNA-binding protein ZFP36l2 as a transcriptional target of the glucocorticoid receptor in BFU–Es, and show that it is involved in the process of erythroid cell expansion following exposure to glucocorticoids. Stem cells and progenitors in many lineages undergo self-renewing divisions, but the extracellular and intracellular proteins that regulate this process are largely unknown. Glucocorticoids stimulate red blood cell formation by promoting self-renewal of early burst-forming unit–erythroid (BFU–E) progenitors1,2,3,4. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 is a transcriptional target of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in BFU–Es and is required for BFU–E self-renewal. ZFP36L2 is normally downregulated during erythroid differentiation from the BFU–E stage, but its expression is maintained by all tested GR agonists that stimulate BFU–E self-renewal, and the GR binds to several potential enhancer regions of ZFP36L2. Knockdown of ZFP36L2 in cultured BFU–E cells did not affect the rate of cell division but disrupted glucocorticoid-induced BFU–E self-renewal, and knockdown of ZFP36L2 in transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion of erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction of anaemia by phenylhydrazine treatment. ZFP36L2 preferentially binds to messenger RNAs that are induced or maintained at high expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation and negatively regulates their expression levels. ZFP36L2 therefore functions as part of a molecular switch promoting BFU–E self-renewal and a subsequent increase in the total numbers of colony-forming unit–erythroid (CFU–E) progenitors and erythroid cells that are generated."

For the first time in the history of neuroscience, it is feasible to study the behavior of live neurons from patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia. In this Perspective, we will discuss reprogramming technology in the context of its potential use for modeling and treating neurological and psychiatric diseases and will highlight areas of caution and opportunities for improvement.

In this Perspective, we will discuss reprogramming technology in the context of its potential use for modeling and treating neurological and psychiatric diseases and will highlight areas of caution and opportunities for improvement. Widespread use of reprogramming and programming technology is challenging our view of differentiated cells as irreversible entities. From the early works of Briggs and King (Briggs and King, 1952Briggs R. King T.J. Transplantation of living nuclei From blastula cells into enucleated frogs’ eggs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The impact of this technology has been most strongly felt in the neurosciences. While much work remains to be done to improve and refine the technology, attempts to apply these techniques to the clinic are already underway. One could argue that it is too early to consider translational research because much more basic understanding of its implications is required, but some of the applied approaches are pushing the field forward, resulting in the need for better systematic safety and reliability standards. Undoubtedly, much more work is needed to optimize iPSC technology. In this Perspective, we will discuss reprogramming technologies and their potential uses for modeling and treating neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as highlighting areas of caution and opportunities for improvement. Soon after human cells were first reprogrammed (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

From these studies of neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric diseases, a general pattern has emerged regarding the inability of neurons to establish proper connections. Specifically, inadequate neuronal maturation, synaptic deficiency, and failed connectivity have been observed in many of the early-onset and neurodevelopmental diseases modeled so far (examples: familial dysautonomia [FD] [Lee et al., 2009Lee G. Papapetrou E.P. Kim H. Chambers S.M. Tomishima M.J. Fasano C.A. Ganat Y.M. Menon J. Shimizu F.

On the other hand, human iPSCs from patients with neurodegenerative disorders, while considered to be suitable for modeling neurodegenerative disorders, do not always exhibit the neuronal maturation and network defects that are observed in vivo. It is possible that this apparent identification of synaptic deficits may be in part because these are the measurements that have been focused on so far. In neurodegenerative diseases and proteopathies, neuronal toxicity due to increased sensitivity to oxidative damage and proteasome inhibition seems to be more prevalent than strictly synaptic deficits. Examples of these diseases include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Mitne-Neto et al., 2011Mitne-Neto M. Machado-Costa M. Marchetto M.C. Bengtson M.H. Joazeiro C.A. Tsuda H. Bellen H.J.

As the number of patients and types of neurological diseases being modeled increases, new patterns will emerge that could aid in the development of earlier diagnostic tools and facilitate effective drug design. Significant interest is growing among clinicians and the pharmaceutical industries as additional neurological conditions are proposed to be modeled using iPSCs. Attractive candidate diseases include, but are not restricted to, major depression, migraine, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and idiopathic autism.Table 1Neurological Syndromes for which iPSCs Have Been DerivedDiseaseGenetic DefectNeurological SymptomsPhenotype in hiPSC-Derived Neural ProgenyTherapeutic Approach: Genetic Manipulation or DrugReferenceAdrenoleukodystrophyABCD1Demyelination and central and peripheric nervous system progressive loss of functionVery long chain fatty acid level was increased in oligodendrocytesLovastatin, 4-phenylbutyrate(Jang et al., 2011Jang J.

However, these approaches are of limited use for modeling sporadic cases of diseases or complex neuropsychiatric disorders where there is no clear genetic etiology. It is conceivable that identifying protocols that generate lineage-specific cells will solve this problem by allowing investigators to monitor the differentiation process more specifically. Defining and consistently obtaining the disease-relevant neural cells at comparable levels of maturation should greatly reduce the phenotypical variability and highlight pertinent disease characteristics. Assessing neuronal network connectivity formation is important for understanding neuronal communication imbalance in disease but it can be a challenging task because as a general rule the right subtype of neurons and the specific maturation time are not represented in the dish at appropriate levels. To that end, promoter-bashing technology may aid in generating the desired populations of neurons that are directly involved in the disease being studied (for example, Hb9-positive cells for disease involving alpha motor neurons such as ALS [Dimos et al., 2008Dimos J.T.

https://openalex.org/W2002246289,"Of the factors governing human-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic avian-adapted H5N1 virus, the most critical is the acquisition of mutations on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to ""quantitatively switch"" its binding from avian to human glycan receptors. Here, we describe a structural framework that outlines a necessary set of H5 HA receptor-binding site (RBS) features required for the H5 HA to quantitatively switch its preference to human receptors. We show here that the same RBS HA mutations that lead to aerosol transmission of A/Vietnam/1203/04 and A/Indonesia/5/05 viruses, when introduced in currently circulating H5N1, do not lead to a quantitative switch in receptor preference. We demonstrate that HAs from circulating clades require as few as a single base pair mutation to quantitatively switch their binding to human receptors. The mutations identified by this study can be used to monitor the emergence of strains having human-to-human transmission potential."
https://openalex.org/W2025965227,"Active force generation by outer hair cells (OHCs) underlies amplification and frequency tuning in the mammalian cochlea but whether such a process exists in nonmammals is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hair cells of the chicken auditory papilla possess an electromechanical force generator in addition to active hair bundle motion due to mechanotransducer channel gating. The properties of the force generator, its voltage dependence and susceptibility to salicylate, as well as an associated chloride-sensitive nonlinear capacitance, suggest involvement of the chicken homolog of prestin, the OHC motor protein. The presence of chicken prestin in the hair cell lateral membrane was confirmed by immunolabeling studies. The hair bundle and prestin motors together create sufficient force to produce fast lateral displacements of the tectorial membrane. Our results imply that the first use of prestin as a motor protein occurred early in amniote evolution and was not a mammalian invention as is usually supposed."
https://openalex.org/W2161603700,"Recent evidence suggests a link between statins and telomere biology. Whether statin treatment may modulate telomerase activity and affect telomere erosion rate is unknown. We aimed at investigating the potential impact of statin therapy on peripheral blood mononuclear cells telomerase activity, its implication on LTL variability, and its association with telomere shortening rates along with aging. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 230 subjects (age range: 30-86 y) stratified according to statins treatment. LTL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and telomerase activity by a PCR-ELISA protocol. Subjects on statin treatment showed higher telomerase activity (P<0.0001) and longer LTL (P= 0.028) levels compared to the nonstatin group. Statin therapy was associated with higher telomerase activity independently of multiple covariates, including age, gender, smoking habits, lipid, systemic inflammation, glucose, and blood pressure levels (P=0.019). Indeed, subjects on statin treatment showed significant lower telomere erosion along with aging. Every 1 y increment in age, LTL decreases by 0.058 Kb in no statin and 0.033 Kb in statin groups, respectively, as well as the major difference in telomere attrition between groups was found after the age of 65 yr (P<0.0001). In summary, statins, modulating telomerase activity, affect telomere erosion along with aging.—Boccardi, V., Barbieri, M., Rizzo, M.

https://openalex.org/W2051052284,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized in part by the loss of striatopallidal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). Expression of BDNF and noggin via intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery in an adenoviral vector triggers the addition of new neurons to the neostriatum. In this study, we found that a single ICV injection of the adeno-associated viruses AAV4-BDNF and AAV4-noggin triggered the sustained recruitment of new MSNs in both wild-type and R6/2 mice, a model of HD. Mice treated with AAV4-BDNF/noggin or with BDNF and noggin proteins actively recruited subependymal progenitor cells to form new MSNs that matured and achieved circuit integration. Importantly, the AAV4-BDNF/noggin-treated R6/2 mice showed delayed deterioration of motor function and substantially increased survival. In addition, squirrel monkeys given ICV injections of adenoviral BDNF/noggin showed similar addition of striatal neurons. Induced neuronal addition may therefore represent a promising avenue for disease amelioration in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2040506298,"Reverse signaling via members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily controls multiple aspects of immune function. Here we document TNFα reverse signaling in the nervous system to our knowledge for the first time and show that it has a crucial role in establishing sympathetic innervation. During postnatal development, sympathetic axons express TNFα as they grow and branch in their target tissues, which in turn express TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). In culture, soluble forms of TNFR1 act directly on postnatal sympathetic axons to promote growth and branching by a mechanism that depends on membrane-integrated TNFα and on downstream activation of ERK. Sympathetic innervation density is substantially lower in several tissues in postnatal and adult mice lacking either TNFα or TNFR1. These findings reveal that target-derived TNFR1 acts as a reverse-signaling ligand for membrane-integrated TNFα to promote growth and branching of sympathetic axons."
https://openalex.org/W1981859071,"Understanding the fetal hepatic niche is essential for optimizing the generation of functional hepatocyte-like cells (hepatic cells) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we show that KDR (VEGFR2/FLK-1), previously assumed to be mostly restricted to mesodermal lineages, marks a hESC-derived hepatic progenitor. hESC-derived endoderm cells do not express KDR but, when cultured in media supporting hepatic differentiation, generate KDR+ hepatic progenitors and KDR- hepatic cells. KDR+ progenitors require active KDR signaling both to instruct their own differentiation into hepatic cells and to non-cell-autonomously support the functional maturation of cocultured KDR- hepatic cells. Analysis of human fetal livers suggests that similar progenitors are present in human livers. Lineage tracing in mice provides in vivo evidence of a KDR+ hepatic progenitor for fetal hepatoblasts, adult hepatocytes, and adult cholangiocytes. Altogether, our findings reveal that KDR is a conserved marker for endoderm-derived hepatic progenitors and a functional receptor instructing early liver development."

https://openalex.org/W2134108166,"The functional significance of the molecular swivel at the head-to-tail overlapping ends of contiguous tropomyosin (Tm) dimers in striated muscle is unknown. Contractile measurements were made in muscle fibers from transgenic (TG) mouse hearts that expressed a mutant α-Tm (TmH276N). We also reconstituted mouse cardiac troponin T (McTnT) N-terminal deletion mutants, McTnT1–44Δ and McTnT45–74Δ, into muscle fibers from TmH276N. For controls, we used the wild-type (WT) McTnT because altered effects could be correlated with the mutant forms of McTnT. TmH276N slowed crossbridge (XB) detachment rate (g) by 19%. McTnT1-44Δ attenuated Ca2+-activated maximal tension against TmWT (36%) and TmH276N (38%), but sped g only against TmH276N by 35%. The rate of tension redevelopment decreased (17%) only in McTnT1–44Δ + TmH276N fibers. McTnT45–74Δ attenuated tension (19%) and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50=5.93 vs. 6.00 in the control fibers) against TmH276N, but not against TmWT background. Thus, altered XB cycling kinetics decreased the fraction of strongly bound XBs in McTnT1-44Δ + TmH276N fibers, whereas diminished thin-filament cooperativity attenuated tension in McTnT45-74Δ + TmH276N fibers. In summary, our study is the first to show that the interplay between the N terminus of cTnT and the overlapping ends of contiguous Tm effectuates different states of Tm on the actin filament. —Mamidi, R., Michael, J.
