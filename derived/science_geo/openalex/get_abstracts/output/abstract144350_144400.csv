https://openalex.org/W2108408221,"Histone H3 (H3) phosphorylation at Ser<sup>10</sup> occurs during mitosis in eukaryotes and was recently shown to play an important role in chromosome condensation in <i>Tetrahymena</i>. When producing monoclonal antibodies that recognize glial fibrillary acidic protein phosphorylation at Thr<sup>7</sup>, we obtained some monoclonal antibodies that cross-reacted with early mitotic chromosomes. They reacted with 15-kDa phosphoprotein specifically in mitotic cell lysate. With microsequencing, this phosphoprotein was proved to be H3. Mutational analysis revealed that they recognized H3 Ser<sup>28</sup>phosphorylation. Then we produced a monoclonal antibody, HTA28, using a phosphopeptide corresponding to phosphorylated H3 Ser<sup>28</sup>. This antibody specifically recognized the phosphorylation of H3 Ser<sup>28</sup> but not that of glial fibrillary acidic protein Thr<sup>7</sup>. Immunocytochemical studies with HTA28 revealed that Ser<sup>28</sup> phosphorylation occurred in chromosomes predominantly during early mitosis and coincided with the initiation of mitotic chromosome condensation. Biochemical analyses using<sup>32</sup>P-labeled mitotic cells also confirmed that H3 is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>28</sup> during early mitosis. In addition, we found that H3 is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>28</sup> as well as Ser<sup>10</sup> when premature chromosome condensation was induced in tsBN2 cells. These observations suggest that H3 phosphorylation at Ser<sup>28</sup>, together with Ser<sup>10</sup>, is a conserved event and is likely to be involved in mitotic chromosome condensation."
https://openalex.org/W2016473759,"α-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders based on the direct linking of missense mutations in α-synuclein to autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease and its presence in Lewy-like lesions. To gain insight into α-synuclein functions, we have investigated whether it binds neuronal proteins and modulates their functional state. The microtubule-associated protein tau was identified as a ligand by α-synuclein affinity chromatography of human brain cytosol. Direct binding assays using 125I-labeled human tau40 demonstrated a reversible binding with a IC50 about 50 pm. The interacting domains were localized to the C terminus of α-synuclein and the microtubule binding region of tau as determined by protein fragmentation and the use of recombinant peptides. High concentrations of tubulin inhibited the binding between tau and α-synuclein. Functionally, α-synuclein stimulated the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of tau serine residues 262 and 356 as determined using a phospho-epitope-specific antibody. We propose that α-synuclein modulates the phosphorylation of soluble axonal tau and thereby indirectly affects the stability of axonal microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2043924172,"Hyperphosphorylated forms of the neuronal microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau are major components of Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments. Previously, we reported that ABαC, the dominant brain isoform of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is localized on MTs, binds directly to tau, and is a major tau phosphatase in cells. We now describe direct interactions among tau, PP2A, and MTs at the submolecular level. Using tau deletion mutants, we found that ABαC binds a domain on tau that is indistinguishable from its MT-binding domain. ABαC binds directly to MTs through a site that encompasses its catalytic subunit and is distinct from its binding site for tau, and ABαC and tau bind to different domains on MTs. Specific PP2A isoforms bind to MTs with distinct affinities in vitro, and these interactions differentially inhibit the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate various substrates, including tau and tubulin. Finally, tubulin assembly decreases PP2A activity in vitro, suggesting that PP2A activity can be modulated by MT dynamics in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate how structural interactions among ABαC, tau, and MTs might control the phosphorylation state of tau. Disruption of these normal interactions could contribute significantly to development of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease.

Hyperphosphorylated tau is the principal component of Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments and neurofibrillar lesions present in several other neurodegenerative disorders (15Spillantini M.G.

A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that changes in tau phosphorylation are decisive events in paired helical filament biogenesis in vivo. To study how tau phosphorylation is regulated, we have been focusing on protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric enzyme that comprises one catalytic C subunit, one non-catalytic A subunit, and one of several structurally distinct, regulatory B subunits (22Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R.L. Yang S.-I. Craft C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20139-20148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that PP2A is likely to be a major tau phosphatase in vivo (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Initially, we found that a pool of ABαC, the major PP2A isoform in brain (22Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R.L. Yang S.-I. Craft C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20139-20148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is associated with MTs in brain and cultured cells (17Sontag E. Nunbhaki-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we determined that tau binds with high affinity to ABαC and ABβC; less tightly to AB′C; and poorly, if at all, to AC or individual PP2A subunits (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that the relative affinities of PP2A isoforms for tau correlated with their tau phosphatase activities, and suppression of PP2A activity in cells stimulated Alzheimer's disease-like phosphorylation of tau and prevented tau from binding MTs (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the use of tau deletion mutants, specific PP2A enzymes, and intact and proteolyzed MTs to define binding sites on tau for PP2A, on PP2A for tau and MTs, and on MTs for PP2A. When considered collectively, the results indicate how structural interactions among PP2A, tau, and MTs can control the phosphorylation of tau. The results suggest, moreover, that disruption of the normal interactions could contribute significantly to the development of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease.

Binder L.I. Rosenbaum J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) or any of several previously described human recombinant tau (rTau) fragments (27Brandt R. Lee G.

We also used one new recombinant tau fragment, rTau9 (see Fig. 1), which was made following the same method used to generate previously produced fragments (27Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some assays, PP2A was incubated on ice for 15 min with 1–5 μm okadaic acid before adding tau. For competition experiments with the synthetic tau peptide 224KKVAVVRTPPKSP236 (numbered according to the longest isoform of human brain tau (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar)), 300 nmABαC was first incubated for 15 min with 1 or 10 μmpeptide and then for an additional 15 min in the presence of peptide plus 600 nm tau. After all incubations were completed, samples were applied directly onto pre-cast, nondenaturing 8–25% polyacrylamide gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); subjected to native gel electrophoresis using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PhastSystem; and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with antibodies to the C or Bα subunits of PP2A (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were densitometrically scanned and quantitatively analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Purified bovine brain tubulin (29Fullerton A.T. Bau M.Y. Conrad P.A. Bloom G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2699-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) at 5 μm (equal to 0.5 mg/ml) was polymerized into MTs by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm GTP and 20 μm Taxol (provided by Nancita Lomax, NCI, National Institutes of Health). When used in PP2A enzymatic assays, MTs were first washed free of GTP by centrifugation at 100,000 ×gmax for 20 min at 30 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor, followed by resuspension in PEM buffer lacking GTP, but containing 20 μm Taxol. This step was essential because high levels of free GTP interfered with PP2A enzymatic assays. To remove C-terminal domains of polymerized tubulin, Taxol-stabilized MTs were incubated overnight at 30 °C with ∼1% (w/w) subtilisin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (30Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1989; 342: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was then terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 5 mm. Subtilisin-digested MTs were sedimented for 45 min at 100,000 ×gmax in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor, resuspended in PEM buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μm Taxol, and used immediately for co-sedimentation assays. The extent of MT proteolysis was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described previously (30Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B.

Biochem. 1985; 153: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PP2A and tau were incubated either individually or together for 15–20 min at room temperature with PEM buffer alone or with PEM buffer containing F-actin (33Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or intact or subtilisin-digested MTs. The samples were then centrifuged at ∼50,000 × gmax for 20 min at 25 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. Next, the supernatants were collected, and each pellet was resuspended to the starting volume (20–50 μl). The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies to the C subunit of PP2A or with the Tau-1 (1Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) or Tau-5 (28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) antibodies. Radiolabeled soluble tau (∼5 mol of phosphate/mol of protein) was produced by incubating bovine brain tau with protein kinase A (Sigma) in the presence of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm cAMP and then purifying phosphorylated tau as described previously (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled, MT-bound tau was obtained by incubating radiolabeled soluble tau with Taxol-assembled MTs, centrifuging MTs for 10 min in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor at ∼50,000 × gmax, and resuspending MTs in GTP-free PEM buffer. For the experiment shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6, ∼1000 cpm each of radiolabeled soluble and MT-bound tau were incubated for 5–45 min at 30 °C with 14 nm ABαC, and dephosphorylation of tau was halted at various time points by addition of 3× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. For the experiment shown in the lower panel of Fig. 6, 200 nm radiolabeled soluble tau was mixed with 40 nm ABαC and 0–10 μm tubulin that had been polymerized in the presence of Taxol. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, after which tau dephosphorylation was terminated by addition of 3× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels, and32P incorporation into tau was measured on dried gels using a PhosphorImager. Purified ABαC, AC, or C subunits (25 nm) in storage buffer were incubated for 15 min with either polymerized or dimeric tubulin (20 μm) in a final volume of 50 μl of phosphatase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0). The reactions were performed in 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates. Green reagent (BIOMOL Research Labs, Inc.) was used in a quantitative colorimetric assay for free phosphate (Pi) released after 30-min incubations at room temperature. Pi levels were determined by measuring A620 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control wells containing only tubulin, MTs, or buffer alone, but no phosphatases, were used to determine the background values of Pi, and the PP2A activities reported here were background-corrected. ABαC, AC, or C subunits were incubated for 15 min with or without 5 μmpolymerized or dimeric tubulin. The samples were then incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with a 100 μm concentration of either of two substrates: radiolabeled phosphorylated myosin light chain (24Mumby M.C. Russell K.L. Garrard L.J. Green D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6257-6265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the synthetic phosphopeptide RRREEE(pT)EEE (Biosynthesis Inc.). Dephosphorylation of myosin light chain was assayed by measuring the release of 32Pi as described previously (17Sontag E. Nunbhaki-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the phosphopeptide was determined by measuring the release of Pi using the colorimetric assay described above for tubulin. Dephosphorylation of polymerized or dimeric tubulin by PP2A enzymes represented, at most, ∼4% of the total phosphatase activity measured for phosphorylated myosin light chain or the phosphopeptide. To localize the binding site on tau for ABαC, a gel mobility shift assay (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) coupled with immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to monitor binding of ABαC to 13 different rTau proteins, all but one of which (rTau9) have been previously described (27Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These recombinant proteins are derived from adult (rTau1–rTau6) or fetal (rTau7–rTau13) isoforms of human brain tau. The largest recombinant tau that was used, rTau1, contains four MT-binding repeats (four-repeat tau) and two 29-mer N-terminal inserts. As shown in Fig.1, each of the other rTau proteins contained one or more unique deletions. Their N- and C-terminal amino acids and the boundaries of their deletions are numbered relative to the amino acid sequence of the largest isoform of brain tau (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), which is equivalent to rTau1. Fig. 1 summarizes the results of the binding assays in which ABαC and the pertinent rTau proteins were used at 300 and 600 nm, respectively. Densitometry of the resulting immunoblots was used to estimate the percentage of PP2A that was bound to each rTau protein. Maximal binding of ABαC (≥95%) was observed for every rTau protein that contains all four MT-binding repeats plus extensive sequence contiguous with the N terminus of the repeats. Included in this group are rTau1 and rTau2, which do not have any C-terminal deletions, and rTau6 and rTau8, which are missing part or all of the C-terminal 45 amino acid residues of native tau. A modest decrease in binding (to ∼80%) was observed for rTau7, which is equivalent to the fetal isoform of brain tau (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), contains only three MT-binding repeats (three-repeat tau), and lacks the two N-terminal inserts. A similar level of ABαC binding (∼75%) was observed for rTau5, the C terminus of which is in the middle of the third MT-binding repeat, but contains no other deletions relative to rTau1. By comparison, rTau4, which contains a large internal deletion and includes just part of the last MT-binding repeat, was able to bind only ∼45% of ABαC. The minimal protein that retained the ability to bind ABαC (∼38%) was rTau12, which lacks all four MT-binding repeats, but, near its C terminus, contains a proline-rich sequence that has MT-binding activity independent of the repeats (4Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Drewes G. Gustke N. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, rTau13, which lacks residues 221–242 of rTau12, but is otherwise identical, failed to bind any ABαC. Deletion of the N-terminal 29-mer inserts (rTau8) or residues 84–161 (rTau2), which include part of the second N-terminal repeat, did not impair binding of four-repeat tau to ABαC. Other deletions located N-terminal to the MT-binding repeats yielded demonstrable, albeit modest effects. A slight reduction in binding (to ∼90%) was observed for rTau3, which contains all four MT-binding repeats, but lacks most of the proline-rich MT-binding domain located immediately N-terminal to those repeats. Likewise, binding to ABαC correlated roughly with protein length for the three-repeat proteins (rTau9, rTau10, and rTau11) that have extensive N-terminal deletions. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the overall PP2A-binding region on tau encompasses the MT-binding repeats and a short sequence N-terminal to the repeats. It is thus indistinguishable, within the limits of experimental resolution, from the MT-binding region on tau (4Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Drewes G. Gustke N. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lower affinity binding of ABαC can be achieved by proteins that contain only the extreme N-terminal (rTau12) or C-terminal (rTau4) part of the overall binding region on tau for ABαC. In addition, the binding affinity of PP2A for tau increases with the number of MT-binding repeats present in tau. It is also important to note that inclusion of 1 μm okadaic acid in the binding reactions completely suppressed PP2A activity, but had no effect on the extent of PP2A interaction with tau (data not shown). To seek further evidence that sequences on tau immediately N-terminal to the MT-binding repeats actually bind ABαC, the synthetic peptide224KKVAVVRTPPKSP236, which corresponds to a portion of this region, was tested for its ability to compete with native tau for binding to ABαC. The sequence of this portion of tau is invariant among all isoforms of human, rat, mouse, and bovine tau. Bovine brain ABαC (300 nm) was preincubated first with 1 or 10 μm peptide, after which bovine brain tau (600 nm) or an equivalent volume of buffer was added. After an additional 15-min incubation, binding of ABαC to tau was monitored by native gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an anti-Bα antibody (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 10 μm (but not 1 μm) peptide partially inhibited binding of PP2A to tau. In addition, 10 μmpeptide induced a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of PP2A on native gels, consistent with the formation of an ABαC-peptide complex. Our previous finding that a pool of ABαC copurifies with MTs in vitro and is associated with MTs in cells (17Sontag E. Nunbhaki-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) raised the question of how ABαC, and possibly other PP2A isoforms as well, might bind to MTs. The results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 strongly imply that tau cannot serve as a MT-anchoring protein for PP2A because they show that ABαC and MTs bind to the same region on tau. To determine whether PP2A might bind directly to MTs, a series of MT co-sedimentation assays were performed with various purified PP2A enzymes. As shown in Fig.3 (upper panel), when bovine brain or human recombinant ABαC heterotrimers were mixed with MTs and centrifuged, ∼50% of PP2A was recovered in the MT pellets under the experimental conditions utilized. The possibility that ABαC may have nonspecifically co-sedimented with MTs under these conditions was assessed in parallel control experiments, in which MTs were omitted or F-actin was substituted for MTs. ABαC proteins did not sediment in either of these cases, emphasizing the specificity of the direct interaction between ABαC and MTs. In addition, 0.5 m NaCl was found to prevent co-sedimentation of PP2A with MTs, indicating that ionic interactions are important for association of the enzyme with MTs. As was observed for the binding of ABαC to tau, inclusion of 5 μm okadaic acid in the assays completely suppressed PP2A activity, but had no effect on the extent of interaction of ABαC with MTs (data not shown). In the next series of experiments, increasing concentrations of ABαC were incubated with MTs and then centrifuged to generate MT-bound (pellet) and unbound (supernatant) fractions. Fig. 3 (lower panel) shows that ABαC co-pelleted with MTs in a concentration-dependent manner. The highest concentration of ABαC that we were able to use for these experiments (1 μm) was not sufficient for saturation binding to ∼5 μm assembled tubulin (see Fig. 4). Nevertheless, ∼40% of 1 μm ABαC bound to ∼5 μm assembled tubulin, indicating that MTs must be able to accommodate >1 ABαC heterotrimer/12.5 tubulin dimers. Furthermore, because ∼80% of ABαC bound to MTs when the total concentration of ABαC was 0.1 μm (Fig. 3, lower panel), the binding of ABαC to MTs must be tight. Efforts to use Scatchard analysis to determine saturation binding and a dissociation constant more accurately were unsuccessful for ABαC and other forms of PP2A (Figs.3 (lower panel) and 4) because the Scatchard plots could not be described accurately by simple linear equations (data not shown). To assess whether ABαC is the only form of PP2A that can bind MTs, we compared the behavior of distinct PP2A enzymes in the MT co-sedimentation assay. As shown in Fig.4, all enzymatically active proteins tested, including the ABβC and AB′C holoenzymes, the AC dimer, and the catalytic C subunit, were able to bind MTs to some extent. However, distinct PP2A isoforms appeared to have distinct affinities for MTs because at fixed molar concentrations of PP2A and polymerized tubulin, the ratio of MT-bound to soluble enzyme varied considerably among the phosphatases tested. Based on the results presented in Fig. 4, the ability of PP2A to bind to MTs can be ranked as follows: ABαC > AC > ABβC > C > AB′C. When actin filaments were substituted for microtubules, virtually none of the PP2A enzymes pelleted, demonstrating that their binding to microtubules was specific (data not shown). The fact that the monomeric C subunit co-sedimented with MTs indicates that it contains a binding site for MTs. However, our findings suggest that the presence of A and B subunits modulates interactions of the catalytic C subunit with MTs and that each type of B subunit does so in its own unique way. As reported previously for binding of various forms of PP2A to tau (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), the ABαC heterotrimer bound more tightly to MTs than any of the other forms of PP2A that were assayed. In addition, we found that neither ABαC nor AC forms detectable complexes with unpolymerized tubulin during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown), implying that PP2A can efficiently interact with tubulin only when the tubulin has polymerized. Binding to MTs of several MAPs such tau and MAP2 can be partially inhibited by prior exposure of either unassembled (32Serrano L. Montejo de Garcini E. Hernandez M.A. Avila J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or polymerized (30Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B.

Both mouse and human transactivation domains recruited the p300/CBP coactivator and were equally sensitive to inhibition by adenovirus E1A protein. Interestingly, the Stat3 carboxyl terminus also functioned as a transactivator capable of recruiting p300/CBP, as does the Stat1 protein, although with widely differing potencies. Yet these proteins share no sequence similarity with Stat2.

To date, 7 mammalian members of this family have been identified, and data from somatic cell mutagenesis and gene targeting studies have indicated that each protein serves a highly specific function. For example, Stat1 is required for responses to type I and type II interferons (IFN) involved in the innate immune response to pathogen infection, while Stat4 and Stat6 are involved in responses to interleukin 12 and interleukin 4, respectively (for review, see Refs. 1Darnell J.E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). Very similar results have been obtained from studies in human and mouse cells, and the Stat genes in these species are highly related, residing in 3 analogous chromosomal clusters. The IFN pathway has served as a paradigm for defining the role of Stat proteins in signaling. Type I IFN (IFNα/β) signals through Stat1 and Stat2 while type II IFN (IFNγ) signals through Stat1 alone. At least one reason why Stat1 is capable of functioning alone is its ability to form homodimers capable of binding specific DNA sequences in the enhancers of target genes, called γ-activated sites, or GAS elements. Stat2, in contrast, has not been demonstrated to exhibit DNA binding activity but rather is recruited to DNA as part of a multimeric complex containing Stat1 (3Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and usually the auxiliary protein ISGF3γ (4Veals S.A. Schindler C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes containing Stat2 do not appear to involve direct contacts between Stat2 and DNA but rather rely on indirect interactions involving the other proteins in the complex (6Qureshi S.A.

Therefore, while one of the conserved domains identified in Stat proteins serves a DNA binding function (9Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), it is unclear what role this domain plays in Stat2. Other protein-protein interactions necessary for Stat function during IFN signaling include Stat-receptor interactions that are necessary for recruitment to Janus kinases for activation (11Greenlund A.C.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Conservation of these protein interactions would suggest conservation of protein sequences, and most Stat protein homologues display considerable sequence conservation across different mammalian species. Stat2 appears to be an exception to this rule. Through cloning and characterization of the mouse Stat2 protein, we report that it is remarkably divergent in primary sequence in comparison to its human homologue. Despite this divergence, mouse Stat2 retains all the functions defined for human Stat2 and will even substitute for the human homologue when transfected into human cells, demonstrating its ability to form all protein interactions necessary for IFN action with both mouse and human partner proteins. Mouse embryo fibroblasts from CD1 mice (18García-Sastre A. Durbin R.K. Zheng H. Palese P. Gertner R. Levy D.E. Durbin J.E. J.

Saksela E. Int. J. Cancer. 1967; 2: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum (Sigma). Stable cell lines in U6A cells were obtained by the calcium phosphate method using 30 μg of human or murine Stat2 expression constructs in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) by selection in 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) and were screened by Western blot for expression of Stat2. Human cells were treated with recombinant IFNα2a (kind gift of Hoffmann-La Roche) and mouse cells were treated with natural type I IFN (Lee Biomolecular). Rabbit antisera and monoclonal antibodies were raised against a bacterial fusion protein expressing the carboxyl terminus of mouse Stat2 fused to GST using the vector pGEX-2T (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat2 were developed by immunizing rabbits with a phosphopeptide representing the conserved phospho-acceptor site of Stat2. The resulting antiserum was absorbed extensively against the non-phosphorylated peptide and against phosphotyrosine to remove cross-reactive antibodies. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies PY20 and 4G10 were obtained from UBI and Transduction Laboratories, respectively, and antibodies against p300 and Gal4 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A partial clone for Stat2 was obtained by low stringency hybridization of a mouse cDNA library, as described previously (23Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicated that this clone lacked two regions present in human Stat2 and later found in mouse Stat2 (see below), namely amino acids 44–98 and 157–182 (data not shown). A full-length clone was obtained by RT-PCR using RNA derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts and 5′ and 3′ primers based on the predicted untranslated regions of the partial clone. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) from mouse embryo fibroblasts treated for 12 h with IFNα/β (500 units/ml). The following sequences were used as primers. 5′-UTR: 5′-ttgcagcgagacgactggaag-3′; 3′-UTR: 5′-gtagggtatggaagtctcatc-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned first into pPCR (24Borovkov A.Y. Rivkin M.I. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 812-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A similar expression construct for human Stat2 was prepared in pcDNA3 (8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

GST fusion constructs were prepared in pGEX-2T (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) containing amino acids 644–923 (murine Stat2) and 670–851 (human Stat2), and recombinant protein was isolated from inclusion bodies of transformed bacteria by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (26Koff A.

GST fusion coprecipitations were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from mouse L cells (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), as described (15Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M.

For detection of ISGF3, 293T cells were transiently transfected with murine Stat1, human or murine Stat2, murine IRF9, and tpr-met expression constructs. Extracts were prepared and analyzed as described previously (28Levy D.E. Methods. 1998; 15: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For detection of Gal4 constructs, COS or U2OS cells were transfected with either vector alone or Gal4-Stat fusion constructs, along with a reporter gene containing 5 Gal4 UAS elements fused to the luciferase gene (gift of T. Hoey, Tularik). U6A cells were transfected with ISG54-luc, as described (8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

Luciferase assays were normalized to β-galactosidase activity derived from co-transfected CMV-lacZ, as described previously (8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

U6A cells were transfected with ISG54-luc, as described (8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

Plasmid DNA was sequenced by the chain termination method and sequences were analyzed by computer using software from the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. The mouse Stat2 sequence has been deposited in GenBank as accession numberAF088862. A mouse Stat2 cDNA clone was initially isolated from a library screen for Stat clones based on hybridization with the conserved SH2 domain (Ref. 23Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar and data not shown). Conceptual translation of the sequence of this clone demonstrated homology with human Stat2 at the amino terminus and throughout much of the sequence except for two gaps and a divergent carboxyl terminus (data not shown). Further characterization of the mouse Stat2 gene was obtained using specific primers, 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA end techniques, and PCR amplification from RNA isolated from mouse embryo fibroblasts (“Experimental Procedures”). The longest clones obtained by these procedures were approximately 3 kilobases in length, and sequence analysis showed the presence of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and an open reading frame encoding 923 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank as accession numberAF088862. Comparison of the mouse Stat2 sequence with human Stat2 demonstrated that the two proteins are co-linear, with conservation of all the major features previously identified in Stat proteins (16Chen X.

Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) could all be recognized, although they were conserved to different degrees (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the region analogous to the DNA-binding domains of other Stat proteins (9Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) was also conserved between mouse and human despite the absence of a demonstrated ability of Stat2 to bind DNA (6Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the carboxyl terminus of human Stat2, a region necessary for the transcriptional activity of the protein (33Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell.

While this region of Stat proteins is not well conserved between distinct genes, it is nonetheless highly conserved between species for all other Stat genes characterized thus far (Table I). All other Stat proteins show 80 to >90% cross-species identity in their carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains, while mouse and human Stat2 proteins are only 33% identical and 41% similar.Table IMouse-human sequence conservationSequenceFull-lengthCarboxyl terminus% Similar% Identical% Similar% IdenticalStat193.792.493.393.3Stat278.168.638.629.7Stat399.198.898.496.8Stat496.094.794.294.2Stat5a97.196.389.689.6Stat687.385.183.478.8 Open table in a new tab The lack of conservation between human and mouse Stat2 led us to question whether our cDNA clone was a legitimate representative of mouse Stat2 or a minor, diverged subspecies. Since other Stat genes are known to be expressed as multiply spliced variants and alternative splicing has been described for Stat2 (34Sugiyama T. Nishio Y. Kishimoto T. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), RNA extracted from mouse cells was examined by Northern blotting using the full-length mouse Stat2 cDNA as probe. A major mRNA approximately 6 kilobases in length hybridized the probe, and this mRNA was increased in abundance in response to IFNα treatment (Fig. 2 A). Induction of Stat2 protein by IFNα has been previously described (35Kumar R. Korutla L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No additional mRNA species were detected by this analysis from either the uninduced or the IFNα-induced sample. In particular, no predominant products were observed that might correspond to major splice variants, as has been described for Stat1 (36Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R.H. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). However, additional minor products possibly representing either splice variants or splicing intermediates were detected by RT-PCR (data not shown). To examine mouse Stat2 protein, antibodies were raised against a recombinant protein consisting of amino acids 644 to the carboxyl terminus. Western blotting detected a single protein of approximately 120 kDa in extracts from mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) which is significantly larger than human Stat2 (113 kDa). This larger size is consistent with the open reading frame predicted by sequence analysis which is also longer in mouse than in human, although both proteins migrate on SDS-PAGE with an abnormally large apparent molecular size. Transfection of human cells with an expression construct containing the mouse Stat2 cDNA produced a protein detected by the antiserum of equal size to endogenous mouse Stat2 (Fig.2 B, lane 1). However, protein expressed from our initial partial Stat2 cDNA clone (lane 3) was significantly smaller than either the endogenous protein or protein expressed from the full-length clone (lane 1). Protein expressed from the full-length cDNA clone comigrated with endogenous mouse Stat2, suggesting that this clone indeed contained the entire Stat2 coding region. Consistent with the sequence divergence between mouse and human Stat2, the antiserum raised against mouse Stat2 and several monoclonal antibodies raised against the same immunogen failed to recognize human Stat2 (data not shown). A characteristic of Stat proteins is their ability to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (1Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 37Levy D.E. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 181-189Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse Stat2 was coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells along with mouse Stat1 and the tpr-met-activated tyrosine kinase (38Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) which efficiently phosphorylates Stat proteins. Coexpression of mouse Stat2 and tpr-met resulted in phosphorylation of Stat2, as revealed by immunoblotting with antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat2 (Fig.2 C, lane 1). In the absence of coexpressed kinase (lane 2), no phosphorylated Stat2 was detected. Protein expressed from the shorter, mStat2-ΔN clone was similarly phosphorylated (lane 3). Endogenous mouse Stat2, recognized by antisera prepared against the recombinant protein, was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IFNα/β treatment, as revealed by the phospho-specific Stat2 antibody (lane 6). Activation of Stat proteins results in their ability to dimerize, and phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 co-precipitated when coexpressed along with kinase (data not shown), indicating SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. This interaction led to formation of the ISGF3 multimeric complex when mouse Stat2 was coexpressed with mouse Stat1 and ISGF3γ p48 (IRF9) in the presence of kinase (Fig. 2 D, lane 1). This complex was efficiently super-shifted by monoclonal antibody against mouse Stat2 (lane 2) and comigrated with mouse ISGF3 isolated from IFN-treated fibroblasts (lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, by the criteria that recombinant protein expressed from this clone comigrates with endogenous Stat2, is tyrosine phosphorylated, associates with Stat1 and IRF9, and is capable of generating an antibody that recognizes endogenous mouse Stat2, we conclude that it is an authentic cDNA clone. Because human and mouse Stat2 are more divergent than other human-mouse Stat homologues, we tested whether mouse Stat2 could substitute for its human counterpart. U6A cells fail to respond to IFNα treatment because they lack the Stat2 protein, but they can be complemented by transfection of human Stat2 (19Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We transfected U6A cells or the parental 2fTGH cells with the IFN-responsive reporter construct ISG54-luc (8Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The wild type parental cells responded to IFNα treatment by an increase in luciferase activity (Fig.3 A, lane 1) while U6A cells showed no response (lane 2). Stable transfection of U6A cells with mouse Stat2 restored the response to IFNα to levels comparable to parental cells (lane 3) and comparable to the level of induction observed when U6A cells were transfected with human Stat2 (Ref. 39Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlieststra R.J. van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5645-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and data not shown). The most divergent region of mouse Stat2 relative to human is the carboxyl terminus which encodes the transactivation domain of the human protein. The transactivation potential of the mouse Stat2 carboxyl terminus was tested and compared with that of its human counterpart. The carboxyl termini of the two proteins were fused with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein (25Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and these constructs were tested for transcriptional activity by co-transfection with a Gal4 UAS-luciferase reporter in COS cells. Both human and mouse Stat2 fusion proteins induced high levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3) relative to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain protein expressed alone (lane 1). A similar fusion protein containing the carboxyl terminus of the mouse Stat3 protein induced a moderate response from the reporter construct (lane 4). Therefore, despite their high degree of sequence divergence, both human and mouse Stat2 transactivation domains encode comparable activities. It has been reported that human Stat2 recruits p300/CBP as a coactivator during transcriptional activation (15Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The sequence divergence between human and mouse Stat2 raised the possibility that mouse Stat2 might activate transcription by a distinct mechanism. Recombinant human and mouse Stat2 carboxyl termini were purified from bacteria as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. When mixed with nuclear extracts from mouse L cells, both human and mouse Stat2 protein fragments were capable of selectively precipitating p300/CBP as determined by immunoblotting (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3). GST displayed only background binding of p300/CBP (lane 4). Interaction of mouse Stat2 with p300 was also tested in vivo. A Gal4-Stat2 construct was co-transfected with an epitope-tagged human p300 expression construct. For comparison, Gal4-Stat1 and Gal4-Stat3 constructs were also co-transfected with p300. Immunoprecipitation of p300 from extracts of transfected cells also recovered each Gal4 construct, detected by immunoblotting with an antibody against the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 4 B). Because p300 interacts with both the amino and carboxyl termini of Stat1 (13Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the entire protein was fused to Gal4. The carboxyl termini of both mouse Stat2 and Stat3 efficiently interacted with p300, despite these protein fragments displaying no significant sequence similarity, as did the divergent human Stat2 carboxyl terminus (not shown). Therefore, p300 is capable of interacting with considerably dissimilar sequences: Stat1, the divergent carboxyl termini of mouse and human Stat2, and the unrelated carboxyl terminus of mouse Stat3. Adenovirus E1A inhibits IFN-dependent transcription (40Reich N. Pine R. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 114-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly due to its ability to bind and sequester p300/CBP (13Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Proc.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), appear broadly relevant to extracellular proteolysis. These families include a large number of enzymes (over 20 gene products each) with demonstrated cleavage activity for matrix molecules as well as nonmatrix, bioactive molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-α (reviewed in Ref. 3Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In other instances of extracellular proteolysis, such as cleavage of aggrecan at the Glu373-Ala374 peptide bond (5Flannery C.R. Lark M.W. Sandy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the shedding of l-selectin from leukocytes (6Borland G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2810-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the responsible proteases have not yet been reported. Such activities may eventually be attributed to cognate proteases but they may well be due to one or more hitherto unknown enzymes. For these reasons, it is important to define the full repertoire of enzymes possessed by cells, their regulation, and their substrate preferences.ADAMs, also referred to as MDC (metalloprotease-disintegrins withcysteine-rich domains, 2) have catalytic domains with zinc-binding signatures and disintegrin domains that are very similar to the snake venom metalloproteinases (reviewed in Ref. 7Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); together, the ADAMs and snake venom metalloproteinases are referred to as reprolysins (7Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Most ADAM members are quite similar in domain organization (2Blobel C.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). ADAM-TS1 lacks the epidermal growth factor-like repeat, does not have a canonical disintegrin sequence, and possesses three modules with similar thrombospondin type-1 (TS) repeats (8Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This unique structure, the existence of three other similar gene products (ADAM-TS2–4) in the public domain, and our discovery of three novel, related gene products led us to recognize and to describe here the essential features of the ADAM-TS family.The existence of procollagen I/II amino-propeptide processing enzyme (PCINP) has been known for decades (9Lapière C.M. Lenaers A. Cohn L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3054-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the recent cDNA cloning of bovine PCINP (10Colige A. Li S.W. Sieron A.L.

The gene is now designated ADAMTS2 in keeping with nomenclature recommended by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. Lack of ADAM-TS2 is known to cause dermatosparaxis in cattle (11Hanset R. Ansay M. Ann. Med. Vet. 1967; 7: 451-470Google Scholar) or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (EDS-VIIC) in humans (12Lapière C.M. Nusgens B.V. Arch.

EDS-VIIC is a recessively inherited disorder, characterized clinically by severe skin fragility and biochemically by the presence in skin of procollagen incompletely processed at the amino terminus. The precise mutations in ADAMTS2 have not yet been reported in the literature. ADAM-TS3 and ADAM-TS4 designate the proteins predicted by mRNAs transcribed from the KIAA0366 (14Nagase T. Ishikawa K.

Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) genes, respectively. These genes have been deposited in GenBankTM by the Kazusa DNA Institute and are designated ADAMTS3 and ADAMTS4, respectively.We now describe here: 1) the discovery of three novel genes, ADAM-TS5–7 belonging to this family; 2) the relationship of their predicted protein products to essential structural features of the ADAM-TS family; 3) analysis of expression of our novel genes in various tissues; and 4) the distribution of the ADAM-TS genes in human and mouse genomes.RESULTSCloning of Novel ADAM-TS cDNAsUsing the BLAST algorithm to scan dBEST for novel ESTs that were homologous to cognate ADAM-TS genes, we identified a number of nonoverlapping sequences deposited in dBEST. Full-length sequencing of the inserts of these clones confirmed that they were not identical to any other gene sequences deposited in GenBankTM. Using nested oligonucleotide primers based on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequences of the I.M.A.G.E. clones, we did successive rounds of RACE to extend the sequences as shown in Fig. 1(a–c). RACE primers were generated 50–200 bp from the ends of the sequences so that the contiguity of RACE clones with I.M.A.G.E. clones could be clearly established. The predicted domain organization relative to the cloned cDNA and the relationship of the products of these novel genes to the four cognate ADAM-TS members are shown in Fig.1.Cloning of Adamts5 and ADAMTS5A single round of 5′ and 3′ RACE sufficed for cloning of the entire coding sequence of Adamts5 and part of the catalytic zinc binding site through to the stop codon of ADAMTS5. The ADAMTS5 clone 345484-52 contained an incompletely processed mRNA (Fig.1 a) revealing a splice junction splitting the zinc binding sequence in the ADAM-TS5 cDNA. Although the complete primary structure of ADAM-TS5 could be deduced from the mouse cDNA the corresponding human cDNA sequence has not yet been completely cloned. At its 5′ end, clone TH5 contains a methionine codon (ATG) within a consensus Kozak sequence for initiation of translation (25Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we have been unable to extend the 5′ sequence further to see if this is the first methionine in the predicted open reading frame (ORF). The predicted amino acid sequences of Adamts5 and ADAMTS5 are shown in alignment in Fig.2 a.Cloning of ADAMTS6The I.M.A.G.E. clone 742630 contained an ORF flanked by consensus splice sequences, indicating the presence of introns (Fig. 1 b). Two successive rounds of RACE at the 5′ end and a single round of RACE at the 3′ end provided the complete coding sequence of ADAM-TS6. The putative ATG codon is within a Kozak consensus sequence and encodes the first methionine within the ORF.Cloning of ADAMTS7The I.M.A.G.E. clone 272098 encoded a putative preproregion and was extended in the 3′-direction by two successive rounds of RACE (Fig. 1 c). Attempts to extend the sequence at its 5′ end have not been successful. However, we identified a typical signal peptide sequence downstream of the first methionine in the translated ORF; this methionine codon lay within a satisfactory Kozak consensus for translation initiation, and we believe it likely that it encodes the start codon.Comparison of the Predicted Structure of ADAM-TS5, ADAM-TS6, and ADAM-TS7Fig. 2 (a–c) displays the deduced primary sequence of each protein. An alignment of these sequences (including ADAM-TS1–4) may be viewed as supplemental data on-line.The three novel conceptual gene products described here share a common domain organization. From amino to carboxyl termini, we describe them as follows.A PreproregionA typical signal sequence of variable length is followed by a putative proregion of variable length but demonstrating short stretches of sequence similarity (see alignment on-line). Three cysteine residues are predicted within each novel prodomain. The COOH-terminal most of these lies within a sequence context similar to the cysteine “switch” of the MMPs (26Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, a–c). All three novel genes predict consensus cleavage signals for furin, three in the case of ADAM-TS5 and one each in the case of ADAM-TS6 and ADAM-TS7. The most carboxyl-terminal furin cleavage site in ADAM-TS5 likely predicts the processing site for generation of the mature protease. The amino terminus of the mature proteins is predicted to start at the residue immediately following the cleavage site (Fig. 2, a–c).A Catalytic DomainThe catalytic domains are very similar to each other and contain eight cysteine residues and a typical reprolysin-type zinc binding signature (Fig. 2, a–c, and Fig. 3 a). Five cysteine residues are upstream of the zinc binding sequence, while three residues are downstream, an arrangement that is shared with other ADAM-TS members. Like all MMPs and reprolysins, the zinc binding signature is followed in all ADAM-TS proteins by a methionine residue within a conserved sequence context (Fig. 3 a). We designate this as being the methionine of the “Met-turn” a structural landmark present in all the MMPs and ADAMs; the Met-turn is a tight turn arranged as a right handed screw in the adamalysin and MMP polypeptides COOH-terminal to the third zinc-binding histidine (32Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The methionine of the Met-turn is at a similar, but not constant, interval from the ADAM-TS zinc-binding signature, and in all the ADAM-TS members, a constant cysteine residue is present in that interval.Figure 3a, sequence alignment of the catalytic zinc binding sites and Met-turn of two snake venom metalloproteases, four ADAMs, and the seven cognate members of the ADAM-TS family. The asterisk indicates a glycine residue which is replaced by asparagine in ADAM-TS1 and ADAM-TS4, and the solid circle indicates the methionine residue of the Met-turn. b, the first thrombospondin type-1 module of ADAMTS1–7.

Residues indicating a potential linear heparin-binding sequence are italicized. c, Dendrogram illustrating the phyllogenetic relationships between the individual members of the ADAM-TS family prepared by MegAlign.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Disintegrin-like DomainThe catalytic domain is followed by a domain of 60–90 residues with 35–45% similarity to snake venom disintegrins, but without the canonical cysteine arrangement seen in the latter. We term this the disintegrin-like domain; while of comparable length in ADAM-TS5 and ADAM-TS7, it is considerably shorter in ADAM-TS6. The disintegrin-like domain contains eight cysteine residues (except for ADAM-TS6 which has six).A TS ModuleThe first TS repeat is very similar in all three novel proteases and very similar to the first TS repeat of other ADAM-TSs (Fig. 3 b). It contains the same number of residues (52) in all three novel gene products (Fig. 3 b).The Cysteine-rich DomainThis TS domain is followed by a conserved cysteine-rich sequence termed the cysteine-rich domain (to distinguish it from the cysteine-free spacer domain). It contains 10 conserved cysteines in each case and demonstrates high sequence homology with the cysteine-rich domain of other ADAM-TS proteins.The Spacer DomainThis domain is of variable length, in all ADAM-TSs, and lacks the sequence landmarks so characteristic of all the other domains. It shows the least homology of all the domains.ADAMTS7 has the longest of all the spacer domains (221 amino acids), while ADAM-TS6 has the shortest of all spacer domains (127 amino acids). The spacer domain of ADAM-TS5 is intermediate in length (158 amino acids).A COOH-terminal TS ModuleThe sequence of the second TS module is more variant between the members of the ADAM-TS family than the first TS module, despite the conservation of the number and spacing of cysteine residues. The second TS module of ADAM-TS7 is followed by a short sequence containing two cysteine residues.Overall, the predicted mature forms of these proteases show 20–40% similarity to each other and to ADAM-TS1–4, although this may be considerably higher or lower for individual domains as described above. The dendrogram in Fig. 3 c indicates specific relationships between individual ADAM-TS members. The predicted molecular weights (Mr) of the full-length gene products are 108,633 (mADAM-TS5), 97,115 (hADAM-TS6), and 116,607 (hADAM-TS7). The actual Mr will almost certainly be different due to processing of these proenzymes to the mature forms and post-translational modifications. All the primary sequences predict the possibility of N-linked glycosylation at a number of potential sites. ADAM-TS5 and ADAM-TS7 contain three and two potential N-glycosylation sites, respectively, in the mature protease, of which two are in similar positions; one of these is in a constant position just upstream of the start of the spacer domain and the other lies within the spacer domain (Fig. 2, a and c). ADAM-TS5 possesses an additional site near the start of the disintegrin domain (Fig. 2 a). In ADAM-TS5, the N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in both mouse and human sequences. ADAM-TS6 has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites within the prodomain and two others in the mature protease. These are at different positions relative to the sites in ADAM-TS5 and ADAM-TS7 (Fig. 2, a–c).Analyses of Expression of ADAM-TS5, ADAM-TS6, and ADAM-TS7 GenesNorthern AnalysisAdamts5 was specifically expressed in the 7-day mouse embryo (the peri-implantation period; hence we have given this gene the trivial name implantin) and at low or undetectable levels thereafter (Fig.4 a). Northern analysis showed undetectable expression of Adamts6 during mouse embryo development (not shown). Adamts7 was expressed at low levels throughout mouse development (Fig. 4 a). In adult human tissues examined with human cDNA probes, ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS6 mRNA were expressed at low levels in placenta, but were barely detectable in a number of other tissues examined (Fig.4 b). In contrast, ADAMTS7 mRNA was found in all tissues examined (Fig. 4 b).Figure 4Northern analysis of expression of ADAM-TS5, ADAM-TS6, and ADAM-TS7.

ADAMTS5 mRNA was approximately 10 kbp in size in human tissue. The most prominent Adamts5 species was estimated at 7.5 kbp together with additional bands at 10 and 4.5 kbp (Fig. 4, a and b). The lone mRNA species detected by ADAMTS6 probe was approximately 8.5 kbp, whereas the most common mRNA species detected by ADAMTS7 probe was 5 kbp in size with an additional species seen at 7 kbp in skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 b). The ADAMTS6 probe hybridized with mRNA species of 4.5 and 3.0 kbp in mouse embryos (Fig.4 a), and a smaller band of 2.0 kbp was detected in gestational day 17 embryo mRNA (Fig. 4 a).In Situ HybridizationSpecific hybridization of the antisense Adamts5 probe to sections of 8.5-day-old mouse embryos was obtained, whereas no hybridization or low level background staining was noted with the control sense probe (Fig.5 a). Staining was uniform throughout the 8.5-day-old embryos (Fig. 5 b); we could not distinguish between the staining of various developmental components at this early stage. In addition, there was labeling of mRNA in trophoblastic cells lining the uterine cavity (Fig. 5, a and b) as well as in the developing placenta (Fig. 5, c and d). The decidual reaction (primarily cells in uterine glands) within the uterus also showed up-regulation of Adamts5 mRNA relative to the negative controls (Fig. 5, a and b). In sections from 10.5-day-old embryos, labeling was widespread but less intense compared with the 8.5-day-old embryo. Labeled cells were seen in mesenchyme and somites as well as in the neural tube and developing hindgut (Fig. 5 d).Figure 5Expression of Adamts5 mRNA in the 8.5-day-old (a–c) and 10.5-day-old (d) embryo by in situ hybridization.

For ADAMTS6 and ADAMTS7, we have yet to assign loci by linkage mapping in human or mouse genomes; the mapping of these genes is presently only available at the resolution of a single human chromosome (Table I).Linkage analysis of the mouse chromosomal loci for Adamts1, Adamts2, Adamts4, and Adamts5 was made possible by the existence of I.M.A.G.E. clones representing these genes. For Adamts1, informative Eco RV RFLVs were detected (C3H/HeJ-gld, 12.0 kbp; Mus spretus, 5.0 kbp); for Adamts2, informative Taq I RFLVs were detected (C3H/HeJ-gld, 6.4 kbp; Mus spretus, 7.0 kbp); for Adamts4, informative Bgl II RFLVs were detected (C3H/HeJ-gld, 5.8 kbp, Mus spretus, 7.0 kbp), and for Adamts5, informative Bgl I RFLVs were detected (C3H/HeJ-gld, 24.0 kbp, Mus spretus, 7.0 kbp).Haplotype analyses indicated that Adamts1 and Adamts5 co-segregated with Grik1 on mouse chromosome 16 in all 38 and 114 meiotic events examined, respectively.Adamts2 co-segregated with the Il3 locus on mouse chromosome 11 in 113/114 meiotic events examined, while Adamts4 co-segregated with the Fcgr3, Fcgr2, Mpz, Apoa2, and Fce1g loci on mouse chromosome 1 in all 114 meiotic events examined. The best gene order ± the S.D. indicated the loci as outlined in Table I.Based on linkage mapping of mouse or human genes, we were able to strongly suggest chromosomal position for the corresponding ortholog using the mouse-human homology maps. Overall, our results (Table I) demonstrate that the genes of this novel family are dispersed in the human and mouse genomes, with the exception of the Adamts1 and Adamts5 genes which are both linked to Grik1 on mouse chromosome 16. ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS6 both lie on human chromosome 5, but we do not yet know if these genes are linked.DISCUSSIONdBEST is a unique resource for identification of novel mRNAs using the BLAST programs. This, combined with the availability of the I.M.A.G.E. clones, provides a means of cloning full-length coding sequences using the inserts of I.M.A.G.E. clones as probes for RACE or library screening. The ESTs that we initially identified were small, did not encode similar peptides, and were not identical to each other, suggesting that they might represent different genes or nonoverlapping sequences from the same gene. Analysis of the monochromosomal mapping panel suggested that the human I.M.A.G.E. clones represented unique genes. In Northern blot analyses, these fragments hybridized to mRNA species of different sizes with different patterns of tissue-specific expression, which provided further evidence that they represented different genes.Because RACE provides overlapping clones in a vectorial fashion, we used this strategy for extending the sequences of these I.M.A.G.E. clones. We found that these novel genes were sufficiently represented in human fetal brain cDNA to permit cloning by RACE using this template. Since Northern analysis demonstrated an abundance of Adamts5 in the 7-day-old embryo, we used this template for RACE. The extension of ESTs led to acquisition of nonidentical, but homologous, sequences encoding similar domains, confirming that the original I.M.A.G.E. clones were derived from distinct genes whose products were related. Extension of the sequence of I.M.A.G.E. clone 569515 revealed 87% nucleotide identity and 96% amino acid identity with the partial ADAMTS5 sequence, demonstrating that this was the mouse ortholog, Adamts5. The novel sequences reported in the paper have been scanned against the data bases and all sequences with identity to, or significant relation to, the new sequence have been identified and accession numbers provided (Fig.1 d and legend).Determination of the initiation of translation requires identification of the first methionine codon in the appropriate Kozak consensus context (25Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the putative start codons identified in Adamts5 and ADAMTS7 lie within appropriate Kozak consensus sequences and are followed by typical signal peptides, the cloned nucleotide sequences do not extend far enough upstream to confirm that these are the first methionines in the ORFs we have defined. Despite many attempts to extend the sequences further using various mRNA templates, PCR conditions, and polymerases, we have not been successful.ADAM-TS Genes Are Highly RegulatedPrevious work of Kuno et al.

Our own studies demonstrate that ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS6 are expressed at low levels, primarily in the placenta.

Four human GalNAc-transferases have been characterized, and several characteristics of the human family of GalNAc-transferases are now apparent. (i) There is overall sequence similarities of approximately 40–45%, with regions of high similarity (80%) in GalNAc-transferase motifs but little similarity among the N-terminal regions encoding the cytoplasmic tail, the putative signal anchor sequence, and the stem regions (1Clausen H.

Furthermore, the catalytic action of the different GalNAc-transferases can be cooperative, since glycosylation of certain acceptor sites in the MUC1 tandem repeat by one GalNAc-transferase is required before other sites can be glycosylated by another GalNActransferase (6Bennett E.P.

These data suggest that each GalNAc-transferase has distinct biological functions that are mainly determined by the kinetic properties and expression patterns of the enzymes. Many properties of the enzyme function are still not fully understood: the importance of sub-Golgi localization (11Rottger S. White R. Wandall H.H. Bennett E.P. Stark A. Olivo J.-C. Whitehouse C. Berger E.G. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of large variation in the length of stem regions (1Clausen H. Bennett E.P.

GalNAc-T3 exhibits acceptor substrate specificities not seen with other enzymes, including glycosylation of a single in vivo defined O-glycosylation site in fibronectin, which forms the oncofetal fibronectin isoform (14Matsuura H. Takio K. Titani K. Greene T. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The unique specificity of GalNAc-T3 for the oncofetal fibronectin peptide was reproduced with plasma fibronectin, clearly indicating the importance of the primary sequence context as a major factor in determining O-glycosylation (10Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P. Nielsen P.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadamitriou J. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23503-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the specificity of GalNAc-T3 for the HIV sequence has been confirmed in vivo. A reporter construct containing the acceptor sequence was O-glycosylated only if GalNAc-T3 was co-expressed in the host cell (15Nehrke K. Hagen T.K.G. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that specificity in vitro reflects in vivo specificity. Recent studies with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to human GalNAc-transferases demonstrated that GalNAc-T3 is not expressed in connective tissue cells in normal or tumor tissues or in a fibroblast cell line synthesizing oncofetal fibronectin (16Mandel U. Hassan H. Therkildsen M.H. Rygaard J. Jacobsen M. Juhl B.R. Dabelsteen E. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that GalNAc-T3 represents the native fibronectin GalNAc-transferase activity found in tumor tissues and fibroblast cell lines, as originally described by Matsuura et al. (17Matsuura H. Greene T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10472-10476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of an additional GalNAc-transferase with similar properties as GalNAc-T3 but with a different expression pattern. Here, we report the cloning and expression of such a novel human GalNAc-transferase, which appears to represent a high similarity duplicate gene of GalNAc-T3. The novel GalNAc-transferase, designated GalNAc-T6, displayed an acceptor substrate specificity similar to GalNAc-T3, although GalNAc-T6 showed better kinetic properties with the fibronectin substrate. The two GalNAc-transferases exhibit different expression patterns as analyzed by Northern analysis and immunocytology. GalNAc-T6 was expressed in a fibroblast cell line synthesizing oncofetal fibronectin. The existence of high similarity pairs of genes within the GalNAc-transferase gene family is significant to the biological function of this large gene family and of practical significance for studies of transgenic knock-out models. The dbEST data base at The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), was searched for sequences similar to the coding region of the human GalNAc-T3 gene (5Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using the tBLASTn and BLASTn algorithms. The 5′ region of GalNAc-T3, with no known similarity to other human GalNAc-transferases (bp 1–600), was used to identify a rat EST (GenBank™ accession number H32001) predicted to encode a protein sequence with 63% similarity to residues 99–181 of GalNAc-T3. The putative human counterpart of this rat sequence was isolated by PCR with a sense primer, EBHC500 (5′-AGCGGATCCACTCCTGCCTTCCGGGGTTC-3′), derived from the rat EST sequence, and an antisense primer, EBHC106N (5′-AGCGGATCCGTATTCGTCCATCCAIACITCTG-3′), derived from the conserved GalNAc-transferase motif (5Bennett E.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and spleen were screened by PCR with 0.5 μmprimers and library lysates containing 1 × 106plaque-forming units. A spleen λ ZAP (Stratagene) random-primed cDNA library was prepared from 2.0 μg of human spleen mRNA (CLONTECH) using a time saver cDNA kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and constructed as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR was performed by using 35 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 2 min under standard conditions. Two cDNA libraries derived from salivary glands and spleen yielded a single PCR product, whereas two libraries derived from the cell lines Colo205 and MKN45 gave no product. The PCR products from the salivary gland and spleen libraries were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were found to be identical. The identified novel human sequence (clone #1) covering the central part of a putative GalNAc-transferase gene was further studied by cloning 5′ and 3′ sequences using rapid cDNA library screening (5Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, panel B). Briefly, the spleen library was aliquoted into 20 sublibraries, and these were screened by PCR using primer pairs based on the identified novel sequence and the λZAP vector primers T3 and T7, and the products were confirmed by hybridization with either EBHC500 or EBHC505 (5′-AGCGGATCCACTCTGCCCCTCTGGACGGGC-3′). EBHC503 (5′-AGCGGATCCGACAAGACAGTGGTGGTGAGC-3′) was used for the 3′ PCR, and EBHC504 (5′-AGCGGATCCGGGTCTCCAGGGGGGTCCAC-3′) was used for the 5′ PCR (Fig. 1, panel B). PCR with EBHC503/T7 yielded a single product of 2 kbp for the 3′ sequence, and PCR with EBHC504/T3 gave a single product of 250 bp. Both products were blunt end-cloned and sequenced. The 3′ sequence contained an in-frame stop codon. The 5′ sequence had a potential open reading frame but was shorter than the coding region of GalNAc-T3 and had no translation initiation codon and hydrophobic sequences, suggesting the existence of further 5′ sequence. Attempts to obtain additional 5′ sequence information by use of various 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques failed. A P1 human foreskin genomic library (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Human Foreskin Fibroblast P1 Library) was screened using primer pairs EBHC500/EBHC504. Three clones were obtained from Genome Systems DMPC-HFF#1-235-B10 (P1-12423), DMPC-HFF#1-826-D3 (P1-12424), DMPC-HFF#1-994-B6 (P1-12425). DNA from P1 phage was prepared as recommended by Genome Systems Inc., and P1-12423 was selected for partial sequence analysis. The entire sequence of the open reading frame compiled from the PCR cDNA cloning strategy was confirmed with minor sequence corrections. The most 5′-coding sequence of the putative GalNAc-transferase gene was obtained by 5′ sequencing of the P1 DNA (Fig. 1, panel A). This sequence included a translation initiation codon, a putative cytoplasmic tail, and a putative hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning domain. The intron/exon organization of the gene was determined by comparing cDNA and P1 sequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on normal human lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes using procedures described previously (6Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Mirgorodskaya E.

Briefly, P1 DNA (P1-12423) was labeled with biotin-14-dATP, precipitated with human Cot 1 DNA, dissolved in hybridization solution (2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 10% dextran sulfate, 1% Tween 20, and 50% formamide, pH 7.0), and heat-denatured. Slides were incubated with the probe for 45 h, followed by immunochemical detection using avidin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and successive steps with rabbit-anti-FITC and mouse-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibodies. Slides were evaluated in a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope, and hybridization signals and chromosomes counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·2HCl (DAPI) were analyzed using the BDS-image™ software package (Oncor). An expression construct of a secreted form of the putative GalNAc-transferase gene, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T6-sol, was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using primers EBHC514 (5′-AGCGGATCCTGGACCTCATGCTGGAGGCCATG-3′) and EBHC511 (5′-AGCGGATCCTGGGGATGATCTGGGTCCTAGAC-3′) with Bam HI overhangs (Fig. 1, panel A), and the product was cloned into the vector pAcGP67 (Pharmingen) and fully sequenced. Salivary gland mRNA (CLONTECH) was used as template for reverse transcription-PCR. Control constructs included pAcGP67-GalNAc-T1-sol, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T2-sol, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T3-sol, pAcGP67-GalNAc-T4-sol, and pAcGP67-O2-sol, which were prepared as described previously (3White T.

Co-transfection of Sf9 cells with pAcGP67 constructs and BaculoGoldTMDNA was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 0.4 μg of construct was mixed with 0.1 μg of BaculoGoldTM DNA and co-transfected in Sf9 cells in 24-well plates. Ninety-six h post-transfection recombinant virus was amplified in 6-well plates at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:50. The titer of amplified virus was estimated by titration in 24-well plates with monitoring of GalNAc-transferase activities (5Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Standard assays were performed in 50 μl of total reaction mixtures containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 50 μm UDP[14C]GalNAc (2,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 200–500 μm acceptor peptide (see Tables I and II for structures), and 5–10 μl of culture supernatants. In some experiments, as indicated, purified recombinant GalNAc-transferase preparations were used. GalNAc-T6 was purified as described previously (10Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E.

Final purification to apparent homogeneity was performed on S12 gel filtration (Superose 12 pc3.2/30, Smart-System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purity and protein concentration of the final fractions were assessed by S12 gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific activity of the purified GalNAc-T6 was estimated to be 2.35 units/mg using 250 μmMuc1a (Table I) as the acceptor peptide. Previously, soluble forms of human GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3 were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to near homogeneity with specific activities of 0.6 unit/mg for GalNAc-T1, 0.5 unit/mg for GalNAc-T2, 0.5 unit/mg for GalNAc-T3, and 0.05 unit/mg for GalNAc-T4, measured using peptides derived from MUC2, MUC1, and MUC7 tandem repeats (6Bennett E.P.

Open table in a new tab Peptides were synthesized by ourselves, by Carlbiotech (Copenhagen), or Neosystems (Strasbourg), and quality was ascertained by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. For analysis of the donor substrate specificity, assays were performed with 100 μmUDP[14C]Gal or UDP[14C]GlcNAc (4,000 cpm/nmol). Products were routinely quantified by scintillation counting after Dowex-1 formic acid cycle chromatography. At least once for all combinations of enzyme sources and peptides, the products were evaluated by C-18 reverse phase chromatography (PC3.2/3 or mRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Smart System) with scintillation counting of peptide peak fractions. Peptides and products produced by in vitro glycosylation were confirmed by mass spectrometry, and reaction kinetics were monitored by capillary electrophoresis. Reaction mixtures for preparative glycosylation included 2 mm cold UDP-GalNAc and 25 μg of acceptor peptide in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated in the sample carousel of an Applied Biosystems model HT270 (Perkin-Elmer) at 30 °C, and injections were performed at 60-min intervals. Capillary zone electrophoresis was performed on coated fused silica capillaries, 72 cm × 50 μm, with 49 cm between sample injection and optical cell. Electrophoresis were performed at 30 °C using 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 2.5). Voltage across the capillary was 20 kV in positive mode with the anode at the injection side, and the runs were monitored at 210 nm. At the beginning of each cycle the capillary was flushed with 0.1 m NaOH for 2 min followed by flushing with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) for 4 min. After 8 h of reaction the glycopeptides were purified by C-18 high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Spectra were acquired on either Voyager-DE mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystem Inc.) equipped with delay extraction. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (25 mg/ml) dissolved in a 2:1 mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile. Samples dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of approximately 80 fmol–2 pmol/μl were prepared for analysis by placing 1 μl of sample solution on a probe tip followed by 1 μl of matrix. Multiple tissue northern (MTN) blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Cell line blots were prepared with total RNA isolated from human colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines SUIT2 and sublines (S2-007, S2-013, S2-020, S2-028, S2-CP9, and S2-VP10), PANC-1, HPAF, Capan-2, BxPC3, ASPC1, COLO 357, SW979, MiaPaca, HCG25, HT-29(+Gal), HT-29(+Glu), and the fibroblast line WI38, essentially as described (19Sutherlin M.E.

Twenty-five μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The soluble expression construct (containing bp 158 to 1869) was used as the GalNAc-T6 probe. The probe was random prime-labeled using [α-P32]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and oligo labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed as described previously (5Bennett E.P.

A peptide with antibacterial activity from the tick gut contents was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was 3,205.7 Da, measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence was obtained by Edman degradation and showed that the peptide was identical to a fragment of the bovine α-hemoglobin. A synthetic peptide based on the sequence obtained showed characterization data identical to those of the isolated material, confirming its structure. The synthetic peptide was active in micromolar concentrations against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. These data led us to conclude that the antibacterial activity detected in tick gut contents is the result of enzymatic processing of a host protein, hemoglobin. This activity may be used by ticks as a defense against microorganisms.

This activity may be used by ticks as a defense against microorganisms. trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight Ticks are obligatory blood-sucking arthropods found throughout the world and are among the most important vectors of human and animal diseases. The diversity of pathogenic organisms transmitted by ticks includes fungi, viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, and protozoa and exceeds that found in all other arthropods (1Sonenshine D.E. Biology of Ticks. Oxford University Press, New York/Oxford1991: 3-12Google Scholar). It is intriguing how many different organisms survive inside the ticks, and little is known about the mechanisms they use to avoid recognition by the defense system of the vector. Animals defend themselves against microorganisms and parasites through a number of cellular and humoral mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides belong to the latter class, and despite the fact that these peptides are very well characterized in insects and limulus (2Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Response in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 40-66Google Scholar, 3Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), they are poorly studied in arachnids. The first biochemical study of antimicrobial peptides in arachnids showed the presence of an antibacterial peptide in the hemolymph of the scorpion, Leiurus quinquestriatus (4Cociancich S. Goyffon M. Bontems F. Bulet P. Bouet F. Menez A. Hoffmann J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The sequence of the isolated peptide has a high similarity to that of a defensin isolated from the dragonfly, Aeschna cyanea, which belongs to an ancient insect order, Odonata. Three distinct antimicrobial peptides were isolated and characterized from another scorpion, Androctonus australis (5Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Two of them are new peptides, androctonin and buthinin, and the other one is a representative of the insect defensin. Recently, lycotoxins I and II, which have been identified in the venom of the spider, Lycosa carolinensis, have shown potent antimicrobial activity against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (6Yan L. Adams M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2059-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two hemolymph factors of the tick, Dermacentor variabilis, have activity against Bacillus subtilis (7Johns R. Sonenshine D.E. Hynes W.L. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of these factors has a molecular mass of 14.5 kDa and was tentatively identified as lysozyme, in agreement with the work of Kuhn and Haug (8Kuhn K.H. Haug T. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 493-504Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) which showed a lysozyme-like immunoreactivity in tick hemocytes. This antibacterial activity was increased significantly after challenge with bacteria (7Johns R. Sonenshine D.E. Hynes W.L. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We studied antimicrobial active compounds originating in the tick, Boophilus microplus. This tick is an ectoparasite of cattle and a vector of pathogens such as Babesia bigemmina, Babesia bovis, and Anaplasma marginale. In addition, B. microplus causes severe production losses because its bites usually result in bovine blood loss and leather damage (1Sonenshine D.E. Biology of Ticks. Oxford University Press, New York/Oxford1991: 3-12Google Scholar). We propose that a knowledge of these antimicrobial compounds will lead to better control of ticks and of the pathogens they transmit. Here we report that the antimicrobial activity present in gut contents of the tick is a fragment of the bovine α-hemoglobin. The B. microplus colony (Porto Alegre strain, Babesia sp. free) was obtained from the Biotechnology Department and Center of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Ticks were reared on Holstein-Friesian calves in the Animal Facilities at the Biomedical Sciences Institute of São Paulo University, Brazil. Partially engorged adult females were removed from the host after approximately 21 days post-infestation and were used for all subsequent hemolymph collections and inoculation experiments. Fully engorged adult females dropped from the host were used for gut contents collection. Bacillus megaterium (ATCC 10778), B. subtilis (ATCC 6633), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC 26108), Serratia marcescens (ATCC 4112), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IAL1025) was obtained from Adolfo Lutz Institute Culture Collection, São Paulo, Brazil. Escherichia coli D31 and Enterobacter cloacae K12 were provided by Dr. H. G. Boman, Stockholm University, Sweden. E. coli SBS 363, Micrococcus luteus A270, and Neurospora crassa were obtained from Dr. P. Bulet, CNRS, Strasbourg, France. M. luteus was obtained from the Pharmaceutic Sciences Institute of São Paulo University, Brazil. Aspergillus nidulans (UT448) was obtained from the Utrecht University Collection, Holland.Candida albicans (MDM8) was obtained from the Microbiology Department Collection, Biomedical Sciences Institute of São Paulo University, Brazil. For hemolymph collections, a small cut was made with a hypodermic needle on the dorsal cuticle at the posterior region of the ticks. Hemolymph was recovered with a glass capillary after gentle pressure to the body of the tick. Hemolymph samples were stored at −20 °C. The gut contents were obtained from ticks within 24 h from the time they had dropped from the calves. The gut contents were collected using a Pasteur pipette, diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 0.15 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, and stored at −20 °C. One μl of bacterial suspension (102−105 cells) was injected into the spiracles, anus, or genital apertures of partially engorged ticks with a Hamilton syringe. Different bacteria strains, M. luteus, E. cloacae, or E. coli, were inoculated. Hemolymph collected at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation was either streaked onto agar plates for bacterial growth detection or stored at −20 °C for antibacterial activity analysis. Granulocytes were isolated from bovine blood as described by Carlson and Kaneko (9Carlson G.P. Kaneko J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Neutrophils granules were obtained according to Genaro et al. (10) and extracted for 2 h in an ice bath with 0.2m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 5 mm EDTA. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 6 N NaOH, and the insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was analyzed for antibacterial activity. Erythrocytes were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated bovine blood using a Ficoll-paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient according to the manufacturer. After centrifugation (400 × g, 30 min, 22 °C), the cell suspension was washed and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (2.6 × 1010 cells/ml). Erythrocytes were lysed as described by Carlson and Kaneko (9Carlson G.P. Kaneko J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was concentrated 2.5 times in a vacuum centrifuge. Two different approaches were used to evaluate the antibacterial activity, an inhibition zone assay (11Hoffmann D. Hultmark D. Boman H.G. Insect Biochem. 1981; 11: 537-548Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and a liquid growth inhibition assay (12Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liquid growth inhibition assay was used for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of the synthetic peptide. The lowest concentration that caused 100% of growth inhibition was recorded. The antifungal activity was detected using the liquid growth inhibition assay described in Fehlbaum et al. (13Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations tested for synthetic peptide were in the range of 0.65–21 μm. A M. luteus culture was incubated with different concentrations of gut contents or synthetic peptide using the assay described by Bulet et al.(12Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture that had total growth inhibition at the lowest concentration of the samples was plated on nutrient agar. The number of colony-forming units was determined after an overnight incubation at 37 °C. The synthetic peptide was tested at the concentration in the range of 0.65–21 μm, and the gut contents were diluted from 80 to 1280 times. The gut contents (10 ml) collected from fully engorged ticks was mixed with 0.15 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0 (1:1, v/v), and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried material was suspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)1 and heated to 80 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA. The elution was performed with different concentrations (20, 30, 40, and 95%) of ACN in 0.1% TFA. The antibacterial peptide eluted in 30% ACN was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography in HPLC. The column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and the presence of antibacterial activity was determined by the inhibition zone assay. The peptides dissolved in acidified water (0.1% TFA) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry using the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Positive ion MALDI mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker BIFLEX time-of-flight mass spectrometer (isolated peptide from the tick) and on a Micromass spectrometer model TofSpec S.E. (synthetic peptide). Automated Edman degradation of the pure isolated peptide and detection of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were performed on a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Model 473A). The peptide was synthesized manually by using the t-Boc strategy on a methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (substitution level of 0.79 mmol/g) (14Miranda A. Koerber S.C. Gulyas J.L., S.L. Craig A.G.

Res. 1997; 50: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The t-Boc amino acids were protected as follows: Lys (ε-2-Cl-Z), Ser (Bzl), Tyr (2-Br-Z), Thr (Bzl), His (Tos)DCHA, and Asp (β-OcHex). After peptide chain assembly was completed, the resulting peptide resin was treated with HF, 1% anisol for 90 min at 0 °C on Peptide Institute Inc. Teflon equipment. The crude peptide was precipitated with anhydrous diethyl ether and extracted with 5% acetic acid, and the resulting solution was lyophilized. Purification of 360 mg of the crude peptide was achieved on a semipreparative Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient of 15–33% ACN in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. The fractions containing the peptide as determined by analytical reversed-phase HPLC under isocratic conditions (1.4 ml/min, 28% ACN in 0.1% TFA) were pooled and lyophilized. Peptide purity and identity were confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC, amino acid analysis, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry measurement. Amino acid analysis was performed on a 7300 Beckman analyzer after 24 h 6 N HCl hydrolysis in a PicoTag workstation (Waters). Antibacterial and antifungal activities were detected in the hemolymph and gut contents of noninfected adult ticks, B. microplus (Table I). The antibacterial activity was detected only against Gram-positive strains. The antifungal activity was observed against two filamentous fungi, A. nidulans and N. crassa, and against the yeast, C. albicans.Table IAntimicrobial activity spectrum of tick neutrophil and samplesBacteria strainDiametersHGNmmGram-positive M. luteus65ND B. subtilis586 B. megaterium464Gram-negative P. aeruginosaNDND14 E. coli D31NDND6 E. cloacaeNDND4Fungi strainGrowth inhibitionHG C. albicans++ A. nidulans++ N. crassa++Hemolymph (H) (2 μl) and gut contents (G) (2 μl) from ticks and neutrophil granules (N) from bovine were applied in the wells of thin agar plates containing bacteria.

Open table in a new tab Hemolymph (H) (2 μl) and gut contents (G) (2 μl) from ticks and neutrophil granules (N) from bovine were applied in the wells of thin agar plates containing bacteria.

Hemolymph (10 μl) and gut contents (10 μl) were applied into wells of a microplate and incubated for 48 h. Growth of fungi was observed microscopically. ND, activity not detected. The level of antibacterial activity found in the hemolymph does not increase after inoculations of 102-105 of M. luteus, E. cloacae, or E. coli cells via injection into the spiracle, anus, or genital aperture (data not shown). We interpret this to indicate that the antibacterial activity in the tick is constitutive and does not respond to bacterial inoculation. We analyzed the number of bacteria in inoculated adult ticks by streaking hemolymph onto agar plates. The number of bacteria in the hemolymph markedly decreased after 24–48 h inoculation (data not shown). Neutrophil granules have a marked antibacterial activity (10Gennaro R. Dolzani L. Romeo D. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 684-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gennaro R. Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3142-3146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that the antibacterial activity found in tick hemolymph and gut contents originated from cells present in the host blood. Using the inhibition zone assay, we showed that bovine cells are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while the tick preparations are active only against Gram-positive bacteria, indicating that the tick antibacterial activity most likely does not come from the bovine neutrophils (Table I). To isolate the active material from the gut contents, 10 ml of a sample collected from fully engorged females were loaded onto reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges equilibrated with 5% acidified ACN. The active fraction eluted with 30% ACN was loaded on a HPLC column Resource-RPC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient of 12–36% ACN in 0.1% TFA over 30 min (Fig. 1 A). The active fraction eluted with 31.5% acetonitrile was then loaded on a Pep-RPC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient of 12–48% ACN in 0.1% TFA over 30 min (Fig. 1 B). The active fraction eluted at 30.7% ACN was reloaded on the same column with a gradient of 15–33% ACN in 0.1% TFA over 30 min (Fig. 1 C). The active fraction eluted with 27% ACN was finally purified to homogeneity on a Vydac C18 reversed-phase column with a gradient of 3–57% ACN in 0.1% TFA over 30 min (Fig. 1 D). The molecular mass of the purified peptide, eluted with 40.8% acetonitrile, was 3,205.7 Da measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The peak at 1,601.7 Da corresponds to the double charged ion (Fig.2 A). Edman degradation yielded the following peptide sequence of 29 amino acids: FLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSAQVKGHGAK. The theoretical molecular mass and pI are 3,206.6 and 9.53, respectively, calculated by the pI/Mw program at ExPASy (Molecular Biology Server of the Geneva University Hospital and the University of Geneva, Switzerland). The comparison of this peptide with a Swiss Protein Database showed 100% identity to the bovine α-hemoglobin fragment 33–61. With the aim of confirming the identity and biological properties of the isolated peptide, we synthesized this peptide corresponding to the α-hemoglobin fragment (33–61). Purity of the synthetic peptide was confirmed by reversed phase-HPLC (90–95% pure), mass spectrometry measurement, and amino acid analysis. The molecular mass obtained by MALDI-TOF was 3,204.3 Da (Fig.2 B). The amino acid analysis results, with the expected values given in parentheses, were: Asp, 1.03 (1.00); Glu, 1.06 (1.00); Gly, 3.01 (3.00); Ala, 2.25 (2.00); Tyr, 0.83 (1.00); Val, 0.77 (1.00); Thr, 2.79 (3.00); Ser, 2.28 (3.00); Pro, 1.16 (2.00); Leu, 2.65 (2.00); Phe, 3.29 (4.00); Lys, 3.02 (3.00); and His, 2.93 (3.00). The synthetic peptide in micromolar concentrations was found to be active against all Gram-positive bacteria tested as well as against two different species of yeast and one filamentous fungi (TableII). Furthermore, intact bovine hemoglobin does not have activity against M. luteus in concentrations up to 30 μm.Table IIAntimicrobial activity spectrum of synthetic hemoglobin fragmentMicroorganismMICμmBacteria strain Gram-negativeP. aeruginosaNDE. coli 363NDE. coli D31NDE. cloacaeNDS. marcescensND Gram-positiveM. luteus A2705M. luteus5S. epidermidis21 Fungi strainC. albicans5S. cerevisiae11A. nidulans1.3The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the synthetic peptide were determined by liquid growth inhibition.

The incubations of the M. luteus culture with the synthetic peptide (5 μm) or the gut contents (diluted 320 times) showed total growth inhibition. They were platted on nutrient agar, and no colony-forming unit was detected after overnight incubation, indicating that the effect of both samples is bactericidal. We investigated whether erythrocytes lysed in vitro have antibacterial activity because it is known that extensive proteolytic degradation of hemoglobin takes place inside these cells (17Ivanov V.T. Karelin A.A. Philippova M.M. Nazimov I.V. Pletnev V.Z. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The sample containing lysed erythrocytes was analyzed in liquid growth inhibition assay (12Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No activity against the bacterial strain tested (M. luteus) was observed. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides constitute an important part of the humoral immune system of arthropods. In this study, we detected antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph and gut contents of noninfected ticks. This activity is not increased in the hemolymph of experimentally bacteria-infected ticks, and we conclude that it is constitutive as opposed to the induction observed in insects. Similar results were reported in other arachnids, such as the scorpion, A. australis (5Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, Johns et al. (7Johns R. Sonenshine D.E. Hynes W.L. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) observed an increase of antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of the bacteria-infected tick D. variabilis. A peptide with activity against M. luteus was purified from the gut contents to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence showed that it was a fragment (33–61) of the bovine α-hemoglobin. The synthetic peptide showed characterization data identical to those of the isolated native peptide, confirming its identity by mass spectrometry measurement and amino acid analysis. It was active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi in micromolar concentrations, being bactericidal on our tested bacteria strain (M. luteus). The predicted secondary structure of the peptide does not display amphipathic alpha-helix character typical of basic antimicrobial pore-forming peptide structure (18Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 19Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). An investigation of the structural requirements of the α-hemoglobin fragment 33–61 would be important for the understanding of its antimicrobial activity. Whole hemoglobin did not show antibacterial activity in our experiments although an early report by Hobson and Hirsch (20Hobson D. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1958; 107: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed such activity in vitro. However, according to these authors an antimicrobial function in vivo is unlikely because the conditions used in the assays are so far from those existing in tissues. In a recent review, Ivanov et al. (17Ivanov V.T. Karelin A.A. Philippova M.M. Nazimov I.V. Pletnev V.Z. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) discussed the role of hemoglobin as a source of biologically active peptides. Apparently, the generation of hemoglobin fragments starts inside the erythrocytes. The primary proteolysis gives rise to peptides with 30 amino acid residues. The next processing step occurs with the excretion of newly formed shorter peptides from the erythrocytes. The function of these peptides would be regulatory and complementary to the conventional hormonal and neuromodulatory systems. More than 150 established amino acid sequences of endogenous hemoglobin fragments are available; however, in no case has an antibacterial activity been mentioned. A literature search for hemoglobin fragments that have some structural identity to the peptide isolated from the tick gut contents revealed six peptides: one isolated from pig hypothalamus (21Schally A.V. Huang W.Y. Redding T.W. Arimura A. Coy D.H. Chihara K. Chang R.C. Raymond V. Labrie F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), three others from human cerebellum (22Slemmon J.R. Hughes C.M. Campbell G.A. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two from rat hippocampus (23Slemmon J.R. Wengenack T.M. Flood D.G. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Table III). The pig hypothalamus peptide (PHP) includes the amino acid residues corresponding to fragment 33–46 of the α-hemoglobin and has an activity related to release of corticotropin in vitro (21Schally A.V. Huang W.Y. Redding T.W. Arimura A. Coy D.H. Chihara K. Chang R.C. Raymond V. Labrie F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The human cerebellum peptides (HCP1, HCP2, and HCP3) have sequences starting at amino acid residue 33 of α-hemoglobin, but the C-terminal amino acids are not known (they have been used as peptide markers of Alzheimer's disease) (22Slemmon J.R. Hughes C.M. Campbell G.A. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat hippocampus peptides (RHP1 and RHP2) sequences are not completely defined and have been used as markers of ischemia (23Slemmon J.R. Wengenack T.M. Flood D.G.

Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because we were not able to detect any antibacterial activity against M. luteus in lysed erythrocytes, we suppose that the active hemoglobin fragment is originated inside the tick gut, probably through enzymatic cleavage at phenylalanine residue. It has been reported that globin in the Schistosoma mansoni gut is degraded to peptides containing phenylalanine at their amino-terminal residue by a hemoglobinase (24Sauer M.C. Senft A.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1972; 42: 205-220Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We are currently interested in purifying and characterizing the putative enzyme responsible for the hemoglobin degradation to antimicrobial peptides. The function of hemoglobin as source of amino acids for blood-sucking insects and ticks is well known. In addition, hemoglobin may be utilized as a regulatory molecule. Azambuja et al. (25Azambuja P. Feder D. Garcia E.S. J. Insect Physiol. 1993; 29: 833-837Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that hemoglobin is important for ecdysteroid production and for the establishment of the ecdysis process in the hematophagous triatomine insect Rhodnius prolixus. Fraidenraich et al. (26Fraidenraich D. Pena C. Isola E.L. Lammel E.M. Coso O. Anel A.D. Pongor S. Baralle F. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This peptide induced the differentiation of T. cruzi epimastigotes to metacyclic trypomastigotes in vitro, through activation of adenylyl cyclase. Garcia et al. (27Garcia E.S. Gonzalez M.S. Azambuja P. Baralle F.E. Fraidenraich D. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Exp. Parasitology. 1995; 81: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that hemoglobin and synthetic peptides corresponding to 30–49 and 35–73 of the αD globin chain induced T. cruzi metacyclogenesis in the R. prolixus gut. It would be interesting to study the effect of the synthetic peptide (α-hemoglobin fragment 33–61) on the development of B. bovis and B. bigemmina, the protozoa transmitted by B. microplus to the cattle (1Sonenshine D.E. Biology of Ticks. Oxford University Press, New York/Oxford1991: 3-12Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose that the ticks utilize a host protein, hemoglobin, to its own defense against microorganisms. The utilization of host proteins for microorganism defense could be a mechanism used by other ticks, because a rabbit lysozyme in the tick Ornithodorus hemolymph has been purified. 2S. Chernysh, personal communication. We do not know if the hemoglobin fragment that we have isolated from the gut contents and characterized in this study is also present in the hemolymph. It is known, however, that proteins from the host blood pass directly from the gut contents into the tick hemolymph, either intact or separated into subunits (28Ben Yakir D. J. Med. Entomol. 1989; 26: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because of this, we are now investigating the possible recovery of this peptide from tick hemolymph. Finally, we are considering whether the hemoglobin fragment can have antimicrobial function in vertebrates, this could be an important effector of the innate immune response to kill microbial invaders.

James (University of California, Irvine, USA) for the critical reading of the manuscript. We thank also Dr. P.

https://openalex.org/W1994810882,"In the standard model of cytokine-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family signaling to the cell nucleus, it is assumed that STAT3 is recruited to the cytoplasmic side of the cell surface receptor complex from within a cytosolic monomer pool. By using Superose-6 gel-filtration chromatography, we have discovered that there is little monomeric STAT3 (91 kDa) in the cytosol of liver cells (human hepatoma Hep3B cell line and rat liver). The bulk of STAT3 (and STAT1, STAT5a, and -b) was present in the cytosol as high molecular mass complexes in two broad distributions in the size range 200–400 kDa (“statosome I”) and 1–2 MDa (“statosome II”). Upon treatment of Hep3B cells with interleukin-6 (IL-6) for 30 min (i) cytosolic tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was found to be in complexes of size ranging from 200–400 kDa to 1–2 MDa; (ii) a small pool of monomeric STAT3 and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 eluting at 80–100 kDa was observed, and (iii) most of the cytoplasmic DNA-binding competent STAT3 (the so-called SIF-A “homodimer”) co-eluted with catalase at 230 kDa. In order to identify the protein components of the 200–400-kDa statosome I cytosolic complexes, we used the novel technique of antibody-subtracted differential protein display using anti-STAT3 antibody. Eight polypeptides in the size range from 20 to 114 kDa co-shifted with STAT3; three of these (p60, p20a, and p20b) were co-shifted in an IL-6-dependent manner. In-gel tryptic fragmentation and mass spectroscopy identified the major IL-6-dependent STAT3-co-shifted p60 protein as the chaperone GRP58/ER-60/ERp57. Taken together, these data (i) emphasize the absence of a detectable STAT3 monomer pool in the cytosol of cytokine-free liver cells as posited by the standard model, and (ii) suggest an alternative model for STAT signaling in which STAT3 proteins function in the cytoplasm as heteromeric complexes with accessory scaffolding proteins, including the chaperone GRP58.

Many cytokines, such as the interferons, interleukins (IL),1 and hematopoietic growth factors, are currently in widespread therapeutic use against various forms of human cancer (3Mackiewicz, A., and Sehgal, P. B. (eds) (1998) Molecular Aspects of Cancer and Its Therapy, MCBU Series, Birkhauser Verlag, BaselGoogle Scholar). Some cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), are invariably present at the host-tumor interface (1Sehgal, P. B., Grieninger, G., and Tosato, G. (eds) (1989) Ann. N. Y. Acad.

(eds) (1998) Molecular Aspects of Cancer and Its Therapy, MCBU Series, Birkhauser Verlag, BaselGoogle Scholar). A common feature of many cytokines is that they engage the class of “non-tyrosine kinase” cell surface receptors that signal to the cell nucleus by activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Fig. 1 A, the “standard” model; figure based on reviews by Heinrich and colleagues (4Heinrich P.C.

The cytokine IL-6 is a major systemic mediator of the acute phase response to infection and injury which includes increased production of various acute phase plasma proteins by the liver (e.g. fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, α1-antichymotrypsin, etc) and enhanced immune function (increased B-cell differentiation and T-cell activation) (1Sehgal, P.

In the case of IL-6, the cytokine binds to the α-chain (“IL-6Rα”) of the receptor (either in the cell surface-attached IL-6Rα form or the soluble IL-6Rα form), and this binary complex then binds cell surface-attached gp130 inducing dimerization of the latter (Fig. 1 A) (1Sehgal, P.

This dimerization of gp130 triggers activation of JAK family tyrosine kinases (primarily JAK1, also JAK2 and Tyk2) associated with the cytoplasmic tail of gp130, by Tyr phosphorylation in trans of the JAK kinases thus leading to their activation (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E.

Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The activated JAK kinases carry out Tyr phosphorylation of up to five discrete “docking” sites in the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 (8Stahl N. Farrugella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong A. Darnell Jr., J.E.

These Tyr-phosphorylated docking sites in gp130 are thought to “recruit” monomeric STAT3 (91 kDa) and to a lesser extent STAT1 via the src homology domain 2 of the respective STAT proteins (Fig. 1 A) (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). This “recruitment” event is followed by Tyr phosphorylation (PY) of the STAT proteins by the JAK kinases to give PY-STAT3, the departure of PY-STAT3 from gp130 by an unknown mechanism, dimerization of the PY-STATs, and the movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of PY-STAT3 through an unknown mechanism (Fig.1 A) (4Heinrich P.C.

In the nuclear compartment, PY-STAT dimers bind target DNA motifs and other transcription factors and thus modulate gene expression (Fig. 1 A) (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F.

Additional Ser phosphorylation of STAT proteins modulates the DNA binding competence of these signal transducers (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem.

Recently, the x-ray structures of the amino-terminal part of STAT4 (123 amino acids), of STAT3β (a partially truncated version of STAT3) bound to its cognate DNA site, and that of STAT1 bound to DNA (10Vinkemeier U.

The IL-6-responsive elements in the promoters of many plasma protein genes contain STAT3-binding sites, and STAT3 is the major signal transducer protein involved (reviewed in Refs. 1Sehgal, P. B., Grieninger, G., and Tosato, G. (eds) (1989) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 557, 1-582Google Scholar, 2Mackiewiez, A., Koj, A., and Sehgal, P. B. (eds) (1995) Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). More generally, for IL-6-type cytokines in diverse cell types, STAT3 (originally called acute phase response factor in 1993 (13Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar)) is the major signal transducer from the cell membrane to the cell nucleus, with the liver (the hepatocyte) being a major physiological site for IL-6 action (Fig. 1) (1Sehgal, P.

STAT3, which is ubiquitously present in diverse cell types, is also the major signal transducer for a large number of additional cytokines and growth factors (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E.

Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar).Stat3 gene knock-out in mice is embryonically lethal, attesting to the non-redundant role for this member of the STAT family (reviewed in Ref. 4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In the standard model presented in Fig. 1 A (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E.

Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), it is assumed that STAT3 is recruited to the receptor complex from within a cytosolic monomer pool. However, no experimental data exist in the literature to support this assumption. The model in Fig. 1 A usually depicts at least the transient presence of phosphotyrosine- and phosphoserine-containing dimers of STAT3 in the cytoplasmic compartment which should be DNA-binding competent. However, except for an early study (13Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), there is little information about DNA-binding competent STAT3 in the cytoplasmic compartment. We have previously reported that the wild-type form of the transcription factor p53 can function as a transcriptional repressor and can inhibit the response of human hepatoma Hep3B and HepG2 cells to IL-6 (17Santhanam U. Ray A. Sehgal P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of the response of hepatoma cells to IL-6 by wild-type p53 led to the discovery of a novel cellular phenomenon that we called “STAT masking” (21Rayanade R.J.

Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we observed that STAT3 immunofluorescence was markedly reduced in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments when human hepatoma Hep3B cells lines constitutively expressing the p53-Val-135 temperature-sensitive mutant of p53 (mutant at 37 °C and wild-type-like at 32.5 °C) grown at 32.5 °C for at least 20 h were treated with IL-6 (21Rayanade R.J.

Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). This dramatic and marked loss of immunological accessibility of cellular STAT3, without any degradation of the protein per se, occurred within 20–30 min of IL-6 addition and lasted 2–4 h (STAT masking; Refs. 21Rayanade R.J.

Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). As the simplest hypothesis, STAT masking suggested the accumulation of a p53-Val-135-inducible gene product(s) which formed a complex with STAT3 in an IL-6-dependent manner and thus “masked” its immunological accessibility (21Rayanade R.J. Patel K. Ndubuisi M. Sharma S. Omura S. Etlinger J.D. Pine R. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4659-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,22Rayanade R.J. Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). In this article we report experimental data indicating that almost all STAT3 in the cytosol of cytokine-free or IL-6-treated hepatocytes exists in the form of high molecular mass protein assemblies of size in the range 200–400 kDa (“statosome I”) and 1–2 MDa (“statosome II”). We also extend these observations to STAT1, STAT5a, and STAT5b for both the Hep3B and primary rat liver cytoplasmic compartments. We devised the novel technique of antibody-subtracted differential protein display using anti-STAT3 antibody to help identify protein components of the statosome I complexes. Eight polypeptides in the size range from 20 to 114 kDa co-shifted with STAT3; three of these (p60, p20a, and p20b) were co-shifted in an IL-6-dependent manner. The p60 protein was identified to be the chaperone GRP58/ER-60/ERp57. Taken together, the new data (i) emphasize the absence of a detectable STAT3 monomer pool in the cytosol of cytokine-free liver cells as posited by the standard model, and (ii) suggest an alternative model for STAT signaling in which STAT3 proteins function in the cytoplasm as complexes with novel accessory scaffolding proteins, including the chaperone GRP58. The p53-free parental human hepatoma Hep3B cell line, a series of 11 stably transfected cell lines constitutively expressing p53-Val-135, and 7 control cell lines expressing pSVneo alone have been described earlier (20Wang L.

Aliquots (200 μl) of 100,000 × g cytosol or the nuclear extracts previously frozen at −70 °C (350–400 μg total protein for each extract) were rapidly thawed and re-clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C just before gel filtration chromatography. The extracts were fractionated by Superose-6 sieving chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system, with separation range from 5 MDa to 50 kDa) in the cold (4 °C). Loading and elution of the FPLC system was carried out in ELB buffer. One-milliliter fractions were collected, each divided into several 100-μl aliquots and stored at −70 °C until analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2052268330,"Caveolin-3, a muscle-specific caveolin-related protein, is the principal structural protein of caveolae membrane domains in striated muscle cell types (cardiac and skeletal). Autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) in humans is due to mutations within the caveolin-3 gene: (i) a 9-base pair microdeletion that removes three amino acids within the caveolin scaffolding domain (DeltaTFT) or (ii) a missense mutation within the membrane spanning domain (P --> L). The molecular mechanisms by which these two mutations cause muscular dystrophy remain unknown. Here, we investigate the phenotypic behavior of these caveolin-3 mutations using heterologous expression. Wild type caveolin-3 or caveolin-3 mutants were transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 (DeltaTFT or P --> L) were primarily retained at the level of a perinuclear compartment that we identified as the Golgi complex in double-labeling experiments, while wild type caveolin-3 was efficiently targeted to the plasma membrane. In accordance with these observations, caveolin-3 mutants formed oligomers of a much larger size than wild type caveolin-3 and were excluded from caveolae-enriched membrane fractions as seen by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In addition, these caveolin-3 mutants were expressed at significantly lower levels and had a dramatically shortened half-life of approximately 45-60 min. However, caveolin-3 mutants were palmitoylated to the same extent as wild type caveolin-3, indicating that targeting to the plasma membrane is not required for palmitoylation of caveolin-3. In conclusion, we show that LGMD-1C mutations lead to formation of unstable high molecular mass aggregates of caveolin-3 that are retained within the Golgi complex and are not targeted to the plasma membrane. Consistent with its autosomal dominant form of genetic transmission, we demonstrate that LGMD-1C mutants of caveolin-3 behave in a dominant-negative fashion, causing the retention of wild type caveolin-3 at the level of the Golgi. These data provide a molecular explanation for why caveolin-3 levels are down-regulated in patients with this form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C)."
https://openalex.org/W1996604197,"In mammalian selenoprotein mRNAs, the highly structured 3′ UTR contains selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements that are required for the recognition of UGA as the selenocysteine codon. Our previous work demonstrated a tight correlation between codon-specific translational read-through and the activity of a 120-kDa RNA-binding protein that interacted specifically with the SECIS element in the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase mRNA. This study reports the RNA binding and biochemical properties of this protein, SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2). We detected SBP2 binding activity in liver, hepatoma cell, and testis extracts from which SBP2 has been purified by anion exchange and RNA affinity chromatography. This scheme has allowed us to identify a 120-kDa polypeptide that co-elutes with SBP2 binding activity from wild-type but not mutant RNA affinity columns. A characterization of SBP2 biochemical properties reveals that SBP2 binding is sensitive to oxidation and the presence of heparin, rRNA, and poly(G). SBP2 activity elutes with a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa during gel filtration chromatography, suggesting the existence of a large functional complex. Direct cross-linking and competition experiments demonstrate that the minimal phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase 3′ UTR binding site is between 82 and 102 nucleotides, which correlates with the minimal sequence necessary for translational read-through. SBP2 also interacts specifically with the minimally functional 3′ UTR of another selenoprotein mRNA, deiodinase 1.

In the case of bacteria, the structured cis-sequence (termed bacterial selenocysteine insertion sequence) lies immediately downstream from an in-frame opal codon (UGA) which directs the insertion of Sec (3Huttenhofer A. Westhof E. Bock A. RNA. 1996; 2: 354-366PubMed Google Scholar). This process requires the activity of a specialized translation elongation factor (SELB) that interacts specifically with both the downstream sequences and with the selenocysteyl-tRNASec (4Baron C. Heider J. Bock A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4181-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Chen G.F. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Biol.

The synthesis of selenocysteyl-tRNA requires the action of three other gene products: SELA, which converts seryl-tRNASec to selenocysteyl-tRNASec (8Forchhammer K. Bock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6324-6328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); SELC, which encodes the Sec tRNA (9Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Bock A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); and SELD, which synthesizes the selenocysteine donor selenophosphate (10Ehrenreich A. Forchhammer K. Tormay P. Veprek B. Bock A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The partially characterized process of Sec insertion into mammalian selenoproteins, although sharing some fundamental properties of the prokaryotic system, has many distinguishing features. First, the cis-sequences reside in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) far downstream from the UGA codon (11Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These sequences are predicted to form a stable stem-loop (see Fig. 1) and contain discrete, highly conserved selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements that include the following: three consecutive, unpaired A residues in the terminal loop; AUGA in the stem 8–10 nucleotides (nt) 5′ of the terminal loop; and GA in the 3′ region of the stem across from the AUGA element (11Berry M.J.

Recent structural analyses have focused on the sequences in and around the AUGA and GA SECIS elements that have been reported to form a non-Watson-Crick duplex (14Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar, 15Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). The distance between the UGA codon and the SECIS elements is naturally variable between 500 and 5300 nt and therefore may represent an example of 3′-mediated translational regulation similar to that mediated by poly(A) and other regulatory sequences found in various 3′ UTRs (reviewed in Ref. 16Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Most selenoproteins are involved in redox reactions in which the active site Sec residue plays a central role in catalysis. This class of selenoproteins includes the bacterial formate dehydrogenases, the mammalian deiodinases, and glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), including phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx). Our studies are focused primarily on the synthesis of PHGPx, the enzymatic activity of which may play a role in the detoxification of pathogenic oxidized lipids (17Thomas J.P. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Girotti A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is expressed in most tissues but is particularly abundant in testis, where it is targeted to the mitochondrial and nuclear membranes (18Godeas C. Sandri G. Panfili E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26993-26999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Outside the realm of oxidized lipids, the apparent association of a significant fraction of PHGPx with chromatin (20Godeas C. Tramer F. Micali F. Roveri A. Maiorino M. Nisii C. Sandri G. Panfili E. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1996; 59: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is of particular interest in light of recent data that suggests that oxidized DNA may be a substrate for PHGPx enzymatic activity (21Bao Y. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify factors that may be involved in regulating Sec insertion, several groups have identified SECIS binding activities by both gel retardation and UV cross-linking studies. To date, a mammalian homolog of the bacterial selB gene has not been discovered, but direct binding studies using mammalian SECIS elements have identified factors that are potentially involved in linking the 3′ UTR to its potential targets such as ribosomes or tRNA. Shen et al. (22Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have identified an RNA-protein complex that requires a perfectly base paired stem. This complex appears to consist of 55- and 65-kDa proteins, as determined by UV cross-linking analysis. Mutations, including a deletion of only 6 nucleotides in the nonconserved basal stem, that inhibit this binding activity correspond with those resulting in the loss of GPx expression in vivo found in previous studies (13Shen Q. Chu F.F. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11463-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shen Q. Leonard J.L. Newburger P.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 519-525PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the same group reported the molecular cloning of this binding activity (termed dbpB), which belongs to the Y-box family of RNA/DNA-binding proteins (24Shen Q. Wu R. Leonard J.L. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5443-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An analysis of its potential role in Sec insertion has not yet been reported. In addition, Hubert et al. (34Hubert N. Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 464-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described a binding activity (termed SECIS-binding protein (SBP)) that interacted with a full-length stem-loop derived from GPx mRNA. In this case, the activity was determined to correspond to a 60–65-kDa protein identified by UV cross-linking, but binding activity has not yet been correlated to any functions related to selenoprotein synthesis, nor is it known whether it binds to a specific SECIS element. Previous results from our own laboratory demonstrated the existence of a highly specific 120-kDa SECIS-binding protein (which we here term SBP2), the binding of which was tightly correlated with selenoprotein synthesis (25Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SBP2 binding and translational read-through were both eliminated by mutations to the AUGA SECIS element. Some mutations that did not affect SBP2 binding did eliminate Sec insertion, and it was thus concluded that SBP2 binding may be necessary but is not sufficient for Sec incorporation. The current work describes the purification of SBP2 and characterization of its biochemical and RNA binding properties. The rat PHGPx 3′ UTR (nt 655–872) was cloned into the Eco RI/Hin dIII sites of pAlter-Ex1 (Promega). Deletion mutants (M129, M102, and M81) were constructed with synthetic oligonucleotides (listed in TableI) used to PCR amplify the terminal portions of the PHGPx 3′ UTR stem loop that then were cloned into the Eco RI and Hin dIII sites of pAlter-Ex1. Wild-type and mutant RNAs were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase from Hin dIII linearized DNA templates. Deiodinase 1 constructs, a gift from Marla Berry (Harvard Medical School), were made as described (26Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar) and were linearized with Dra I. RNAs were radiolabeled by incorporation of [α-32P]UTP as described (27Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L.M. Martinez D.

Open table in a new tab Fresh, pretrimmed rat testes were purchased from Pel-Freez (shipped on wet ice). The tissue was minced with a razor, and Buffer A (20 mmKPO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT) was added to 2 ml/g of wet weight of tissue followed by homogenization with a Bio-Homogenizer (Fisher). Crude extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and then that supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield S100 extracts ranging in protein concentration from 10 to 15 mg/ml. Kidney, spleen and liver extracts were made in the same fashion except that 14,000 × g supernatants were used for analysis. McArdle 7777 (rat hepatoma) cell extracts were prepared in the same fashion except that 80% confluent cells were scraped from 10-cm plates and pelleted. The cell pellet was washed three times in 5 volumes of Buffer A and Dounce homogenized with a micro-Dounce. All column chromatography was performed on the BioCad Sprint chromatography system. Columns were jacketed with copper coils for cooling. For partial purification, S100 extracts were diluted 1:1 with 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, and immediately applied to a 1.6 × 26-cm S-Sepharose column (bed volume of 32 ml) equilibrated in Buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a 5-column-volume linear gradient from 100 to 800 mm KCl at 2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and 10 μl of each was assayed for SBP2 by UV cross-linking (see below). Active fractions were pooled and brought to 35% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was incubated on ice for 0.5 h followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 18,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in120 of the original volume and either dialyzed or used directly for analysis or further purification. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay normalized to bovine serum albumin standards. For gel filtration chromatography, 0.5 mg of the ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a 1 × 30-cm Superose-12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A plus 1.1 mKCl. Proteins were eluted at 0.4 ml/min, and 1 min fractions were collected. 100 μl of each fraction and 20 μl of the starting material were dialyzed against Buffer A in a multiwell microdialysis apparatus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Dialyzed fractions (16 μl each) were analyzed for SBP2 activity by UV cross-linking. Sizing of SBP2 was performed by comparison to standards run under identical conditions: apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Wild-type and ΔAUGA mutant PHGPx 3′ UTR RNAs were synthesized in bulk with Ribomax (Promega) transcription reagents and immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (28Kaminski A. Hunt S.L. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA beads (150–200 μg RNA/ml beads) were directly loaded into Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 0.5 × 5 cm FPLC columns which were subsequently equilibrated in Buffer A. Approximately 1 mg of protein from the ammonium sulfate fraction was loaded at 0.2 ml/min, and the column was washed in Buffer A plus 170 mm KCl until A280returned to baseline. Proteins were eluted (0.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient (0.27–1.7 m KCl) in 10 min, followed by a step to 2 m KCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected directly into 0.28 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate. After collection, fractions were incubated on ice for 30 min and spun at 18,000 × g in a 4 °C microcentrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and saved for later analysis, and the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A and stored at −80 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of 0.2 n NaOH, SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of activity derived from RNA affinity chromatography was calculated directly from analysis of limiting amounts of column fractions immediately after collection because the activity was not stable after this procedure even when stored at −80 °C. The yield of protein from RNA affinity chromatography was estimated by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Extracts or column fractions were incubated with 20 fmol of 32P-labeled (22,000 cpm/fmol) synthetic RNA for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl containing Buffer A supplemented with 250 μg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA, 10 mm DTT, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Each reaction was treated with UV irradiation (Bio-Rad GS Genelinker) at 254 nm for 10 min in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Corning). The reaction was then treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). For specific activity determinations, data were obtained from a single phosphorimage scan except for the RNA affinity-derived activity, which was normalized to known amounts of activity from the previous purification step. All determinations of specific activity and inhibitor effects were carried out under conditions of limiting protein within the linear range of the cross-linking assay as described in Tables II and III.Table IIPurification scheme for SBP2ProteinUnits2-aActivity units are arbitrarily derived from PhosphorImager quantitation of UV cross-linking assays.

COS-7 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 9.5-cm2 well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 ng/ml Na2SeO3. At 70–80% confluency (18 h), 950 ng of test DNA was cotransfected with 50 ng of pRSV-β-galactosidase DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for detection of luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) or β-galactosidase activity using LumiGal 530 assay reagent (Lumigen). Extracts were assayed using a ML2250 luminometer (Dynatech). Protein assays were performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and the results were expressed as relative luminescence units/mg of protein. Our previous analysis of SBP2 binding activity was carried out with crude testicular extracts. These extracts contained several proteins identified by UV cross-linking that bound to the wild-type PHGPx 3′UTR, the most abundant of which migrated as a 55-kDa protein. Based on UV cross-linking and competition analysis, only a 120-kDa protein (SBP2) bound to the UTR in a sequence-specific manner (25Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the AUGA and AAAA SECIS elements indicated that binding of SBP2 required the AUGA element (see diagram in Fig.1). To support the idea that SBP2 is a general player in Sec insertion, and in order to identify the best tissue from which to obtain SBP2 activity, extracts derived from several rat tissues and McArdle 7777 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, were analyzed. Fig. 2 shows UV cross-linking analysis of crude extracts from testis, liver, kidney, spleen, and McArdle 7777 cells using radiolabeled wild-type PHGPx 3′ UTR or a mutant (AUGA → ACGA) previously shown to be unable to bind SBP2 (25Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 120-kDa cross-linking band that specifically binds the wild-type UTR was detectable only in testes, liver, and McArdle 7777 extracts. The lack of SBP2 cross-linking activity in kidney and spleen, as well as the reduced level observed in liver extracts, is potentially due to an inhibitor in these extracts because mixtures of these extracts with testicular extract inhibited binding (not shown). It is clear from this analysis that SBP2 functions in at least one other tissue. Among the extracts tested, that derived from testes had the highest specific activity. This result is consistent with the fact that the PHGPx mRNA and enzyme are over-represented in the testis relative to other tissues (19Pushpa-Rekha T.R. Burdsall A.L. Oleksa L.M. Chisolm G.M.

The apparent abundance of SBP2 in the testicular extracts assayed in Fig. 2 prompted our utilization of this tissue as a starting point for SBP2 purification. Although the UV cross-linking assay used to follow SBP2 binding activity is not highly quantitative, we estimate a 26-fold purification of activity after S-Sepharose chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation (TableII). As expected, SBP2 may have the characteristics of a basic protein or complex as evidenced by its preferential interaction with cation exchange matrices, such as S-Sepharose, at neutral pH. SBP2 does bind to a MonoQ column (anion exchange) when the pH was raised to 8.0, but significant losses of activity undermined its utility in the purification scheme. SBP2 activity eluted in a single peak from the S-Sepharose column at a point in the gradient corresponding to ∼200 mm KCl. The activity was subsequently concentrated, and the excess KCl removed by 35% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The mixture obtained at this step was used for the analyses described below and is referred to as partially purified SBP2. This purification scheme was sufficient to remove the major contaminating cross-linking proteins detected in S100 extracts, most notably the abundant 55-kDa protein (compare crude testis extracts to the ammonium sulfate fraction in Fig. 2). The lower molecular weight bands detected by UV cross-linking in the ammonium sulfate fraction do not appear consistently and may represent variations in the recovery of proteins that bind to the double stranded stem of the full-length PHGPx 3′ UTR (compare Figs. 2 and 6). The specificity of partially purified SBP2 binding was verified by virtue of its ability to cross-link to wild-type but not mutant (AUGA →ACGA) PHGPx 3′ UTRs (Fig. 2). The conditions under which maximal UV cross-linking activity can be detected for partially purified SBP2 were analyzed. The optimal reaction conditions include 50–100 mm KCl, pH 6.5–7.0, at 30–37 °C. The addition of magnesium did not augment cross-linking, and binding was not inhibited by up to 5 mm EDTA, indicating that a metal co-factor is not necessary for this interaction. SBP2 binding was not affected by repeated freeze/thaw cycles and was cryostable. Nonionic detergents had no deleterious effect on binding, and SBP2 binding was restored after treatment with 2m guanidine HCl followed by dialysis. Denaturation, however, in SDS or 6 m guanidine was irreversibly inhibitory to binding activity. The effects of a variety of compounds on the level of SBP2 UV cross-linking found in partially purified preparations are summarized in Table III. We chose to analyze an array of nucleic acids that may compete for binding, as well as several divalent cations that may facilitate the binding activity. In addition, we tested the effect of sodium selenite to determine whether binding activity is regulated by selenium concentration. Two-fold serial dilutions of each effector were assayed in standard cross-linking reactions with limiting amounts (∼2 μg) of total protein from the ammonium sulfate fraction, and the inhibitory concentration at 50% inactivation (IC50) was determined by PhosphorImager-based quantitation. Table III groups the tested substances into those that had little or no effect at the highest concentration tested, those that had an intermediate effect, and those that significantly inhibited binding. Although SBP2 binding activity was not dramatically enhanced by any of these treatments, NiCl2, heparin, poly(G), and rRNA were all significantly inhibitory. It is worth noting that although selenite (NaSeO3) was inhibitory, the IC50 concentration (72 μm) is approximately 3000 times the physiological concentration. These results suggest that SBP2 interacts nonspecifically with the ribose moiety of highly structured RNAs, such as rRNA and poly(G), and is likely inactivated by oxidation by reactive metal salts, such as NiCl2. In order to determine the aggregate molecular mass of SBP2, partially purified material was subjected to Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography. Under lower salt conditions (100 mm KCl), SBP2 cofractionated with totally excluded material (cutoff molecular mass, 2000 kDa) and with another peak corresponding to 500 kDa. Under higher salt conditions (400 mm KCl), the activity was only detected as 500 kDa (not shown). In an attempt to analyze monomeric SBP2, Superose-12 chromatography was run with 1.2 m KCl, and the fractions were analyzed by UV cross-linking following microdialysis (Fig. 3). In this case, the majority of SBP2 activity eluted in a major peak corresponding to ∼500 kDa and a minor peak corresponding to ∼200 kDa. The recovery of SBP2 activity under these conditions was good (∼70%), thereby discounting the possibility that we were only observing a small fraction of the input material. These results suggest that the 120-kDa SBP2 as detected by UV cross-linking is part of a homogeneous or heterogeneous multiprotein complex that can be only partially dissociated under high ionic strength conditions. As it has been shown that many DNA and RNA-binding proteins require free cysteine residues for binding activity (31Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we studied SBP2 binding activity in the context of altered redox potential. Extracts made in buffer lacking DTT showed little if any SBP2 binding activity, whereas the addition of 10–300 mm DTT to the reaction stimulated SBP2 cross-linking activity. Furthermore, pretreatment of crude or partially purified sources of SPB2 with the oxidizing agent diamide eliminated binding a"

Furthermore, recent in vitro experiments have indicated that ATM phosphorylates p53 protein at serine 15 (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 22Canman C.E. Lim D.-S. Cimprivh K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Although there has been a report indicating the phosphorylation of serine 15 in AT cells (23Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), it is highly possible that the activity of p53 protein is mediated by ATM kinase activity.Very little is known about the mechanism by which ATM protein is activated by DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that ATM protein levels do not change during cell cycle progression or after exposure to ionizing radiation (24Lakin N.D. Weber P. Stankovic T. Rottinghaus S.T. Taylor A.M.R. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ramsey J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and therefore, it has been hypothesized that ATM protein may not be an inducible effector, but may act as a transducer or, more likely, a sensor for DNA damage. Previous studies have indicated that ATM protein harbors a putative leucine zipper motif (6Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F.C. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whose structure is commonly detected in DNA binding proteins that form homo- or heterodimers. Furthermore, the association of ATM protein with meiotic chromosomes has been reported, indicating that the ATM protein may sense double strand break related structures occurring in synapsing meiotic chromosomes (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that ATM protein also interacts with DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Because DNA-PK, a protein kinase that shares amino acid homology with ATM, has been shown to be recruited through its association with Ku70/80 proteins bound to the DNA ends of double strand breaks, and DNA-PK has a putative leucine zipper motif (5Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 28Suwa A.

Our results show that the ATM protein constitutively associates with double strand DNA and that its interaction is potentiated when the DNA is exposed to ionizing radiation. The ATM protein also interacted with Pvu II-treated DNA but not with DNA exposed to UVC light. Although a very weak interaction between ATM and DNA-PK was observed, immunodepletion of DNA-PK protein did not affect the interaction of ATM protein with damaged DNA. Furthermore, ATM associated with damaged DNA in Chinese hamster cells deficient in Ku80. These results suggested that association of the ATM protein with damaged DNA is independent of DNA-PK or Ku80 proteins.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that approximately 350-kDa protein was detected as ATM protein in normal human embryo cells using anti-ATM monoclonal antibody used in this study (Fig. 1). We did not detect ATM protein in two AT cell lines, AT2KY and AT5BI. AT2KY cells have a deletion in the ATM gene at nucleotide position 7883, which is predicted to form a truncated ATM protein (32Gilad S. Khosravi R. Shkedy D. Uziel T. Ziv Y. Savitsky K. Rotman G. Smith S. Chessa L. Jorgensen T.J. Harnik R. Frydman M. Sanal O. Portnoi S. Goldwicz Z. Jaspers N.G. Gatti R.A. Lenoir G. Lavin M.F. Tatsumi K. Wegner R.D. Shiloh Y. Bar-Shira A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). AT5BI cells have a deletion of 6 base pairs in the ATM gene, which may cause deletion of two amino acids at codon 2427 (32Gilad S. Khosravi R. Shkedy D. Uziel T. Ziv Y. Savitsky K. Rotman G. Smith S. Chessa L. Jorgensen T.J. Harnik R. Frydman M. Sanal O. Portnoi S. Goldwicz Z. Jaspers N.G. Gatti R.A. Lenoir G. Lavin M.F. Tatsumi K. Wegner R.D. Shiloh Y. Bar-Shira A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because the antibody used in this study recognizes amino acids between 2577 and 3056, it is possible that the ATM protein in these AT cell lines will be destabilized, as suggested previously (25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).The time course experiments showed that the amount of ATM protein in both nuclear and cytoplasm did not change up to 12 h after X-irradiation, while p53 accumulated significantly during this period. Previous studies have also shown that ionizing radiation and UV irradiation do not affect the amount of ATM protein (24Lakin N.D. Weber P. Stankovic T. Rottinghaus S.T. Taylor A.M.R. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ramsey J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that ATM protein is not an inducible mediator or a transducer in signal transduction which activates p53 protein, but it acts as a sensor for DNA damage. Recently, it has been reported that ATM protein associates with chromatin in meiotic prophase (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in ATM−/− knockout mice, it has been shown that meiosis is arrested at prophase, which results in an abnormal chromosomal synapsis and chromosome fragmentation (33Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because DNA double strand breaks are thought to occur in meiotic prophase, it has been hypothesized that ATM recognizes DNA strand breaks (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ATM protein associates with damaged DNA. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, ATM protein was found to interact with double strand DNA, and its association markedly increased when DNA was exposed to ionizing radiation, indicating that ATM constitutively interacts with DNA, and it monitors DNA damage. We found that irradiation of cells did not alter the amount of ATM protein associated with damaged DNA. Thus, it seems likely that increased association with damaged DNA may not require posttranslational modification, although ATM protein is a phosphoprotein (34Chen G. Lee E.Y.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the association of ATM protein with DNA was also increased using DNA-damaged by P vu II endonuclease treatment, but not by DNA exposed to UV light. X-irradiated denatured DNA was not a good substrate for ATM association. P vu II treatment produces blunt-ended double strand breaks, and UV light causes pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts predominantly. Thus, it is implicated that ATM protein is recruited to the site of DNA double strand breaks and it functions as a sensor for DNA damage.The amino acid sequence of the ATM protein has a putative leucine zipper motif at codons 1217–1238 (6Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F.C. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 35Byrd P.J. McConville C.M. Cooper P. Parkhill J. Stankovic T. McGuire G.M. Thick J.A. Taylor A.M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM protein may form homo- or heterodimers with other nuclear protein(s). Recently, the biological significance of the leucine zipper motif was examined by Morgan et al. (36Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). They found that overexpression of the ATM protein fragment containing this motif in RKO cells abrogated the S-phase check point and enhanced radiosensitivity. This dominant negative effect indicates that this motif is required for ATM function. Therefore, we examined whether nuclear protein association enhanced association of ATM protein with damaged DNA. Since DNA-PK has been reported to have a putative leucine zipper motif at codons 1503–1538 (5Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), we determined whether ATM protein associated with damaged DNA through interaction with DNA-PK. As shown in Fig. 6, the association between ATM and DNA-PK was very weak. Furthermore, depletion of DNA-PK did not affect the association of ATM with damaged DNA (Fig. 7). The association of ATM protein with damaged DNA was also detected in Chinese hamster cells deficient in Ku80 protein (Fig. 8). Therefore, both DNA-PK and Ku80 proteins are probably not involved in the recognition of damaged DNA by ATM protein. So far, DNA-PK and ATM have implicated to function independently (37Jongmans W. Artuso M. Vuillaume M. Bresil H. Jackson S.P. Hall J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1133-1138PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent reports have indicated that c-Abl protein interacts with both DNA-PK and ATM proteins (38Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and therefore, there is a possibility that these two independent pathways may communicate or cooperate to transduce signals. Further studies will be needed to clarify this point.In conclusion, we have shown that ATM protein associates with DNA in normal human cells, and the association is potentiated by DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. The recruited ATM protein may be activated by an unknown mechanism and induce a signal to stabilize p53, thereby regulating cell cycle, DNA replication, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT)1 is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a variety of clinical symptoms. At the cellular level, AT cells exhibit hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, radio-resistant DNA synthesis, and a high frequency of chromosome aberrations (reviewed in Refs. 1Jachson S.P. Curr.

Furthermore, recent in vitro experiments have indicated that ATM phosphorylates p53 protein at serine 15 (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C.

Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Although there has been a report indicating the phosphorylation of serine 15 in AT cells (23Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), it is highly possible that the activity of p53 protein is mediated by ATM kinase activity. Very little is known about the mechanism by which ATM protein is activated by DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that ATM protein levels do not change during cell cycle progression or after exposure to ionizing radiation (24Lakin N.D. Weber P. Stankovic T. Rottinghaus S.T. Taylor A.M.R. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ramsey J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and therefore, it has been hypothesized that ATM protein may not be an inducible effector, but may act as a transducer or, more likely, a sensor for DNA damage. Previous studies have indicated that ATM protein harbors a putative leucine zipper motif (6Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F.C. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whose structure is commonly detected in DNA binding proteins that form homo- or heterodimers. Furthermore, the association of ATM protein with meiotic chromosomes has been reported, indicating that the ATM protein may sense double strand break related structures occurring in synapsing meiotic chromosomes (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that ATM protein also interacts with DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Because DNA-PK, a protein kinase that shares amino acid homology with ATM, has been shown to be recruited through its association with Ku70/80 proteins bound to the DNA ends of double strand breaks, and DNA-PK has a putative leucine zipper motif (5Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 28Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it can be hypothesized that ATM protein interacts with damaged DNA by itself or through an association with DNA-PK or Ku-like proteins. In the present study, we examined whether ATM protein interacts with damaged DNA in vitro. Our results show that the ATM protein constitutively associates with double strand DNA and that its interaction is potentiated when the DNA is exposed to ionizing radiation. The ATM protein also interacted with Pvu II-treated DNA but not with DNA exposed to UVC light. Although a very weak interaction between ATM and DNA-PK was observed, immunodepletion of DNA-PK protein did not affect the interaction of ATM protein with damaged DNA. Furthermore, ATM associated with damaged DNA in Chinese hamster cells deficient in Ku80. These results suggested that association of the ATM protein with damaged DNA is independent of DNA-PK or Ku80 proteins. DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that approximately 350-kDa protein was detected as ATM protein in normal human embryo cells using anti-ATM monoclonal antibody used in this study (Fig. 1). We did not detect ATM protein in two AT cell lines, AT2KY and AT5BI. AT2KY cells have a deletion in the ATM gene at nucleotide position 7883, which is predicted to form a truncated ATM protein (32Gilad S. Khosravi R. Shkedy D. Uziel T. Ziv Y. Savitsky K. Rotman G. Smith S. Chessa L. Jorgensen T.J. Harnik R. Frydman M. Sanal O. Portnoi S. Goldwicz Z. Jaspers N.G. Gatti R.A. Lenoir G. Lavin M.F. Tatsumi K. Wegner R.D. Shiloh Y. Bar-Shira A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). AT5BI cells have a deletion of 6 base pairs in the ATM gene, which may cause deletion of two amino acids at codon 2427 (32Gilad S. Khosravi R. Shkedy D. Uziel T. Ziv Y. Savitsky K. Rotman G. Smith S. Chessa L. Jorgensen T.J. Harnik R. Frydman M. Sanal O. Portnoi S. Goldwicz Z. Jaspers N.G. Gatti R.A. Lenoir G. Lavin M.F. Tatsumi K. Wegner R.D. Shiloh Y. Bar-Shira A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because the antibody used in this study recognizes amino acids between 2577 and 3056, it is possible that the ATM protein in these AT cell lines will be destabilized, as suggested previously (25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).The time course experiments showed that the amount of ATM protein in both nuclear and cytoplasm did not change up to 12 h after X-irradiation, while p53 accumulated significantly during this period. Previous studies have also shown that ionizing radiation and UV irradiation do not affect the amount of ATM protein (24Lakin N.D. Weber P. Stankovic T. Rottinghaus S.T. Taylor A.M.R. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tangle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ramsey J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that ATM protein is not an inducible mediator or a transducer in signal transduction which activates p53 protein, but it acts as a sensor for DNA damage. Recently, it has been reported that ATM protein associates with chromatin in meiotic prophase (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in ATM−/− knockout mice, it has been shown that meiosis is arrested at prophase, which results in an abnormal chromosomal synapsis and chromosome fragmentation (33Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because DNA double strand breaks are thought to occur in meiotic prophase, it has been hypothesized that ATM recognizes DNA strand breaks (27Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ATM protein associates with damaged DNA. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, ATM protein was found to interact with double strand DNA, and its association markedly increased when DNA was exposed to ionizing radiation, indicating that ATM constitutively interacts with DNA, and it monitors DNA damage. We found that irradiation of cells did not alter the amount of ATM protein associated with damaged DNA. Thus, it seems likely that increased association with damaged DNA may not require posttranslational modification, although ATM protein is a phosphoprotein (34Chen G. Lee E.Y.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the association of ATM protein with DNA was also increased using DNA-damaged by P vu II endonuclease treatment, but not by DNA exposed to UV light. X-irradiated denatured DNA was not a good substrate for ATM association. P vu II treatment produces blunt-ended double strand breaks, and UV light causes pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts predominantly. Thus, it is implicated that ATM protein is recruited to the site of DNA double strand breaks and it functions as a sensor for DNA damage.The amino acid sequence of the ATM protein has a putative leucine zipper motif at codons 1217–1238 (6Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F.C. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 35Byrd P.J. McConville C.M. Cooper P. Parkhill J. Stankovic T. McGuire G.M. Thick J.A. Taylor A.M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM protein may form homo- or heterodimers with other nuclear protein(s). Recently, the biological significance of the leucine zipper motif was examined by Morgan et al. (36Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). They found that overexpression of the ATM protein fragment containing this motif in RKO cells abrogated the S-phase check point and enhanced radiosensitivity. This dominant negative effect indicates that this motif is required for ATM function. Therefore, we examined whether nuclear protein association enhanced association of ATM protein with damaged DNA. Since DNA-PK has been reported to have a putative leucine zipper motif at codons 1503–1538 (5Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), we determined whether ATM protein associated with damaged DNA through interaction with DNA-PK. As shown in Fig. 6, the association between ATM and DNA-PK was very weak. Furthermore, depletion of DNA-PK did not affect the association of ATM with damaged DNA (Fig. 7). The association of ATM protein with damaged DNA was also detected in Chinese hamster cells deficient in Ku80 protein (Fig. 8). Therefore, both DNA-PK and Ku80 proteins are probably not involved in the recognition of damaged DNA by ATM protein. So far, DNA-PK and ATM have implicated to function independently (37Jongmans W. Artuso M. Vuillaume M. Bresil H. Jackson S.P. Hall J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1133-1138PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent reports have indicated that c-Abl protein interacts with both DNA-PK and ATM proteins (38Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and therefore, there is a possibility that these two independent pathways may communicate or cooperate to transduce signals. Further studies will be needed to clarify this point.In conclusion, we have shown that ATM protein associates with DNA in normal human cells, and the association is potentiated by DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. The recruited ATM protein may be activated by an unknown mechanism and induce a signal to stabilize p53, thereby regulating cell cycle, DNA replication, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

https://openalex.org/W2080429622,"Along with degradation of type IV collagen in basement membrane, destruction of the stromal collagens, types I and III, is an essential step in the invasive/metastatic behavior of tumor cells, and it is mediated, at least in part, by interstitial collagenase 1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1)). Because A2058 melanoma cells produce substantial quantities of MMP-1, we used these cells as models for studying invasion of type I collagen. With a sensitive and quantitative in vitro invasion assay, we monitored the ability of these cells to invade a matrix of type I collagen and the ability of a serine proteinase inhibitor and all-trans-retinoic acid to block invasion. Although these cells produce copious amounts of MMP-1, they do not invade collagen unless they are co-cultured with fibroblasts or with conditioned medium derived from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that a proteolytic cascade that depends on stromal/tumor cell interactions facilitates the ability of A2058 melanoma cells to invade a matrix of type I collagen. This cascade activates latent MMP-1 and involves both serine proteinases and MMPs, particularly stromelysin 1 (MMP-3). All-trans-retinoic acid (10−6m) suppresses the invasion of tumor cells by several mechanisms that include suppression of MMP synthesis and an increase in levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2. We conclude that invasion of stromal collagen by A2058 melanoma cells is mediated by a novel host/tumor cell interaction in which a proteolytic cascade culminates in the activation of pro-MMP-1 and tumor cell invasion.

Although these cells produce copious amounts of MMP-1, they do not invade collagen unless they are co-cultured with fibroblasts or with conditioned medium derived from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that a proteolytic cascade that depends on stromal/tumor cell interactions facilitates the ability of A2058 melanoma cells to invade a matrix of type I collagen. This cascade activates latent MMP-1 and involves both serine proteinases and MMPs, particularly stromelysin 1 (MMP-3). All-trans-retinoic acid (10−6m) suppresses the invasion of tumor cells by several mechanisms that include suppression of MMP synthesis and an increase in levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2. We conclude that invasion of stromal collagen by A2058 melanoma cells is mediated by a novel host/tumor cell interaction in which a proteolytic cascade culminates in the activation of pro-MMP-1 and tumor cell invasion. The ability of many tumor cells to invade their local environment and to metastasize from their primary site to vital organs such as liver, lung, and brain, is potentially life-threatening. Therefore, the critical event in tumor cell invasion is degradation of the extracellular matrix, because this process allows dissemination from the localized site (1MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M.

Both serine proteinases and MMP family members have been implicated in this activation (2Parsons S.L. Watson S.A. Brown P.D. Collins H.M. Steele R.J.C. Br. J.

In addition to basement membranes, tumor cells must traverse the interstitial stroma, which is made up of collagens I and III (1MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M.

Thus, degradation of interstitial collagen is an essential component of the three-step process of invasion/metastasis: adhesion, degradation, and migration (6Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Of significance is the fact that this degradation is accomplished most effectively by the interstitial collagenases, MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13, and to some extent by MMP-2 (20Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and the membrane-type MMP, MT1-MMP (MMP14), (8Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), but relatively little attention has been given to the role of collagenase in tumor invasion. MMP-1 (collagenase 1) is ubiquitously expressed and is often a major gene product of stimulated fibroblasts and of some tumor cells (5, 16 22–25), including A2058 melanoma cells (22Templeton N.S. Brown P.D. Levy A.T. Margulies I.M.K. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5431-5437PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have described several types of host/tumor cell interactions that either mediate or augment tumor invasion by MMPs. These include secretion of MMPs by stromal cells in response to stimulation by tumor cells or, conversely, induction of MMP production by the tumor cells in response to host stimuli. Some of these mechanisms require direct contact between the stromal and tumor cells (27Segain J-P. Harb J. Gregoire M. Meflah K. Menanteau J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5506-5512PubMed Google Scholar, 28Martorana A.M. Zheng G. Crowe T.C. O'Grady R.L. Lyons J.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4970-4979PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others do not (29Guo H. Zucker S. Gordon M.K. Toole B.P. Biswas C. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5506-5512PubMed Google Scholar), and in most instances, conditioned medium from macrophages or fibroblasts is an effective inducer (32Himelstein B.P. Caneta-Soler R. Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 477-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we begin to investigate the mechanism(s) by which MMP-1 mediates the invasive behavior of tumor cells through a matrix of type I collagen. As models we used A2058 melanoma cells, which produce substantial amounts of MMP-1 constitutively and which are an aggressive and invasive line established from a brain metastasis in a 43-year-old man (22Templeton N.S. Brown P.D. Levy A.T. Margulies I.M.K. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5431-5437PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that a cascade that depends on proteinases produced by both stromal cells and by tumor cells facilitates tumor invasion through the collagen. Furthermore, invasion was inhibited by all-trans-retinoic acid by mechanisms that include down-regulation of MMP-1 synthesis and up-regulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 gene expression. Stock cultures of A2058 melanoma cells were grown in 150-mm-diameter culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (37 °C in 5% CO2). After 3–4 days, when the cells were confluent, they were passaged 1:7 with 0.25% trypsin. For most experiments, cells were grown to the desired level of confluence, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) to remove traces of serum and placed in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (DMEM/LH) (33Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from the Birthing Pavilion at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital (Lebanon, NH), and fibroblasts were isolated as described previously (33Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They were grown in 150-mm-diameter culture dishes in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin and used between passages 4 and 12 (33Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At confluence, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and placed in DMEM/LH. Culture medium (1 ml) was precipitated with 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. Proteins were pelleted and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). MMP-1 protein was detected as described previously (33Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies for MMP-3, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and Western analysis was performed using chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A2058 melanoma cells at confluence were placed in serum-free medium for 24 h, and total RNA was harvested with a Trizol kit. RNA (5–10 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane, and membranes were hybridized with denatured [α-32P]dCTP-cDNA labeled by random oligo priming to probes for MMP-1, MT1-MMP, MMP-3, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13. Hybridization with glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. Collagen zymography was performed as described previously (34Gogly B. Groult N. Hornebeck W. Godeau G. Pellat B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium (15 μl) was loaded on a polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing 1 mg/ml type I collagen and 100 μl of 10% SDS. Following electrophoresis, gels were washed twice with 5% Triton X-100 (30 min each). After washing, the gels were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, pH 7.5, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 30 min and then destained. The assay utilizes a modified Boyden chamber (35Schoenermark M.P. Bock O. Buchner A. Steinmeir R. Benbow U. Lenarz T Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Benbow U. Maitra R. Hamilton J.W. Brinckerhoff C.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar) with the two compartments separated by a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell AE100, 25-mm diameter, 12-μm pore size). Briefly, filters were autoclaved and coated with collagen type I (1 mg/ml; Sigma) diluted in sterile DMEM in the presence of 1% antibiotics, and successively applied to the membrane (3 × 150 μl, 1 × 550 μl, allowed to gel at 37 °C for 30 min, and air dried for 1 h at room temperature). The efficiency of coating was monitored by scanning electron microscopy at the electron microscope facility at Dartmouth Medical School. Single cell suspensions, consisting of 105 tumor cells alone, 105 fibroblasts, alone, or the two cell types co-cultured in varying amounts up to equal numbers of 5 × 104, were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution, resuspended in serum-free medium, and counted. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. The lower chamber was filled with serum-free medium, and 105 cells in 1 ml were added to the upper chamber. In some experiments, a two-compartment culture model was used, and fibroblasts were cultured on plastic in the lower compartment, while the tumor cells were cultured on type I collagen in the upper compartment. The chamber was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h, and the degree of cellular invasion was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. For scanning electron microscopy images, filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (30 min), washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (2 × 5 min), and postfixed in 1% osmiumtetroxide (90 min). Then filters were dehydrated in 2-propanol and subjected to critical point drying using hexamethyl-disilazame:ethanol (1:1) (Sigma; 20 min), followed by 20 min of incubation with hexamethyl-disilazame alone. Filters were mounted and sputter coated (approximately 30 nm; Polaron E5400, 0.6kV, 20 mA). Scanning electron microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss SEM 962. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was performed on invasion chamber membranes (35Schoenermark M.P. Bock O. Buchner A. Steinmeir R. Benbow U. Lenarz T Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Benbow U. Maitra R. Hamilton J.W. Brinckerhoff C.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar) at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center Cell Imaging Unit (Lebanon, NH). Briefly, invasion assays were terminated after 48 h. The membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and dehydrated with 2-propanol (10 min) followed by a 30-min RNase-treatment (1 mg/ml) at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the filters were stained for 30 min with propidium iodide (0.01 μg/ml) at room temperature. Filters were washed with water and dehydrated with 2-propanol. The specimens were then treated with 100% xylene (four times for 4 min each), which leads to complete translucence of the filters. Samples were mounted on slides and sealed with Canada balsam (Sigma). A Bio-Rad MRC-1024 CLSM with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and a Zeiss Plan Neofluor 40 × 1.3NA objective was used to assay propidium iodide fluorescence in the membranes (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Excitation light was 488 + 568 nm with fluorescence measured through a 605 ± 16-nm filter using a 0.7 confocal iris. Images were 240 × 240 μm and were captured at 2-μm steps starting at top of the collagen matrix. For analyses, the stack of images was processed with Molecular Dynamics Image Space software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) in a modification of the method described by Schoenermark et al. (35Schoenermark M.P. Bock O. Buchner A. Steinmeir R. Benbow U. Lenarz T Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A threshold was set to eliminate background fluorescence, and the total propidium iodide fluorescence (related to the total double stranded nucleic acid content) of each section was determined as the sum of the intensity of cell fluorescent pixels in that section. Results were plotted as percentages of total fluorescence in each section, which are equivalent to the numbers of cells in each section. Invasion assays were repeated at least four times. For each assay, a minimum of four fields/filter was taken. Minimal variability values were observed between the treatments in each set of experiments. Representatives of individual assays are shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6.Figure 5All-trans-retinoic reduces the invasive phenotype of A2058 cells. A, A2058 cells were seeded on a collagen type I matrix as described in the legend to Fig. 4, in the presence of fibroblast conditioned medium (HFF), medium from fibroblasts treated with RA (10−6m) (HFF+RA); dialyzed medium from RA-treated fibroblasts (HFF+RA (dialyzed)), and HFF medium with RA added during the assay period (HFF+RA*). After 48 h the assays were terminated, and invasion was quantified by CLSM. Note that the curves for treatments with HFF and RA (▵) and HFF and RA (dialyzed) (▴) are almost identical and therefore not distinguishable in the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effects of aprotinin treatment on type I collagen invasion.

After concentration the individual fractions were adjusted to the same protein concentration and added to the upper invasion chamber. Recombinant pro-MMP-3 was purified from the culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells stably transfected with the expression vector pEE-14, harboring the full-length human MMP-3 cDNA by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (37Benbow U. Buttice G. Nagase H. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10715-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant pro-MMP-3(ΔC) that lacks the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain (residue Met1 to Thr255) was expressed in Escherichia coli transformed with the pET3a expression vector, harboring the pro-MMP-3(ΔC) cDNA, and the recombinant protein in inclusion bodies was refolded and purified as described by Suzuki et al. (38Suzuki K. Kan C.C. Hung W. Gehring M.R. Brew K. Nagase H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both recombinant pro-MMP-3 and pro-MMP-3(ΔC) were homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The full-length pro-MMP-3 was activated to the 45-kDa MMP-3 species by incubation with 10 mg/ml of chymotrypsin for 2 h at 37 °C followed by inactivation of chymotrypsin with 2 mm pheylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Pro-MMP-3(ΔC) was activated to the 23.5-kDa MMP-3 by incubating with 1 mm4-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C for 16 h. HFF conditioned medium was applied to the anti-MMP-3 affinity column as described above. Depletion of MMP-3 from the medium was monitored with a monoclonal antibody obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. We used Northern and Western blot analyses to confirm and extend earlier reports of MMPs that are constitutively expressed by A2058 melanoma cells (22Templeton N.S. Brown P.D. Levy A.T.

These enzymes are overexpressed in certain tumors and cancer cells and down-regulated in apoptosis and may play a role in regulating cell growth. Mammalian thioredoxin reductases contain a selenocysteine residue, encoded by a UGA codon, as the penultimate carboxyl-terminal amino acid. This amino acid has been proposed to carry reducing equivalents from the active site to substrates. We report expression of a wild-type thioredoxin reductase selenoenzyme, a cysteine mutant enzyme, and the UGA-terminated protein in mammalian cells and overexpression of the cysteine mutant and UGA-terminated proteins in the baculovirus insect cell system. We show that substitution of cysteine for selenocysteine decreases enzyme activity for thioredoxin by 2 orders magnitude, and that termination at the UGA codon abolishes activity. We further demonstrate the presence of a functional selenocysteine insertion sequence element that is highly active but only moderately responsive to selenium supplementation. Finally, we show that thioredoxin reductase mRNA levels are down-regulated by other sequences in the 3′-untranslated region, which contains multiple AU-rich instability elements. These sequences are found in a number of cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs and have been shown to confer rapid mRNA turnover.

These enzymes exhibit broad substrate specificity, reducing lipid hydroperoxides and lipoic acid, protein disulfide isomerase, and several low molecular weight disulfide substrates in addition to thioredoxin. The substrate thioredoxin functions in the proper folding and redox regulation of enzymes and transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB and transcription factor IIIC (1Hayashi T. Ueno Y.

Expression of both thioredoxin and TRR is elevated in a number of cancer cells and tumors (3Powis G. Gasdaska J.R. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Kirkpatrick D.L. Engman L. Cotgreave I.A. Angulo M.

Cells transfected with thioredoxin cDNA show increased tumor growth, and thioredoxin has been shown to contribute to the transformed phenotype of some human cancer cells (5Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R.

Finally, expression of TRR is down-regulated in apoptosis (4Gladyshev V. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and expression of the substrate, thioredoxin, inhibits apoptosis (6Baker A. Payne C.M. Briehl M.M. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5162-5167PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the thioredoxin redox system is a major contributor to regulating cell growth and death. Selenoenzymes have long been known to play important roles in protection from oxidative stress and the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species. The glutathione peroxidases, the best characterized family of selenoenzymes, were thought to be solely responsible for the role of selenium in this protection. Selenium has also been implicated through nutritional and epidemiological studies in cancer prevention, and recent clinical studies have provided considerable support for such a role (7Clark L.C. Combs G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher J.L. Park H.K. Sanders B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. J. Am. Med.

Furthermore, the presence of selenium in the TRRs establishes a potential mechanistic link between this essential trace element and cancer. Selenocysteine is encoded by UGA codons, which typically serve as signals for termination of protein synthesis. Recoding of UGA as a selenocysteine codon occurs in the presence of specific mRNA secondary structures, termed selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, located in the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of selenoprotein mRNAs (14Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). All selenoproteins characterized to date for which functions are known are redox enzymes, with selenocysteine in the active center. The selenocysteine residue in mammalian TRRs is the penultimate amino acid from the carboxyl terminus of the protein and is not part of the predicted catalytic site (15Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Instead, selenocysteine has been proposed to carry reducing equivalents from the active site to substrates (16Gromer S. Wissing J. Behne D. Ashman K. Schirmer R.H. Flohe L. Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In support of an essential role for selenocysteine in TRR activity, removal of the carboxyl terminus by either carboxypeptidase treatment (17Zhong L. Arner E.S.J. Ljung J. Aslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) or trypsin digestion (16Gromer S. Wissing J. Behne D. Ashman K. Schirmer R.H. Flohe L. Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or alkylation of the selenocysteine residue (18Gorlatov S.N. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8520-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) all resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. Due to the critical functions of the TRR enzymes and the unusual location of the selenocysteine residue, we undertook the present study to express the human wt selenoenzyme and a cysteine mutant analog to investigate the role of selenocysteine in catalytic activity and to characterize the SECIS element. Our studies utilized the first mammalian TRR cDNA, which was cloned from a human placenta library and is now termed TR-α (10Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M.M. Berry M.J. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or TrxR1 (11Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We have expressed the wild-type, cysteine mutant, and UGA-terminated enzymes in mammalian cells and overexpressed the cysteine mutant and UGA-terminated protein in insect cells. We demonstrate that substitution of cysteine for selenocysteine decreases the kcat for thioredoxin by 2 orders of magnitude, confirming the requirement for selenocysteine for maximal activity. Our studies also reveal that TRR expression is repressed by sequences in the 3′-UTR. This repression occurs at the mRNA level and is likely due to the presence of a series of AUUUA instability elements (AU-rich elements), regulatory sequences typically found in growth factor, cytokine, and proto-oncogene mRNAs. Regulation of expression of TRR by these AU-rich elements may be crucial in maintaining tight control on this important enzyme and the cellular processes it affects. All TRR sequences are derived from human placental TRR cDNA (9Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), now designated TR-α or TrxR1. The type 1 deiodinase (D1) coding + D1 SECIS construct used as a control and as the parent vector for the D1 coding + TRR SECIS construct has been described previously (construct 1536 in Ref. 19Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The TRR SECIS element was generated by designing complementary overlapping PCR oligonucleotides to synthesize the predicted TRR element, with unique restriction sites (Hin dIII and Not I) on either end. The sequence of the upstream oligonucleotide is 5′-CC AAGCTT TAGATCCATGAAGTCACCAGTCT CAAGCCCATGTGG- 3′, and the sequence of the downstream oligonucleotide is 5′-CC GCGGCCGC TTGTTCCATCACCGCCTA CCACATGGGCTTG- 3′. Regions of complementarity are underlined, and restriction sites are shown in italics. The PCR product was digested to create unique Hin dIII and Not I ends. This fragment was subcloned downstream of the D1 coding region in place of the D1 SECIS element via the same unique restriction sites (19Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The selenocysteine to cysteine mutant was generated using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). TRR clone 30B (9Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was the template for this mutagenesis reaction. The TRR mammalian expression constructs were generated by subcloning the wt TRR cDNA (9Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or the cysteine mutant into pCMX vector (20Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) via Kpn I and Bam HI sites in the polylinker. Deletion constructs were generated using the unique restriction sites Xba I (nt 2014), Pst I (nt 2482), Dra III (nt 3326), and Bam HI (nt 3690) or by PCR (nt 1933). The native TRR polyadenylation signal (beginning at nt 3776) was deleted in all TRR constructs, thus the first polyadenylation site is in the vector, ∼0.6 kilobase downstream of the polylinker. A weak polyadenylation signal (UAUAAA at nt 3137) is present in the 3326 and 3690 constructs, possibly accounting for the additional RNA bands detected by Northern blotting. This signal is deleted in the shorter constructs. Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were grown and maintained by standard tissue culture techniques in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (21Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell sonicates were assayed for the presence of 5′-deiodinase activity using 125I-reverse 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine as substrate, as described previously (21Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 75Se labeling was carried out for 24 h, beginning 1 day after transfection.75Se (specific activity, ∼1000 mCi/mg) was added at 4 mCi/60-mm dish in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, washed once in the same, sonicated briefly, and resuspended in electrophoresis buffer containing 1.25% SDS and 0.5 mβ-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. A PCR fragment (base pairs 440–1954) containing the cysteine mutant described above was cloned into the Bam HI site of the pFASTBAC1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). The UGA-terminated TRR was generated by cloning a PCR fragment (base pairs 440–1933) into the Bam HI and Xho I sites of the pFASTBAC1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant TRR bacmid DNA isolated from transformed DH10Bac cells was used to generate recombinant baculovirus particles from Sf21 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System; Life Technologies, Inc.). The virus was amplified to a final titer of 1–109plaque-forming units/ml. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus particles with a multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested after 3 days. Human placental thioredoxin reductase was purified to homogeneity as described previously (22Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-derived TRR protein was purified to homogeneity, as assessed by silver staining, using an adaptation of the placenta protocol described above in combination with chromatography steps as described by Gladyshev et al. (13Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.6) and sonicated, and particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6 (Buffer A). A yellow band containing recombinant protein was eluted from the column with Buffer A containing 2 m NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1 m. The solution was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate and 1 m ammonium sulfate at pH 7.4. The column was washed with sequential washes of 20 mm sodium phosphate containing 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0m ammonium sulfate. TRR was eluted in the last wash. Thioredoxin reductase activity was assayed by measuring oxidation of NADPH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm with thioredoxin coupled to insulin as the final electron acceptor (23Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as the post-reaction redox chromophore (24Mau B.L. Powis G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sonicates from transfected cells were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and electroblotted to Immobilon membrane (Millipore). Western blot analysis utilized a polyclonal antiserum (M2098, used at 1:2,500 dilution) directed against a human TRR peptide (amino acids 435–454; VVGFHVLGPNAGEVTQGFAA) (9Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution). This peptide lies 44 amino acids upstream of the selenocysteine or the corresponding mutant cysteine codon; thus, antibody reactivity would not be predicted to be affected by the presence of selenocysteine rather than cysteine or termination. Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Renaissance ECL system (NEN Life Science Products) and quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer and ImageQuant software.

Total RNA was prepared from transfected cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. 10 μg of RNA were analyzed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels in 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer. RNA was blotted to Nitran nylon membranes by vacuum blotting. A TRR cDNA probe (a Xba I fragment spanning nucleotides 1010–2470) was prepared by random priming (Prime It; Stratagene). Blots were hybridized at 65 °C and washed in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. Hybridization signals were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer and ImageQuant software. Incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA codons in eukaryotes has been shown to require the presence of a stem-loop or hairpin structure termed the SECIS element (14Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). SECIS elements are characterized by a small number of conserved nucleotides at specific positions in the stem-loop, notably the sequences AUGA and GA opposite each other on the 5′ and 3′ arms of the stem, respectively, and two or three adenosines in either the terminal loop or an internal bulge. We examined the 3′-UTR of the human TRR sequence for the presence of these nucleotides and the potential to form the consensus stem-loop structure. We identified a single region fitting these criteria located between nucleotides 2184 and 2227 (numbering according to Ref. 9Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The position of the SECIS element relative to the coding region and the rest of the 3′-UTR is shown in Fig.1 A. The predicted TRR SECIS element is shown in Fig. 1 B. During the course of these studies, predicted structures of this putative SECIS element were reported elsewhere (10Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M.M. Berry M.J. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Zhong L. Arner E.S.J. Ljung J. Aslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, demonstration of the ability to direct selenocysteine incorporation and quantitation of SECIS activity relative to other elements have not been reported. We synthesized the predicted TRR SECIS element by PCR and subcloned it into a mammalian expression vector downstream of the coding region of another selenoprotein, the D1 (19Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a functional SECIS element is required for synthesis of active deiodinase enzyme (14Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 25Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and that SECIS elements from a variety of different eukaryotic selenoproteins could function in this capacity (26Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). After transient transfection of the chimeric D1-TRR construct into HEK-293 cells, the TRR element efficiently directed selenocysteine incorporation into D1, as assessed by the production of D1 activity (Fig. 1 C). The activity of the TRR SECIS element was approximately 50% greater (mean of five independent transfections) than that of the D1 element. Because most other elements fall in the same range of activity as the D1 element (26Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar), the TRR SECIS is among the more potent elements identified. Selenoproteins have been proposed to follow a hierarchy for selenium supply in that the amounts of certain selenoproteins decrease more rapidly in selenium deficiency and reappear more slowly after selenium repletion. A previous study suggested that this was due in part to differences in the SECIS elements of different proteins (27Bermano G. Arthur J.R. Hesketh J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of selenium supplementation on the relative activities of the TRR and D1 SECIS elements. Whereas in the absence of added selenium, the TRR SECIS was 1.5-fold more potent than that of D1, the addition of 10 or 100 nm selenium resulted in a greater increase in D1 SECIS activity relative to the TRR SECIS (Fig.1 D). This effect was seen with cells cultured in either 1% or 10% serum. Thus, in 10% serum, the addition of 100 nmselenium increased activity with the D1 SECIS element by 4-fold, versus a 2-fold increase for TRR. In 1% serum with the same addition (100 nm selenium), the TRR SECIS element activity increased by ∼7-fold, versus a 16-fold increase for D1. We next examined the expression of TRR and the incorporation of75Se into the protein after transient transfection of the human TRR cDNA in mammalian cells. Expression constructs either containing or lacking the entire 3′-UTR were transfected,75Se was added to the media 1 day later, and cells were harvested for protein analysis the following day. Transfection of the full-length TRR + UTR construct resulted in an increase in labeling of TRR above the endogenous protein levels seen in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 2 versus lane 4). Upon transfection of the TRR-UTR construct, the level of 75Se-labeled TRR corresponded to that seen with vector alone (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus lane 4), presumably reflecting only the75Se-labeled product from the endogenous cellular TRR gene. No additional 75Se-labeled TRR is produced from the TRR construct lacking the 3′-UTR. Transfection of a full-length construct in which the selenocysteine codon was mutated to a cysteine codon also produced no additional 75Se-labeled TRR, confirming that this codon serves to direct selenocysteine incorporation (data not shown). We were interested in studying the contribution of the selenocysteine residue to TRR enzyme activity. We and others have previously shown that substitution of cysteine for selenocysteine in iodothyronine deiodinase (28Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or formate dehydrogenase (29Axley M.J. Böck A. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8450-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) decreased the kcat by ∼300-fold in each case. We wished to express cysteine mutant and UGA-terminated TRR proteins to compare with the wt enzyme. However, even if we could achieve overexpression of the cysteine mutant by 2 orders of magnitude relative to the endogenous wt enzyme, the predicted 2 order of magnitude decrease in specific activity with the cysteine substitution would result in the endogenous TRR enzyme contributing significantly to the total measured activity. Therefore, we undertook expression of the mutant enzymes in the baculovirus system, which allows for higher levels of expression than mammalian cells. Constructs encoding either a selenocysteine to cysteine mutant or a UGA-truncated version of TRR were subcloned into the pFASTBAC baculovirus system, and recombinant baculovirus stocks were generated. Mutant proteins were expressed after viral infection of Sf9 insect cells, purified to homogeneity, and assayed for reduction of thioredoxin and DTNB. We and others have found that in both the baculovirus system and transfected mammalian cells, synthesis of selenoproteins is very inefficient (30Kim I.Y. Guimaraes M.J. Zlotnik A. Bazan J.F. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used human placenta as a source of wt enzyme. The native placental TRR enzyme was purified to homogeneity, as described previously (22Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The wt and mutant enzyme activities are shown in TableI. The kcat for the reduction of thioredoxin was 135-fold higher for the wt enzyme than for the cysteine mutant. No activity was detectable with the UGA-terminated protein. With DTNB as substrate, the kcat was ∼10-fold higher for the selenoenzyme than it was for either the cysteine mutant or UGA-terminated protein. The Km values were only minimally affected by the cysteine substitution, increasing by a factor of ∼2 for for both substrates.Table IKinetics of thioredoxin and DTNB reduction by TRR selenoenzyme, cysteine mutant, or UGA-terminated proteinThioredoxinDTNBkcatKmkcatKmTRR wt661 min−10.55 mm1770 min−1 (Ref. 41Tamura T.

Our previous studies have shown that CD44 expressed in cancer cells is proteolytically cleaved at the extracellular domain through membrane-associated metalloproteases and that CD44 cleavage plays a critical role in CD44-mediated tumor cell migration (Okamoto, I., Kawano, Y., Tsuiki, H., Sasaki, J., Nakao, M., Matsumoto, M., Suga, M., Ando, M., Nakajima, M., and Saya, H. (1999)Oncogene 18, 1435–1446). In the present study, we first demonstrate rapid degradation of the membrane-tethered CD44 cleavage product through intracellular proteolytic pathways, and it occurs only after CD44 extracellular cleavage. To address the mechanisms regulating CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain, we show that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin rapidly enhance metalloprotease-mediated CD44 cleavage in U251MG cells via protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively, suggesting the existence of multiple distinct pathways for regulation of CD44 cleavage. Concomitant with TPA-induced CD44 cleavage, TPA treatment induces redistribution of CD44 and ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) to newly generated membrane ruffling areas. Treatment with lysophosphatidic acid, which is known to activate the Rho-dependent pathway, inhibits TPA-induced CD44 redistribution and CD44 cleavage. Furthermore, overexpression of Rac dominant active mutants results in the redistribution of CD44 to the Rac-induced ruffling areas and the enhancement of CD44 cleavage. These results suggest that the Rho family proteins play a role in regulation of CD44 distribution and cleavage.

Urol. 1998; 160: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the detailed molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We have recently demonstrated that CD44 expressed in cancer cells is cleaved proteolytically at the extracellular domain through membrane-associated metalloproteases and that CD44 cleavage plays a critical role in CD44-mediated tumor cell migration through the highly dynamic regulation of interaction between CD44 and ECM (15Okamoto I.

These observations present CD44 as being dynamically regulated during the migration process. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms that regulate CD44 cleavage. Identification of the molecular components involved in regulated CD44 cleavage is crucial for a better understanding of CD44 dynamics in tumor cell migration and invasion. Consistent with the implication of CD44 in cell migration, CD44 has been known to associate with actin-cytoskeleton via binding to ERM proteins (16Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins consist of three closely related proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, and behave as regulatable scaffold proteins that anchor actin filaments to the plasma membrane (17Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). CD44·ERM complex formation has been reported to be regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Rho (18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), which belongs to the Rho family proteins. The Rho family proteins, consisting of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies, regulate various cell functions, including cell migration. The best characterized function involves their regulation of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (19Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 20Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 21Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Rho is involved in the assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions in many types of cells (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar), Rac induces lamellipodia and membrane ruffling (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar), and Cdc42 regulates the formation of filopodia (24Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These dynamic actin structures provide the driving force for cell migration. Considering that cell migration is undoubtedly complex, requiring coordinated activities of the cytoskeletal, membrane, and adhesion systems (25Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar,26Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the Rho family proteins may not only internally regulate actin-cytoskeleton but also externally regulate the CD44-ECM interaction in CD44-mediated tumor cell migration. To address mechanisms regulating CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain, we determined the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin on CD44. We found that each agent rapidly enhanced CD44 cleavage through distinct pathways. Concomitant with the induction of CD44 cleavage during TPA stimulation, we also observed the coordinated regulation of Rho and Rac in TPA-treated U251MG cells. Therefore, we have focused on the role of the Rho family proteins in regulating CD44 cleavage. The monoclonal antibody BU52 (Ancell, Bayport, MN) is directed against the ectodomain epitope common to all CD44 isoforms. An antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of CD44, anti-CD44cyto pAb, was raised in rabbits as described previously (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The M11, R21, and M22 mAb, which were raised in rats against recombinant mouse ezrin, radixin and moesin, respectively, were kindly supplied by Dr. Sachiko Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (27Takeuchi K.

The anti-HA monoclonal antibody was prepared from 12CA5 cells. mAb065, an anti-rat β-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with β-tubulin from all species (plant to human), was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (used for Western blotting) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3 (used for immunofluorescence microscopy) were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Chemicals were obtained as follows: carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl- eucinyl-leucinal (MG132) was from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan); TPA and l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were from Sigma; GF109203X was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); and calcium ionophore (ionomycin) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor, BB2516 (marimastat) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Nakajima (Novartis Pharmaceutical, Takarazuka, Japan). The human glioblastoma cell line U251MG was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV12, -Rac1N17, and -Rac1V12 plasmids were constructed as described previously (28Amano M.

These expression plasmids were transfected into U251MG cells using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 104 cells in 2 ml of medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes or 6-well dishes 12 h before transfection. 1 μg of plasmid was added to the cells after preincubation for 15 min with 3 μl of FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent and 100 μl of serum-free medium. Supernatants of treated cells were filtered using a 0.22-μm Millipore filter (Bedford, MA) before analysis. Soluble CD44 in the culture supernatant was quantified using a soluble CD44 s ELISA kit (Bender MedSystem, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the Western blot analysis, the cultured cells were directly lysed with SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 120 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. In some experiments, the cultured cells were mechanically scraped, and the cell pellets were immediately lysed with SDS sample buffer as described previously (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The samples containing equal amounts of cell lysates extracted from equal numbers of cells were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters with a constant current of 120 mA for 2 h. The filters were blocked in PBS containing 10% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20 for 1 h and washed three times for 7 min each time with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20. The filters were then incubated for 40 min with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20, and specific proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). U251MG cells grown on 35-mm culture dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, during secondary antibody incubation, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to reveal F-actin. After being washed with PBS, samples were mounted in 80% glycerol and visualized with a confocal microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an argon gas laser and appropriate filter sets to allow the simultaneous recording of fluorescein. Fluorescence micrographs were recorded using PL APO 40× objectives and were sampled at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels and 8-bits/color. Throughout this study, we confirmed that no bleed-through occurred between different channels by comparing the results obtained by depleting one primary antibody. We showed previously that CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain in cancer cells generated a membrane-tethered cleavage product that was detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody (anti-CD44cyto pAb) against the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The CD44 cleavage product was clearly detected by anti-CD44cyto pAb in the highly invasive human glioma cell line U251MG, when the cells were mechanically scraped in preparing the lysates, as shown in our preceding paper (Fig.1 A, lane 1) (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CD44 cleavage product was not observed in the presence of the specific metalloprotease inhibitor BB2516 (marimastat) during mechanical scraping of the cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). These results are in line with our previous demonstration that CD44 expressed in cancer cells is proteolytically cleaved at the extracellular domain by metalloproteases (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the course of further studies, we found that the CD44 cleavage product was hardly detectable when the U251MG cells were directly lysed with SDS sample buffer without scraping (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Interestingly, when the lysates were prepared from the proteasome inhibitor MG132-treated U251MG cells without mechanical scraping, three bands of with apparent molecular masses between 20 and 30 kDa became apparent (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). The bands were absent in the presence of the metalloprotease inhibitor BB2516 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), indicating that these fragments are generated by metalloprotease-mediated CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain. The difference in the size of the three fragments suggests existence of plural cleavage sites in the membrane proximal of CD44 ectodomain or modifications of the CD44 cleavage product. Our data indicate that CD44 cleavage product is rapidly degraded through intracellular proteolytic pathways, and thereby, the membrane-bound CD44 cleavage product is not detectable in the lysates prepared without mechanical scraping. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation itself, such as scraping of cells, which may activate diverse intracellular signalings, strongly enhances the CD44 cleavage reaction in cancer cells having high CD44 cleavage activity, and the enhancement enables us to detect the resultant cleavage product. These observations prompted us to investigate what type of intracellular signaling can enhance the metalloprotease-mediated CD44 cleavage at extracellular domain. Because phorbol esters have been shown to facilitate proteolytic cleavage of several cell surface receptors and release the soluble form (30Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 31Werb Z. Yan Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether phorbol esters can induce CD44 cleavage in cancer cells. U251MG cells were incubated with TPA, and then the levels of soluble CD44 released into the culture supernatants were determined by an ELISA system. TPA treatment induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in the release of soluble CD44 (Fig. 2 A). To verify that the increase in the soluble CD44 level was caused by enhancement of CD44 cleavage, the cell lysates prepared without mechanical scraping were analyzed by Western blot using anti-CD44cyto pAb. The CD44 cleavage products were exhibited in U251MG cells treated with TPA but not in the cells without any treatment (Fig.2 C, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2), whereas bands of full-length CD44 (85 kDa) were consistently detected in both cell lysates (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). These findings reveal that the elevation of soluble CD44 observed in TPA-treated U251MG cells results from the induction of CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain, although a considerable amount of CD44 remains uncleaved on the cell surface. The effects of TPA were completely blocked in the presence of BB2516 (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 5), indicating that the induction of CD44 cleavage by TPA treatment is mediated by metalloprotease. This observation is consistent with our previous demonstrations that CD44 cleavage at cancer cells surface is evoked by metalloproteases (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TPA is a known activator of PKC. To examine whether TPA-induced proteolytic cleavage of CD44 is PKC activation-dependent, U251MG cells were pretreated with the specific PKC inhibitors GF109203X prior to addition of TPA and then analyzed for the effect on CD44 cleavage by ELISA and Western blot using anti-CD44cyto pAb. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 (B and C), pretreatment with GF109203X prevented TPA-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 4). These results suggest that the induction of CD44 cleavage in the presence of TPA requires PKC activity. Because the activity of certain PKC isoforms is Ca2+-dependent (32Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar, 33Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels may activate PKC and subsequently produce effects similar to those of TPA on CD44 cleavage. We therefore treated U251MG cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin and then analyzed for the effect on CD44 cleavage as described above. Treatment of cells with ionomycin-induced release of soluble CD44 in a dose- and time-dependent manner and yielded the CD44 cleavage products detected with anti-CD44cyto pAb (Fig. 2, D and F, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). The fact that the ionomycin effect was abolished in medium containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA indicated that CD44 cleavage can be induced by the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane followed by the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2, E and F, lane 3). Furthermore, the ionomycin-induced CD44 cleavage was completely blocked in the presence of BB2516, as seen with TPA (Fig. 2, E nd F, lane 5). These results indicate that extracellular Ca2+ influx enhances CD44 cleavage mediated by metalloproteases. We subsequently examined whether PKC plays a role in ionomycin-induced proteolytic cleavage of CD44. Interestingly, pretreatment with GF109203X had no significant inhibitory effect on ionomycin-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2, E and F, lane 4), indicating that PKC activity is not required for the cleavage induction mechanism, whereas it was essential for TPA-induced CD44 cleavage. Moreover, in contrast with its effect on ionomycin, chelation of Ca2+ in the medium had minimal inhibitory effects on TPA-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 3). Thus, TPA- and ionomycin-induced CD44 cleavage were distinct in terms of their sensitivities to GF109203X and chelation of Ca2+, whereas metalloprotease inhibitors blocked CD44 cleavage induced by both TPA and ionomycin. Taken together, these findings show that there are at least two independent pathways leading to the induction of CD44 proteolytic cleavage mediated by metalloproteases. To further investigate the role of TPA and ionomycin in the regulation of CD44 cleavage, we examined the effect of these treatments on CD44 localization at the plasma membrane. Confocal microscopic analysis of U251MG cells without any treatment showed that CD44 was mainly located at filopodia and membrane ruffling areas where polymerized actin was concentrated at the inner surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A–D, M, and O). The ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) also showed a distribution similar to that of CD44 (Fig. 3, E–H), and double immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CD44 was precisely colocalized with the ERM proteins at filopodia and ruffling areas (Fig. 3, I–P). These staining patterns are consistent with the earlier reports that CD44 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the ERM proteins, which are thought to function as cross-linking proteins between plasma membranes and actin filaments (16Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Notably, treatment of U251MG cells with TPA-induced membrane ruffling over the entire cell surface within 10 min (Fig.4, A–D) followed by a loss of actin stress fibers at 30 min (Fig. 4, E–H). The newly generated membrane ruffling was always observed during the treatment, and both CD44 and the ERM proteins were redistributed to the TPA-induced ruffling areas where the colocalization of these proteins was observed (Fig. 4, C, G, and I–L). Pretreatment of U251MG cells with BB2516, which strongly prevented TPA-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C), did not affect the TPA-induced CD44 redistribution (Fig. 4, M–P), indicating that CD44 cleavage is not necessary for TPA-induced CD44 redistribution. On the other hand, ionomycin treatment did not show apparent alterations in the localization of CD44 and the ERM proteins under the condition that enhanced CD44 cleavage (data not shown). The Rho small G protein family is reported to be involved in phorbol ester-induced membrane ruffling (34Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 35Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakao K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the regulation of the Rho family proteins in CD44 redistribution to TPA-induced membrane ruffling areas. We transiently transfected the plasmid encoding HA epitope-tagged dominant active mutant of RhoA (RhoAV14) into U251MG cells. Treatment of the RhoAV14 transfected cells with TPA for 30 min did not reduce the stress fibers (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with earlier observations that Rho activation enhanced the formation of stress fibers (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the RhoAV14-transfected cells, the membrane ruffling and CD44 redistribution were not observed during TPA treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). Because it is well known that membrane ruffling is induced by activation of Rac (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar), we transiently transfected U251MG cells with an HA-tagged Rac1N17 dominant negative mutant. Treatment of the Rac1N17-transfected cells with TPA did not induce the membrane ruffling and CD44 redistribution during the treatment (Fig. 5, E–H). Furthermore, we transfected an HA-tagged Rac1V12 dominant active mutant into U251MG cells. As reported previously (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar), the expression of Rac1V12 in U251MG cells induced ruffling at the margin of the plasma membrane, and the expressed active Rac itself was found to be accumulated in the ruffling areas (Fig. 5, I and L). In the Rac1V12 transfected cells, relocalization of CD44 and the ERM proteins to the Rac1V12 induced ruffling areas was clearly observed (Fig. 5, I–N). Thus, the redistribution of CD44 and the ERM proteins to membrane ruffles induced by Rac1V12 were similar to observations in TPA-treated U251MG cells. Taken together, the coordinated regulation of the Rho family proteins may be involved in the redistribution of CD44 and the ERM proteins to TPA-induced membrane ruffling. Because the TPA-induced CD44 redistribution and CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain took place simultaneously, we next examined possible involvement of the Rho family proteins in TPA-induced CD44 cleavage. To address the possibility, we took advantage of LPA, which is known to activate the Rho-dependent pathway (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). U251MG cells were treated with LPA in serum-free medium for 3 h and then stimulated with TPA. In most U251MG cells pretreated with LPA, the TPA-induced reduction of actin stress fibers and CD44 redistribution was impaired (Fig.6 A) consistent with our observations in dominant active Rho-transfected U251MG cells (Fig. 5, A–D), although these effects of LPA appeared to be less than those by introduction of active Rho. The treatment of cells with LPA clearly inhibited the TPA-induced increase in soluble CD44 and CD44 cleavage product in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6, B and C) but not the ionomycin-induced CD44 release (Fig. 6 D), which acts through a different mechanism from TPA (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the finely regulated Rho family proteins are involved in regulation of TPA-induced CD44 cleavage. To obtain further evidence of the involvement of the Rho family proteins in CD44 cleavage, based on the regulation of Rac activity found in TPA-treated U251MG cells, we tested effects of the expression of dominant active or negative Rac on the induction of CD44 cleavage. U251MG cells were transfected with HA-tagged Rac1V12 dominant active or HA-tagged Rac1N17 dominant negative or control vector plasmids (Fig.7 A). At 8 h post-transfection, cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with fresh medium, and the level of soluble CD44 in the conditioned medium was determined. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the dominant active Rac-transfected cells released significantly larger amounts of soluble CD44 than the control vector- or dominant negative Rac-transfected cells (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that activation of Rac plays a role in the promotion of CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain. In this study, we have firstly demonstrated that the membrane-tethered cleavage products generated following the proteolytic cleavage of CD44 at the extracellular domain is degraded through intracellular proteolytic pathways. Western blot analysis in the lysates prepared without mechanical scraping of the cells shows that the CD44 cleavage product is normally unstable and that the products are stabilized by MG132, which inhibits intracellular proteolysis activities including the proteasome, calpains, and lysosomal cysteine proteases. Our present data give the evidence that CD44 is processed by two sequential proteolytic events at the extra- and intracellular domains. We have identified two independent pathways that promote proteolytic cleavage of CD44 at the extracellular domain in U251MG cells. The first pathway is activated by extracellular Ca2+ influx and is PKC-independent. Elevations in intracellular Ca2+concentration are known to activate PKC (32Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar, 33Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, the lack of inhibitory effects of PKC inhibitor GF109203X on ionomycin-induced CD44 cleavage indicates that possible downstream PKC activation is not required for functional activation of the first pathway. The second pathway is activated by the phorbol ester TPA and is PKC-dependent. TPA can often stimulate proteolytic processing of the extracellular domain of several cell surface molecules (30Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 31Werb Z. Yan Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although TPA is known as a potent PKC activator, the proteolytic stimulation by TPA has been insufficient to demonstrate the involvement of PKC-dependent regulation. For example, TPA-induced cleavage of angiotensin converting enzyme has been reported to be resistant to several PKC inhibitors, indicating the activation of the PKC-independent pathway by TPA (37Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous reports indicated that CD44 can be enzymatically released from the cell surface of phorbol ester-stimulated leukocytes (38Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1314-1322PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of the agents on CD44 expressed in cancer cells and the involvement of PKC activation are unknown. Here, we have confirmed in U251MG cells that TPA rapidly enhances CD44 cleavage and that PKC activation is necessary for the enhancement. The existence of such several distinct pathways for the regulation of proteolytic cleavage at the extracellular domain have been also shown in other membrane proteins, including transforming growth factor-α, Kit ligand, c-kit receptor, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (39Pandiella A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5769-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Huang E.J. Nocka K.H. Buck J. Besmer P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 41Yee N.S. Langen H. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14189-14201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is notable that the induction of CD44 cleavage through the extracellular Ca2+-mediated pathway or the PKC-mediated pathway was blocked by a specific metalloprotease inhibitor, indicating that these distinct pathways share a common component, metalloproteases, in the CD44 cleavage mechanisms. These results are supported by our previous demonstration that membrane-associated metalloproteases cleave CD44 at the extracellular domain in several cancer cell lines, including U251MG cells (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In parallel with the induction of CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain, we have found that TPA treatment results in the redistribution of CD44 and ERM proteins to the newly formed membrane ruffling areas in U251MG cells. ERM proteins have bipartite domains, composed of the N-terminal domain responsible for binding to a transmembrane protein and the C-terminal domain that binds to actin filaments, and serve as cross-linkers between plasma membranes and actin filaments (17Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). CD44 has been proposed to be an integral membrane target for ERM proteins (16Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated that the association of ERM proteins with the plasma membrane and actin filaments is regulated by the Rho family proteins, and this regulatable scaffold (membrane-ERM-actin filaments) is thought to be an essential prerequisite for both Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 19Hall A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34663-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We found that dominant active Rho and dominant negative Rac impair the TPA-induced membrane ruffling and redistribution of CD44 and ERM proteins, whereas dominant active Rac induces their redistribution to the Rac-induced membrane ruffling areas. Taken together, these observations suggest that TPA-induced redistribution of CD44 and ERM proteins is under the control of coordinated regulation of Rho and Rac. In the present study, we have shown that treatment of the cells with LPA inhibits both TPA-induced CD44 redistribution and promotion of CD44 cleavage. LPA have been thought to activate Rho based on an ability to induce stress fiber formation in a Rho-dependent manner (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). Our findings that LPA treatment, as well as dominant active Rho, inhibited TPA-induced formation of membrane rufflings followed by reduction of stress fibers likely result from impairment of the fine regulation between Rac and Rho activity, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that LPA may have other actions. Therefore, the fact that U251MG cells pretreated with LPA no longer respond to TPA-induced CD44 cleavage suggests that regulation of the Rho family proteins is involved in the CD44 cleavage. Furthermore, the promotion of CD44 cleavage in U251MG cells overexpressing dominant active Rac supports this notion and suggests that activation of Rac plays a role in the regulated processing of CD44. We have demonstrated previously that CD44 cleavage is mediated by a membrane-bound metalloprotease expressed in cancer cells (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). If the metalloprotease and CD44 are localized apart at the membrane, the redistribution followed by clustering of the protease and substrate might be essential for triggering this proteolytic processing. Therefore, we propose that one plausible role for the Rho family in CD44 cleavage may be the spatial organization between the CD44 cleavage metalloprotease and CD44. As in our demonstration that CD44 and ERM proteins are dramatically redistributed and colocalized on the membrane through activation of Rac, the Rho family proteins may finely regulate the recruitment of the CD44 cleavage metalloprotease to CD44. Identification of the metalloprotease and its distribution on the membrane will provide further insight into the mechanisms of regulated CD44 cleavage. The Rho family proteins have been shown to regulate cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion (46Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J.

Concomitant with their effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, the Rho family proteins thus act as key regulatory molecule in the formation of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesions through cell surface receptors. In our preceding paper (15Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), CD44 cleavage at the extracellular domain was demonstrated to play a critical role in CD44-mediated tumor cell migration by providing offsetting changes in adhesive interactions between CD44 and ECM. The results of the present study suggest the involvement of the Rho family proteins in the CD44 regulatory mechanism.

Comparison of protein C activation in the presence and absence of TM identified 11 residues mediating the thrombin-TM interaction (Lys21, Gln24, Arg62, Lys65, His66, Arg68, Thr69, Tyr71, Arg73, Lys77, Lys106). Three mutants (E25A, D51A, R89A/R93A/E94A) were found to have decreased ability to activate TAFI yet retained normal protein C activation, whereas three other mutants (R178A/R180A/D183A, E229A, R233A) had decreased ability to activate protein C but maintained normal TAFI activation. One mutant (W50A) displayed decreased activation of both substrates. Mapping of these functional residues on thrombin revealed that the 11 residues mediating the thrombin-TM interaction are all located in exosite I. Residues important in TAFI activation are located above the active-site cleft, whereas residues involved in protein C are located below the active-site cleft.

Binding of thrombin to the endothelial cell surface protein thrombomodulin (TM)1 alters the substrate specificities of the enzyme, leading to loss of its procoagulant activities.

Like PC, there is a 1,000-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of TM-bound thrombin for TAFI activation compared with free thrombin. Unlike PC, TAFI is a metalloproteinase, has a short half-life, and has no identified specific plasma inhibitor, and the thrombin cleavage site in TAFI shares no homology to the site in PC. The thrombin domains involved in TAFI activation have not yet been identified.Insights into the diverse specificities of thrombin have come from structural analysis of the crystallized molecule bound to either specific inhibitors (PPACK, hirudin) or substrate peptides (fibrinopeptide A, hirulog) (reviewed in Ref. 14Stubbs M.T.

There are two patches of positively charged residues located on opposite sides of the active site termed exosite I and exosite II, and it is primarily these two domains that interact with the majority of substrates of thrombin and contribute to its exquisite specificity. Thrombin also contains a sodium-binding site, which is intimately involved in mediating allosteric changes within the molecule (15Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M.

Sodium is coordinated by the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Arg233 and Lys236, and the entire binding environment involves a charge-stabilizing system that includes Glu229, Glu146, Arg197, Asp234, and Tyr237.Functional studies into the contribution of these structural domains to the activities of thrombin have come from a variety of methodologies including the use of proteolyzed thrombin preparations (16Hofsteenge J.

We have previously described the approach of alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in which 79 highly exposed charged or polar residues on thrombin were individually mutated to alanine, and this library of mutants was screened for clotting activity, PC activation, and inhibition by antithrombin III (38Tsiang M.

These studies demonstrated that all of these functional residues were located on one hemisphere of the molecule, which included the active site cleft and exosites I. Residues in which mutations caused changes in the procoagulant and anticoagulant activities of thrombin were not spatially distinct, but specific mutations that dissociated the clotting activity of thrombin from its PC anticoagulant activity were identified. This work led to the development of a novel class of anticoagulants, termed protein C activators, which have demonstrated in vivo anticoagulant (40Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E.

Haemostasis. 1997; : 419Google Scholar).To identify key residues in thrombin involved in TAFI activation, we decided to use the library of thrombin alanine mutants to compare the activation of the TM-dependent substrates PC and TAFI. Previous studies with the thrombin mutants used the strategy of transient expression of mutant prothrombin, activation by Echis carinatus venom, and thrombin quantitation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although allowing for rapid screening, this strategy is limited by a number of factors, including obtaining limiting amounts of the mutants, the presence of venom in the media that can interfere in assays of the activities of thrombin, and accuracy/reproducibility of the quantitation of enzyme concentration. To circumvent these problems, we have expressed these mutants in stable cell lines and purified them to homogeneity to have a collection of readily usable reagents that can broadly be used for structural-functional analyses of thrombin-substrate interactions. In the present study, we used this purified collection to identify thrombin residues involved in the activation of PC and TAFI. By using two TM-dependent substrates, we were able to distinguish residues important in the thrombin-TM interaction from those involved with the individual substrates. The results show that distinct domains in thrombin are involved in PC, TAFI, and TM binding and that PC and TAFI activation can be dissociated from each other.DISCUSSIONThis study describes the use of a large collection of thrombin mutants to identify key residues involved in the interaction of thrombin with thrombomodulin, protein C, and TAFI. This stategy of alanine scanning has been described previously (38Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in which 79 charged or polar surface residues on thrombin have been systematically mutated to alanine to minimize nonspecific structural pertubations in the molecule while focusing on those residues most likely to mediate the interactions of thrombin with macromolecular substrates. These residues cover 62% of the solvent-accessible surface of the molecule, allowing for a comprehensive structural-functional analysis of the molecule. To obtain a readily usable set of reagents in sufficient quantity for detailed studies, the library of mutants was converted into purified thrombin preparations. The thrombin mutants used here were purified after expression in CHO cells and have similar enzymatic and clotting activities to those of transiently expressed thrombins in crude cell supernatants used in earlier studies. Despite the heterogeneity in glycosylation of the proteins, there was no evidence for any significant effects on the enzymatic properties of thrombin when produced in CHO cells rather than COS-7 cells.By comparing the activation of two thrombin-TM-dependent substrates, we were able to identify specific domains on thrombin mediating its interaction with each of these molecules. Mutations in thrombin were found that either had selective effects on PC activation, TAFI activation, or both. Those mutations affecting both substrates were found to do so primarily by disruption of the thrombin-TM interaction, and all of these residues are located in exosite I. In the previous study (38Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), only two residues (Arg70, Gln24) were identified that had normalized PC activation in the absence of TM compared with 11 residues in the current study. This difference is most likely due to differences in the assay conditions. In the original study, PC activation without TM was carried out in the absence of calcium and compared with activation with TM in the presence of calcium. Calcium has been shown to have direct effects on PC activation (45Parkinson J.F. Grinnel B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so that a direct comparison of thrombin mutant PC activation under different buffer conditions could be misleading. In the current study, PC activation was determined under identical buffer conditions. In addition, we found only a minor effect for the R70A mutant on PC activation (∼50% WT activity), which differs from the previous study. There may be differences between the soluble TM used in this study and the full-length membrane-bound form used previously (38Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), although a recent study suggests that there is little difference in TAFI activation between these two forms of TM (46Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Morser J. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2792-2798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The current PC activation results have been repeated using a second preparation of R70A, and the presence of the R70A mutation in the purified protein was confirmed by using Lys-C digestion followed by mass spectroscopy of the thrombin fragments (data not shown). This residue was also studied by Wu et al. (26Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lenz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), who found more profound effects, but these may be attributed in part to the mutant used in their studies, R70E, which involves a charge reversal that could have more dramatic effects on thrombin-TM binding.Enhanced activation of PC by thrombin in the presence of TM is postulated to occur by formation of a ternary complex, which could lead to either conformational changes in thrombin, which change its substrate specificity (7Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or changes in PC, which make it a better substrate for thrombin (47Vindigni A. White C.E. Komines E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutations in thrombin could interfere with formation of the thrombin-TM complex, could affect its ability to undergo the allosteric changes needed for proper substrate activation, or could directly affect interactions with PC. In this communication, we have used the panel of purified thrombin mutants as a general screen to identify interesting residues involved in TAFI and PC activation for future studies.Enhanced PC activation in the absence of TM has been described previously for two thrombin mutants, E25K and E202Q (28Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has led to the hypothesis that there are repulsive interactions between thrombin and the P′3 and P3 aspartate residues in PC, making PC a poor substrate for free thrombin. We confirmed this finding for the E25A mutant and observed the same effect for R20A. This is not completely unexpected, as Arg20 is hydrogen-bonded with Glu25, and mutation of either residue would disrupt this interaction (29Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of autodegradation, E202A could not be produced and tested in this system. Whether or not a similar mechanism for TAFI activation exists remains to be tested. The P3 and P′3 residues of TAFI are not acidic (NDTVSP R ASAYY), and in the absence of TM, thrombin will cleave at additional sites leading to TAFI inactivation. Furthermore, mutation of acidic residues in thrombin (Glu25, Asp51, and possibly Glu94) diminishes TAFI activation, suggesting there may be important basic residues in TAFI mediating the thrombin interaction. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism for enhanced TAFI activation with TM.Although mapping of the residues important in fibrinogen clotting and PC activation (with TM) showed considerable overlap in the molecule, those involved in PC and TAFI activation show that distinct domains are involved. The residues important in TAFI activation lie above the active site, involving and in close proximity to the Trp50insertion loop. Trp50 itself appears to be a critical residue for all of the activities of thrombin, as mutation or deletion of this residue results in diminished small molecule substrate hydrolysis, fibrinogen cleavage, PC activation, and antithrombin III inhibition. This is unlikely to be due to nonspecific stuctural pertubations within the loop, as mutations of neighboring residues have very selective effects; D51A has normal clotting activity and PC activation but diminished TAFI activation, whereas K52A has diminished clotting activity but normal PC and TAFI activation. The residues important in PC activation are below the active site and clustered around the sodium binding pocket. Mutation of these residues may lead to allosteric changes in thrombin affecting PC activation, or alternatively, represent residues in direct contact with the substrate, which then affects sodium binding. In either case, these residues are not involved in TAFI activation.Previous studies with EGF deletion mutants (48Kokame K. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 49Nesheim M.E. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the functional TM requirements for enhanced PC and TAFI activation. EGF5–6 of TM binds with high affinity to thrombin but does not enhance PC activation, whereas EGF i4–6 supports enhanced PC but not TAFI activation. EGF3–6 supports both enhanced PC and TAFI activation, but deletion of EGF4 alone (to give EGF35–6) does not support activation of either TAFI or PC. These data, taken together with the current thrombin mapping data, suggests one possible model for formation of the ternary complexes. Namely, EGF5–6 would mediate the binding of TM to thrombin exosite I and orient EGF4 and EGF3 such that they are adjacent to the lower and upper lips of the active-site cleft, respectively. EGF4 would then align PC along the lower cleft, where it could interact with the residues around the sodium binding pocket, which is located on the opposite side of the molecule from exosite I. This assembly process is further augmented by the endothelial cell PC receptor (50Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the current mapping data suggest that thrombin and PC would be bridged on opposite sides by TM and the endothelial PC receptor in a quaternary complex. On the other hand, EGF3 would align TAFI along the upper lip to contact the acidic residues in and around the Trp50loop. Although perhaps overly simplistic, this model could be tested directly using TM alanine mutants in conjunction with the thrombin alanine mutants or TAFI mutants to map potential sites of interaction between all of these molecules. In addition, the thrombin mutant data along with the TM deletion data strongly suggest that the mechanisms of activation of TAFI and PC by the thrombin-TM complex are quite different.In summary, a large collection of purified thrombin alanine mutants was used to map the interaction of thrombin with TM, PC, and TAFI. These studies demonstrated that specific mutations can dissociate PC from TAFI activation in the presence of TM. This library represents a powerful set of reagents for studying the numerous macromolecular interactions of thrombin. By examining the functional requirements for a particular thrombin activity, one may identify candidate residues that effectively dissociate one thrombin activity from another. Since knock-out of the prothrombin gene in mice results in either embryonic lethality or death soon after birth from hemorrhage (22Xue J. Wu Q. Westfield L.A. Tuley E.A. Lu D. Zhang Q. Shim K.

Thrombin is unique among the clotting cascade serine proteases in its ability to interact with a large number of diverse substrates. These interactions can paradoxically lead to either procoagulant or anticoagulant effects. Procoagulant properties of thrombin include cleavage of fibrinogen to form a fibrin clot (1Mosesson M.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 19: 361-367Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), activation of platelets through cleavage of the thrombin receptor(s) (2Liu L.W. Vu T.K. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J.

Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Binding of thrombin to the endothelial cell surface protein thrombomodulin (TM)1 alters the substrate specificities of the enzyme, leading to loss of its procoagulant activities. The thrombin-TM complex acts as an anticoagulant through activation of protein C (PC), which attenuates the clotting cascade by inactivation of the activated cofactors V and VIII (6Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, thrombin activity can be regulated by several serine protease inhibitors, including antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II, and protease nexin I (7Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D.

Recently, a new substrate for the thrombin-TM complex has been identified termed plasma procarboxypeptidase B or thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) (10Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Activated TAFI functions as a fibrinolysis inhibitor by cleavage of C-terminal lysines from partially degraded fibrin, diminishing the activation of plasminogen, leading to delayed clot lysis (11Bajzar L.

Like PC, there is a 1,000-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of TM-bound thrombin for TAFI activation compared with free thrombin. Unlike PC, TAFI is a metalloproteinase, has a short half-life, and has no identified specific plasma inhibitor, and the thrombin cleavage site in TAFI shares no homology to the site in PC. The thrombin domains involved in TAFI activation have not yet been identified. Insights into the diverse specificities of thrombin have come from structural analysis of the crystallized molecule bound to either specific inhibitors (PPACK, hirudin) or substrate peptides (fibrinopeptide A, hirulog) (reviewed in Ref. 14Stubbs M.T.

We isolated here a downstream target of Rab11, named rabphilin-11, from bovine brain. Moreover, we isolated from a rat brain cDNA library its cDNA, which encoded a protein with a Mr of 100,946 and 908 amino acids (aa). Rabphilin-11 bound GTP-Rab11 more preferentially than GDP-Rab11 at the N-terminal region and was specific for Rab11 and inactive for other Rab and Rho small G proteins.

In HeLa cells cultured on fibronectin, both the proteins were localized not only at perinuclear regions but also along microtubules, which were oriented toward membrane lamellipodia. Treatment of HeLa cells with nocodazole caused disruption of microtubules and dispersion of GTP-Rab11 and rabphilin-11. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (aa 607–730), lacking the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, in HeLa cells reduced accumulation of transferrin at perinuclear regions and cell migration.

Rab11 is ubiquitously expressed but particularly enriched in tissues with active vesicle trafficking (6Sakurada K. Uchida K. Yamaguchi K. Aisaka K. Ito S. Ohmori T. Takeyama Y. Ueda T. Hori Y.

Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6578-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Rab11 has subsequently been shown to be localized at sorting endosomes, recycling endosomes, the trans- Golgi network membranes, and the post-Golgi secretory vesicles, and to be implicated in vesicle recycling (8Urbé S.

A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the mode of action of Rab11 in vesicle recycling has not yet been clarified. The Rab family small G proteins have two interconvertible forms, the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms (3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The conversion of the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is regulated by two types of upstream regulators, GEPs and GDIs. The reverse conversion is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins. Each Rab family member appears to have its specific GEP and GTPase-activating protein, whereas GDIs are active on all the Rab family members. The GTP-bound form binds to downstream target(s) that exerts its function. Of the many Rab family members, the downstream targets of Rab3, -5, -6, -8, and -9, named rabphilin-3 (12Shirataki H.

However, neither the upstream regulators nor the downstream targets of Rab11 have been identified. We isolated and characterized here a downstream target of Rab11. We named this protein rabphilin-11, because we previously isolated and characterized a downstream target of Rab3 and named it rabphilin-3 (philin for the Greek word for friend) (13Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). GST-Rab11, -Rab3A, -Rab5, and -RhoA were purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli as described (12Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Horiuchi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10946-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 blot overlay was done as described (21Manser E. Leung T. Monfries C. Teo M. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16025-16028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-Rab11 (40 pmol) was labeled with 1.25 μm [35S]GTPγS (1.4 × 106 cpm/pmol) by incubation at 30 °C for 20 min in a solution (40 μl) containing 18 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 8.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm DTT, 4.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.3% CHAPS. After this incubation, 4 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 13 mm, and the mixture was immediately cooled on ice. Where indicated, [35S]GDPβS (1.4 × 106 cpm/pmol) was used instead of [35S]GTPγS. The sample to be tested was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked at 4 °C in PBS containing 5 mm DTT, 50 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml BSA. The membrane was then incubated at room temperature for 5 min, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 10 min with 5 nm[35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 (7.0 × 106 cpm) in a solution (1 ml) containing 25 mm MES/NaOH at pH 6.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 1.25 mmMgCl2, and 1.25 mg/ml BSA. Where indicated, non-radioactive GTPγS-GST-Rab3A, -Rab5, or -RhoA (650 pmol each) was added to this solution. After the incubation , the membrane was washed with 25 mm MES/NaOH at pH 6.5 containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100, followed by autoradiography by use of an image analyzer (Fujix BAS-2000; Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). All the following procedures were done at 4 °C. Bovine brains (250 g wet weight) were homogenized with a solution (300 ml) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.32m sucrose, and a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μm p- amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C until use. One-eighth of the supernatant (40 ml, 320 mg of protein) was applied on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2). Elution was performed with a 240-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–1m) in Buffer A. Fractions of 4 ml each were collected. Rabphilin-11 appeared in fractions 16–18. The active fractions (12 ml, 10 mg of protein) were collected. The rest of the supernatant fraction was also subjected to the Mono Q column chromatography in the same manner as described above. The active fractions of the eight Mono Q column chromatographies were combined. Half of the combined sample (48 ml, 40 mg of protein) was applied on a hydroxyapatite column (1.0 × 10 cm; Calbiochem) equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mmpotassium phosphate at pH 7.5 and 1 mm DTT). Elution was performed with a 120-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate (20–500 mm) in Buffer B. Fractions of 2 ml each were collected. Rabphilin-11 appeared in fractions 10–16. The active fractions (14 ml, 2 mg of protein) were collected. The other half of the combined sample of the Mono Q column chromatographies was also subjected to the hydroxyapatite column chromatography in the same manner as described above. The active fractions (28 ml, 4 mg of protein) of the two hydroxyapatite column chromatographies were combined and applied on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1% cholate. Elution was performed with a 15-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–1m) in Buffer A containing 1% cholate. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. Rabphilin-11 appeared in fractions 12–20. The active fractions (4.5 ml, 2 mg of protein) were collected and applied on a TSK gel phenyl-5PW RP column (0.75 × 7.5 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a 60-ml linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80%) in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. Rabphilin-11 appeared in fractions 78–83 (see Fig. 1). The active fractions (3 ml, 0.3 mg of protein) were collected and lyophilized. This lyophilized sample (0.3 mg of protein) was dissolved in 0.3 ml of Laemmli's buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide gel). The protein band corresponding to a protein with a Mr of about 140,000 was cut out from the gel and digested with a lysyl endopeptidase, and the digested peptides were separated by TSKgel PODS-80Ts (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh) reverse phase high pressure liquid column chromatography (22Imazumi K. Sasaki T. Takahashi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The aa sequences of the 13 peptides were determined with a peptide sequencer. A rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened by use of the oligonucleotide probes designed from the partial aa sequences. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed in pMALC2 (New England Biolabs), pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pRSET (Invitrogen), and pEGFP (CLONTECH) by use of standard molecular biological methods. Full-length rabphilin-11 was constructed in the pRSET vector. Full-length His6-rabphilin-11 was produced in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine by use of the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The truncated mutants of rabphilin-11 were constructed in the pMALC2 and pGEX vectors as follows: pMALC2-rabphilin-11–1, aa 1–631; pMALC2-rabphilin-11–2, aa 632–908; pMALC2-rabphilin-11–3, aa 53–301; and pGEX-rabphilin-11–3, aa 53–301. The full-length and truncated mutants of rabphilin-11 were constructed in the pEGFP vector; pEGFP-rabphilin-11, full length; pEGFP-rabphilin-11–1, aa 1–631; and pEGFP-rabphilin-11–4, aa 607–730 . MDCK cells were supplied by Dr. W. Birchmeier (Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). HeLa cells were supplied by Dr. S. Orita (Discovery Research Laboratory, Shionogi & Co. LTD, Osaka, Japan). KB cells were supplied by Dr. Y. Miyata (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). MDCK cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells and KB cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in the same medium. Where indicated, HeLa cells were cultured on the dishes precoated with fibronectin. Fibronectin-coated dishes were prepared by incubation of non-treated dishes with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with 1% BSA/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. HeLa cells, which had been cultured on non-treated dishes, were trypsinized and washed once in serum-free DMEM. The cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM (2 × 104 cells/ml), placed on fibronectin-coated dishes, and used for experiments. Transient transfection of pEGFP-rabphilin-11 into MDCK cells or HeLa cells was performed by use of Superfect reagent (Qiagen). MDCK cells stably expressing a Myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Rab11 (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells) or a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11 (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells) were established (23Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of pSRα-Myc-Rab11Q70L in HeLa cells (sHeLa-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells) was carried out by use of Superfect reagent (Qiagen), and cell clones were isolated by resistance to G418 as described previously (23Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). sMDCK cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.75 mg/ml G418. sHeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in the same medium. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against rabphilin-11 was raised against GST-rabphilin-11–3 (aa 53–301). The antiserum was affinity purified with MBP-rabphilin-11–3 (aa 53–301) covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridoma cells expressing the mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). An anti-tubulin β antibody was purchased from Sigma. Second antibodies for immunofluorescence microscopy were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. Temecula, CA). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (23Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells used here were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. After being soaked in 10% FCS/PBS for 1 h, the cells were treated with the first antibody in 10% FCS/PBS for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS three times, followed by incubation with the second antibody in 10% FCS/PBS for 1 h. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were examined by use of a ECLIPSE E800 immunofluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Where indicated, an LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. Assay for internalization of transferrin in HeLa cells or KB cells was performed as described (24Ohya T. Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 613-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells or KB cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the indicated proteins by use of Superfect reagent (Qiagen). After 18 h, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with serum-free DMEM, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were then immunostained and analyzed. Uniform carpet of gold particles was prepared on glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass) as described (25Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 26Takaishi K. Kikuchi A. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The colloidal gold-coated coverslips were placed in 35-mm non-treated dishes, and the coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin by incubation at 4 °C overnight. HeLa cells suspended in DMEM (2 × 104 cells/ml) were added to each gold-coated coverslip and incubated. After 6 h, the cells expressing each GFP-tagged protein were visualized on an inverted DIAPHOT 300 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and cell migration was analyzed by measuring the areas free of gold particles around a single cell. The statistical analysis of migration was analyzed with analysis of variance, and significance was determined by paired t test. SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide gel) was performed as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with BSA as a reference protein (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). We identified a band of [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11-binding activity with a Mr of about 140,000 in the cytosol fraction of bovine brain by use of a blot overlay method with [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 (data not shown). We highly purified this protein (p140) from the cytosol fraction of bovine brain by successive chromatographies of Mono Q, hydroxyapatite, Mono Q, and phenyl-5PW RP columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On the final phenyl-5PW RP column chromatography, the [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11-binding protein band coincided with a protein with a Mr of about 140,000 which was identified by protein staining (Fig.1, A—C). p140 bound [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 more preferentially than [35S]GDPβS-GST-Rab11 (Fig.2 Aa). p140 did not stimulate the GTPase activity of Rab11 (data not shown). p140 did not bind other Rab and Rho small G proteins, including Rab3A, Rab5, and RhoA (Fig.2 Ba). We determined the partial aa sequences of p140. The aa sequences of p140 were not found in the current protein data base. On the basis of this information, we isolated a p140 cDNA from a rat brain cDNA library and determined its nucleotide sequence. The encoded protein consisted of 908 aa and showed a calculated Mr of 100,946 (GenBankTM accession number AF130121) (Fig.3 A). It included all the partial aa sequences except 6 aa. The slight difference of the aa sequences might be due to the differences in species. The calculated Mr value was less than that estimated by SDS-PAGE. To confirm whether this clone contained the full-length cDNA of p140, we constructed the pRSET vector with this cDNA and expressed the protein in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine by use of the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. The in vitro translated product showed a motility similar to that of native p140 on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 Ba). Therefore, we concluded that this clone encoded the full-length cDNA of p140. After we had submitted this original manuscript, Zeng et al. (29Zeng J. Ren M. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) isolated a putative target of Rab11 from bovine brain by the method similar to ours, determined its nucleotide and deduced aa sequences, and named it Rab11BP (Rab11-binding protein). All the partial aa sequences of our p140 were included in the deduced aa sequence of Rab11BP. Comparison of deduced aa sequences of our rat and their bovine proteins revealed that they showed 85% identity over the entire sequences (data not shown). This aa difference might be due to the difference of species, and our rabphilin-11 is most likely to be a rat counterpart of bovine Rab11BP. By use of recombinant rat rabphilin-11, we found that [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 binding activity was located in the N-terminal fragment (aa 1–631) and not in the C-terminal fragment (aa 632–908) (Fig. 3 Bb). This N-terminal fragment, including the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, bound [35S]GTPγS-GST-Rab11 more preferentially than [35S]GDPβS-GST-Rab11 (Fig. 2 Ab). The N-terminal fragment did not stimulate the GTPase activity of Rab11 (data not shown). The N-terminal fragment did not bind other Rab and Rho small G proteins, including Rab3A, Rab5, and RhoA (Fig.2 Bb). Rab11 is expressed in various tissues but abundant in brain, lung, adrenal gland, kidney, pancreas, and testis (6Sakurada K. Uchida K. Yamaguchi K. Aisaka K. Ito S. Ohmori T. Takeyama Y. Ueda T. Hori Y. Ohyanagi H. Saitoh Y. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Hori Y. Takeyama Y. Hiroyoshi M. Ueda T. Maeda A. Ohyanagi H. Saitoh Y. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis indicated that rabphilin-11 was also expressed in various rat tissues examined (Fig.4). Of various cell lines, rabphilin-11 was abundant in MDCK cells, HeLa cells, and PC12 cells (data not shown). Subcellular localization analysis showed that both expressed GDP-Rab11 (a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11, Myc-Rab11S25N), and GFP-tagged full-length rabphilin-11 were found in the cytoplasm in MDCK cells stably expressing Myc-Rab11S25N (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells) (Fig.5 A, a and b), whereas both expressed GTP-Rab11 (a Myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Rab11, Myc-Rab11Q70L), and GFP-tagged full-length rabphilin-11 were colocalized at perinuclear regions (Fig. 5 B, a and b). When endogenous rabphilin-11 was stained in MDCK cells stably expressing Myc-Rab11Q70L (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells) and sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells, essentially the same results were obtained (data not shown). These results suggest that rabphilin-11 binds GTP-Rab11 not only in a cell-free system but also in intact cells and that they are colocalized at perinuclear regions, which presumably correspond to the Golgi complex and recycling endosomes. It has been shown that microtubules are oriented toward lamellipodia (31Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and that microtubules are involved in vesicle recycling (32Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 34Maples C.J. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6741-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We examined the localization of a Myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Rab11 (Myc-Rab11Q70L) and rabphilin-11 in HeLa cells cultured on fibronectin. The HeLa cells cultured on fibronectin showed well developed lamellipodia toward which microtubules were oriented (Fig. 6, A and B). Both Myc-Rab11Q70L and rabphilin-11 were localized not only at perinuclear regions but also along these microtubules (Fig. 6 A). When the GFP-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (GFP-rabphilin-11–1, aa 1–631), including the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, was expressed in HeLa cells cultured on fibronectin, it was localized both at perinuclear regions and along microtubules, whereas when the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (GFP-rabphilin-11–4, aa 607–730), lacking the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, was expressed, it was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of rabphilin-11 is responsible for its localization at perinuclear regions and along microtubules. Treatment of these cells with nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent, caused disruption of microtubules and dispersion of both Myc-Rab11Q70L and rabphilin-11 (Fig. 6 C). These results have provided additional evidence that GTP-Rab11 and rabphilin-11 interact with each other in intact cells and furthermore suggest that both the proteins are localized presumably on the recycling vesicles at perinuclear regions and along microtubules. We examined whether rabphilin-11 indeed regulates vesicle recycling as described for Rab11 (9Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 11Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11 (Myc-Rab11S25N) in HeLa cells markedly inhibited accumulation of transferrin at perinuclear regions as compared with those in wild-type cells (data not shown), consistent with the earlier observations (9Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar,11Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (GFP-rabphilin-11–4, aa 607–730), lacking the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, markedly inhibited this accumulation (Fig.7 A, a and b). However, overexpression of GFP-tagged full-length rabphilin-11 did not affect this accumulation (Fig. 7 A, c and d). Overexpression of the GFP-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (GFP-rabphilin-11–1, aa 1–631), including the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, did not affect this accumulation, either (data not shown). The essentially similar results were obtained when the similar experiments were done with KB cells (Fig. 7 B). It is not clear to which intracellular organellae the perinuclear regions correspond, but they may be the Golgi complex and recycling endosomes. These results, together with the earlier observations that Rab11 regulates vesicle recycling (9Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 11Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggest that rabphilin-11 also regulates vesicle recycling. Transferrin was also observed as small dots widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm in HeLa cells and KB cells (Fig. 7). This distribution of transferrin was not affected by overexpression of Myc-Rab11S25N (data not shown) or the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (Fig. 7, Aa and Ba). It is not clear where these dots correspond, but they may be early endosomes. If this is the case, Rab11 and rabphilin-11 may not be involved in vesicle trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes by endocytosis, and this conclusion is consistent with the earlier observations for Rab11 (9Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 11Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has been reported by Zeng et al. (29Zeng J. Ren M. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal fragment of Rab11BP (aa 1–504) inhibits the accumulation of transferrin at endosomes in TRVb cells, and our above result is apparently inconsistent with this observation. The exact reason for this discrepancy is not known at present, but this might be due either to different lengths of the N-terminal fragments of Rab11BP and rabphilin-11 or to a lower expression level of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (aa 1–631) in our assay system than that of the N-terminal fragment of Rab11BP (aa 1–504) in their assay system. They did not examine the effect of the C-terminal fragment of Rab11BP, but our results clearly indicate that the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (aa 607–730) reduces the accumulation of transferrin at perinuclear regions (Fig. 7, Aa and Ba), and the expression levels of the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments were apparently similar (data not shown). Therefore, it could be concluded from their experiments and our experiments that the C-terminal fragment might be more effective than the N-terminal fragment on inhibiting vesicle recycling. It has been shown that vesicle recycling is necessary for cell migration (35Bretscher M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined whether Rab11 and rabphilin-11 are involved in cell migration. For this purpose, we first used MDCK cells stably expressing a Myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Rab11 (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells) or MDCK cells stably expressing a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11 (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells), and we estimated cell migration by use of the gold particle uptake assay. Wild-type MDCK cells and sMDCK-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells migrated to a similar extent, but sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells migrated significantly to a lesser extent (data not shown). Because MDCK cells stably expressing various mutants of rabphilin-11 were not available, we transiently overexpressed GFP-tagged full-length rabphilin-11, the GFP-tagged N-terminal fragment (GFP-rabphilin-11–1, aa 1–631), or the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (GFP-rabphilin-11–4, aa 607–730) in HeLa cells cultured on fibronectin, and we assayed their migration. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment, but not full-length rabphilin-11 or the N-terminal fragment, markedly reduced cell migration (Fig. 8). These results suggest that both Rab11 and rabphilin-11 are involved in cell migration. We have not examined here the overexpression of Rab11S25N in HeLa cells, because GFP-tagged Rab11S25N was not available, but the inhibitory effect of Rab11S25N on migration of MDCK cells is consistent with the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 on migration of HeLa cells. In this study, we have isolated and characterized a GTP-Rab11-binding protein and named it rabphilin-11. We have concluded that rabphilin-11 is a downstream target of Rab11 that has been implicated in vesicle recycling (8Urbé S. Huber L.A. Zerial M. Tooze S.A. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J.

We have shown here that Rab11 and rabphilin-11 are colocalized at perinuclear regions in HeLa cells and KB cells and that both the proteins regulate the accumulation of transferrin there without affecting its accumulation at small dots which are widely distributed in the cytoplasm. The precise localization sites of GTP-Rab11 and rabphilin-11 at perinuclear regions are not known, but they are likely the Golgi complex and recycling endosomes, and the small dots in the cytoplasm may be early endosomes. If these sites are correct, both the proteins may regulate at least vesicle recycling from early endosomes to recycling endosomes. Moreover, we have shown here that Rab11 and rabphilin-11 are colocalized along microtubules oriented toward lamellipodia. Microtubules are known to be implicated in transport from early endosomes to late endosomes and apical vesicle recycling, both of which are inhibited by nocodazole in polarized MDCK cells (33Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 34Maples C.J. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6741-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is not known whether Rab11 and rabphilin-11 are involved in apical vesicle recycling along microtubules, but the localization of Rab11 and rabphilin-11 along microtubules oriented toward lamellipodia has raised their possible involvement in apical vesicle recycling. Vesicle recycling of various transmembrane proteins, including adhesion molecules such as integrin, has been implicated in cell migration (37Felsenfeld D.P. Choquet D. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 39Bretscher M.S.

We have recently shown that dynamic rearrangement of focal adhesion and stress fibers are observed during migration of MDCK cells and that Rab GDI, a general regulator of all the Rab family members, and at least Rab5 are involved in this rearrangement, most presumably by regulating endocytosis and recycling of integrin (23Imamura H.

Consistently, we have shown here that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rab11 (Rab11S25N) and the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin-11 (aa 607–730), lacking the GTP-Rab11 binding domain, reduce migration of MDCK cells and HeLa cells, respectively. It remains to be clarified how these proteins reduce cell migration, but they may reduce cell migration by inhibiting the vesicle recycling from early endosomes to recycling endosomes. Of the downstream targets of the Rab family members thus far reported, Shirataki et al. (41Shirataki H. Yamamoto T. Hagi S. Miura H. Oishi H. Jin-no Y. Senbonmatsu T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that rabphilin-3, a target of Rab3, is associated with synaptic vesicles in a manner independent of GTP-Rab3A, although Stahl et al. (43Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown that it is associated with the vesicles in a manner dependent on GTP-Rab3A, whereas rabaptin-5, a target of Rab5, is associated with early endosomes in a manner dependent on GTP-Rab5 (15Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We have shown here that both GDP-Rab11 (a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11, Myc-Rab11S25N) and rabphilin-11 are found in the cytoplasm in MDCK cells stably expressing Myc-Rab11S25N (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11S25N cells), whereas both GTP-Rab11 (a Myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Rab11, Myc-Rab11Q70L) and rabphilin-11 are colocalized at perinuclear regions in MDCK cells stably expressing Myc-Rab11Q70L (sMDCK-Myc-Rab11Q70L cells). These results suggest that rabphilin-11 is translocated between the cytoplasm and the membranes of perinuclear regions coupled with the cycling of Rab11 between the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms. In conclusion, rabphilin-11 is a downstream target of Rab11 that regulates vesicle recycling. Further studies are necessary for our understanding of the modes of activation and action of Rab11 and rabphilin-11 in vesicle recycling."

The column was pre-equilibrated with 2 volumes of corresponding buffer between the runs. Free Ca2+ concentrations in the samples were adjusted prior to injection by adding EGTA or CaCl2, respectively. The molecular weight standards for gel filtration included blue dextran (2,000 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, Stokes radius: 45.5 Å), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, Stokes radius: 36.1 Å), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, Stokes radius: 20.1 Å) and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) (Sigma). The column was calibrated prior to the analysis and reproducibility of the calibration was tested between series of the experiments. It was virtually identical in the presence of either EGTA or CaCl2. Activation of retGC in washed outer segment membranes reconstituted with GCAPs was assayed under infrared illumination using [α-32P]GTP as a substrate and [3H]cGMP as an internal standard and analyzed using TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) essentially as described in full detail in our previous publications (9Dizhoor A.M.

The main chain conformation in GCAP-2 molecule is very similar to that of neurocalcin or recoverin (35Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B.

Consistently with the previous report by Vijay-Kumar and Kumar (37Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on crystal structure of neurocalcin, in the presence of Ca2+, neurocalcin elutes from the Superdex 200 column as a dimer (molecular mass ∼46 kDa, Fig. 1), while it becomes a monomer in the presence of EGTA (molecular mass ∼22 kDa, Fig. 1). However, Ca2+ has an opposite effect on the chromatographic behavior of GCAP-2. We have found that in the absence of Ca2+, GCAP-2 can dimerize, while the presence of Ca2+ strongly inhibits its dimerization (Fig.2).Figure 2GCAP-2 forms dimers in the absence of Ca2+. A, aliquots of 2 mg/ml myristoylated recombinant GCAP-2 (200 μl) were analyzed by high-resolution gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of either 300 μm CaCl2 (line a) or 0.4 mm EGTA (line b). In the presence of Ca2+ neurocalcin elutes in a volume that corresponds to its monomer (peak M), and in the absence of Ca2+it elutes as both as a monomer and a ∼60-kDa dimer (peak D). The molecular mass values for both peaks of GCAP-2 (○) in line b were calculated from the plot shown in the inset, where • indicates positions of the corresponding molecular mass standards. In B GCAP-2 peaks eluted from the column (marked with a thick horizontal bar in A, line b) were collected as 0.3-ml fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, at 300 μmfree Ca2+ GCAP-2 is fully Ca2+-bound and completely incapable of activating the cyclase (see also inset in Fig. 3). At the saturating free Ca2+ concentration myristoylated wild type GCAP-2 elutes from the column as a protein with a Stokes radius of ∼22 Å and apparent molecular mass of ∼31 kDa (Fig. 2), approximately 7 kDa larger than its actual molecular mass (23,808 Da) determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (30Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to the “31-kDa” monomer peak (marked “M” in Fig. 2), the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 elutes as a peak that corresponds to its dimer (molecular mass ∼57 ± 6 kDa, Stokes radius: ∼34 Å, marked “D” in Fig. 2). The GCAP-2 dimer is relatively stable, otherwise it would have completely dissociated during the chromatography (∼29 min). Dimerization of GCAP-2 in the presence of EGTA may also be one of the reasons why the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 exhibits a poor NMR spectrum (34Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the dimer is not irreversible even in the presence of EGTA, because when the peak of dimer is collected and subjected to the second round of chromatography, GCAP-2 elutes again as two peaks, a dimer and a monomer (data not shown). Also, the dimer collected in the absence of Ca2+ dissociates during the subsequent round of chromatography in the presence of Ca2+ (not shown). Conversely, the Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 monomer (as in Fig.2 A, line a) forms a dimer when rechromatographed in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2 A, line b). Dimerization and dissociation of the GCAP-2 complex is a function of Ca2+ concentrations and cannot be attributed to differences in ionic strength, because concentrations of CaCl2 and EGTA are insignificant compared with the total salt concentration in the elution buffer. It can neither be attributed to a nonspecific effect of divalent cations, because both elution buffers contain 10 mm MgCl2. Importantly, we can also rule out a possibility that either of the peaks shown in Fig. 2 A, line b, represents merely a misfolded inactive form of GCAP-2. When tested in retGC activation assay at low free Ca2+, the specific activity of GCAP-2 in each peak is similar (Fig. 2 B). This demonstrates that each peak contains active GCAP-2 capable of reversible dimerization such that at low Ca2+ concentrations the equilibrium between the dimer and the monomer is shifted toward the formation of the dimer, and at high free Ca2+ it shifts toward the dissociation of the complex into Ca2+-loaded monomers. The ability of the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 to dimerize gives rise to a possibility that GCAP-2 dimerization is directly involved in regulation of retGC. In order to verify this hypothesis, we compared several mutants of GCAP-2 that demonstrated distinct differences in their properties as retGC regulators. We have found that the ability of these mutants to activate retGC at low Ca2+ concentrations correlates with their dimerization (Figs. 3 and4). A constitutively active mutant of GCAP-2 (E80Q/E116Q/D158N, Ref. 31Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that stimulates retGC in both low and high free Ca2+ also forms the dimer regardless of the free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 A). The elution profiles of GCAP-2 (E80Q/E116Q/D158N) in the presence of 0.4 mm EGTA and in 300 μmCa2+ are almost identical. Myristoylation of GCAP-2 that is apparently nonessential for regulation of retGC (30Olshevskaya E.V. Hughes R.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is also nonessential for dimerization of GCAP-2, because a minor fraction of nonmyristoylated GCAP-2 commonly present in preparations of recombinant fatty acylated GCAP-2 (30Olshevskaya E.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) appears in peaks of GCAP-2 dimer as well as monomer (marked “−Myr” in Fig. 3 B). In our recent study we constructed several chimera mutants of GCAP-2 (22Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have found that either the substitution of a large N-terminal fragment of GCAP-2 (chimera mutant XIX, see Ref. 22Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar for details) or the substitution of a region proximal to EF-hand 4 (chimera mutant XIII, Ref. 22Olshevskaya E.V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the corresponding neurocalcin fragments interferes with activation of retGC. When tested for their ability to dimerize in the absence of Ca2+, neither of these chimeras exhibit a distinct dimer peak in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 4 B). In our experiments the elution time for GCAP-2 dimer is approximately 29 min; therefore, even if these mutants were capable of dimerization, their dimers completely dissociated during the chromatography. Thus, our results demonstrate that the ability of these GCAP-2 mutants to dimerize at low Ca2+ concentrations is either completely lost or at least dramatically reduced compared to the wild type GCAP-2. Importantly, these GCAP-2 mutants retain their ability to bind retGC in the presence of Ca2+, because they are both capable of inhibiting retGC at high free Ca2+ concentrations (22Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another GCAP-2 chimera protein whose central part was substituted with the corresponding neurocalcin fragment and that fails to activate retGC at low free Ca2+ concentrations (chimera III, Ref. 22Olshevskaya E.V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also fails to dimerize in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 4 A, line d). However, if we insert into this chimera the exiting helix of EF-2 together with the entering helix of EF-3 derived from GCAP-2 (mosaic chimera IV, Ref. 22Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A.

We propose that dimerization of GCAP-2 is what controls dimerization of retGC and thus contributes to the cyclase regulation by Ca2+ (Fig. 5). This model is based on the following observations: (i) catalytic domains of guanylyl cyclases are very similar to those of membrane adenylyl cyclase (38Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,39Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and peptide receptor membrane guanylyl cyclases also function as dimers (25Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, retGCs form homodimers in photoreceptors in vivo (28Yang R.-B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). (ii) Activation of retGC by GCAPs stimulates cyclase dimerization or at least closer contacts between the subunits in retGC dimers (29Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). (iii) GCAP-2 is known to bind to retGC both in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+ (31Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 41Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but only the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 activates retGC, while the Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 inhibits it. (iv) The ability of GCAP-2 and its mutants to activate retGC at low free Ca2+ concentrations correlates with its ability to dimerize, indicating that not only GCAP-retGC interaction, but also GCAP-GCAP interaction, is important for the regulation of the cyclase. Our general hypothesis is that retGC becomes activated because GCAP dimer acts as an adapter for dimerization of the cyclase. GCAP-2 can be always bound to the cyclase through interaction with its kinase homology and/or catalytic domains regardless of the free Ca2+ concentrations. However, when GCAP-2 is loaded with Ca2+ in the dark, it is unable to promote the formation of retGC dimers. Conformational changes in GCAP-2 caused by dissociation of Ca2+ result in strong GCAP-GCAP interaction such that a Ca2+-free GCAP-2 dimer brings the two subunits (or parts of the subunits) of retGC closer together and stabilizes the interaction between the catalytic domains in retGC subunits. Dimerization is reversed when the free Ca2+ concentrations increase in the dark. It cannot be excluded that cyclase subunits may also undergo reversible spontaneous dimerization in the absence of GCAPs in vitro, which may account for relatively high basal activity of retGC in washed photoreceptor membranes in the absence of GCAPs (8Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). If Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 monomers attached to the cyclase subunits interfere with spontaneous dimerization of retGC, it would explain why a fully Ca2+-loaded GCAP inhibits basal activity of retGC in vitro (31Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Dizhoor A.M. Boikov S.G. Olshevskaya E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether or not such “dimer adapter” mechanism is applicable to retGC activation by GCAP-1. Similarly to GCAP-2, GCAP-1 also forms dimers in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.4 C) and is apparently able to interact with similar peptide fragments derived from the cyclase sequence (42Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of retGC by GCAP-1 also results in tight dimerization of the cyclase or at least closer interaction between its subunits (29Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ability of GCAP-1 to dimerize alone would not be sufficient to account for the activation of the cyclase. There is an obvious difference between GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 at high Ca2+concentrations. The retention time for the Ca2+-free dimer of GCAP-1 is slightly different from that of the Ca2+-loaded dimer of GCAP-1, which suggests that Ca2+ affects conformation of the whole dimer, but apparently does not change the GCAP-1 dimer stability (Fig.4 C). Conformational changes in Ca2+-loaded versus Ca2+-free GCAP must play a critical role in the interaction between the GCAPs and the cyclase. However, only in case of GCAP-2 such changes also strongly affect stability of GCAP/GCAP dimer. That may account for the different specificity of GCAP-1 versus GCAP-2 relative to different isoforms of the cyclase (14Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Li N. Pettenati M. Rao N. Bronson D. Wechter R. Baehr W.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We outline in the model described in Fig. 5 the simplest hypothesis that a dimer of GCAP activates RetGC catalytic domains by causing dimerization of the cyclase. It may be a complete dissociation/association of the cyclase subunits that regulates its activity. However, there are also indications that membrane guanylyl cyclases in photoreceptors may always exist as homodimers (28Yang R.-B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and therefore it is possible that dimers of GCAPs can also affect the conformation of retGC dimers rather than the equilibrium between association and dissociation of the cyclase. Based on chemical cross-linking experiments (29Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), GCAP-activated retGC can either undergo association from two completely separate cyclase monomers or equally likely change the conformation of a pre-existing retGC dimer so that it results in a closer contacts between the two cyclase subunits. Conformational changes and dimerization of a Ca2+-free GCAP-2 (or just conformational changes in GCAP-1 dimer) may provide the necessary energy to cause either association of retGC subunits or the intramolecular rearrangements within the pre-existing “flexible” dimer of the cyclase. Also, GCAP dimer does not necessarily act as an immediate “bridge” between the two catalytic domains of the cyclase. Instead, it may cause conformational changes in other parts of the cyclase subunits, and these changes could be then transduced through the structure of cyclase subunits to their catalytic domains. The overall three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-bound monomer of GCAP-2 is similar to that of recoverin or neurocalcin (34Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B.

Neurocalcin dimers formation results from close interactions between EF-hands 2, 3, and 4 in its subunits. Hence, one could assume that the corresponding residues on the surface of GCAP-2 may also be involved in dimerization. However, there is an obvious difference between GCAP-2 and neurocalcin, since GCAP-2 forms relatively stable dimers only in the absence of Ca2+. Besides, the dimers of Ca2+-free GCAP-2 are less stable compared with Ca2+-loaded neurocalcin, because they partially dissociate during the time of chromatography (compare Figs. 1 and 2). Further study will have to determine what sites in GCAP-2 may play critical role in its dimerization and what sites are directly involved in interaction with the cyclase. It will also require additional study to determine how Ca2+ binding changes the kinetic parameters of the GCAP-2 dimerization. We thank Sergei Boikov for technical assistance."

To understand why, unlike other DNA and RNA polymerases, they catalyze 2′-5′ instead of 3′-5′ phosphodiester bond formation, we used molecular modeling to compare the structure of the catalytic domain of DNA polymerase β (pol β) to that of a region of the P69 isozyme of 2-5(A) synthetase. Although the primary sequence identity is low, like pol β, P69 can assume an αββαβββ structure in this region. Moreover, mutation of the three Asp residues of P69, which correspond to the three catalytic site Asp residues of pol β, inactivated the enzyme without affecting its substrate and activator binding capacity, providing further credence to the concept that this region is the catalytic domain of P69. This domain is highly conserved among all 2-5(A) synthetase isozymes. Biochemical and mutational studies demonstrated that dimerization of the P69 protein is required for its enzyme activity. However, a dimer containing a wild type subunit and an inactive catalytic domain mutant subunit was also active. The rate of catalysis of the heterodimer was half of that of the wild type homodimer, although the two proteins bound double-stranded RNA and ATP equally well. 2′-5′-Oligoadenylate (2-5(A)) synthetases are a family of interferon-induced enzymes that are activated by double-stranded RNA.

The rate of catalysis of the heterodimer was half of that of the wild type homodimer, although the two proteins bound double-stranded RNA and ATP equally well. 2′-5′-oligoadenylate double-stranded polyinosinic acid·polycytidylic acid wild type P1, P3-di(adenosine-5′) triphosphate polymerase β multiplicity of infection The 2′-5′-oligoadenylate (2-5(A))1 synthetases are a family of enzymes that share many properties. Their synthesis is induced upon interferon treatment of cells, and they participate in mediating the antiviral and anticellular effects of interferons (1Hovanessian A.G. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes are inactive, as such, and are activated by an essential co-factor, double-stranded (ds) RNA. The activated enzymes polymerize ATP to produce 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 3Williams B.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1978; 276: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The known isozymes of 2-5(A) synthetases are grouped into three size classes: small, medium, and large. Members of the small and the medium classes have been cloned, and their enzymatic properties have been characterized (4Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar). The most notable difference between them is in their product profiles; the medium 2-5(A) synthetase, P69 (6Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synthesizes 2-5(A) molecules containing up to 30 residues (7Marie I. Blanco J. Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the small synthetase, 9-2 (8Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synthesizes only up to hexamers of 2-5(A) (9Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another difference is in the multimeric composition of the proteins; 9-2 is a tetramer, whereas P69 is a dimer (12Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified the oligomerization domain of 9-2 and shown that oligomerization is required for its enzyme activity (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that monomeric P69 is also inactive.By sequence considerations, the 2-5(A) synthetases have been assigned membership in the Class I nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (14Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of this class include DNA polymerase β (pol β), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and poly(A) polymerase. Although the members of this superfamily catalyze the same reaction, namely, the coupling of a nucleoside triphosphate to a free hydroxyl group via elimination of a pyrophosphate, there is only a weak conservation of their amino acid sequences (16Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, an extremely well conserved structural motif present at their catalytic domains became apparent when the crystal structures of a number of polymerases were solved (17Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). This structural motif consists of four or five β strands packed against two α-helices. In all of them, the catalytic site is created by a triad of aspartates present at the tips of two conserved β strands. These residues coordinate the Mg2+ ions necessary for catalysis (18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Although in some cases the aspartates can be replaced by glutamates, in others any substitution causes inactivation of the enzyme (19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Le Grice S.F. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Unlike other members of the superfamily, the 2-5(A) synthetases catalyze the formation of 2′-5′, instead of 3′-5′, phosphodiester bonds. Like poly(A) polymerases and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases, they are also template-independent. But unlike the latter enzymes, 2-5(A) synthetases can use mononucleotides instead of DNA or RNA as primers or acceptors for the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. Moreover, unlike other polymerases, 2-5(A) synthetases require dsRNA as a co-factor. In view of the above differences, we investigated the nature of the catalytic domain of 2-5(A) synthetases. Molecular modeling suggested that the putative catalytic domain of the P69 isozyme may have a structure very similar to that of the pol β catalytic domain. Moreover, mutation of the three Asp residues that may constitute the putative catalytic site inactivated P69. However, such a mutant of P69 could bind ATP and dsRNA and, like the wild type (wt) protein, it was a dimer. We used this mutant to demonstrate that although a P69 monomer is inactive, a P69 dimer containing one active and another inactive subunit is enzymatically active.DISCUSSIONOur molecular modeling studies suggest a strong similarity in the structures of the catalytic domains of 2-5(A) synthetases and pol β. Unlike several other polymerases, in these enzymes, the two β strands containing the active site are parallel, not antiparallel (18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, the single Asp residue of the active site is carboxyl-terminal to the other two Asp residues in the primary structures of both proteins, and in both of them the other two Asp residues are separated by one residue, although in many other enzymes of this class they are adjacent (discussed in detail in Ref. 32Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Studies with pol β and other members of the nucleotidyl transference superfamily have revealed that the three carboxylates of the catalytic site coordinate two Mg2+ ions, which in turn coordinate the α-phosphate and the 3′-hydroxyl group. The activated hydroxyl group acts as the nucleophile in the phosphodiester bond formation causing an inversion of the stereochemistry at the α-phosphorous of the donor nucleotide (33Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether the same mechanism applies to 2-5(A) synthesis. Even if the general mechanism of catalysis is the same, it remains to be explained why the 2′-hydroxyl, but not the 3′-hydroxyl, of the acceptor molecule participates in the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes. The determination of a high resolution structure of the catalytic domain of P69 may reveal specific structural features that distinguish it from other polymerases and thus provide a structural basis for favoring the 2′-5′ bond formation.We have developed several new assays, as reported here, for monitoring the substrate binding and the catalytic activity of P69. In the conventional assay for 2-5(A) synthetase enzyme activity, ATP is used both as the initial acceptor and the universal donor for the 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond formation. For obvious experimental reasons, we wanted to use two different nucleotides as the donor and the acceptor so that they could be manipulated independently. ApppA was selected as the acceptor because its 5′-OH groups are blocked and it cannot serve as a donor. Conversely, 2′-dATP was a good donor of the phosphate group, but it could not accept the same because of the absence of a 2′-OH group. Thus, ApppA and 2′-deoxyATP were a good pair of substrates for the enzyme reaction. An added advantage was that the products were restricted to only two kinds of molecules with one or two AMP moieties attached to ApppA. Moreover, it seems that ApppA not only fails to serve as a donor but also does not compete with dATP to serve as a donor because from the concentration curve of ApppA (Fig. 9 C and data not shown), it appears that even at high concentrations of ApppA the reaction was not inhibited. In contrast, when a fixed amount of ApppA was used, excess dATP (more than 5 mm) inhibited the reaction (data not shown) indicating that dATP may have a low affinity for the acceptor site as well. However, at 5 mmand lower concentrations of ApppA and dATP, the two reagents did not interfere with each other's functions, although the rate of reaction was three times lower than that observed with ATP alone.For monitoring substrates binding to the P69 protein, we have developed a new assay using fluorescence quenching. Although an indirect assay, it is fast, convenient, and quantitative. This assay was used to determine the affinity constants of ATP for P69. The relatively weak affinity, with a dissociation constant of 5.6 mm, was predictable from the need of a high ATP concentration for the optimum enzyme activity (11Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The affinity of dATP, presumably for the donor site, was very similar to that of ATP (Fig. 5), but the affinity of ApppA for the acceptor site was slightly higher. It should be noted, however, that in coming to the above conclusions, we assumed that the binding of the substrates at the acceptor and the donor sites of the protein generates the same degree of fluorescence quenching. The fluorescence quenching assay, although convenient, is not amenable for studying competitive binding. For example, we could not use this assay to directly demonstrate that dATP does not interfere with the binding of ApppA and vice versa. Different assays using radioligands and differentially mutated proteins need to be developed for this purpose.The DADA mutant of P69 was found to be completely inactive enzymatically. It, however, dimerized and bound dsRNA and the substrates almost as efficiently as the wt protein. The D481A mutant was also practically inactive, but when Mg2+ was replaced by Mn2+ in the reaction mixture, it displayed a very low level of activity (data not shown). Similar observations have been documented for active site point mutants of other polymerases (23Menge K.L. Hostomsky Z. Nodes B.R. Hudson G.O. Rahmati S. Moomaw E.W. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15934-15942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Once we established that the dimerization of P69 is necessary for its enzyme activity, identification of the DADA mutant as an enzymatically inactive protein allowed us to investigate whether both subunits of P69 require functional catalytic domains. The key finding was that the wt/DADA heterodimer was enzymatically active. We were concerned that the observation could be misleading because of the wt subunit dissociating from the DADA subunit bound to the matrix and forming wt homodimer in solution. To rule out this possibility, the matrix-bound proteins were centrifuged down after the reaction, and the supernatant was tested for the presence of wt P69 by Western blotting and enzyme activity assays. Both assays showed that no P69 protein was present in the solution (data not shown). Given these experimental data and the fact that the wt protein cannot bind to the FLAG-antibody matrix, we concluded that the wt/DADA heterodimer was indeed active. Our results also clearly show that the P69 protein has only one functional catalytic site per subunit. Because the two halves of the protein have strong sequence homology, it has been suggested that each P69 molecule may be composed of two functional subunits (6Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of activity of the DADA and the D481A mutant, however, is not compatible with the presence of another catalytic site in the amino-terminal half. Moreover, the Asp triad is not conserved in the corresponding putative active center of the amino-terminal half (see Fig. 2). For pol β, mutational studies have shown that these Asp residues are absolutely required for activity and they cannot be replaced even by Glu residues. Thus, the experimental data strongly indicate that each P69 chain contains only one catalytic site. Similarly, the newly cloned large P100 isozyme appears to have three catalytic domains (35Rebouillat D. Hovnanian A. Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1557-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). But homology comparison revealed that only the domain closest to the carboxyl terminus contains the Asp triad (data not shown). Future mutational studies will determine the number of catalytic sites of the large isozyme in a definitive fashion.Characterization of the enzyme activity of the wt/DADA heterodimer using different substrates allowed us to conclude that it has half of the catalytic activity of the wt homodimer. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the wt protein contains two functional catalytic domains in the two subunits and both of these are simultaneously engaged in 2-5(A) synthesis. Moreover, the two catalytic domains can function independently of each other because the wt/DADA heterodimer is active. Then why is dimerization of P69 necessary for enzyme activity? Although the real reason remains to be determined, there are several possibilities. First, the dimerization process may bring about a conformational change in each subunit that is required for the catalytic domain to be functional. Second, the two subunits may participate in criss-cross reactions in which the substrates bound to one subunit are used by the catalytic domain of the other subunit for polymerization. The latter model, however, will not fit the paradigm of other polymerases such as pol β, which function as monomers and whose catalytic domains use substrates bound to the same protein subunit. Future studies using new P69 mutants defective in acceptor or donor binding sites for complementation of the catalytic domain mutant will be needed for critical testing of the second model. Information generated from such studies will also be useful to the understanding of the mechanism of catalysis by small synthetases, which are tetramers, and the large synthetases, which are monomers. We anticipate that a knowledge of these mechanisms will eventually enable us to explain why the small and large families of 2-5(A) synthetases generate shorter oligomers, primarily dimers, of 2-5(A), whereas the medium isozymes, such as P69, synthesize long chains of 2-5(A) quite efficiently (9Bandyopadhyay S.

Nature. 1977; 268: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes are inactive, as such, and are activated by an essential co-factor, double-stranded (ds) RNA. The activated enzymes polymerize ATP to produce 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The known isozymes of 2-5(A) synthetases are grouped into three size classes: small, medium, and large. Members of the small and the medium classes have been cloned, and their enzymatic properties have been characterized (4Hovanessian A.G. J.

Another difference is in the multimeric composition of the proteins; 9-2 is a tetramer, whereas P69 is a dimer (12Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol.

We have previously identified the oligomerization domain of 9-2 and shown that oligomerization is required for its enzyme activity (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that monomeric P69 is also inactive. By sequence considerations, the 2-5(A) synthetases have been assigned membership in the Class I nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (14Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of this class include DNA polymerase β (pol β), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and poly(A) polymerase. Although the members of this superfamily catalyze the same reaction, namely, the coupling of a nucleoside triphosphate to a free hydroxyl group via elimination of a pyrophosphate, there is only a weak conservation of their amino acid sequences (16Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, an extremely well conserved structural motif present at their catalytic domains became apparent when the crystal structures of a number of polymerases were solved (17Delarue M. Poch O.

Unlike other members of the superfamily, the 2-5(A) synthetases catalyze the formation of 2′-5′, instead of 3′-5′, phosphodiester bonds. Like poly(A) polymerases and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases, they are also template-independent. But unlike the latter enzymes, 2-5(A) synthetases can use mononucleotides instead of DNA or RNA as primers or acceptors for the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. Moreover, unlike other polymerases, 2-5(A) synthetases require dsRNA as a co-factor. In view of the above differences, we investigated the nature of the catalytic domain of 2-5(A) synthetases. Molecular modeling suggested that the putative catalytic domain of the P69 isozyme may have a structure very similar to that of the pol β catalytic domain. Moreover, mutation of the three Asp residues that may constitute the putative catalytic site inactivated P69. However, such a mutant of P69 could bind ATP and dsRNA and, like the wild type (wt) protein, it was a dimer. We used this mutant to demonstrate that although a P69 monomer is inactive, a P69 dimer containing one active and another inactive subunit is enzymatically active. DISCUSSIONOur molecular modeling studies suggest a strong similarity in the structures of the catalytic domains of 2-5(A) synthetases and pol β. Unlike several other polymerases, in these enzymes, the two β strands containing the active site are parallel, not antiparallel (18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev.

Studies with pol β and other members of the nucleotidyl transference superfamily have revealed that the three carboxylates of the catalytic site coordinate two Mg2+ ions, which in turn coordinate the α-phosphate and the 3′-hydroxyl group. The activated hydroxyl group acts as the nucleophile in the phosphodiester bond formation causing an inversion of the stereochemistry at the α-phosphorous of the donor nucleotide (33Joyce C.M.

The relatively weak affinity, with a dissociation constant of 5.6 mm, was predictable from the need of a high ATP concentration for the optimum enzyme activity (11Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The affinity of dATP, presumably for the donor site, was very similar to that of ATP (Fig. 5), but the affinity of ApppA for the acceptor site was slightly higher. It should be noted, however, that in coming to the above conclusions, we assumed that the binding of the substrates at the acceptor and the donor sites of the protein generates the same degree of fluorescence quenching. The fluorescence quenching assay, although convenient, is not amenable for studying competitive binding. For example, we could not use this assay to directly demonstrate that dATP does not interfere with the binding of ApppA and vice versa. Different assays using radioligands and differentially mutated proteins need to be developed for this purpose.The DADA mutant of P69 was found to be completely inactive enzymatically. It, however, dimerized and bound dsRNA and the substrates almost as efficiently as the wt protein. The D481A mutant was also practically inactive, but when Mg2+ was replaced by Mn2+ in the reaction mixture, it displayed a very low level of activity (data not shown). Similar observations have been documented for active site point mutants of other polymerases (23Menge K.L. Hostomsky Z. Nodes B.R. Hudson G.O. Rahmati S. Moomaw E.W. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15934-15942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Once we established that the dimerization of P69 is necessary for its enzyme activity, identification of the DADA mutant as an enzymatically inactive protein allowed us to investigate whether both subunits of P69 require functional catalytic domains. The key finding was that the wt/DADA heterodimer was enzymatically active. We were concerned that the observation could be misleading because of the wt subunit dissociating from the DADA subunit bound to the matrix and forming wt homodimer in solution. To rule out this possibility, the matrix-bound proteins were centrifuged down after the reaction, and the supernatant was tested for the presence of wt P69 by Western blotting and enzyme activity assays. Both assays showed that no P69 protein was present in the solution (data not shown). Given these experimental data and the fact that the wt protein cannot bind to the FLAG-antibody matrix, we concluded that the wt/DADA heterodimer was indeed active. Our results also clearly show that the P69 protein has only one functional catalytic site per subunit. Because the two halves of the protein have strong sequence homology, it has been suggested that each P69 molecule may be composed of two functional subunits (6Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of activity of the DADA and the D481A mutant, however, is not compatible with the presence of another catalytic site in the amino-terminal half. Moreover, the Asp triad is not conserved in the corresponding putative active center of the amino-terminal half (see Fig. 2). For pol β, mutational studies have shown that these Asp residues are absolutely required for activity and they cannot be replaced even by Glu residues. Thus, the experimental data strongly indicate that each P69 chain contains only one catalytic site. Similarly, the newly cloned large P100 isozyme appears to have three catalytic domains (35Rebouillat D. Hovnanian A. Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1557-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). But homology comparison revealed that only the domain closest to the carboxyl terminus contains the Asp triad (data not shown). Future mutational studies will determine the number of catalytic sites of the large isozyme in a definitive fashion.Characterization of the enzyme activity of the wt/DADA heterodimer using different substrates allowed us to conclude that it has half of the catalytic activity of the wt homodimer. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the wt protein contains two functional catalytic domains in the two subunits and both of these are simultaneously engaged in 2-5(A) synthesis. Moreover, the two catalytic domains can function independently of each other because the wt/DADA heterodimer is active. Then why is dimerization of P69 necessary for enzyme activity? Although the real reason remains to be determined, there are several possibilities. First, the dimerization process may bring about a conformational change in each subunit that is required for the catalytic domain to be functional. Second, the two subunits may participate in criss-cross reactions in which the substrates bound to one subunit are used by the catalytic domain of the other subunit for polymerization. The latter model, however, will not fit the paradigm of other polymerases such as pol β, which function as monomers and whose catalytic domains use substrates bound to the same protein subunit. Future studies using new P69 mutants defective in acceptor or donor binding sites for complementation of the catalytic domain mutant will be needed for critical testing of the second model. Information generated from such studies will also be useful to the understanding of the mechanism of catalysis by small synthetases, which are tetramers, and the large synthetases, which are monomers. We anticipate that a knowledge of these mechanisms will eventually enable us to explain why the small and large families of 2-5(A) synthetases generate shorter oligomers, primarily dimers, of 2-5(A), whereas the medium isozymes, such as P69, synthesize long chains of 2-5(A) quite efficiently (9Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our molecular modeling studies suggest a strong similarity in the structures of the catalytic domains of 2-5(A) synthetases and pol β. Unlike several other polymerases, in these enzymes, the two β strands containing the active site are parallel, not antiparallel (18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, the single Asp residue of the active site is carboxyl-terminal to the other two Asp residues in the primary structures of both proteins, and in both of them the other two Asp residues are separated by one residue, although in many other enzymes of this class they are adjacent (discussed in detail in Ref. 32Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Studies with pol β and other members of the nucleotidyl transference superfamily have revealed that the three carboxylates of the catalytic site coordinate two Mg2+ ions, which in turn coordinate the α-phosphate and the 3′-hydroxyl group. The activated hydroxyl group acts as the nucleophile in the phosphodiester bond formation causing an inversion of the stereochemistry at the α-phosphorous of the donor nucleotide (33Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether the same mechanism applies to 2-5(A) synthesis. Even if the general mechanism of catalysis is the same, it remains to be explained why the 2′-hydroxyl, but not the 3′-hydroxyl, of the acceptor molecule participates in the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes. The determination of a high resolution structure of the catalytic domain of P69 may reveal specific structural features that distinguish it from other polymerases and thus provide a structural basis for favoring the 2′-5′ bond formation. We have developed several new assays, as reported here, for monitoring the substrate binding and the catalytic activity of P69. In the conventional assay for 2-5(A) synthetase enzyme activity, ATP is used both as the initial acceptor and the universal donor for the 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond formation. For obvious experimental reasons, we wanted to use two different nucleotides as the donor and the acceptor so that they could be manipulated independently. ApppA was selected as the acceptor because its 5′-OH groups are blocked and it cannot serve as a donor. Conversely, 2′-dATP was a good donor of the phosphate group, but it could not accept the same because of the absence of a 2′-OH group. Thus, ApppA and 2′-deoxyATP were a good pair of substrates for the enzyme reaction. An added advantage was that the products were restricted to only two kinds of molecules with one or two AMP moieties attached to ApppA. Moreover, it seems that ApppA not only fails to serve as a donor but also does not compete with dATP to serve as a donor because from the concentration curve of ApppA (Fig. 9 C and data not shown), it appears that even at high concentrations of ApppA the reaction was not inhibited. In contrast, when a fixed amount of ApppA was used, excess dATP (more than 5 mm) inhibited the reaction (data not shown) indicating that dATP may have a low affinity for the acceptor site as well. However, at 5 mmand lower concentrations of ApppA and dATP, the two reagents did not interfere with each other's functions, although the rate of reaction was three times lower than that observed with ATP alone. For monitoring substrates binding to the P69 protein, we have developed a new assay using fluorescence quenching. Although an indirect assay, it is fast, convenient, and quantitative.

https://openalex.org/W1995746773,"The occurrence of apoptosis in thyroid follicular cells induced by Fas activation has been a subject of much debate. This is due, in part, to the fact that no physiologically relevant treatment conditions have been reported to cause rapid and extensive Fas-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cells, whereas treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prior to Fas activation allows for massive cell death. This indicates that the Fas signaling pathway is present but that its function is blocked in the overwhelming majority of cultured thyroid cells. To reconcile the conflicting reports, we set out to identify physiologically relevant conditions in which rapid, massive thyroid cell apoptosis in response to Fas activation could be demonstrated. We determined that susceptibility to Fas-activated apoptosis could be influenced by certain combinations of inflammatory cytokines. Although no single cytokine was effective, pretreatment of thyroid cells with the combination of γ-interferon and either tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin 1β allowed for massive Fas-mediated apoptosis. Susceptibility to Fas-induced death correlated with an increase in expression of a tunicamycin-inhibitable high molecular weight form of Fas but not with aggregate expression of Fas.

The processes involved in apoptosis are tightly regulated, and alterations in their function may result in disorders, including autoimmune disease and cancer (3Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp.

Morphological changes indicative of apoptosis have been observed in normal thyroid glands and appear at increased frequency in thyroid tissue affected with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (6Kotani T.

Apoptosis is one mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes can destroy thyrocytes in thyroiditis, which in turn may lead to hypothyroidism (6Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H.

It is important to define the signaling components of apoptosis present in thyroid follicular cells because they may provide insights into potential pathogenic mechanisms and lead to development of pharmacological interventions for treatment of thyroid disease.A potentially important pathway in signaling apoptosis in the thyroid involves the Fas death-inducing receptor. Fas is a type I membrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (9Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar,10Itoh N.

It is found constitutively expressed on lymphocytes and has been detected on many cells of nonhematopoeitic origin (9Nagata S. Golstein P.

It is therefore possible that this system plays a role in the pathogenesis of thyroiditis, because cytotoxic T lymphocytes are abundantly present in the thyroid in areas where apoptosis is observed (6Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H. Ohtaki S. Autoimmunity. 1995; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Three reports have presented different conclusions as to the expression and regulation of Fas and the induction of apoptosis in thyroid cells. Kawakami et al. (21Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Matsuoka N. Tsuboi M. Kawabe Y. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that Fas is constitutively expressed on thyroid cells but suggested that it does not function to induce apoptosis unless the cells are exposed to IFNγ or IL-1β. In addition, they reported that TSH regulates the expression of Fas and Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, Giordano et al. (22Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) suggested that Fas was not constitutively expressed on thyroid cells but that its expression was induced by IL-1β in thyroiditis-derived cell cultures leading to autologous apoptosis by thyrocyte expressed FasL. However, these investigators did not use a cell death assay specific for apoptosis (rather than necrosis). In addition, the acute and massive apoptosis that would be expected from autologous Fas activation, as suggested by the Giordano hypothesis, is not observed in thyroiditis. The reliability of reagents used in this report also have been questioned (23Stokes T.A. Rymaszewski M. Arscott P.L. Wang S.H. Bretz J.D. Bartron J.L. Baker Jr., J.R.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 4159-4160PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that Fas was constitutively expressed and only minimally regulated by either IFNγ or IL-1β (26Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and showed, in direct contrast to the results of Giordano et al. (22Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), that thyroid cells are resistant to Fas-mediated cell death regardless of treatment with either IFNγ or IL-1β, except in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (26Arscott P.L.

This confirmed the functionality of the Fas cell death pathway in thyroid cells but suggested the presence of a labile inhibitor. In addition, we showed no TSH regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis.To resolve the contradictions between these studies, we examined Fas-mediated cell death in thyroid cells by several different methods and under various treatment conditions. We found that the combination of IFNγ with either TNFα or IL-1β provides signals that facilitate rapid and extensive Fas-mediated thyroid cell apoptosis. The inflammatory cytokine-induced susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis correlated with expression of a tunicamycin-inhibitable high molecular weight form of Fas. We will discuss possible mechanisms of Fas-induced cell death signaling in thyroid cells and the potential role of Fas in thyroid disease.DISCUSSIONApoptosis clearly plays an important role in autoimmune chronic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, a disorder that often results in hypothyroidism. The inability of researchers to more precisely define the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis suggests a great complexity to this disease. The contradictory reports of Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cells re-enforces this complexity. In this paper, we report data that may suggest an explanation for some of these inconsistencies. We set out to determine physiologically relevant conditions in which rapid and extensive Fas-mediated apoptosis could occur. The combination of IFNγ with either TNFα or IL-1β provided susceptibility to nearly complete and total apoptotic cell death through Fas activation. This massive apoptosis occurs within 7 h of activation. Greater than 78% of thyroid cells are either apoptotic or dead as measured by flow cytometry. This is consistent with Fas-mediated cell death signaling in other systems (10Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S.

Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), who required 72 h to reach comparative levels of thyroid cell death after pretreatment with IL-1β, and Kawakami et al. (21Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Matsuoka N. Tsuboi M. Kawabe Y. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Kawakami A. Eguchi K.

In addition, all of our experiments were performed in the presence of TSH, suggesting that this growth factor may not protect against Fas-mediated cell death. In our system, combinations of inflammatory cytokines other than IFNγ with either TNFα or IL-1β provide much less significant susceptibility. The need for this synergistic effect to induce apoptosis suggests an explanation for the contrasting reports of IL-1β induction of Fas susceptibility. It is possible that cultures of thyroiditis-derived cells contained contaminating, activated, IFNγ-producing T lymphocytes known to be present in the intact thyroid (32Roura-Mir C. Catalfamo M. Sospedra M. Alcalde L. Pujol-Borrell R. Jaraquemada D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3290-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, when IL-1β was added to the cultures, the cells would become susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis because of the provision of the two signals required for this to happen. Other inflammatory cytokines may also be present to varying degrees depending on the presence of contaminating lymphocytes (IFNγ and TNFα) or macrophages (TNFα and IL-1β) that produce these cytokines. Therefore we took great care to remove all nonadherent cells from our cultures by repeated washings. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect rearranged T-cell receptor genes confirmed the absence of those cells when this method is used. Despite this care, we encountered considerable variability in IFNγ-induced susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis. This could be due to prior in vivo exposure to or the variable presence of contaminating cells producing either TNFα and/or IL-1β.It is apparent from our data that both TNFα and IL-1β provide signals that synergize with IFNγ for inducing Fas-mediated death susceptibility, and it is possible that they may provide the same signal. Activation of their respective receptors generate overlapping signals including the secondary messengers ceramide and nitrous oxide and the transcription activator NFκB (33Schutze S. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 35Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar, 36Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Ceramide alone kills thyroid cells, whereas fumonisin, an inhibitor of an enzyme in the ceramide pathway, does not affect Fas-mediated death.2 This suggests that this pathway is not involved with providing susceptibility to Fas-mediated cell death. The specific intracellular pathways involved in this process remain to be determined. One clue, as we have discerned, is that TNF-R1 activation can generate one of the two required signals.One important question that remains to be satisfactorily answered regarding Fas-mediated death in the thyroid is whether FasL is expressed and whether it can induce thyroid cell suicide in cells expressing Fas. Our data suggest that it is unlikely that significant amounts of FasL are expressed by thyroid cells because this would cause massive death by suicide/fratricide in our experiments, without the addition of Fas-activating Ab. The change in cell viability by treatment with IFNγ combined with TNFα or IL-1β, without Fas activation (as measured by MTT assay) is clearly not apoptosis in the flow cytometry assays. If FasL was constitutively expressed or induced by inflammatory cytokines, as suggested by some researchers (37Stassi G. Todaro M. Bucchieri F. Stoppacciaro A. Farina F. Zummo G. Testi R. Maria R.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 263-267PubMed Google Scholar), then we would expect massive thyroid cell death after IFNγ/TNFα treatment. Treatment of cells with a Fas antagonist Ab (clone ZB4) did not inhibit the loss of viability induced by IFNγ combined with TNFα or IL-1β treatment,2 confirming a lack of Fas activation. Inconsistent reports of Fas-induced apoptosis in thyroid cells may be due to two other factors. Some of the apoptosis activating Fas antibodies, clone DX2 an IgG isotype for example, do not induce apoptosis in thyroid cells.2 In our hands only clone CH11, an IgM antibody, sufficiently cross-links to activate Fas signaling. Also, differences in interpretation of results because of detection of cell death by different methods may overestimate or underestimate the effect of different agents.The question remains as to why an inflamed thyroid is not destroyed upon being infiltrated by activated FasL-expressing immune cells. There are situations in which the thyroid is infiltrated by immune cells but is not destroyed (Graves' disease and post-partum thyroiditis). One answer might be that the cellular immune response differs in that IFNγ- and TNFα-producing helper 1 subset of T lymphocytes are predominant in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, whereas helper 2 subset T lymphocytes (IL-4-producing) are predominant in Graves' disease. Another possibility is that the thyroid cells are capable of fighting off infiltrating cells via induced expression of death ligands, such as TRAIL, which we have shown to be functionally expressed by thyroid cells (38Bretz J.D. Rymaszewski M. Arscott P.L. Myc A. Ain K.B. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23627-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TRAIL is capable of killing activated T lymphocytes (39Katsikis P.D. Garcia-Ojeda M.E. Torres-Roca J.F. Tijoe I.M. Smith C.A. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,40Jeremias I. Herr I. Boehler T. Debatin K.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and therefore could protect the thyroid cells.We have shown by three methods that Fas expression in thyroid cells is regulated by inflammatory cytokines. The conditions of greatest susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis show the greatest increase in Fas. However, the expression levels are not substantially greater than other conditions that show little or no Fas-mediated death. It is unlikely that either the 1.5-fold increase measured by Western analysis, the 1.5-fold increase measured by RNase protection assay, or the 2.2-fold increase measured by flow cytometry can account for the vast differences in Fas-mediated apoptosis when compared with the respective 1.2-, 1.3-, and 1.5-fold increases in Fas observed with conditions that were not associated with increased susceptibility. In contrast, susceptibility does correlate with induction of high molecular weight forms of Fas, which is due to increased glycosylation. This suggests that glycosylation may play an important role in signaling. This is of interest because, although Fas is known to be glycosylated (41Lendeckel U. Wex T. Ittenson A. Arndt M. Frank K. Mayboroda O. Schubert W. Ansorge S. Immunobiology. 1997; 197: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), there are no reports of Fas glycosylation being an important regulatory process. It is possible that glycosylation affects transport and cell surface expression of Fas. Our data indicate that inhibition of Fas glycosylation can reduce Fas-mediated cell death. Another possibility is that the critical event in Fas-mediated apoptosis is not Fas expression but the regulation of a Fas pathway inhibitor. Our previous report (26Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showing cycloheximide-induced susceptibility suggests the presence of a labile inhibitor that may be eliminated or inactivated by the combination of IFNγ with TNFα or IL-1β. A known inhibitor of the Fas pathway is I-FLICE (42Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We found no evidence of regulation of this inhibitor by cycloheximide or any combination of cytokines in thyroid cells.2 These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Both points of regulation (glycosylation and labile inhibitor) may influence Fas signaling. Supporting this idea are two points: 1) tunicamycin only partially inhibits Fas-mediated cell death despite the almost total ablation of the glycosylated form of Fas and 2) cycloheximide-inducible Fas-mediated cell death occurs in the absence of Fas glycosylation.2 Our data will provide important guidance in the search for the inhibitor(s) of this pathway. Apoptosis is an important mechanism in mammalian development, homeostasis, and immune response (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). The processes involved in apoptosis are tightly regulated, and alterations in their function may result in disorders, including autoimmune disease and cancer (3Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 4Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Apoptosis may play an important role in thyroid homeostasis and disease. Morphological changes indicative of apoptosis have been observed in normal thyroid glands and appear at increased frequency in thyroid tissue affected with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (6Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H. Ohtaki S. Autoimmunity. 1995; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Tamura M. Kimura H. Koji T. Tominaga T. Ashizawa K. Kiriyama T.

Endocr. J. 1995; 42: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is one mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes can destroy thyrocytes in thyroiditis, which in turn may lead to hypothyroidism (6Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H. Ohtaki S. Autoimmunity. 1995; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,8Tanimoto C. Hirakawa S. Kawasaki H. Hayakawa N. Ota Z. Endocr. J. 1995; 42: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, the suppression of apoptosis may contribute to thyroid proliferative diseases including goiter, cancer, and Graves' disease (7Tamura M. Kimura H. Koji T. Tominaga T. Ashizawa K. Kiriyama T. Yokoyama N. Yoshimura T. Eguchi K. Nakane P.K. Nagataki S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3646-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Tanimoto C. Hirakawa S. Kawasaki H. Hayakawa N. Ota Z. Endocr. J. 1995; 42: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms and regulation of apoptotic signaling in thyroid cells. It is important to define the signaling components of apoptosis present in thyroid follicular cells because they may provide insights into potential pathogenic mechanisms and lead to development of pharmacological interventions for treatment of thyroid disease. A potentially important pathway in signaling apoptosis in the thyroid involves the Fas death-inducing receptor. Fas is a type I membrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (9Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar,10Itoh N.

It is found constitutively expressed on lymphocytes and has been detected on many cells of nonhematopoeitic origin (9Nagata S. Golstein P.

Med. 1998; 37: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Regulation or modulation of this pathway can occur at multiple levels throughout the pathway. This may include changes in the level of the expression of Fas or its ligand (9Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 11Owen-Schaub L.B.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Fas pathway is a major mechanism of T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (9Nagata S. Golstein P.

It is therefore possible that this system plays a role in the pathogenesis of thyroiditis, because cytotoxic T lymphocytes are abundantly present in the thyroid in areas where apoptosis is observed (6Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H. Ohtaki S. Autoimmunity. 1995; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

They generated functional receptors displaying conductance and response to both GABA and picrotoxinin similar to the wild type α1β1γ2 receptor. Three chemically reactive affinity probes derived from non-competitive blockers were synthesized to react with the engineered cysteines: 1) dithiane bis-sulfone derivative modified by an isothiocyanate function (probe A); 2) fiprole derivatives modified by an α-chloroketone (probe B) and α-bromoketone (probe C) moiety. These probes blocked the GABA-induced currents on all receptors. This blockade could be fully reversed by a washing procedure on the wild type, the α1T261Cβ1γ2 and α1L264Cβ1γ2 mutant receptors. In contrast, an irreversible effect was observed for all three probes on both α1V257Cβ1γ2 and α1S272Cβ1γ2 mutant receptors. This effect was probe concentration-dependent and could be abolished by picrotoxinin and/or t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate.

The existence of 6α, 4β, 4γ, 1δ, and 2ρ subunits in addition to splicing variants, suggests a large diversity in the constitution of heteropentameric isoforms allowing a subtle tuning of the action of this neurotransmitter (6Barnard E.A.

Of particular interest are the action of non-competitive antagonists which are presumed to interact within the GABA receptor chloride channel leading to powerful insecticidal properties when presenting a selectivity for insect GABA receptor (13Gant D.B.

To investigate, at a molecular level, the interaction of non-competitive GABA antagonists with the chloride channel associated to the GABAA receptor, we defined an approach which uses chemically reactive non-competitive blockers (NCBs) as chemical sensors for cysteine mutants on the rat α1 GABA receptor subunit. This strategy was derived from the extensive work of Akabas and co-workers on several ionic channels including the chloride channel associated to the GABAA receptor (17Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) which identified the receptor channel-lining residues using a cysteine accessibility method (18Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selected channel-lining cysteine mutants from the α1 rat subunit, at positions 257, 261, 264, and 272, respectively, when co-expressed with β1 and γ2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes, were probed for their ability to react covalently with several chemically modified NCBs derived from dithiane bis-sulfones (19Elliott M. Pulman D.A. Larkin J.P. Casida J.E. Agric. Food. Chem. 1992; 40: 147-151Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Kapfer I. Jacques P. Toubal H. Goeldner M.P.

Pesticides and the Future. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 147-156Google Scholar). The reactive chemical functions were either aromatic isothiocyanates or α-chloro- and α-bromoketone fiproles. The formation of a selective covalent bond between the cysteine mutant and the reactive NCB, protectable by reference NCBs such as PTX or TBPS, allows positioning in a spatial proximity of the cysteine residue with the reactive group of the NCB and most importantly, has made it possible to discriminate effects due to an allosteric interaction induced by the mutation. In this study we present evidence that the synthesized reactive NCB probes had a fully reversible effect on the wild type receptor as well as on the α1T261Cβ2γ2 and the α1L264Cβ2γ2 mutant receptors. In contrast, a selective irreversible effect could be demonstrated for the α1V257Cβ2γ2 and α1S272C β2γ2 mutant receptors. Although, the interaction of NCBs such as PTX at position 257 of the M2 helix was already postulated (22Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a specific interaction at position 272 of the helix, close to the entrance of the channel, was not described and if it occurs, would allow new insight on the interaction of NCBs within this ionic channel. In addition, the formation of the covalent bonds, especially at position 257, suggests a positioning of the reactive ligands, in an oriented manner within the channel. The dithiane bis-sulfone isothiocyanate A was synthesized starting from the previously described aromatic difluoroazido derivative (20Kapfer I. Jacques P. Toubal H. Goeldner M.P. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by catalytic hydrogenation followed by treatment of the amino group by thiophosgene in acetone to the desired aromatic difluoroisothiocyanate with a global yield of 27% for these two steps. Probes B and C were a gift from Rhône-Poulenc Ag Co. (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). The cDNA encoding rat α1, α1V257C, α1T261C, α1L264C, α1S272C, β1, and γ2 in pBluescript SK(−) plasmids were obtained from Prof. M. H. Akabas (Columbia University, New York). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) to construct the α1V257S cDNA using the following primers: 5′-CCAGCAAGAACTTCCTTTGGAGTGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCACTCCAAAGGAAGTTCTTGCTGG-3′ in the polymerase chain reaction with the α1 subunit cDNA inserted in a pBluescript SK(−) plasmid (Stratagene) as a template. The underlined position indicates the position of the Val to Ser mutation. After purification of the DNA fragments, the mutation was checked by DNA sequencing. For in vitro mRNA transcription, the plasmids containing the α1 and β1 subunits were linearized with Hin dIII and the γ2 subunit was linearized with Not I. mRNA was transcribed in vitro by T3 (β1) or T7 (α1 an γ2) polymerase using the Ambion (Austin, TX) mMessage mMachine kit. Stage V and VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested and defolliculated as described (24Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). One day after the oocytes were harvested, they were injected with 20 ng of total mRNA (mixed in the subunit α1β1γ2 ratio 1:1:1) dissolved in 50 nl of nuclease-free water. After injection, the oocytes were incubated 3–6 days at 18 °C in OR-3 (1:2 dilution of L-15 Leibovitz media, 1 mm glutamine, gentamycin (100 μg·ml−1), 15 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.6 with NaOH) before recordings. GABA-induced currents were recorded from individual oocytes under two-electrode voltage clamp at a holding potential of −80 mV. Microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had a resistance of 0.5–3 megohm. The ground electrode was connected to the chamber via a 3 m KCl/agar bridge. Data were acquired with an Oocyte clamp OC-725C (Warner Instruments) using a MacLab Digital Interface Module and Chart software (AD Instruments). The oocytes were held in a 0.3-ml chamber and continuously superfused (2 ml·min−1) with Ca2+-free frog Ringer's solution (CFFR) (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) at room temperature via a rapid superfusion system allowing quick exchange of the various solutions. All drugs were applied via the superfusate. GABA, TBPS, and PTX were purchased from Sigma. Probes A, B, C, and PTX were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted into test concentration, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide being kept below 0.1%. The GABA concentration that induced 50% of the maximal current (EC50) was determined by sequential application of the following concentrations: 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μm. The concentration that inhibited 50% of the current induced by 100 μm GABA (IC50) was determined by sequential co-application of GABA and six concentrations of PTX: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μm, respectively. The current was measured after a 20-s co-application of GABA and PTX. EC50 and IC50 were calculated from data obtained on six individual oocytes. We tested the susceptibility of wild type (WT) and mutant GABAA receptors to a 1-min application of probes A, B, or C. To determine the reversible inhibition induced by probes A, B, and C, the following sequence of perfusion was used: 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm A, 10 μm B, or 10 μm C, 1 min; A, B, or C + 100 μmGABA 10 s. The reversible inhibition was taken as [1 − (IGABA+Probe, after/IGABA, before)]. The following sequence of perfusion adapted from a previously described procedure (17Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used to determine an irreversible effect: 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min; 100 μm A, 10 μm B, or 10 μm C, 1 min; CFFR 3 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 6 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 5 min; 100 μm GABA 10 s. To test the ability of NCBs to protect the engineered cysteines from modification by the probes, we used the following sequence of perfusion solutions: 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm PTX or 10 μm TBPS 1 min, 100 μm A, 10 μm B, or 10 μm C + 100 μm PTX or 10 μm TBPS 1 min, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm GABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μmGABA 10 s, CFFR 3 min, 100 μm GABA 10 s. The average of the two peak currents before probe application was used as the control response. The fractional effect at the different times after application was taken as [1 − (IGABA, after/IGABA, before)]. The irreversible effect was calculated by comparing the average of the two peak currents 3 and 9 min after probe application. Similar results were obtained on 3–6 single oocytes for each probe and each receptor. GABA-induced currents were recorded on wild type (α1β1γ2) and mutant recombinant receptors (α1V257Cβ1γ2, α1T261Cβ1γ2, α1L264Cβ1γ2, α1S272Cβ1γ2, and α1V257 Sβ1γ2) (Fig. 1), expressed in oocytes. The selected cysteine mutants showed currents very similar to the WT, in accordance with the described results with even slightly less pronounced differences (17Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), while the serine mutant at position 257 showed a 2-fold increase in the GABA-induced currents (TableI).Table IPharmacological evaluation of the expressed recombinant receptorsRecombinant receptorCurrentGABA EC50PTX IC50nAμmWT873 ± 1717 ± 31.0 ± 0.3α1V257Cβ1γ2892 ± 8811 ± 21.6 ± 0.5α1T261Cβ1γ2640 ± 3633 ± 91.4 ± 0.3α1L264Cβ1γ2728 ± 12518 ± 53.0 ± 1.8α1S272Cβ1γ2867 ± 5624 ± 81.0 ± 0.4α1V257Sβ1γ22021 ± 2902 ± 11.7 ± 0.3X. laevis oocytes were injected with WT (α1β1γ2) or α1 mutant receptors.

The sensitivity to the GABA response and the effect of the reference NCB PTX were tested for the different recombinant receptors. The observed EC50 and IC50 values (Table I) further indicated that the binding properties for GABA and PTX were only slightly affected by the various cysteine mutations, while the α1V257S mutant showed an increased affinity for the GABA molecule (EC50 2 μm versus 17 μm for the WT), in agreement with the previously observed GABA-induced current increase. The affinities of the reactive probes A, B, and C (Fig. 1) for the NCB-binding site were estimated by a displacement of [3H]1-(4′-Ethynylphenyl)-4-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicylo[2,2,2] octane (EBOB) on rat brain and housefly membranes. The obtained IC50 values (not shown), indicate affinities in the submicromolar range for the vertebrate receptor. A marked difference was noticeable on the rat brain membranes for the 4-acyl-pyrazole side chain substituent in the fiprole series, i.e. IC50 values for B and C were 0.2 and 1 μm, respectively. The effect of the three probes on recombinant α1β1γ2 WT receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes was analyzed by recording the GABA-induced chloride currents after applying excess of the probes (100 μm probe A and 10 μm fiprole derivatives B and C) (TableII). Eighty to 90% inhibition of the GABA-induced currents were obtained for these probes and this effect could be fully reversed by successive washings of the oocytes.Table IIReversible and irreversible inhibition of GABA induced currents by the affinity probes on WT and mutant GABAA receptorsRecombinant receptor% Reversible (% irreversible inhibition)A, 100 μmB, 10 μmC, 10 μmWT81 ± 1 (0)90 ± 1 (0)82 ± 2 (0)α1V257Cβ1γ280 ± 2 (69 ± 2)88 ± 3 (30 ± 2)82 ± 2 (59 ± 2)α1T261Cβ1γ283 ± 2 (0)85 ± 2 (0)83 ± 1 (0)α1L264Cβ1γ282 ± 1 (0)87 ± 2 (0)85 ± 3 (0)α1S272Cβ1γ284 ± 3 (40 ± 5)88 ± 2 (20 ± 1)85 ± 1 (40 ± 2)α1V257Sβ1γ2ND2-aND; not determined.ND79 ± 3 (0)The percent inhibition, represented % reversible (% irreversible), induced by probes A, B, or C were determined from X. laevis injected oocytes according to the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data indicate the mean ± S.E. of three to five individual oocytes.2-a ND; not determined.

Fig. 2shows the comparative effect of probe A on the WT receptor and the α1V257Cβ1γ2 mutant receptor, leading to a reversible effect of GABA-induced currents on the WT (Fig. 2 A) and an irreversible effect on the mutant receptor, with only partial recovery of the initial GABA-induced currents after successive washings (Fig.2 B). Fig. 3 A shows the time dependence of the washing procedure on the WT and the α1V257Cβ1γ2 mutant receptor after inhibition by probe A as well as the probe concentration dependence on the extent of the irreversible effect, varying from 18, 45, and 69% irreversible inhibition for 10, 30, and 100 μm probe concentration, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Finally, the irreversible effect could be prevented in the presence of PTX in a concentration-dependent manner, i.e. a full protection was observed in the presence of 100 μm PTX for a 69% inhibition induced by a 100 μm probe concentration (Fig. 2 C). We checked that the observed effect was independent of the presence of GABA. The reversible inhibition on the WT receptor and the irreversible inhibition on the α1V257Cβ1γ2 mutant receptor were similar when probe A was co-applied with 100 μm GABA for 1 min (not shown). This series of experiments indicates the occurrence of a specific covalent reaction between the cysteine residue incorporated at position 257 of the α subunit of the mutant receptor and the isothiocyanate moiety of the dithiane bis-sulfone probe A.Figure 3Effect of probe A on the α1V257C receptor. A, comparison of the inhibition of 100 μm GABA induced currents on the WT (open box) versus α1V257C (solid box) receptors. An irreversible inhibition is observed on the mutant receptor, while on the WT receptor, the inhibition is negligible after the 25-min washing procedure.

These probes blocked efficiently (between 80 and 90%) the GABA-induced currents on all recombinant receptors. While the effect, for the three probes was shown to be fully reversible for the WT, the two cysteine mutants at positions 261 and 264 as well as the serine 257 mutant receptors (Table II), the effect could be demonstrated to be partially irreversible for the two mutant cysteine receptors at positions 257 and 272. The irreversible effect was more pronounced at position 257 for the three probes, at a given probe concentration, and consistent with its greater reactivity, the bromoketone derivative C led to a more efficient irreversible reaction when compared with the chloro derivative B. The irreversible effects were proven to be concentration dependent (not shown) and finally, they were shown to be partially protectable by either PTX or TBPS at both positions 257 and 272. The extent of the protection was, however, depending on the test probe, on the mutant position, and also on the protector examined. While a full protection was observed at position 257 with PTX on probe A-induced inactivation (Fig. 2 C), a less efficient protection was established at position 257 over the 272 position for probe C (or B) induced inactivation, i.e. the 100% protection (not shown) observed with 100 μm PTX or 10 μm TBPS induced by 10 μm probe C at position 272 (Table II) was reduced to 60% protection by TBPS or 20% protection by PTX at position 257 (not shown). The GABAA receptors have been proposed to be a protein complex composed of (hetero)pentameric transmembrane subunits assembly comprising a central cavity defining an ionic channel (3Smith G.B.

A series of neurotoxic insecticides, including the toxin PTX, or synthetic compounds such as polychlorocycloalkanes and fipronil, inhibit GABA-induced currents by binding to the NCB site(s) of the GABAA receptor complex of vertebrates and invertebrates with variable efficacy (14Deng Y. Palmer C.J. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 41: 60-65Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Cole L.M. Nicholson R.A. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem.

By analogy to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the M2 membrane-spanning segment of the different GABA receptor subunits have been suggested to line the channel pore (27Giraudat J. Dennis M. Heidmann T. Haumont P.Y. Lederer F. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and numerous site-directed mutagenesis experiments achieved within this segment of vertebrate or invertebrate receptors have demonstrated an affect on the binding of the NCBs. A typical example being the natural point mutation A302S in the Drosophila melanogaster GABA receptor (RDL subunit) conferring high levels of resistance to PTX and dieldrin (28ffrench-Constant R.H. Rocheleau T.A. Steichen J.C. Chalmers A.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), this residue being homologous to the rat α1Val257. Using the cysteine accessibility approach, Akabas and co-workers (22Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) studied the action of PTX on the protection of the chemical modification by cysteine-specific permeants (cationic and anionic) at positions 257 and 261 of the rat α1 subunit in α1β1γ2 recombinant receptors. They showed a protective effect induced by PTX only at the more cytoplasmic position 257 and this effect was complete, only in an open GABA channel configuration. This action was proposed to result from a direct interaction of PTX in the GABA channel at the level of residue 257, this interaction becoming more effective in an open channel receptor conformation, rather than an allosteric effect induced by PTX binding outside the channel. A series of mutants near the center of the presumed M2 membrane spanning segment were studied to analyze the effect on the binding of NCBs and the conductance properties. Recombinant rat α1β2γ2 receptors containing double mutations at homologous positions at α1, β2, or γ2 subunits: α1(T261F/T267A), β2(T246F/T252A), or γ2(T271F/T277A) were shown to become insensitive to PTX (29Gurley D. Amin J. Ross P. Weiss D.S. White G. Receptors and Channels. 1995; 3: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar) and even the single mutant β2(T246F) could induce this insensitivity to PTX. Among the possible explanations, the authors have forwarded a sterical blockade resulting from the Phe side chain and preventing the access of PTX to its binding site. By analogy to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (30Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J-L. Devillers Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Labarca C. Nowak M.W. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the mutation of the conserved leucine residue at the center of the presumed M2 helix of the human GABA α1β1 receptor, α1L264T or β1L259T, when coexpressed with the non-mutated subunit, generates receptors that form spontaneous open chloride channels in cells, without exposure to GABA. These currents are not blocked by bicuculline or PTX (32Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Pillai N.P. Clements J.D. Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PTX and other NCBs have also been reported to inhibit GABAC receptors (33Shimada S. Cutting C. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 683-687PubMed Google Scholar, 34Woodward R.M. Polenzani L. Miledi R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar). A naturally occurring mutation within the M2 domain of the rat ρ2 subunit methionine 300 (aligned with Thr314 of the rat ρ1 and Thr261 of the rat α1 subunit) was shown to induce resistance to PTX blockade of native GABAC receptors in the rat retina (35Zhang D. Pan Z-H. Drideau A.D. Zhang X. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11756-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Independently, proline residue 309 of the human ρ1 subunit (aligning with rat α1Val257 residue) was identified as controlling the sensitivity to PTX inhibition after expression in oocytes (36Wang T-L. Hackam A.S. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11751-11755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support a mechanism by which PTX blocks the ionic GABA channel, presumably through binding in the channel lumen without, however, rejecting conclusively allosteric mechanism alternatives. Among the amino acids from the presumed membrane spanning segment M2 of the different GABA receptor subunits, the cytoplasmic position at the level of Val257 of rat α1 subunit, corresponding to the natural mutation in Drosophila Rdl A302S subunit and the Pro309 in human ρ1 subunit, represents a crucial position in the NCB interaction with various GABA receptors. The aim of our approach, which combines a site-directed labeling method to noninvasive site-directed mutagenesis experiments, is to induce a specific irreversible reaction between a reactive electrophilic affinity ligand analog and a nucleophilic cysteine mutant. The affinity probes which were synthesized derived from two structurally unrelated NCBs having insecticidal properties, the dithiane bis-sulfone and the fipronil series (13Gant D.B. Bloomquist J.R. Ayad H.M. Chalmers A.E. Pestic. Sci. 1990; 30: 355-357Google Scholar, 15Cole L.M. Nicholson R.A. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 46: 47-54Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 19Elliott M. Pulman D.A. Larkin J.P. Casida J.E. Agric. Food. Chem. 1992; 40: 147-151Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) which were chemically modified by an isothiocyanate function or α-chloro and α-bromo moiety leading to probes A, B, and C, respectively. When tested independently for their chemical reactivity toward nucleophilic amino acids, the cysteine residues were found to be the only amino acids reacting efficiently and instantaneously with our probes at neutral pH (not shown). Therefore we generated cysteine mutants within the α subunit of the GABAA receptor to ensure the chemical reactivity. We selected GABAA channel-lining residues, respectively, at positions 257, 261, 264, and 272, which were (i) spread out along the presumed M2 helix of the receptor and proposed to face the lumen of the channel (17Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); (ii) known to produce cysteines mutants displaying conductance properties similar to the WT when co-expressed with β1 and γ2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes Table I (17Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); and (iii) which showed unaltered binding properties for the agonist GABA and the NCB PTX (Table I). These four mutants, when co-expressed with β1 and γ2 subunits in X. laevis oocytes, generate GABA receptors having biochemical and pharmacological properties very similar to the WT type receptor and are therefore adapted for the present study. For control experiments we also generated the α1V257S mutant which showed an increased affinity for GABA in α1V257S β1γ2 recombinant receptor. The three probes A, B, and C(Fig. 1) are efficient blockers of the GABAA-associated chloride channel at the concentration used as demonstrated by the high inhibition observed on GABA-induced currents from recombinant receptors from rat α1, β1, γ2 (WT), or mutants α1, β1, γ2, subunits co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Table II). The washing procedure that was used allowed complete restoration of the conductance properties on the WT receptor as well as on the two cysteine mutant receptors, α1T261Cβ1γ2 and α1L264Cβ1γ2, respectively, while this conductance recovery was only partial for the two cysteine mutant receptors α1V257Cβ1γ2 and α1S272Cβ1γ2 (Table II). The observed irreversible inactivations showed the expected probe concentration dependence (Fig. 3 B) and all three probes induced a higher inhibition at position 257 over position 272 (TableII). The specificity of the inactivation was demonstrated by the protective effect against the inactivation exerted either by PTX (Fig.2 C) and/or TBPS (not shown). Finally, to assess that the covalent reaction occurred between the mutated cysteine and the reactive moiety of the probe, we performed two additional controls. We checked that no irreversible reaction occurred, either on the serine mutant α1V257Sβ1γ2 after treatment with probes A, B, or C (Table II) or, between a fiprole derivative having a nonreactive 4-acetyl pyrazole side chain with the cysteine mutant α1V257Cβ1γ2 (not shown). Clearly, the observed irreversible reactions required the vicinity of both cysteine and reactive probe and even more precisely, it required a spatial proximity between the cysteine side chain and the reactive moiety of the probe, allowing a tentative positioning of the probe within the channel cavity. While reaction at position 257 was fully expected, reinforcing previously described results and observations (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 29Gurley D. Amin J. Ross P. Weiss D.S. White G. Receptors and Channels. 1995; 3: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar), reaction at position 272, presumably very close to the extracellular side, in conjunction with the absence of reaction at the intermediate positions 261 and 264, represents a new result. The simplest tentative explanation to account for these results could be that the NCBs are “filtered” by a narrow part at the channel entrance (position 272), than passing by a more widely open intermediate part before reaching the site located deeply in the channel (position 257) and acting like a plug at this position. Such an overall structure could also explain why PTX does not protect the cysteine mutant at position 261 from the alkylation by the ionic permeants which are smaller molecules and used in large excess (22Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Due to the strong hydrophobic character of the probes in conjunction with their respective potencies and the used concentrations, it seems very unlikely that the covalent reaction occurring at position 257 could result through an action of the probe coming from the inside of the cell, after crossing the membrane. For instance, such an explanation would be in contradiction with the fact that all three probes had a much stronger irreversible effect at position 257 over 272, also the efficiency of probe C (59% irreversible inhibition at position 257 at 10 μm) would be fully unexpected, knowing its high hydrophobic character and its moderate affinity for the NCB site (IC50/[3H]EBOB ∼ 1 μm on rat membranes). The proposed mode of action of the NCBs within the GABA receptor channel raises, however, different questions. The description of an ionic channel centered in the cleft of five straight helical transmembrane segments cannot explain satisfactorily our labeling results. They do not coincide with a structural description given for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, where the narrow part of the channel is proposed to be located at the middle of the transmembrane segments (37Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The irreversible reaction observed at position 272 could either reflect a narrowing of the channel entrance, implying the contribution of other subunits at homologous positions, or it could suggest the existence of a recognition site located mainly on the α-subunit(s) and involving additional α subunit residues, e.g. residues from the putative membrane-spanning helix M1, as was proposed for the interaction of a NCB with the open state of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (38DiPaola M. Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11017-11029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, additional experiments are necessary to describe more precisely the NCB site on the GABAA receptor but again these experiments can be undertaken in the light of our new approach combining cysteine mutants with our reactive probes. We are indebted to Professor Myles H. Akabas for the generous gift of plasmids encoding for the different GABAA receptor subunits, and Mike Tomalski and Vincent Wingate for helpful advice and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1983846212,"Tryparedoxin-I is a recently discovered thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase involved in the regulation of oxidative stress in parasitic trypanosomatids. The crystal structure of recombinant Crithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin-I in the oxidized state has been determined using multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods applied to a selenomethionyl derivative. The model comprises residues 3 to 145 with 236 water molecules and has been refined using all data between a 19- and 1.4-Å resolution to an R-factor and R-free of 19.1 and 22.3%, respectively. Despite sharing only about 20% sequence identity, tryparedoxin-I presents a five-stranded twisted β-sheet and two elements of helical structure in the same type of fold as displayed by thioredoxin, the archetypal thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. However, the relationship of secondary structure with the linear amino acid sequences is different for each protein, producing a distinctive topology. The β-sheet core is extended in the trypanosomatid protein with an N-terminal β-hairpin. There are also differences in the content and orientation of helical elements of secondary structure positioned at the surface of the proteins, which leads to different shapes and charge distributions between human thioredoxin and tryparedoxin-I. A right-handed redox-active disulfide is formed between Cys-40 and Cys-43 at the N-terminal region of a distorted α-helix (α1). Cys-40 is solvent-accessible, and Cys-43 is positioned in a hydrophilic cavity. Three C-H···O hydrogen bonds donated from two proline residues serve to stabilize the disulfide-carrying helix and support the correct alignment of active site residues. The accurate model for tryparedoxin-I allows for comparisons with the family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and provides a template for the discovery or design of selective inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism in trypanosomes. Such inhibitors are sought as potential therapies against a range of human pathogens. Tryparedoxin-I is a recently discovered thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase involved in the regulation of oxidative stress in parasitic trypanosomatids. The crystal structure of recombinant Crithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin-I in the oxidized state has been determined using multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods applied to a selenomethionyl derivative. The model comprises residues 3 to 145 with 236 water molecules and has been refined using all data between a 19- and 1.4-Å resolution to an R-factor and R-free of 19.1 and 22.3%, respectively. Despite sharing only about 20% sequence identity, tryparedoxin-I presents a five-stranded twisted β-sheet and two elements of helical structure in the same type of fold as displayed by thioredoxin, the archetypal thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. However, the relationship of secondary structure with the linear amino acid sequences is different for each protein, producing a distinctive topology. The β-sheet core is extended in the trypanosomatid protein with an N-terminal β-hairpin. There are also differences in the content and orientation of helical elements of secondary structure positioned at the surface of the proteins, which leads to different shapes and charge distributions between human thioredoxin and tryparedoxin-I. A right-handed redox-active disulfide is formed between Cys-40 and Cys-43 at the N-terminal region of a distorted α-helix (α1).

Such inhibitors are sought as potential therapies against a range of human pathogens. root mean square Parasitic trypanosomatids, belonging to the order Kinetoplastida, cause debilitating and life-threatening human diseases such as African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and the leishmaniases (1WHO Tropical Diseases: Progress in Research 1989–1990 , Programme report 10. World Health Organization, Geneva1993Google Scholar). The current therapies against these infections are inadequate due to poor drug efficacy and toxicity combined with increasing drug resistance (2Webster L.T. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor P. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press, Inc., Tarrytown, NY1990Google Scholar). There is therefore an urgent need to understand how drugs already in use function so that they might be improved and to identify new targets for chemotherapeutic attack. The ideal target is an enzyme of a metabolic pathway that is essential for the survival of the parasite and either absent in the human host or one that presents differing substrate specificities (3Wang C.C. Parasitology. 1997; 114: 31-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because trypanosomatids are susceptible to oxidative stress, this aspect of their metabolism represents an attractive target for the development of new trypanocidal agents (4Docampo R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1990; 73: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 6Nogoceke E.

As with other organisms living in an aerobic environment, trypanosomes are exposed to reactive oxygen intermediates such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. These potentially destructive chemicals are eliminated in most eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells by means of a combination of superoxide dismutases, catalase, and a variety of peroxidases. In mammalian cells, the principal route of hydrogen peroxide detoxification involves glutathione peroxidase working in concert with NADPH, glutathione, and glutathione reductase (7Flohé L. Dolphin D. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 643-731Google Scholar). The medically important trypanosomatids do not contain catalase, glutathione peroxidase, or glutathione reductase but rely on an analogous system to regulate oxidative stress. The details of this trypanothione peroxidase system have been elucidated in the model trypanosome Crithidia fasciculata (6Nogoceke E. Daniel U.G. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem.

NADPH provides reducing input to the flavoprotein trypanothione reductase, which in turn maintains high levels of reduced trypanothione (N 1, N 8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), a polyamine peptide conjugate unique to trypanosomatids (5Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Trypanothione reduces tryparedoxin, which then reduces tryparedoxin peroxidase. The peroxidase then catalyzes the final reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water or alcohols. Hydroperoxide metabolism in mammals, yeasts, and some plants uses thioredoxin peroxidase to reduce H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides with reducing equivalents provided from a pathway involving thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH (Refs. 12Raina S.

Tryparedoxin-I and tryparedoxin peroxidase are analogous to thioredoxin and thioredoxin peroxidase, respectively. These proteins all utilize a reactive Cys-sulfhydryl group to reduce disulfides or, alternatively, to oxidize sulfhydryl groups. Tryparedoxin-I is a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, a family of proteins that participates in a diverse range of biological processes, which include the formation of or isomerization of disulfides during protein folding events, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, repair of oxidative damage, activation of transcription factors, modulation of protein-DNA interactions, and the regulation of cell growth (see Refs. 12Raina S.

In contrast, much less is known about the thioredoxin homologs recently discovered in trypanosomes. The first of these was identified in C. fasciculata and is called tryparedoxin-I (6Nogoceke E. Daniel U.G. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Eur.

This is a protein of 146 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 16 kDa; hence, significantly larger than typical thioredoxins. Tryparedoxin-I contains a Trp39-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys43 sequence near the N terminus that resembles the thioredoxin-type Trp-Cys-Gly (or Ala)-Pro-Cys active-site motif (12Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), in which the vicinal cysteine residues form a redox-active disulfide. Tryparedoxin has been found in Trypanosoma brucei (39Ludemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follman H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Letts. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and Trypanosoma cruzi 1E. Tetaud and A. H. Fairlamb, unpublished information. but not so far in Leishmania species. However, tryparedoxins may be ubiquitous for the trypanosomatids since a functional tryparedoxin peroxidase has been identified in Leishmania major (40Levick M.P. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A second tryparedoxin (II) has recently been cloned from C. fasciculata and also serves as a physiological electron donor for tryparedoxin peroxidase (41Montemartini M. Kalisz H.M. Kiess M. Nogoceke E. Singh M. Steinert P. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A crystallographic study of tryparedoxin-I has been initiated to delineate structure-function relationships in the Kinetoplastida-specific trypanothione peroxidase system to enable comparisons with thioredoxins and to investigate how this pathway might be used for the development of trypanocidal agents. Attempts to solve the structure of tryparedoxin-I by molecular replacement using thioredoxin as a search model were unsuccessful (42Alphey M.S. Tetaud E. Gourley D.G. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and we also encountered problems of nonisomorphism following cryo-protection/freezing of the crystals and difficulties in the preparation of heavy-atom derivatives. It was therefore decided to obtain experimental phases using multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD (43Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar)) targeting a selenomethionine derivative. We now describe the preparation of the selenomethionyl protein, the structure solution and refinement using diffraction terms to a resolution of 1.4 Å. The high resolution model reveals the fold and secondary structure of tryparedoxin-I together with the molecular details in and around the active site. Comparisons with other thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, in particular human thioredoxin, are presented as appropriate. The methionine auxotrophic strain of E. coli B834(DE3) was heat shock-transformed with the plasmid carrying the gene for C. fasciculata tryparedoxin-I (pET-TryX (11Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) and selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. Bacteria were cultured in M9 media supplemented with the usual amino acids except that l-selenomethionine (100 mg l−1) was substituted for l-methionine. Expression of tryparedoxin-I was induced at mid-log phase with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell growth was allowed to continue for a further 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g) at 4 °C, resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mmbenzamidine), and lysed in a French press. The insoluble debris was separated by centrifugation (27,000 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant filtered then applied to a Ni2+-resin column (Poros 4.6 mm/100 mm) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer using a PerSeptive Biosystems BioCAD 700e. The resin was washed at 5 ml min−1 with 18 column volumes of 20 mm Bis-Tris propane, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and the product was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 60 mm in a single step. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and those containing tryparedoxin-I pooled, dialyzed against binding buffer, and subjected to a second purification step on the Ni2+-resin column using the same protocol. The protein was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the histidine tag was cleaved with biotinylated-thrombin (Novagen). The protease was removed by use of a streptavadin-agarose resin (Novagen), and the histidine tag was removed by passage through the Ni2+-resin column. Pooled fractions of tryparedoxin-I were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and concentrated (Centricon-10, Amicon) to approximately 10 mg ml−1 for use in crystallization experiments. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (PerSeptive Biosystems, Voyager) was used to assess purity and to confirm the full incorporation of selenomethionine. Orthorhombic crystals in space group P212121were obtained under similar conditions to those employed on the wild-type protein (42Alphey M.S. Tetaud E. Gourley D.G. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine tryparedoxin-I crystals have unit cell dimensions of a = 38.39, b = 50.70, c = 70.82 Å with a single copy of the protein in the asymmetric unit. The N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag is cleaved by thrombin during the purification procedure, leaving a Gly-Ser-His extension that ensures that the initiating methionine is preserved on the recombinant protein. A single crystal (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm) was cryo-protected with 40% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 then flash-frozen in a nylon loop with a nitrogen stream at −170 °C (Oxford Cryo-stream), maintained at low temperature and transported dry to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility BM14 in Grenoble (Statebourne Cryogenics Biotrek 3), then used for MAD data collection. The x-ray detector was a charge coupled device (MAR Research), and the choice of wavelengths for the peak (λ1), inflection point (λ2), and remote data (λ3) were derived from a XANES (x-ray absorption near edge structure) scan of the Se K-absorption edge from the crystal. The three wavelengths were selected to provide the largest value for the anomalous difference, f "" (λ1) and the minimum value for f ′ (λ2 or inflection point). The remote wavelength (λ3) maximized the dispersive difference, Δf ′ (λ3– λ2) and, by virtue of being at a higher energy, extended the resolution to which data were recorded. The STRATEGY program (44Ravelli R.B.G. Sweet R.M. Skinner J.M. Duisenberg A.J.M. Krron J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 551-554Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was used to determine the range for data collection, and each wavelength data set was subsequently collected in a sweep of 0.5° oscillations through 87.5°. All data were processed, reduced, and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar) then analyzed using the CCP4 software package (46Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

An anomalous difference Patterson function, calculated using the peak wavelength data, revealed a single ordered selenium atom subsequently identified as Se-Met84. MAD data were input to the program SOLVE, and experimental phases were calculated from the selenium atom position using a multiple isomorphous replacement approach (47Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 17-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This calculation provided phases to 1.7-Å resolution with an overall figure-of-merit of 0.69. Density modification by solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM (49Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsletter. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) increased the figure-of-merit to 0.76. The resulting electron density map was of excellent quality (Fig. 2) and readily interpreted with the program O (50Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The first five N-terminal residues and the final C-terminal residue are disordered and are not included in the model of tryparedoxin-I. This disorder at the N terminus of the protein provides an explanation of why the selenium corresponding to Se-Met1 could not be located in the anomalous difference Patterson. The resolution of the data was extended to 1.4 Å with the λ3 data set measured at a shorter wavelength, and refinement was accomplished using REFMAC (51Murshodov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) interspersed with computer graphics map inspection (Silicon Graphics) and model manipulation combined with ARP (52Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for water placement. The R-free was monitored as a guide for the refinement (53Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several residues on the surface of the protein were poorly defined by the MAD phased electron density map and truncated to alanines in the first model; however, in the course of refinement, the complete side chains could be built in. Similarly, as the refinement progressed, the maps indicated dual conformations for seven residues, which were successfully modeled as such. The stereochemistry of the tryparedoxin-I model was assessed with PROCHECK (54Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The three tryparedoxins for which sequence information is available all share high levels of sequence identity with approximately 45% of residues conserved across all three proteins (Fig. 4). The two examples from C. fasciculata, namely tryparedoxin-I and II, are 52% identical, and the T. brucei protein is 57% identical with tryparedoxin-II. The sequence conservation extends over three dimensions as shown in Fig. 4 b, so the structure we present can be considered as representative of this subset of the thioredoxin superfamily. The sequence conservation also provides an indication of which residues are likely to contribute to the stability and reactivity of tryparedoxins, and in the analysis of the structural model, we pay particular attention to those residues.Figure 4a, the amino acid sequence of C. fasciculata tryparedoxin-I with the assignment of secondary structure based on the crystallographic model.

Expression of the pts P0 promoter that is increased during growth in the presence of glucose is also activated by cAMP receptor protein·cAMP. Based on the existence of a sequence that has a high similarity with the known Mlc binding site in the promoter, the effects of the Mlc protein on the pts P0 promoter expression were studied. In vivo transcription assays using wild type and mlc-negative E. coli strains grown in the presence and absence of glucose indicate that Mlc negatively regulates expression of the P0 promoter, and Mlc-dependent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium. In vitro transcription assay using purified recombinant Mlc showed that Mlc repressed transcription from the P0 but did not affect the activity of the P1. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that a Mlc binding site was located around +1 to +25 of the promoter and that Mlc inhibited the binding of RNA polymerase to the P0 promoter. Cells overexpressing Mlc showed a very slow fermentation rate compared with the wild type when grown in the presence of various phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system sugars but few differences in the presence of non-phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system sugars except maltose. These results suggest that the pts operon is one of major targets for the negative regulation by Mlc, and thus Mlc regulates the utilization of various sugars as well as glucose in E. coli. The possibility that the inducer of Mlc may not be sugar or its derivative but an unknown factor is proposed to explain the Mlc induction mechanism by various sugars.

Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is sequentially transferred to enzyme I, to HPr, to the sugar-specific enzyme II complex, and finally to the substrate as it is translocated across the membrane. The ptsH, ptsI, and crr genes encoding HPr, enzyme I, and enzyme IIAGlc, respectively, constitute the pts operon. The pts operon is regulated in a complex fashion by P0 and P1, each of which has two different transcription start sites depending on the availability of CRP·cAMP and on the topology of DNA (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the pts promoters increases in the presence of CRP·cAMP as well as glucose in vivo (3Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 109-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4De Reuse H.

Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been known that the target promoter that is activated when cells are grown in the presence of glucose is the P0 promoter, but the mechanism by which glucose activates the P0 transcription is not known. Transcription from the P0 is fully activated only when cells grow in the presence of both glucose and exogenous cAMP (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4De Reuse H. Kolb A. Danchin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Ryu S.

The possibility of the presence of a repressor that is sensitive to glucose has been suggested based on these observations (7Ryu S. Ramsier T.M. Michotey V. Saier Jr., M.H. Garges S. J. Biol.

Mlc (making large colonies) is a newly identified global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol.

The mlc gene was originally found to cause the reduction of acetate accumulation when the overexpressing cells grow in the presence of glucose (12Hosono K. Kakuda H. Ichihara S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mlc gene was also shown to be identical with the previously characterized dgsA gene (10Plumbridge J. Mol.

All genes that are so far known to be under the control of Mlc are also regulated by CRP·cAMP. We noticed a sequence that has a high homology with the known Mlc binding site between +1 and +25 of the pts P0 promoter region (Fig. 1). In this study, a procedure is described for purification of the active form of Mlc to homogeneity, and the effects of Mlc on the expression of the pts P0 promoter were studied to determine whether the in vivo glucose effect on pts operon expression is mediated by Mlc. Cyclic AMP was obtained from Sigma. RNA polymerase and nucleotide triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cycle sequencing kit was from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]UTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Klenow polymerase was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). SR702 (MC4100, suhX1) is a derivative of MC4100 (araD139 ΔargF-lacU169rpsL150 thiA1 relA1 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsR) that expresses a high level of GroEL because of an IS 1 element inserted upstream of the groE gene. It was constructed from KY1603 (15Kusukawa N. Yura T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) by P1 transduction. The chaperonin GroEL protects RNA from nucleases (16Georgellis D. Sohlberg B. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Mol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 560Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) is stabilized in suhX1 strain background because of a high level of GroEL. SR703 (SR702, mlc) was constructed from CP1036 by P1 transduction. Glutamine at residue 369 of Mlc is replaced by a stop codon (UAG) in CP1036 (18Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol.

Total Escherichia coli RNA was purified using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was resuspended in sterile distilled water. Purified γ-32P-end labeled primer P11 (5′-GCCAGTTTTTAACAGACGCGACGCACGAAG-3′) (7Ryu S. Ramsier T.M. Michotey V. Saier Jr., M.H. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2489-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was coprecipitated with 30 μg of total cell RNA, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 250 mm KCl, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Primer extension reactions were done as described by Ryu and Garges (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence from base 194 to 1490 of the E. coli mlc gene (GenBankTM accession codeD32222) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The forward polymerase chain reaction primer (5′-GCGAAAATATAGGGAGTATCAT ATGGTTGC-3′) contained an engineered Nde I site (underlined) containing the ATG start codon (boldface, the original GTG was changed into ATG for better expression). The reverse polymerase chain reaction primer (5′-CTTTCCTGGCCCAAATTGGGATCCCGCAAA-3′) contained an engineered Bam HI site (underlined) located 33 base pairs downstream from the TAA stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the Nde I and Bam HI cloning sites of the vector pRE1 (19Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the sequence of the recombinant plasmid, pNS100, was verified by a cycle sequencing kit. The pNS100 was electroporated with an E. coli pulser (Bio-Rad) into E. coli strain GI698. In plasmid pNS100, the mlc gene is under the control of the strong λPl promoter-cII ribosome binding site combination. The λ c I repressor gene is under the control of the trp promoter in GI698 (20Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E. coli GI698 transformed with plasmid pNS100 was cultured at 30 °C in 200 ml of synthetic medium (20Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. When the culture reached an A600 = 0.5, tryptophan (0.1 mg/ml) was added to induce the expression of Mlc. The cells harvested 20 h after induction were washed once with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and stored at −20 °C. Fermentation properties of E. coli GI698 strains transformed with pNS100 or pRE1 were compared with that of the mlc-negative mutant to check the effect of Mlc overexpression or deletion on the PTS activity. These strains were grown in the synthetic medium supplemented with ampicillin and then spotted onto MacConkey indicator plates containing various sugars as carbon sources, and color development of those colonies was observed. Four PTS sugars including glucose, mannose, mannitol, and N-acetylglucosamine and four non-PTS sugars including lactose, maltose, melibiose, and sucrose were tested. The cells containing overexpressed Mlc were sonicated in glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, and the cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono-Q 5/5 column equilibrated with glycine-NaOH buffer (buffer G), pH 9.5, containing 1 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer G containing 1 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl, and then Mlc was eluted with a linear salt gradient (7 column volumes of buffer G containing 50 mm NaCl to 7 column volumes of buffer G containing 500 mm NaCl in the presence of 1 mm DTT). The elution of Mlc was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fractions containing substantial amounts of Mlc were pooled and concentrated in a 3 K Macrosep centrifugal concentrator (Filtron). The concentrate was chromatographed through a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffer G with 1 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl as eluent. The fractions containing Mlc were pooled and concentrated as described above. Reactions were done as described by Ryu and Garges (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 25-μl volume containing the following: 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 3 mmmagnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mmGTP, 0.2 mm CTP, 0.02 mm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 2 nm supercoiled DNA template, 20 nm RNA polymerase holoenzyme, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Additional regulators such as 40 nm CRP, 100 μm cAMP, or 0–200 ng of Mlc were added to the reaction as needed. All components except nucleotides were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Transcriptions were started by the addition of nucleotides and terminated after 10 min by the addition of 25 μl of formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. The amounts of transcripts were measured using a Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). DNase I protection experiments were done as described by Ryu et al. (7Ryu S. Ramsier T.M. Michotey V. Saier Jr., M.H. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2489-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two nm DNA, 40 nm CRP, 200 ng of Mlc, and 100 μm cAMP were mixed in transcription buffer in the combinations as indicated in Fig. 5 and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. RNA polymerase was added and incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C before DNase I treatment. The DNase I treatment was terminated by adding an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA and heating at 85 °C for 3 min. The DNase I-treated DNA was cleaned with a Wizard DNA cleanup kit (Promega, Madison, WI), probed with 32P-end labeled primer using Klenow polymerase, and analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. We have suggested the presence of a repressor that is inducible by glucose in the pts P0 promoter (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a sequence that has a high similarity with the known Mlc binding site (9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) at the pts P0 promoter region prompted us to study the effect of Mlc on the expression of the promoter (Fig.1). We tested the effect of Mlc on transcription of the P0 promoter in vivo by primer extension assay of total RNA extracted from cells grown in the presence or absence of glucose. The P0 transcription was stimulated by growth on glucose in a wild type strain as expected (Fig.2). In the absence of glucose, the mlc-negative mutant showed a much higher transcription level of the P0 promoter than the wild type strain, implying that Mlc negatively regulates the expression of the P0 promoter in the wild type (compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 2). The level of transcription from the P0 promoter of a mlc-negative mutant grown without glucose (Fig. 2, lane 4) was even higher than that of a wild type strain grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 2, lane 1). This is because the P0 is activated further by CRP·cAMP in the absence of glucose in a mlc-negative mutant. In glucose-grown cultures, however, the mlc-negative strain showed a similar expression level of P0 promoter with the wild type strain (compare lanes 1 and 3 of Fig. 2). These results suggest that Mlc is a repressor of the pts P0 promoter, and Mlc-dependent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium. Mlc protein was purified to characterize its effects on the pts P0 promoter further. Mlc could be overproduced in E. coli strain GI698 containing pNS100 to about 25% of the total cell protein after induction (Fig.3). Even though a high level of expression of Mlc could be achieved using the system, the protein was found in the insoluble fraction of the lysate (lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 3). Various methods as suggested by Rudolph and Lilie (21Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) were tried to increase the solubility of Mlc in the cell extract, and we found that Mlc was soluble in glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5. Mlc was purified using a combination of anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The overall purification was 3.8-fold from the crude extract to the final preparation (TableI). From 100 ml of culture (about 350 mg of wet weight cell), a yield of 5.5 mg of approximately 95% pure Mlc was obtained as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3, lane 6). The final preparation was free of RNase activity and was directly used for in vitro transcription assay.Table IPurification of recombinant Mlc from E. coli GI698 containing pNS100Purification stepTotal proteinMlcPurityYieldPurification foldmgmg%%Crude extract5513.7251001.00100,000 × g supernatant4111.528841.12Mono-Q chromatography127.260532.4Superdex 75 chromatography5.85.595403.8 Open table in a new tab The effect of Mlc on the P0 transcription was studied further by an in vitro transcription assay using purified proteins. The supercoiled pHX DNA containing both P0 and P1 promoters was used as a DNA template (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mlc inhibited transcription from the P0 promoter but did not affect transcription of the P1 promoter (Fig.4 A). The specificity of the Mlc action on the P0 promoter was further demonstrated by the consistent activity of the rep that is originated from the plasmid origin of replication regardless of the presence of Mlc (Fig.4 A). The inhibitory effect of Mlc on the P0 promoter was reduced in the presence of CRP·cAMP (compare lanes 1 and 3 in Fig. 4A), even though the influence of CRP·cAMP was not significant. Varying amounts of purified Mlc were added to the in vitro transcription reactions to determine the kinetic behavior of the purified protein in the transcriptional regulation of the P0 promoter. Half repression by the recombinant Mlc, in the absence and presence of CRP·cAMP, was obtainable with about 6 and 12 ng (Fig. 4 B), respectively, showing that the stimulatory effect of the CRP·cAMP complex on P0 in the presence of Mlc was not significant, and Mlc is a stronger regulator. We tested the binding of Mlc on the P0 promoter region to determine the mechanism of Mlc action. Binding of Mlc, CRP·cAMP, and RNA polymerase on the P0 promoter region was studied using a DNase I footprinting experiment. Fig. 5 showed that Mlc bound to the P0 promoter region, and the binding of both Mlc and CRP·cAMP to the P0 promoter region was independent of each other (compare lanes 2, 3, and 7). DNase I footprinting results (Fig. 5) confirmed the Mlc binding site around +1 to +25 of the P0 promoter as indicated by sequence comparison of the known Mlc binding sites to the region. DNase I footprinting results also showed that the binding of RNA polymerase to the P0 promoter region was inhibited in the presence of Mlc (compare lanes 2, 4, and 5 in Fig. 5). The phenotype of E. coli overexpressing Mlc was examined on MacConkey agar plates containing various PTS and non-PTS sugar substrates. The overall colony size of GI698 harboring pNS100 (containing the mlc gene) was larger than the strain harboring a control vector, pRE1, regardless of the sugar substrates, and colonies on plates containing readily fermentable sugars showed a reddish purple color 6 h after spotting at 37 °C. When non-PTS sugars such as lactose, maltose, melibiose, and sucrose were used as substrate, there were no remarkable differences between GI698 harboring pNS100 and the strain containing pRE1 except for maltose (TableII). When PTS sugars were included in MacConkey plates, however, Mlc overexpression seriously retarded the fermentation rate of those PTS sugars regardless of the sugar substrates (Table II). Repressing activity of Mlc and derepression of Mlc activity by readily fermentable sugar substrates have been shown for several sugar-specific transporter genes and the pts operon (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

According to these observations, the wild type cells grown in the presence of these sugar substrates should show the similar fermentation rate compared with the mlc-negative cells. When we compared fermentation patterns of the mlc mutant and the wild type cells to the GI698 strain harboring pRE1 or pNS100, the mlc-negative mutant showed no remarkable difference in fermentation patterns with the wild type cells or the GI698 strain harboring pRE1, as expected. These results imply that Mlc, which mainly affects utilization of PTS sugars, is a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism .Table IIFermentation patterns of E. coli strains transformed with pNS100 and pRE1 on various sugar substratesSugars addedGI698/pRE1GI698/pNS100PTS sugars Glucose+++++ Mannose+++++ Mannitol++++++ N-acetylglucosamine+++++Non-PTS sugars Lactose++++ Maltose+++++ Melibiose+++++ Sucrose−−Fermentation rate was checked on the basis of color development on a MacConkey agar plate containing indicated sugars (1%), and each experiment was repeated three to seven times. −, no fermentation; +, very slow fermentation; ++, slow fermentation; +++, moderate fermentation; ++++, fast fermentation.

The expression level of pts gene products in E. coli was reported to change 2- to 3-fold in response to the environmental changes such as the availability of the sugar substrates and oxygen (1Postma P.W.

Examination of the pts P0 promoter region revealed a site that has a high similarity to the sequence of the known Mlc binding sites. The mlc encodes a 44-kDa protein, Mlc, that has been shown to regulate the expression of ptsG encoding IICBGlc, manXYZ encoding enzyme II of the mannose PTS, malT encoding the activator of maltose regulon, and mlc itself (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mlc is proposed to be a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Comparison of transcription from the pts P0 promoter in wild type and mlc- negative mutant suggests that Mlc is a repressor of the P0 promoter. The P0 promoter was activated in the wild type, whereas it was repressed in a mlc- negative mutant when cells were grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 2). The probable reason for the reduction of the activity of the P0 promoter when the mlc-negative strain grows in the presence of glucose is that the concentration of an activator of the P0 promoter, CRP·cAMP, was lowered in that condition (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results also indicated that the action of Mlc in the regulation of the pts operon is dominant over that of CRP·cAMP as proposed for the regulation of ptsG expression by Mlc recently (9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the concentration of Mlc in E. coli is limiting (9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene is autoregulated (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the translation efficiency of the mlc is low because the translation initiation codon of the mlc is GTG (12Hosono K. Kakuda H. Ichihara S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We cloned the mlc under the control of λPl and changed the GTG to ATG in our expression vector pNS100 for better expression of the gene. We could get more than 95% pure Mlc using a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. This is the first report describing the purification of Mlc. In vitro transcription assays with purified Mlc clearly showed that Mlc specifically inhibited transcription from the P0 promoter but had no effect on the P1 promoter (Fig. 4 A). CRP·cAMP reduced the action of Mlc a little but could not prevent Mlc from inhibiting the P0 promoter. It is, however, possible that the modest influence of CRP·cAMP on Mlc action revealed by in vitro transcription assay can be significant in vivo because Mlc concentration is limiting in E. coli (9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription assay results together with the in vivo Mlc effects on the pts P0 promoter activity strongly demonstrated that Mlc was a repressor of the pts P0 promoter that can be induced by glucose. We identified one Mlc binding site centered at +13 of the promoter. The sequence has high homology with the tentative consensus sequence of the Mlc binding site as proposed by Kimata et al. (9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The binding sites of CRP·cAMP and Mlc do not overlap and their binding to the P0 promoter region was independent of each other as expected from the previous finding that the glucose- and cAMP-mediated activations of the pts promoter were independent of each other (2Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mlc inhibited the P0 promoter activity by interfering with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter (Fig. 5). The common feature of five operons (manXYZ, malT, mlc, ptsG, and pts) identified as the Mlc regulon so far is that all of them have at least one CRP·cAMP binding site as well as a Mlc binding site, and thus they are under the dual regulation. This seems to be necessary for the fine control of expression of these genes to respond to various environmental conditions. It is interesting that E. coli overexpressing Mlc showed the same phenotype (the cells having a very slow fermentation rate) on N-acetylglucosamine and mannitol indicator plates as on glucose and mannose plates (Table II). The nagE gene of N-acetylglucosamine PTS and the mtlA gene of mannitol PTS correspond to the ptsG gene of glucose PTS and the manXYZ gene of mannose PTS in that all of them encode the major sugar-specific transporters, enzyme II. It is not known if Mlc is involved in the regulation of the nagE and mtlA genes, even though positive regulation of nagE by the CRP·cAMP complex was reported recently (24Plumbridge J. Kolb A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1254-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In any case, we can expect that Mlc regulates utilization of many PTS sugars because it modulates the expression of the pts that encodes general proteins for all PTSs, enzyme I, and HPr. To serve as a common regulator of metabolism of many sugars, Mlc should be induced by different kinds of sugar. The inducer of Mlc has not been identified despite repeated attempts to identify the inducer that affects the Mlc binding to its binding site by many researchers (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that the inducer relieves repression by Mlc without affecting the binding of Mlc to its binding site using in vitro transcription assay. However, none of the sugars or their derivatives tested (glucose, glucose-6-P, maltose, mannitol, mannose, xylose, melibiose, pyruvate, N-acetylglucosamine, methyl β-d-thiogalactoside) showed any effect on the repression by Mlc. These results suggest the possibility that the inducer of Mlc may not be the sugar or its derivative. It has been known that glucose-mediated activation of the pts operon is dependent on the enzyme IICBGlc, which may act as a sensor protein (25De Reuse H. Danchin A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this view, Mlc can act as a response regulator whose activity is modulated by enzyme IICBGlc. However, the possibility that Mlc is phosphorylated by enzyme IICBGlc is low because we could not get any evidence of phosphorylation of Mlc, even though we tried several different approaches employing [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate or [γ-32P]ATP mixed with purified Mlc in the presence and absence of E. coli cell-free extracts to phosphorylate Mlc (data not shown). These may imply that the activity of Mlc is modulated by interaction with an unknown factor probably through protein-protein interaction as in the case of anti-ς factors (26Decatur A.L. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2348-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Ohnishi K. Kutsukake K. Suzuki H. Lino T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3149-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Glucose may affect the interaction by changing the phosphorylation state of enzyme IICBGlc, and other sugars may also affect the interaction through their own enzyme II. The unknown factor could be any one of PTS proteins or an unknown novel factor yet to be identified. We are testing this possibility, and further work is needed to discover the inducer of Mlc would be. We thank Drs. T. Yura and C. Park for providing strains and R. Labbe for reviewing the manuscript."

At present, based on information available from the NMR structure of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain, we examined the structural interaction with the 8-kDa domain using two species, C18-linoleic acid (LA) or C24-nervonic acid (NA). In the 8-kDa domain with LA or NA, the structure that forms the interaction interface included helix-1, helix-2, helix-4, the three turns (residues 1–13, 48–51, and 79–87) and residues adjacent to an Ω-type loop connecting helix-1 and helix-2 of the same face. No significant shifts were observed for any of the residues on the opposite side of the 8-kDa domain. The NA interaction interface on the amino acid residues of the 8-kDa domain fragment was mostly the same as that of LA, except that the shifted cross-peaks of Leu-11 and Thr-79 were significantly changed between LA and NA. The 8-kDa domain bound to LA or NA as a 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.02 or 2.64 mm, respectively.

DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) nervonic acid linoleic acid single strand deoxyribonucleic acid heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlated spectroscopy polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis We reported previously that long-chain fatty acids strongly inhibited the activities of mammalian DNA polymerase α (pol α)1 and DNA polymerase β (pol β) in vitro and plant DNA polymerases, albeit less potently, but that at the concentrations used, the fatty acids hardly influenced the activities of prokaryotic DNA polymerases or other DNA metabolic enzymes such as DNase I (1Mizushina Y.

Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The most potent inhibitors were fatty acids, which have the following characteristics: hydrocarbon chain containing 18 or more carbons, a free carboxyl end, and the cis-configuration is preferred to the trans-configuration. Fatty acids in the trans-configuration have a much weaker inhibitory effect on pol β, and those in which the carboxyl end is chemically modified can lose the inhibitory effect on both pol α and pol β. The mode of inhibition by longer chain fatty acids showed the same characteristics, except that the minimum inhibitory doses of these longer chain fatty acids were much lower (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys.

Lineweaver-Burk plots of the fatty acids indicated that both the substrate (i.e. deoxynucleotide)-binding and the template DNA-binding sites of pol α were nonantagonistically inhibited by the fatty acids, but they were effective as antagonists against the sites of pol β. For pol β, fatty acids acted by competing with not only the substrate but also the template-primer DNA. In screening inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA polymerase, we also found several natural compounds which inhibited pol β in the same manner as fatty acids (4Ohta K. Mizushina Y. Hirata N. Takemura M.

Pol β is the smallest known DNA polymerase in animal cells with a molecular mass of 39 kDa, and its structure is highly conserved among mammals (11Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1992: 197-225Google Scholar). This protein has a modular two-domain structure, with apparent flexibility within a protease-sensitive region between residues 82 and 86, which separates the two domains. Treatment with trypsin yields an N-terminal domain fragment (8 kDa), which retains binding affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and a C-terminal domain fragment (31 kDa) with reduced DNA polymerase activity (12Kumar A.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7156-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We reported previously the mode of biochemical inhibition by fatty acids using two of the pol β fragments that were proteolytically separated (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The fatty acids were found to bind to the 8-kDa DNA-binding domain fragment and to suppress binding to the template-primer DNA. A 10,000-fold higher level of fatty acid was required for binding to the 31-kDa catalytic domain or to inhibit the DNA polymerase activity, suggesting that it directly disturbs the template-primer incorporation into the template-primer-binding domain and indirectly competes with the substrate on its binding site in the catalytic domain (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The binding between the enzymes and fatty acids can be released by detergents without any permanent damage to the structure (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the binding is physiologically specific and has some roles in vivo: for example, to maintain the enzymes in the inactive state on the internal surface of the membranes. In this study, we analyzed the structural interactions of C18 and C24 fatty acids with pol β, especially the N-terminal 8-kDa domain, in cross-linking studies using a 5′-end-labeled photoprobe (dT14D) instead of template-primer DNA and the binding surface of the 8-kDa domain in contact with the fatty acids by NMR. The crystal and NMR structures of pol β and the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β have been determined recently by Wilson and his co-workers (14Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W.

The study of the relationship between fatty acids and pol β may reveal why C16 or shorter fatty acids cannot inhibit the polymerase activity (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), why the minimum inhibitory doses of longer chain fatty acids are much lower than those of shorter chain species, although the biochemical mode of inhibition is the same, and how the fatty acids bind to the N-terminal 8-kDa domain. These studies may help to further clarify the structure and function of pol β and subsequently may allow us to speculate on the in vivo role of DNA polymerase inhibition by fatty acids. The N-terminal 8-kDa fragment of rat DNA pol β (residues 2–87) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 harboring the expression plasmid “Lys-87” constructed in our laboratory. Overproduction of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain and the purification procedure have principally been described in our previous report (23Date T. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Tanihara K. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For 15N-correlated NMR experiments, the N-terminal 8-kDa domain was expressed from BL21/Lys-87 grown on minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source (24Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Mullen G.P. Abeygunawardana C. Lattman E.E. Mildvan A.S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In preparing the NMR sample, the purified N-terminal domain was concentrated using a Centricon-3 (Amicon) and exchanged into 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 20% D2O. Two samples for NMR experiments contained 1.25 mm15N-labeled N-terminal 8-kDa domain after addition of fatty acids (linoleic acid (LA) and nervonic acid (NA)). The fatty acids (12.5 mm each) were dissolved in Me2SO-d 6. Fragments of 8 and 31 kDa of pol β were prepared and purified as described previously (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (9.4 μl) was comprised of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.085 μm32P-5′-end-labeled photoprobes dT14D (i.e. an oligothymidylate 15-mer analogue containing a photolabile 2′-deoxy-E-5-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-3 H-diazirin-3-yl)styryl]uridylate residue at the 3′ terminus, 0.8 pmol/reaction mixture) (25Yamaguchi T. Suyama K. Narita K. Kohgo S. Tomikawa A. Saneyoshi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 20% Me2SO with various concentrations of fatty acids. The 8-kDa domain fragment (0.14 μg, 18 pmol) and 31-kDa domain (0.55 μg, 18 pmol) or 8-kDa domain fragment (0.14 μg, 18 pmol) were added in the reaction mixture. Incubation was carried out for 5 min at 25 °C. After chilling at 0 °C, the reaction mixture was irradiated with a near-UV lamp as described (25Yamaguchi T. Suyama K. Narita K. Kohgo S. Tomikawa A. Saneyoshi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for 10 min in an ice bath. The product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% separation gel) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. For CD analysis, 6.25 μm (50 μg/ml) purified 8-kDa domain fragment of pol β and 62.5 μm fatty acid mixture (molecular ratio, enzyme:inhibitor = 1:10) were dissolved in 5 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5% methanol. The chromatograms for the mixtures were compared with that of the 8-kDa domain alone. The concentrations of the proteins were determined by UV adsorption at 280 nm (ε280 = 5440m−1 cm−1). CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter in a 1-cm cell at 25 °C. The CD spectra were collected from 260 to 200 nm at a resolution of 1 nm using up to eight scans. The per residue molar ellipticity (degree·cm2 dmol−1) was calculated from the concentration for the 87-residue polypeptide. NMR spectra were measured at 750 MHz on a Varian Unity-Plus 750 spectrometer. 1H-15N HMQC spectra were recorded at a temperature of 30 °C. Each spectrum size was 1024 complex points in the t2 dimension and 96 complex points in t1. The data were zero filled in both dimensions, and a shifted sine-bell was applied as a window function for resolution enhancement. A total of 32 scans per FID was accumulated, leading to a measuring time of 90 min per HMQC spectrum. The in vitro relationship between mammalian DNA polymerases and fatty acids has been investigated (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M.

Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As described in the Introduction, longer chain fatty acids (over 18 carbons) strongly inhibited DNA polymerase activities in vitro. Fatty acids in which they are of the trans-configuration have much weaker inhibitory effects on especially pol β, and the fatty acids in which the carboxyl end is chemically modified can lose the inhibitory effect. In this study, we analyzed the structure of pol β and its relationship to the long-chain fatty acids in more detail. Lineweaver-Burk plots of fatty acids indicated that both the substrate-binding and the template DNA-binding sites of pol β were antagonistically inhibited by fatty acids (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We tested fatty acids from C18 to the longest commercially available, C24, previously (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Among the fatty acids examined, the strongest inhibitor was a C24fatty acid, nervonic acid (NA), and the weakest was a C18fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA) (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the mode of binding to pol β using the longest and the shortest fatty acids in the present study. The effects of fatty acid were analyzed using proteolytic methods. Rat pol β, which was also used in this study, can be divided into two domain fragments (8- and 31-kDa polypeptides) using controlled proteolysis (12Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kumar A. Abbotts J. Karawya E.M. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7156-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 8-kDa domain is the DNA template-binding domain, and the 31-kDa domain is the catalytic part involved in DNA polymerization. According to the methods described by Kumar et al. (12Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we purified both of these fragments by fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 4, Ref. 3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and used them in this experiment. We also suggested previously that the fatty acids bind to pol β and the 8-kDa domain fragment, but not to the 31-kDa domain fragment (3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both NA and LA appear to interact with the enzyme or the 8-kDa domain fragment in the same way, but the longer chain binds to the domain fragment more tightly and inhibits DNA polymerase activity much more strongly. The labeling abilities of the synthesized 32P 5′-end-labeled photoprobes (dT14D) were investigated using the N-terminal 8-kDa and C-terminal 31-kDa domain fragments of the recombinant rat pol β (39 kDa). The 32P 5′-end-labeled photoprobe (dT14D) had a molecular mass of 5 kDa. dT14D was mixed with 8- and 31-kDa fragments of pol β and irradiated with near-UV light as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then analyzed by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1A, autoradiography of the radioactive products of the 8-kDa domain fragment resolved by SDS-PAGE showed a shift from the original 8-kDa to the 13 (8 + 5)-kDa position as the labeled protein complex (lane 1). Poly (dT), which is a DNA template, competed with the photoprobe for binding to the 8-kDa domain fragment (lanes 1–3 in Fig. 1A). The 8-kDa band observed in Fig. 1A may have been due to the absorption of very small amount of labeled photoprobe. A small amount of dT14D could bind to the 31-kDa domain fragment and cause a shift to the 36 (31 + 5)-kDa position, although this band was faint (lane 1 in Fig. 1 A). The SDS-PAGE characteristics of dT14D and recombinant rat pol β (39 kDa) were shown previously (Fig. 6 of Ref. 25Yamaguchi T. Suyama K. Narita K. Kohgo S. Tomikawa A. Saneyoshi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When the mixture was not irradiated, no cross-linking of the proteins with dT14D was observed (lane 4 in Fig.1 A). The 8-kDa domain fragment of pol β could be shifted with the cross-linked dT14D, but the 31-kDa fragment, the catalytic domain without a DNA-binding site, could not, because this domain has no DNA binding capacity (lane 1 in Fig.1 A). Cross-linking of the fragments of pol β with photolabile dT14D was inhibited by addition of the natural template, poly(dT) (lanes 1–3 in Fig. 1 A), showing that the 8-kDa domain fragment has contained the template DNA-binding site. LA and NA interfered with complex formation of the 8-kDa fragment and ssDNA template (Fig. 1, B and C). pT14D at a concentration of 0.8 pmol was added to 18 pmol of the 8-kDa fragment along with various concentrations of LA (Fig.1 B) or NA (Fig. 1 C). The I/E (inhibitor/enzyme) ratios in the presence of 0, 1.8, 3.6, and 7.2 μm fatty acids (LA is Fig. 1 B, NA is Fig.1 C) were 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1, respectively. NA interfered with binding of the DNA to the 8-kDa fragment, and at an I/E ratio of 1, the interference became nearly complete (Fig.1 C). We, therefore, concluded that one molecule of fatty acids competes with oligonucleotide, i.e. dT14D, suggesting that a fatty acid molecule interferes with the binding of template DNA to one molecule of the 8-kDa domain fragment. Similar results were obtained using LA instead of NA (Fig. 1 B). LA also interfered with DNA binding to the fragment, but the interference was not complete at an I/E ratio of 1. Thus, the C24 fatty acid, NA, showed stronger interference than the C18 fatty acid, LA, at the I/E ratio of 1. This may explain the observation that the inhibition of pol β activity by NA was 10-fold stronger than that by LA although the biochemical mode of inhibition was the same (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To explain why the minimum inhibitory dose of the longer chain fatty acid was much lower than that of short chain species, the dissociation constants (KD) between each of the fatty acids and the domain fragment were also analyzed as described in the later part of this report (Fig. 3). To investigate the binding mode including KD in detail, NMR structures of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain with or without the fatty acids were determined. The CD spectra of complexes of the 8-kDa domain fragment and the fatty acids were very similar to the CD spectrum of the 8-kDa domain fragment alone (Fig. 2). The comparable maximal negative ellipticities at 208 and 220 nm indicated that the overall helical structure in the mixture of the 8-kDa domain, and the fatty acids were similar to that of the 8-kDa domain fragment alone (Fig. 2). The spectra of the protein-LA complex and the protein-NA complex were similar to each other, but the maximal negative ellipticity of 208 nm and the maximal positive ellipticity of 235–260 nm of the protein-NA complex were higher than those of the protein LA complex (Fig. 2). The unchanged ratio of the maximal negative ellipticity at 222 nm versus 208 nm in the mixture of the 8-kDa domain fragment and the fatty acids suggested no increase in helical structure in comparison with the 8-kDa domain fragment alone. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the fatty acids do not adversely affect the overall structure of the 8-kDa domain fragment. The NMR structures of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain have recently been determined by Wilson, Mullen, and their co-workers (19Liu D. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). According to their results, the 8-kDa domain (residues 1–87) is formed by four α-helices, packed as two antiparallel pairs. The pairs of α-helices cross one another at 50° giving them a V-like shape. The 8-kDa domain contains a motif termed the “helix-hairpin-helix.” The protein residues involved in template DNA binding have been identified by NMR using chemical shift changes (16Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The helix-3-hairpin-helix-4 motif and residues in an adjacent Ω-type loop connecting helix-1 and helix-2 form the ssDNA interaction surface (16Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they also found that several mutants of the 8-kDa domain (F25W, K35A, K60A, and K68A) showed impaired template DNA binding activity (14Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In a biochemical study, using the purified recombinant 8-kDa domain, photochemical cross-linking studies showed that residues Ser-30 and His-34 cross-linked to p(dT)16 (27Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studying the effects of fatty acid binding, the recombinant 8-kDa domain fragment was titrated with a 12.5 mm stock solution of LA or NA. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HMQC spectra were recorded for the 8-kDa domain-fatty acid complex at fatty acid concentrations of 0.3125, 0.625, 0.9375, 1.25, 1.5625, 1.875, 2.1875, and 2.5 mm. The complex is in fast exchange on the time scale of NMR, permitting us to follow the chemical shift changes of the backbone NH and 15N signals of the 8-kDa domain upon complex formation by recording a series of1H-15N HMQC spectra of uniformly15N-labeled 8-kDa domain in the presence of increasing amounts of fatty acids. Of the 79 amides in residues 5–86 of the 8-kDa domain, 75 amides were assigned in the fatty acid complex. The cross-peak for Leu-11 was sufficiently resolved during the titration to allow determination of the mole fraction of protein bound with fatty acids. The backbone amide of Leu-11 displays the longest chemical shift change upon complexation. The change in the chemical shift of the Leu-11 resonance is interpreted as resulting from the chemical shifts for the free (δF) and the bound forms (δB) of the Leu-11 resonance being averaged into a single resonance (δav) (i.e. (δF − δB)≪koff for the complex (28Raftery M.A. Dahlquist F.W. Chan S.I. Parsons S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4175-4180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Fitting of the titration curve for the amide proton resonance of Leu-11 indicated that the 8-kDa domain binds to LA or NA as a 1:1 complex with a KD of 1.02 or 2.64 mm, respectively (Fig. 3), indicating that the longer fatty acid could bind to the fragment more tightly. This probably explains why the minimum inhibitory dose of the longer chain fatty acid was much lower, although the biochemical mode of inhibition was the same. Since C16 or shorter fatty acids are expected to have higher KD values than the KD of the C18 fatty acid, this may also explain why the shorter chain fatty acids cannot inhibit polymerase activity. Fig. 4 A shows the1H-15N HMQC spectrum of the 8-kDa domain alone. Fig. 4 B shows the 1H-15N HMQC spectrum of the 8-kDa domain (blue contours) overlaid on that of the 1:1 mixture of the 8-kDa domain and NA (red contours). Similarly, Fig. 4 C depicts the superimposed spectra of the 1:1 mixture of the 8-kDa domain and NA (red contours) and the 1:1 mixture of the 8-kDa domain and LA (green contours). Chemical shift changes of ≥0.015 for1H and ≥0.1 for 15N were determined for Lys-5, Ala-6, Gln-8, Glu-9, Leu-11, Leu-22, Ala-23, Glu-26, Asn-28, Val-29, Ser-30, Ile-33, Lys-35, Asn-37, Tyr-39, His-51, Lys-52, Ile-73, Asp-74, Phe-76, Leu-77, Ala-78, Thr-79, Gly-80, Leu-82, and Lys-84 (Fig.5). The data in Fig. 5 indicate the NH chemical shift differences in the presence of 1.25 mm LA or NA along the amino acid sequence of the 8-kDa domain in Fig. 4. The shifted cross-peaks for LA were the same as those for NA, except Leu-11 and Thr-79, suggesting that the mode of binding to the domain does not change between LA and NA.Figure 4Expanded 1H-15N HMQC spectra of the 15N-labeled N-terminal 8-kDa domain-fatty acid complex.

NH chemical shift changes of 0.015–0.03 ppm and 15N chemical shift changes of 0.1–0.2 ppm (Lys-5, Leu-22, Ala-23, Asn-28, Asn-37, Tyr-39, Lys-52, Ile-73, Asp-74, Ala-78, Leu-82, and Lys-84) are shown in yellow. NH chemical shift changes of 0.03–0.06 ppm and15N chemical shift changes of 0.2–0.4 ppm (Ala-6, Gln-8, Glu-9, Glu-26, Val-29, Ser-30, Ile-33, Phe-76, Leu-77, and Gly-80) are shown in orange. NH chemical shift changes of more than 0.06 ppm and 15N chemical shift changes of more than 0.4 ppm (Leu-11, Lys-35, His-51, and Thr-79) are shown in red. These exposed residues showing significant changes were the same between LA and NA (Figs. 4 C and 5). In the presence of either LA or NA, the cross-peaks were shifted as follows: Lys-5, Ala-6, Gln-8, Glu-9, and Leu-11 were in the unstructured segment; Glu-26 was in helix-1, which is adjacent to the Ω-type loop; Asn-28, Val-29, Ser-30, Ile-33, and Lys-35 were in the Ω-type loop; Asn-37 and Tyr-39 were in helix-2, which is adjacent to the Ω-type loop; His-51 and Lys-52 were in a turn; Ile-73, Asp-74, Phe-76, Leu-77, and Ala-78 were in helix-4, which is adjacent to the 48–55 turn and 79–87 unstructured linker segment; Thr-79, Gly-80, Leu-82, and Lys-84 were in the unstructured linker segment that connects to the 31-kDa catalytic domain in the full-length enzyme. These chemical shift changes can be explained in terms of the fatty acid contact and perturbation in the electrostatic charge distribution at the surface. Surface residues displaying chemical shift changes were predominantly, although not entirely, clustered on one side of the domain (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the fatty acid-binding interface of the 8-kDa domain consists of two regions: one consisting of Leu-11 in the 1–13 unstructured segment, His-51 in the 45–55 turn, and Thr-79 in the 79–87 unstructured linker segment (“I” in Fig. 6 A), while the other consists of an Ω-type loop, including helix-1 and helix-2 (“II” in Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 B shows the mapping in the solution structure of the 8-kDa domain with ssDNA. The data determined by Wilson, Mullen, and their co-workers, the NMR structures (16Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Liu D. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the results of site-directed mutagenesis of the 8-kDa domain (14Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were used to illustrate the map. According to Prasad et al. (14Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the site-directed mutants of Phe-25, Lys-35, Lys-60, or Lys-68 were impaired template DNA binding activity. Since the fatty acids bind to the ssDNA-binding region of the 8-kDa domain and compete for binding with template DNA as shown in Fig. 1, two of the maps were compared. In Fig. 6 B, the residues (Gln-31, Asn-37, Arg-40, Lys-41, Ala-57, Glu-58, Lys-60, Gly-66, Lys-68, Glu-71, Lys-72, Glu-75, Ala-78, Leu-82, Arg-83, and Leu-85) of the p(dT)8 interaction interface from the HMQC NMR experiment (16Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are shown. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, the only site shifted not only by fatty acid binding, but by ssDNA (i.e. p(dT)8) binding was Lys-35 in the Ω-type loop including helix-1 and helix-2. The region II shown in Fig. 6 A appears to have an important role in the fatty acid effect. The fatty acids probably compete with template DNA at the residue Lys-35 and bind to the site, which subsequently inhibits the ssDNA binding activity on the 8-kDa domain. In the region I shown in Fig. 6 A, Leu-11, His-51, and Thr-79 are different from the other DNA binding sites (Phe-25, Lys-60, and Lys-68), suggesting that the methyl end of fatty acids disturb the binding of the template DNA at region I. Lys-35 in region II is a hydrophilic amino acid, and Leu-11 and His-51 in region I are hydrophobic amino acids. The carboxyl ends of the fatty acids may, therefore, show a preference for binding to the hydrophilic site, and the other side, the methyl end, may be absorbed to the hydrophobic site. We reported previously (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that longer chain fatty acids inhibited the binding activity more strongly and that C16or shorter fatty acids have no inhibitory effect. The distance between regions I and II may be a key to explain these characteristics of the inhibition by fatty acids. As shown in Figs. 3, 4 C, and 5, the shifted cross-peaks of Leu-11 and Thr-79 were significantly changed between LA and NA. The longer chain fatty acids (over C24) are expected to more tightly bind to these residues of amino acids in the 8-kDa domain. -To confirm the above assumption, we performed modeling analysis using the results of NMR experiments. The results of computer simulation of the binding mode between the N-terminal 8-kDa domain and the fatty acids are shown in Fig. 7. NA (yellow line) on the 8-kDa domain (blue-white line) in Fig. 7, A and B, was bridged from Lys-35 (red line) to Leu-11 (red line), His-51 (red line), and Thr-79 (red line) and intercalated smoothly into the pocket between helix-1 and helix-2 in the Ω-type loop. The distance between the Lys-35 hydrophilic region and Leu-11 and His-51 hydrophobic regions fit the length of U-shaped NA. On the other hand, LA (yellow line) was trapped more deeply in the pocket, although the LA binding model is basically the same as that of NA, and was further away from regions I and II than in the NA binding model (Fig. 7, C and D). The methyl end of LA may not be able to bind firmly to region I, and subsequently, a steeper U-shaped model was postulated for LA (Fig. 7, C and D). In this simulation, the fatty acid structures were modeled, but the 8-kDa domain structure was fixed. Although the residues shown by red lines seemed to be separated from the fatty acid structures (yellow lines) (Fig. 7), the fatty acid ends are thought to bind to the respective amino acid residues, and at least the Lys-35 binding area in the 8-kDa domain peptide must be strained. The unstructured segment of the 1–13 turn is comprised of the N-terminal residues and is flexible. The 79–87 turn, i.e. the unstructured linker segment, must also be structurally flexible. Therefore, when the fatty acids bound to the domain at His-51 and Lys-35, the N-terminal turn including Leu-11 and the unstructured linker segment including Thr-79 appear to be adjacent to His-51 in the 45–55 turn. The longer chain fatty acids, since they can more likely gain access to region I, can affect the tighter binding to region I. LA or shorter fatty acids are located at some distance from the site and may hardly induce the movement. We also reported previously that the saturated forms of fatty acids, for example C18-stearic acid, had no inhibitory effect on pol β, although then could suppress the activity of pol α (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The carbon chain in the saturated form fatty acid molecule is linear and does not form a U-shaped curve as seen in the unsaturated form fatty acids such as LA and NA. The linear chain may not be able to intercalate between helix-1 and helix-2 in the Ω-type loop and thus cannot inhibit pol β activity. In conclusion, the lack of an effect of shorter chain fatty acids, the positive relationship between longer carbon chain length and tighter binding, and the configuration effectiveness on pol β can be explained by our model. The inhibitory effects of fatty acids on DNA polymerase activity occur by binding between the 8-kDa domain and the fatty acid as a 1:1 complex, and this binding can be released by nonionic detergents (2Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M. Matsukage A. Yoshida S. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,3Mizushina Y. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sakaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The fatty acids are present on the internal surface of the cytoplasmic membranes. These observations suggest that the inhibitory effect of fatty acids on DNA polymerase activity occurs in vivo and is reversibly controlled by binding to or release of the DNA polymerase from the fatty acids, perhaps on the membranes. These observations may help in determining the mechanisms of control of these enzymes in vivo. We are grateful to Dr. A.

To elucidate the role of the Walker motif A of RuvB (G X GKT; X indicates a nonconserved residue) in ATP hydrolysis and branch migration activities, we constructed four ruvB mutant genes by site-directed mutagenesis, altering the highly conserved Lys68 and Thr69. K68R, K68A, and T69A mutants except T69S failed to complement UV-sensitive phenotype of the ruvB strain. These three mutant proteins, when overexpressed, made the wild-type strain UV-sensitive to varying degrees. K68R, K68A, and T69A were defective in ATP hydrolysis and branch migration activities in vitro. In the presence of Mg2+, K68R showed markedly reduced affinity for ATP, while K68A and T69A showed only mild reduction. K68A and T69A could form hexamers in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, while K68R failed to form hexamers and existed instead as a higher oligomer, probably a dodecamer. In contrast to wild-type RuvB, K68R, K68A, and T69A by themselves were defective in DNA binding. However, RuvA could facilitate binding of K68A and T69A to DNA, whereas it could not promote binding of K68R to DNA. All of the three mutant RuvBs could physically interact with RuvA. These results indicate the direct involvement in ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis of the invariant Lys68 and Thr69 residues of Walker motif A of RuvB and suggest that these residues play key roles in interrelating these activities with the conformational change of RuvB, which is required for the branch migration activity.

These results indicate the direct involvement in ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis of the invariant Lys68 and Thr69 residues of Walker motif A of RuvB and suggest that these residues play key roles in interrelating these activities with the conformational change of RuvB, which is required for the branch migration activity. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Homologous DNA recombination involves multistep reactions that require many gene products.

In the former structure, the four-way junction DNA was bound by a RuvA tetramer on one face, while in the latter, the junction DNA was sandwiched between two tetramers. It has not been determined which form of the RuvA-junction DNA complex represents the active form in vivo. The RuvA-RuvB complex catalyzes branch migration of Holliday junctions using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (13Tsaneva I.R. Illing G. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RuvB is a helicase that catalyzes unwinding of DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction with respect to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (15Tsaneva I.R. Müller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RuvB forms a hexameric ring structure in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP and binds DNA through the central holes of the ring (16Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, under the conditions of low Mg2+ and/or low RuvB concentration, RuvB forms a stable dimer (18Shiba T. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that the dimer is the basic unit of RuvB in forming the hexamer. Thus, RuvB changes its tertiary and quaternary structures by allosteric interactions with various effectors such as Mg2+, ATP, RuvA, and DNA.DNA helicases catalyze the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to produce ssDNA using energy derived from nucleotide 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis (19Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). These enzymes play essential roles in a variety of processes in DNA metabolism, such as replication, recombination, repair, and transcription (20Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A large number of helicases have been identified, and comparison of their amino acid sequences has revealed the presence of seven conserved sequence motifs in the majority of them (21Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), suggesting that many helicases share structural similarities.Motifs I and II of the helicases correspond to the Walker A and B motifs (22Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar), respectively, found in numerous NTP-binding proteins. The crystal structures of adenylate kinase (23Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Ras (24Milburn M.V.

Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), and F1-ATPase (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), for example, show that motif I binds the diphosphate or triphosphate moiety of nucleotides and that motif II is involved in binding nucleotides via Mg2+. Like all helicases so far characterized, the RuvB family of helicases shares the consensus amino acid sequences for Walker motif A (G X GKT) and B (DE X H) (where X indicates a nonconserved amino acid residue), while the other five common motifs are not clearly identifiable in RuvB. However, from a study of structure-based sequence alignments, the protein architectures of RuvB family helicases are suggested to be closely related to those of the clamp-loader proteins, such as the γ subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III and human RF-C proteins, all of which are involved in the loading of clamp proteins to achieve high processivities of replicative DNA polymerases (27Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that RuvB, although it is an intrinsic DNA helicase, has a type of protein folding and mechanism of DNA unwinding distinct from those of other typical DE XX DNA/RNA helicase family proteins. Therefore, we use Walker motifs A and B, rather than helicase motifs I and II, throughout this report to designate for the RuvB motifs.In this study, we constructed four ruvB mutant genes with substitutions in the highly conserved amino acids Lys68 and Thr69 in Walker motif A by site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrated that these point mutations affected not only the RuvB activities of ATP hydrolysis and ATP binding, but also those of DNA binding, hexamer formation, and promotion of branch migration. The results suggest that amino acid residues directly involved in binding and hydrolysis of ATP play additional roles in interrelating other functions of RuvB.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we studied the roles of the conserved residues in the Walker motif A of RuvB in the ATPase and branch migration activities by constructing mutants. One of these, T69S, could fully complement the UV-sensitive phenotype of the ruvB strain, while others, K68R, K68A, and T69A, failed to complement. Overexpression of K68R, K68A, and T69A made the wild-type strain UV sensitive to similar degrees. However, at a lower level of expression, the K68R made the wild-type strain less UV-sensitive than the other two mutants. This may be due to the defective binding of K68R to DNA even in the presence of RuvA, which may make the mutant RuvB-RuvA complex less competitive than the wild type RuvB-RuvA complex for the junction loading.The three mutant proteins showed markedly reduced ATPase activity in vitro. RuvA and supercoiled DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of wild-type RuvB, but had no stimulating effect on the low, intrinsic ATPase activities of these three mutant proteins. The kcat values of K68R, K68A, T69A, and wild-type RuvB for ATPase in the presence of RuvA and DNA were 0.11, 0.16, 0.6, and 30.2 min−1, respectively. Thus, the mutations in Walker motif A of RuvB virtually eliminated the fundamental ability to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 4), as has been shown for many other ATPases (38Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 39Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40George J.W. Brosh R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that the mutations in Walker motif A affected the affinity of RuvB for ATP (Fig. 6). In the absence of Mg2+, K68R and K68A had reduced ability to bind ATP. Mg2+stimulated the ATP binding ability of wild-type RuvB (2.5-fold decrease in Kd), while it greatly reduced the ATP binding ability of K68R, compared with that of wild-type RuvB (66-fold increase in Kd). Meanwhile, the Kd of K68A was unaffected by the addition of Mg2+. These results suggest that Lys 68 in RuvB plays a key role in the interaction with ATP. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the RecA-ADP complex and F1-ATPase indicate that the corresponding lysine residues in the P-loop directly interact with the β and γ phosphates of ATP (25Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The reduced ATP binding of K68A may be due to the loss of positive charge required for the direct interaction with the β and γ phosphates of ATP resulting from the substitution of lysine by alanine. K68R not only exhibited reduced ATP binding activity, similarly to K68A, in the absence of Mg2+, but it also showed a further reduction in ATP binding activity in the presence of Mg2+. This was surprising because the positive charge of the side chain was maintained. To account for this result, we speculate that some change in tertiary structure is caused by the substitution of lysine with arginine such that the bulky side chain of arginine sterically hinders the ATP binding, and this hindrance may be further enhanced by a Mg2+-coordinated conformational change around the ATP-binding site of RuvB. Indeed, gel filtration analysis revealed that K68R formed higher oligomeric states (hexamers and dodecamers) under all conditions we studied, unlike the wild-type RuvB. T69A had the same ability to bind ATP as wild-type RuvB in the absence of Mg2+, consistent with the x-ray crystallographic studies of the RecA-ADP complex and F1-ATPase, which revealed that the threonine residue of Walker motif A (G X GKT) interacted with a magnesium ion that bridges the β and γ phosphates of ATP. However, T69A had reduced ability to bind ATP in the presence of Mg2+ (5.5-fold increase in Kd). Gel filtration analysis revealed that T69A was able to undergo conformational change in response to Mg2+ (Fig.9 B), indicating that T69A can bind to Mg2+ even without the Thr69 residue. These results suggest that coordination of Mg2+ not mediated by Thr69induces a conformational change that affects the topology around the P-loop. Thus, these equilibrium ATP binding experiments strongly suggest the roles for the lysine and threonine residues of the Walker A sequence of RuvB in ATP binding, which is in good agreement with the x-ray crystallographic data of the Walker A regions in other proteins such as adenylate kinase (23Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Ras (24Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), RecA (25Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and F1-ATPase (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar).Protein-DNA cross-linking assays revealed that K68R, K68A, and T69A were defective in DNA binding in the presence of ATPγS. Similar substitutions in the hexameric helicase T7 gene 4 protein (39Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also caused defective DNA binding in the presence of dTMP-PCP. However, RuvA could facilitate the loading of K68A and T69A onto DNA. As an explanation for the DNA binding defects of K68A and T69A by themselves, these mutant proteins may not bind ATPγS or may be defective in the conformational change induced by the ATPγS, which is necessary for the DNA binding of wild-type RuvB. RuvA may restore these defects of K68A and T69A. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that RuvA reduced the Km of the RuvB ATPase and enhanced the intimate and continuous contact of RuvB with DNA (36Marrione P.E. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11228-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic and gel filtration studies have shown that RuvB forms a hexameric ring structure as an active form of RuvB that assembles in solution in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. In this study, gel filtration analysis revealed that K68A and T69A as well as wild-type RuvB could form hexamers in the presence of Mg2+and ATP and could form complexes with RuvA. These results suggest that these two mutants are capable of undergoing the nucleotide-induced conformational change in the presence of saturating amounts of ATP.On the other hand, K68R could not bind DNA even in the presence of RuvA, although K68R could form a complex with RuvA (Fig.7 B). Recently, Mezard et al. (41Mézard C. Davies A.A. Stasiac A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed D113N, with a substitution in Walker motif B, was defective in DNA binding both in the presence and absence of RuvA. D113N was also formed hexamers or dodecamers even in the absence of Mg2+ at higher RuvB concentrations (41Mézard C. Davies A.A. Stasiac A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). K68R, like D113N, formed higher oligomeric states, such as hexamers and dodecamers, under all conditions we studied. Thus, K68R protein may self-aggregate to form hexameric or dodecameric rings in the absence of DNA, which prevents loading onto DNA. These results suggest that the change in oligomeric states induced by nucleotide binding is important for the assembly of RuvB onto DNA.Although the ATPase activity of RuvB is required for the branch migration activity, the mechanisms by which RuvB protein transmits the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into the movement necessary for the branch migration are still unclear. It is likely that a conformational change caused by the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis must be coupled to DNA unwinding and translocation. Indeed, nucleotide-induced conformational changes have been reported for several helicases such as E. coli DnaB, Rep, and bacteriophage T7 gene 4 proteins (42Nakayama N. Arai N. Kaziro Y. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 88-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yong Y. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24509-24517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that all of the substitution mutations in the conserved lysine and threonine residues in Walker motif A, except T69S, not only affect the ATP binding affinity and inactivate the ATPase activity, but also affect the DNA binding. In addition, K68R affected the oligomer formation. These results suggest that these residues may play key roles in interconnecting ATP binding and ATPase activities with DNA binding and oligomerization through nucleotide-induced conformational changes, all of which are required for the branch migration activity. Homologous DNA recombination involves multistep reactions that require many gene products. Much of our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in recombination has been derived from studies of Escherichia coli (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M.

RuvA and supercoiled DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of wild-type RuvB, but had no stimulating effect on the low, intrinsic ATPase activities of these three mutant proteins. The kcat values of K68R, K68A, T69A, and wild-type RuvB for ATPase in the presence of RuvA and DNA were 0.11, 0.16, 0.6, and 30.2 min−1, respectively. Thus, the mutations in Walker motif A of RuvB virtually eliminated the fundamental ability to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 4), as has been shown for many other ATPases (38Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 39Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40George J.W. Brosh R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that the mutations in Walker motif A affected the affinity of RuvB for ATP (Fig. 6). In the absence of Mg2+, K68R and K68A had reduced ability to bind ATP. Mg2+stimulated the ATP binding ability of wild-type RuvB (2.5-fold decrease in Kd), while it greatly reduced the ATP binding ability of K68R, compared with that of wild-type RuvB (66-fold increase in Kd). Meanwhile, the Kd of K68A was unaffected by the addition of Mg2+. These results suggest that Lys 68 in RuvB plays a key role in the interaction with ATP. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the RecA-ADP complex and F1-ATPase indicate that the corresponding lysine residues in the P-loop directly interact with the β and γ phosphates of ATP (25Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The reduced ATP binding of K68A may be due to the loss of positive charge required for the direct interaction with the β and γ phosphates of ATP resulting from the substitution of lysine by alanine. K68R not only exhibited reduced ATP binding activity, similarly to K68A, in the absence of Mg2+, but it also showed a further reduction in ATP binding activity in the presence of Mg2+. This was surprising because the positive charge of the side chain was maintained. To account for this result, we speculate that some change in tertiary structure is caused by the substitution of lysine with arginine such that the bulky side chain of arginine sterically hinders the ATP binding, and this hindrance may be further enhanced by a Mg2+-coordinated conformational change around the ATP-binding site of RuvB. Indeed, gel filtration analysis revealed that K68R formed higher oligomeric states (hexamers and dodecamers) under all conditions we studied, unlike the wild-type RuvB. T69A had the same ability to bind ATP as wild-type RuvB in the absence of Mg2+, consistent with the x-ray crystallographic studies of the RecA-ADP complex and F1-ATPase, which revealed that the threonine residue of Walker motif A (G X GKT) interacted with a magnesium ion that bridges the β and γ phosphates of ATP. However, T69A had reduced ability to bind ATP in the presence of Mg2+ (5.5-fold increase in Kd). Gel filtration analysis revealed that T69A was able to undergo conformational change in response to Mg2+ (Fig.9 B), indicating that T69A can bind to Mg2+ even without the Thr69 residue. These results suggest that coordination of Mg2+ not mediated by Thr69induces a conformational change that affects the topology around the P-loop. Thus, these equilibrium ATP binding experiments strongly suggest the roles for the lysine and threonine residues of the Walker A sequence of RuvB in ATP binding, which is in good agreement with the x-ray crystallographic data of the Walker A regions in other proteins such as adenylate kinase (23Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Ras (24Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S.

Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and F1-ATPase (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar).Protein-DNA cross-linking assays revealed that K68R, K68A, and T69A were defective in DNA binding in the presence of ATPγS. Similar substitutions in the hexameric helicase T7 gene 4 protein (39Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also caused defective DNA binding in the presence of dTMP-PCP. However, RuvA could facilitate the loading of K68A and T69A onto DNA. As an explanation for the DNA binding defects of K68A and T69A by themselves, these mutant proteins may not bind ATPγS or may be defective in the conformational change induced by the ATPγS, which is necessary for the DNA binding of wild-type RuvB. RuvA may restore these defects of K68A and T69A. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that RuvA reduced the Km of the RuvB ATPase and enhanced the intimate and continuous contact of RuvB with DNA (36Marrione P.E. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11228-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic and gel filtration studies have shown that RuvB forms a hexameric ring structure as an active form of RuvB that assembles in solution in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. In this study, gel filtration analysis revealed that K68A and T69A as well as wild-type RuvB could form hexamers in the presence of Mg2+and ATP and could form complexes with RuvA. These results suggest that these two mutants are capable of undergoing the nucleotide-induced conformational change in the presence of saturating amounts of ATP.On the other hand, K68R could not bind DNA even in the presence of RuvA, although K68R could form a complex with RuvA (Fig.7 B). Recently, Mezard et al. (41Mézard C. Davies A.A. Stasiac A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed D113N, with a substitution in Walker motif B, was defective in DNA binding both in the presence and absence of RuvA. D113N was also formed hexamers or dodecamers even in the absence of Mg2+ at higher RuvB concentrations (41Mézard C. Davies A.A. Stasiac A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). K68R, like D113N, formed higher oligomeric states, such as hexamers and dodecamers, under all conditions we studied. Thus, K68R protein may self-aggregate to form hexameric or dodecameric rings in the absence of DNA, which prevents loading onto DNA. These results suggest that the change in oligomeric states induced by nucleotide binding is important for the assembly of RuvB onto DNA.Although the ATPase activity of RuvB is required for the branch migration activity, the mechanisms by which RuvB protein transmits the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into the movement necessary for the branch migration are still unclear. It is likely that a conformational change caused by the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis must be coupled to DNA unwinding and translocation. Indeed, nucleotide-induced conformational changes have been reported for several helicases such as E. coli DnaB, Rep, and bacteriophage T7 gene 4 proteins (42Nakayama N. Arai N. Kaziro Y. Arai K. J.

In this study, we have shown that all of the substitution mutations in the conserved lysine and threonine residues in Walker motif A, except T69S, not only affect the ATP binding affinity and inactivate the ATPase activity, but also affect the DNA binding. In addition, K68R affected the oligomer formation. These results suggest that these residues may play key roles in interconnecting ATP binding and ATPase activities with DNA binding and oligomerization through nucleotide-induced conformational changes, all of which are required for the branch migration activity. In this work, we studied the roles of the conserved residues in the Walker motif A of RuvB in the ATPase and branch migration activities by constructing mutants. One of these, T69S, could fully complement the UV-sensitive phenotype of the ruvB strain, while others, K68R, K68A, and T69A, failed to complement. Overexpression of K68R, K68A, and T69A made the wild-type strain UV sensitive to similar degrees. However, at a lower level of expression, the K68R made the wild-type strain less UV-sensitive than the other two mutants. This may be due to the defective binding of K68R to DNA even in the presence of RuvA, which may make the mutant RuvB-RuvA complex less competitive than the wild type RuvB-RuvA complex for the junction loading.

Glucose-stimulated increase in cytosolic ATP or in the ratio of ATP to ADP closes ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP)1 channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane potential above a threshold, leading to Ca2+ entry into the cytosol through activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs). The rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) is thought to finally trigger exocytosis of insulin from secretory vesicles. It has been known that pyruvate, an end product of aerobic glycolysis, cannot stimulate insulin secretion although it is oxidized as efficiently as glucose in β cells (14Sener A. Kawazu S.

These results suggested that glycolysis-derived factor(s) other than pyruvate are required for activation of mitochondrial metabolism and for generation of the metabolic signals such as ATP. NADH, which is generated at a step catalyzed by a glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, is one such candidate. This is because the electrons of the cytosolic NADH are transferred into the mitochondrial electron transfer chain directly through the NADH shuttle system and enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential.

These results demonstrated that the NADH shuttle system is essential for coupling glycolysis with mitochondrial ATP generation to trigger glucose-induced insulin secretion. However, the mechanism by which deprivation of cellular ATP led to the downstream events that culminated in abrogation of insulin secretion was not addressed in the previous study. Under the conditions where the NADH shuttle system was stopped, the change in [Ca2+]c in response to glucose was significantly impaired. An initial drop below a base line and the first phase peak of [Ca2+]c failed to occur, although it was followed by a gradual elevation of [Ca2+]c to the second phase plateau level in 10 to 15 min (20Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T.

These results suggested that Ca2+ uptake of endoplasmic reticulum by Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+ influx through VDCCs from the extracellular compartment were severely impaired (24Wolf B.A. Colca J.R.

In β cells, the activity of VDCCs is controlled by the plasma membrane potential, which in turn is mainly regulated by the activity of the KATP channel (27Atwater I. Ribalet B. Rojas E. J. Physiol. 1978; 278: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 29Ashcroft F.M. Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that glucose metabolism without the functional NADH shuttle system was not sufficient to close the KATP channel due to inefficient generation of ATP and to elicit depolarization of the plasma membrane and generation of action potentials. Moreover, steps distal to an elevation of [Ca2+]c are also energy-requiring (30Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C.

These steps including mobilization of secretory granules toward the plasma membrane, priming of the granules, and a final fusion process may also have been affected. In this article, using electrophysiological techniques we provide evidence that glucose metabolism through the NADH shuttle system is essential to regulate the KATP channel-dependent pathway in glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, with diazoxide and a depolarizing concentration of KCl we show that steps distal to an elevation of [Ca2+]c are also regulated by glucose metabolism through the system. Isolation of islets from mGPDH-deficient mice (20Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H.

Transplantation. 1986; 42: 689-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In brief, after clamping the common bile duct at a point close to the duodenum outlet, 2.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (118.4 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.0 mmCaCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) containing collagenase (Sigma) was injected into the duct. The swollen pancreas was taken out and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The pancreas was dispersed by pipetting and washed two times with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. Islets were collected by manual picking and incubated in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Isolation of single β cells was performed using 1000 units/ml dispase (Godo Shusei, Japan), as described previously (35Misler S. Falke L.C. Gillis K. McDaniel L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7119-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion from islets was measured with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with a basal glucose concentration of 2.8 mm unless otherwise stated. Batch incubation was performed with 10 islets/tube at 37 °C for 1 h after preincubation with the basal glucose concentration for 20 min. Perifusion experiments were performed with 30 islets/chamber at 37 °C with a flow rate of 0.6 ml. AOA, when used, was added to both preincubation and incubation medium. AOA and diazoxide were purchased from Sigma. A single islet was placed under a microscope (IMT-2, Olympus, Japan) and perifused with Sol II buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Fluorescence was excited with light emitted from a xenon lamp (TILL Photonics, Germany), collected through interference filters (Olympus, Japan), and detected using a photomultiplier (NT5783, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Islets were loaded with 15 μmfura-2/acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 1 h. The fluorescence was excited with a dual-wavelength ratiometric mode at 340 and 380 nm. The emission wavelength was filtered at 500 nm. Dispersed islet cells were kept in a 35-mm Petri dish on an inverted microscope. Identification of β cells from other islet cells was carried out by detecting the excitatory electrical response of the cells to 15 mm glucose or to 0.5 mm tolbutamide. The patch clamp method was used to record membrane currents and membrane potential with an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (List Electronic, Germany) (36Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar, 37Suga S. Kanno T. Nakano K. Takeo T. Dobashi Y. Wakui M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resistance of electrodes made of borosillicate glass capillaries was 2–4 megaohms. For recording the plasma membrane potential, the nystatin-perforated whole-cell configuration was used (38Levitan E.S. Kramer R.H. Nature. 1990; 348: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Sala S. Parsey R.V. Cohen A.S. Matteson D.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For recording the whole-cell membrane currents, the conventional whole-cell mode was used. The membrane capacitance ranged from 12 to 20 picofarads. The membrane potential was repeatedly changed from −90 to −50 mV by ramp pulses with a ramp pulse generator (SET-2100, Nihon Kohden, Japan). Both the rising and falling time of each ramp pulse was 2 s in duration. In the inside-out mode, single channel currents were recorded. The data were analyzed by using a single channel current analysis program (QP-129J, Nihon Kohden). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The standard extracellular solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). When the cells were stimulated with glucose, sucrose was added to the control solution to adjust the osmolarity. In the nystatin-perforation recordings, the pipette solution contained 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma), and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). In the conventional whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution contained 100 mm potassium gluconate, 35 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm GTP, 2 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). In single channel recordings, both pipette (external) and internal solutions contained 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (Sigma), 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH was 7.3 in the external solution and 7.2 in the internal solution. Cells in the bath were superfused with a stream of an extracellular solution. Drugs were dissolved in the extracellular solution and applied to cells by switching flow tubes. Ten islets were incubated with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 2.8, 10.0, or 16.7 mm glucose at 37 °C for 1 h. After aspiration of medium, the metabolism was snap-stopped by an addition of ice-cold 1n perchloric acid and freezing with liquid nitrogen. Then, samples were thawed, sonicated, and neutralized with NaOH (40Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ATP content was measured using a luciferase-luciferin system (Sigma). Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated with the Student's t test or by analysis of variance. In static incubation for 1 h, the increase in insulin secretion stimulated by 16.7 mm glucose was inhibited by 94% in mGPDH-deficient mice islets treated with 5 mm AOA (0.11 ± 0.03 ng/islet/h) compared with wild-type islets without AOA (1.83 ± 0.19 ng/islet/h). Perifusion experiments revealed that the first phase of the secretion was severely decreased and the second phase was totally abrogated (Fig.1 A, closed squares) compared with wild-type islets without AOA (Fig. 1A, closed circles). The inhibitory effect of AOA on glucose-induced insulin secretion from mGPDH-deficient islets was dose-dependent, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of AOA was ∼1 mm at 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 1 B). As previously reported (20Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), an initial small drop and the first phase peak of [Ca2+]c, which were normally observed in wild-type islets without AOA in response to 22.2 mm glucose (Fig. 1 C, left panel), disappeared when 5 mm AOA was applied to mGPDH-deficient islets (Fig.1 C, right panel). However, [Ca2+]c gradually rose in 10 to 15 min to the second phase plateau level, which was comparable to that of wild-type islets without AOA. At 1 mm AOA, the initial drop and the subsequent first phase peak of [Ca2+]c remained missing, whereas the second phase plateau was reached in 6 to 8 min (data not shown). These results suggested that both the appearance of the first phase peak of [Ca2+]c and the time required to raise [Ca2+]c to the second phase level were dependent on glucose metabolism through the NADH shuttle system and that loss of function of the shuttle system impaired Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. Stimulation by 15 mm glucose instead of 16.7 or 22.2 mm glucose produced essentially similar results to the above experiments. We next directly measured the plasma membrane potential of β cells with patch clamp techniques. Under the nystatin-perforated whole-cell mode, the resting membrane potentials in the presence of 2 mm glucose were −58.4 ± 1.3 mV (n = 24) in wild-type β cells, −61.5 ± 1.6 mV (n = 24) in wild-type β cells with 5 mm AOA, −61.3 ± 1.9 mV (n = 23) in mGPDH-deficient β cells, and −62.5 ± 1.7 mV (n = 22) in mGPDH-deficient β cells with 5 mm AOA. There were no significant differences among the four groups. In wild-type β cells treated with 5 mm AOA, stimulation by 15 mm glucose normally depolarized the plasma membrane potential to ∼50 mV in 70–90 s, where action potentials were generated (Fig.2 A). These normal responses were also observed in mGPDH-deficient β cells without AOA (Fig.2 B). However, in mGPDH-deficient β cells treated with 5 mm AOA, the membrane potential was only minimally depolarized in response to 15 mm glucose and failed to reach the threshold and to generate action potentials within the measurement period of 4 min (Fig. 2 C). Application of 0.5 mm tolbutamide to extracellular solution caused the depolarization of the plasma membrane and generated action potentials even in mGPDH-deficient β cells treated with AOA (Fig.2 D). This suggested that sensitivity of the KATPchannel to sulfonylurea was preserved under these conditions. Because the second phase plateau of [Ca2+]c was attained within 10 to 15 min after glucose stimulation in mGPDH-deficient islets treated with 5 mm AOA (Fig.1 C, right panel), we presumed that the membrane potential of β cells might take longer to reach the threshold. The measurement period was then extended to 15 min. Under these conditions, membrane depolarization and generation of action potentials were observed in 2 of 6 experiments; one at 6 min (Fig. 2 E), and the other at 7 min after the glucose stimulation. Thus, small number of mGPDH-deficient β cells treated with AOA retained electrical excitability to glucose stimulation, although the initiation of the response was markedly delayed. We then studied the KATPchannel current in response to glucose in a conventional whole-cell mode. Ramp voltage pulses from −90 mV to −50 mV were given every 4 s. In mGPDH-deficient β cells, the KATP channel current in response to the 40-mV voltage pulse was decreased from ∼40 to ∼15 pA by elevation of the extracellular glucose concentration from 2 to 15 mm (Fig.3 A, upper panel). At several time points during the trace, the mode of recording was transiently changed to a current clamp mode, where a stepwise depolarization of the membrane potential culminating in the generation of action potentials was clearly observed (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). However, in mGPDH-deficient β cells treated with 5 mm AOA, no decrease in the KATP channel current (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) or depolarization of the membrane potential (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) in response to 15 mm glucose was observed. In contrast, application of 0.5 mm tolbutamide to the cells reversibly abolished the KATP channel current (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). We then performed electrophysiological analyses of the KATP channel itself in an inside-out patch of the plasma membrane excised from β cells. At a recording voltage of −60 mV, the amplitude of the KATPchannel current in mGPDH-deficient β cells was the same as in wild-type β cells (Fig. 4 A). When the KATP channel currents were plotted against the recording voltage from −60 mV to 60 mV at an interval of 10 mV, the current-voltage relationship of mGPDH-deficient β cells essentially overlapped that of wild-type β cells, which show a weak inward rectification (Fig. 4 B). The single KATP channel conductance of mGPDH-deficient β cells measured between −60 mV and 0 mV was 73.1 ± 3.8 picosiemens (n = 4) and was not different from that of wild-type β cells (72.7 ± 3.3 picosiemens, n = 4). We next studied the effect of ATP on the KATP channel activity in the inside-out mode with the recording voltage at −60 mV. When 1 mm ATP was applied to the cytoplasmic surface of mGPDH-deficient β cell plasma membranes, the KATP channel current was immediately and completely abolished (Fig. 5 A). The channel open probabilities at 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm ATP in mGPDH-deficient β cells were not different from those in wild-type β cells (Fig. 5 B). These values were well in accordance with the theoretical values calculated with the Hill equation (41Gribble F. Tucker S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the electrophysiological characteristics of the KATP channel and its sensitivity to ATP per se were normal in mGPDH-deficient β cells. When both the NADH shuttles were stopped by treating mGPDH-deficient β cells with 5 mmAOA, the first phase peak of [Ca2+]c in response to glucose disappeared (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Moreover, it took 10 to 15 min for [Ca2+]c to reach the second phase plateau. These findings indicated an impairment of Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane during this period. We then postulated that a restoration of Ca2+influx could recover insulin secretion. To test this, islets were treated with diazoxide, a KATP channel opener, to hold the KATP channel open in combination with a high concentration of KCl to depolarize the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, it has been shown that glucose does not further elevate [Ca2+]c but amplifies the actions of Ca2+ on the insulin-secreting processes (31Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 32Sato Y. Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Okada N. Yamada T.

Physiol. 1994; 266: C622-C627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With application of 30 mm KCl in the presence of 250 μm diazoxide, the insulin secretory response to glucose was indeed restored in mGPDH-deficient islets treated with 5 mm AOA (Fig. 6, A–C, closed squares). The amounts of secreted insulin were increased by elevating glucose concentration from 2.8 to 10.0 mm and to 16.7 mm. Insulin released by this treatment was, however, still ∼60% lower than that observed in wild-type islets treated with 250 μm diazoxide and 30 mm KCl in the absence of AOA at each concentration of glucose (Fig. 6, A-C, closed circles). To evaluate glucose metabolism leading to ATP generation in islets, we measured the ATP content of islets after glucose stimulation for 1 h in the presence of 250 μm diazoxide and 30 mm KCl. At 2.8 mm glucose, the ATP content of mGPDH-deficient islets treated with 5 mm AOA was 10.5 ± 0.3 pmol/islet, which was not different from that of wild-type islets (10.1 ± 0.7 pmol/islet). However, the ATP contents of mGPDH-deficient islets treated with AOA were significantly less than those of wild-type islets at both 10.0 mm glucose (11.2 ± 0.2 versus 13.1 ± 0.6 pmol/islet, respectively, p < 0.01) and 16.7 mmglucose (12.0 ± 0.4 versus 15.4 ± 0.05 pmol/islet, respectively, p < 0.01) (Fig.7). These results indicated that efficient ATP generation by glucose metabolism through the NADH shuttles was important in the steps distal to elevation of [Ca2+]c in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The ATP contents in wild-type islets incubated with diazoxide and KCl were comparable to those in wild-type islets incubated without diazoxide or KCl at 2.8, 10.0, and 16.7 mm glucose (data not shown). This study is the first to provide direct evidence that the NADH shuttle system plays an essential role in regulating both the KATP channel-dependent pathway and steps distal to Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The KATP channels are a weak inward rectifier that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues including pancreatic β cells, cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain, and serve to couple cellular metabolic state to electrical excitability (44Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In β cells, the KATP channels are composed of the inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir) 6.2 (45Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar) and the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1, a member of the superfamily of ATP binding cassette proteins (46Aguilar-Bryan L.

Kir6.2 acts as the ATP-sensitive pore-forming subunit of the KATP channel complex (47Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C. J. Gen.

Activation of murine macrophages by cytokines increases MRP expression, but infection with Leishmania promastigotes during activation results in MRP depletion. We therefore examined the effect of Leishmania major LV39 on recombinant MRP. Both live promastigotes and a soluble fraction of LV39 lysates degraded MRP to yield lower molecular weight fragments. Degradation was independent of MRP myristoylation and was inhibited by protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of MRP. MRP was similarly degraded by purified leishmanolysin (gp63), a Leishmania surface metalloprotease. Degradation was evident at low enzyme/substrate ratios, over a broad pH range, and was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline and by a hydroxamate dipeptide inhibitor of leishmanolysin. Using mass spectrometric analysis, cleavage was shown to occur within the effector domain of MRP between Ser92 and Phe93, in accordance with the substrate specificity of leishmanolysin. Moreover, an MRP construct in which the effector domain had been deleted was resistant to cleavage. Thus, Leishmania infection may result in leishmanolysin-dependent hydrolysis of MRP, a major protein kinase C substrate in macrophages."

Mitogenic response of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on VSMC is thought to be mediated by induction of endogenous platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), especially PDGF-AA. Although the action of PDGF-AA is mediated by its specific receptor, PDGFα-receptor (PDGFαR), very little is known about the regulatory mechanism of PDGFαR gene expression in VSMC. To understand the mechanism, we studied the transcriptional control of the PDGFαR gene in VSMC after treatment with IL-1β. IL-1β (10 ng/ml) drastically increased both PDGFαR and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) mRNA levels in a time dependent manner. A rapid induction of C/EBPδ mRNA within 30 min was followed by slower emergence of PDGFαR mRNA, which reached the maximum level in 12 h, whereas C/EBPδ mRNA was detectable at 30 min and reached the maximum level at 3 h. Electromobility shift and supershift assays revealed that IL-1β markedly increased DNA-protein complex, which was mainly composed of C/EBPβ and/or -δ. Both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that either C/EBPβ or -δ expression was induced by IL-1β exclusively in nuclei of VSMC. On the other hand, overexpression of C/EBPδ specifically transactivated the promoter activity of the PDGFαR gene and significantly enhanced VSMC proliferation in PDGF-treated cells. We conclude that induction of PDGFαR expression is mainly mediated by C/EBPδ expression in VSMC, and a high level of C/EBPδ expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis.

Res. 1989; 181: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mitogenic activity of IL-1β for fibroblasts and VSMC is mediated indirectly via an autocrine loop by causing the release of PDGF-AA, which then specifically binds to the PDGF α-receptor (PDGFαR) subtype on cell surface. Furthermore, recent studies (15Bonner J.C. Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Moomaw C.R. Morgan D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L72-L80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lindroos P.M. Coin P.G. Badgett A. Morgan D.L. Bonner J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 16: 283-292Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that IL-1β can up-regulate PDGFαR expression in rat lung fibroblasts, thereby enhancing PDGF-mediated mitogenesis and chemotaxis of lung fibroblasts. Although the pathophysiological implications of IL-1β-induced PDGFαR expression are beginning to be recognized, little is known about the molecular mechanism involved. Therefore, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of PDGFαR gene transcription in VSMC and obtained results indicating that IL-1β induces PDGFαR gene expression via a trans-acting nuclear factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ). Actinomycin D and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma, and recombinant mouse IL-1β was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Tokyo, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (220 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies for PDGFαR and C/EBPα, -β, and -δ raised against peptidic epitopes corresponding to amino acid residues of human PDGFαR (residues 951–1,089), rat C/EBPα (residues 253–265), rat C/EBPβ (residues 258–276), and rat C/EBPδ (residues 247–268) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Expression vectors of C/EBPα, -β, and -δ (designated EBPα, -β, and -δ, respectively) were generous gifts of Dr. Steven L. McKnight. VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Japan Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), weighing 280–320 g, by the method described previously (17Inui H. Kitami Y. Kondo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17045-17050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 per dish and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. VSMC were passaged every 4–7 days, and experiments were performed on cells at 3–10 passages from primary culture. In preparation for experiments, confluent cells, which exhibited a typical hill and valley pattern of smooth muscle cells in culture, were made quiescent by placing them in a defined serum-free medium containing insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), and sodium selenite (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. This medium has been shown to maintain VSMC in a quiescent and noncatabolic state for an extended period of time (18Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kilobase pair fragment of rat PDGFαR cDNA (19Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 1.1-kilobase pair Nco I fragment of EBPα, 0.4-kilobase pair Nco I fragment of EBPβ or 1.0-kilobase pair Eco RI–Bam HI fragment of EBPδ was used as a probe for Northern blotting. Each DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method. Total cellular RNA extraction from VSMC and Northern blot analysis were carried out by the methods described previously (19Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Kitami Y. Hiwada K. Kokubu T. J. Hypertens. 1989; 7: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from VSMC according to the method described by Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). After protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent, nuclear extracts were divided into small aliquots, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift assay, a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probe for the consensus sequence of C/EBP was generated by annealing two complementary oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the nucleotide sequence spanning −165 to −138 in the 5′-flanking region of the rat PDGFαR gene, 5′-CCCCAGATTGCATAAGAGCAAAAAGCCA-3′. Another double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probe for the consensus sequence of nuclear factor-1, 5′-CCTTTGGCATGCTGCCAATAT G-3′, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and used as an unrelated competitor. The C/EBP probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were incubated with 2.0 × 104 cpm of the labeled C/EBP probe for 30 min at room temperature in a 10-μl binding buffer containing 12 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For competition experiments or supershift assay, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe or 1–2 μl of antibodies against each subtype of the C/EBP family was added to nuclear extracts, respectively, and was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before addition of the labeled C/EBP probe. Then all reaction mixtures were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, and the gel was dried and processed as described previously (19Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PDGFαR promoter/firefly luciferase fusion vector, which was designated as −1,381/+68 WT, was prepared by insertion of the basal promoter region spanning positions −1,381 through +68 of the PDGFαR gene (19Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) onto pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mock vector, which was designated as MSV, was prepared by deletion of the coding region of C/EBPδ cDNA from EBPδ. pRL-CMV (Promega), which can drive Renilla luciferase activity, was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. One day before transfection, VSMC were seeded onto 60-mm dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish) or 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) for luciferase or cell proliferation assay, respectively. DNA transfection was performed with cells at approximately 70% confluency according to the manufacturer's specifications of Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). For luciferase assay, pGL3-Basic or −1,381/+68 WT (3 μg/dish each) was used for cotransfection with EBPα, -β, -δ, or MSV (3 μg/dish each) in addition to pRL-CMV (1 μg/dish). For cell proliferation assay, EBPδ or MSV (0.2 μg/well each) was used for transfection of VSMC. Promoter activity was determined by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) as described previously (22Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Okura T. Takata Y. Maguchi M. Igase M. Kohara K. Hiwada K. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Takata Y. Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Okura T. Hiwada K. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 298-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After normalization for transfection efficiency in reference to sequentially determined Renilla luciferase activity, each promoter activity was presented as a relative luciferase activity in reference to the activity of −1,381/+68 WT cotransfected with MSV that was set to unity. Cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for VSMC proliferation assay according to the manufacturer's specifications. One day after transfection, PDGF-AA or -BB (50 ng/ml each) was directly added to the culture medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 24-h. Then WST-1 reagent (0.1 volume of culture medium) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the absorbance (A450 −A690) of each well was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader, and cell proliferation activity was presented as a relative activity in reference to the activity of MSV-transfected VSMC after treatment with PDGF-AA that was set to unity. Western blotting was performed by the method described previously (17Inui H. Kitami Y. Kondo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17045-17050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (2.5 μg) prepared from VSMC were directly subjected to Western blotting for C/EBPα, -β, and -δ. After boiling with sample buffer, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using a 12.5% gel according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium; Bio-Rad) by electroblotting for 1 h at 100 V. The membrane was treated with diluted primary antibodies against each C/EBP member, and immunoreactive proteins were detected by autoradiography using a chemiluminescence detection system (the ECL Western blotting analysis system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). VSMC were cultured for 24 h in wells of chamber slides (Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide; Nalege Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and then fixed with 100% cold acetone for 30 min. All slides were treated with PBS containing 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C, and the following steps were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications for the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). After blocking for 30 min at 37 °C with diluted normal goat serum, slides were covered with diluted primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After exposure to a solution containing diluted biotinylated secondary antibodies, the slides were treated with a Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent. Positive staining cells were visualized with a solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol gradient and with 100% xylene, and then mounted in mounting medium (Mount-Quick; Daido Sangyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Analysis of variance with Bonferroni-Dunn post hoc analysis was used to analyze differences between two experimental groups. All data are expressed as mean + S.E., and statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. VSMC derived from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated for 6 h in the presence of IL-1β at various concentrations (0–40 ng/ml), and mRNA levels of both PDGFαR and C/EBPδ were determined by Northern blotting. Although base-line levels of both mRNA expression were very low or almost negligible in quiescent VSMC, they were markedly increased by the treatment with IL-1β at doses up to 10 ng/ml in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Therefore, we used the dose of IL-1β at 10 ng/ml hereafter. To identify the kinetic relationship between C/EBP and PDGFαR expression during treatment with IL-1β, mRNA levels of C/EBP members and PDGFαR were monitored for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, a high level of PDGFαR mRNA expression was accompanied by a similarly marked induction of C/EBPδ mRNA in VSMC following the addition of IL-1β. A rapid induction of C/EBPδ mRNA within 30 min was followed by slower emergence of PDGFαR mRNA, which reached the maximum level (12.2-fold higher than the zero time level) in 12 h, whereas C/EBPδ mRNA reached the maximum level (10.5-fold higher than the zero time level) at 3 h, continued at least for 12 h, and then decreased gradually to a basal level within 48 h. The significant induction of PDGFαR mRNA expression began to increase at 3 h and continued at least for 24 h. This time course indicates a causal relationship in which C/EBPδ induced PDGFαR gene transcription. In contrast, a high level of C/EBPα mRNA expression was observed even in a quiescent state, and IL-1β did not significantly alter it. Although the induction of C/EBPβ mRNA expression was also detectable at 30 min, it continued for an extended period up to 48 h. To determine whether the induction of PDGFαR mRNA expression after treatment with IL-1β is due to the effect of IL-1β on the mRNA stability, the half-life time of PDGFαR mRNA was determined in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 2). VSMC were pretreated with IL-1β for 12 h, washed with PBS, and then exposed to a freshly prepared medium with or without IL-1β in the presence of 5 mg/ml actinomycin D. A half-life time of the PDGFαR mRNA seen in cells incubated in the medium with IL-1β was 8.6 h, and that without IL-1β was 10.0 h, indicating that IL-1β does not significantly affect the PDGFαR mRNA stability. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by using a labeled C/EBP probe containing the consensus sequence of C/EBP recognition site of rat PDGFαR promoter region (Fig.3 A). Nuclear extracts were prepared from either quiescent or IL-1β-treated VSMC. Although the C/EBP probe was not shifted by nuclear extracts from quiescent VSMC, it was clearly shifted by nuclear extracts from VSMC treated with IL-1β for 12 h, generating a band of the DNA-protein complex. The DNA-protein complex was markedly competed out by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled C/EBP probe but not by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled nuclear factor-1 probe. To determine the specific subtype of C/EBP that is bound by the probe and actually involved in the transcriptional activation of the PDGFαR gene, supershift assay was performed using antibodies against three major members of C/EBP family, C/EBPα, -β, and -δ (Fig. 3 B). In IL-1β-treated VSMC, the band was clearly supershifted by antibodies against either C/EBPβ or -δ but not C/EBPα. To further clarify the direct evidence for C/EBP family in regulating the transcription of the rat PDGFαR gene, we evaluated the ability of the C/EBP family to transactivate the basal promoter of PDGFαR in a luciferase fusion construct (Fig.4 A). The wild-type PDGFαR promoter/firefly luciferase construct, −1,381/+68 WT, was cotransfected with a mock vector, MSV, or an expression vector for each C/EBP member, EBPα, -β, or -δ. Forced expression of C/EBPδ specifically transactivated the promoter activity of −1,381/+68 WT, the extent of stimulation being on the order of 9.8-fold compared with that of −1,381/+68 WT cotransfected with MSV. On the other hand, forced expression of other C/EBP members did not significantly affect PDGFαR gene promoter activity. Furthermore, cell proliferation activity following treatment with PDGF-AA or -BB was determined in the transfected VSMC with MSV or EBPδ (Fig. 4 B). Proliferation activity following treatment with PDGF-AA or -BB was significantly enhanced in the transfected cells with EBPδ compared with those with MSV, the extent of enhancement being on the order of 1.6- or 1.5-fold, respectively. To see if C/EBPδ gene expression is activated by IL-1β without any other de novo protein synthesis, the ability of IL-1β to induce C/EBPδ gene expression was determined in the presence of CHX (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 5). Although induction of PDGFαR mRNA expression by IL-1β was markedly reduced in the presence of CHX, that of C/EBPδ mRNA expression was even greater than in the absence of CHX. On the other hand, CHX alone did not cause the superinduction of C/EBPδ mRNA expression. In Fig.6, protein levels of PDGFαR and C/EBPα, -β, and -δ expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in quiescent or IL-1β-treated VSMC. Although protein levels of PDGFαR were very low or almost negligible in quiescent VSMC, IL-1β drastically induced immunoreactive PDGFαR expression exclusively in the cytoplasm of cells. A high level of C/EBPα protein expression was observed in both quiescent and IL-1β-treated VSMC and was localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Positive staining of immunoreactive C/EBPδ protein was not detected in quiescent VSMC, whereas that of immunoreactive C/EBPβ protein was identified specifically in the peripheral portion of the nuclei. Furthermore, either C/EBPβ or -δ protein expression was markedly induced by the treatment with IL-1β and was localized exclusively and homogeneously in the nuclei. To determine a quantitative evaluation of functionally active C/EBP members as nuclear proteins, nuclear extracts from quiescent or IL-1β-treated VSMC were directly subjected to Western blotting using specific antibodies against C/EBPα, -β, and -δ (Fig.7). Although nuclear extracts from quiescent VSMC contained only a recognizable level of C/EBPβ protein but not C/EBPα or -δ protein, either C/EBPβ (36 kDa) or C/EBPδ (33 kDa) protein was markedly induced in the nuclear extracts from IL-1β-treated VSMC for 12 h. The expression level of C/EBPα (42 kDa) protein was almost negligible in the nuclear extracts from either quiescent or IL-1β-treated VSMC. C/EBPδ has been originally identified in the liver as one of the closely related members of C/EBP family that belongs to the basic leucine zipper transcriptional factors (25Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

Previous studies revealed that C/EBPδ expression was usually at an undetectable or minor level in normal cells or tissues and was rapidly induced by lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (28Juan T.S-C.

Therefore, C/EBPδ is thought to be an important factor to regulate the gene transcription of acute phase reactive proteins (28Juan T.S-C. Wilson D.R. Wilde M.D. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2584-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both PDGF-A and its specific receptor, PDGFαR, are also known to be up-regulated by the treatment with IL-1β in several cells including VSMC and pulmonary fibroblasts, causing the cell migration and/or proliferation in the pathologic conditions (12Raines E.W. Dower S.K. Ross R. Science. 1989; 243: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 15Bonner J.C. Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Moomaw C.R. Morgan D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L72-L80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lindroos P.M. Coin P.G. Badgett A. Morgan D.L. Bonner J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 16: 283-292Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, little has been known about detailed molecular mechanisms of its gene up-regulation. Recently, Khachigian et al. (32Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that major vascular growth-related genes such as PDGF-A chain, PDGF-B chain, transforming growth factor β1, and tissue factor are transactivated by the interaction of two specific regulatory nuclear factors, Sp-1 and Egr-1, suggesting that a common mechanism may exist in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that the PDGF β-receptor (PDGFβR) gene is mainly regulated by the CCAAT box located at position −67 of its promoter region in VSMC (22Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Okura T. Takata Y. Maguchi M. Igase M. Kohara K. Hiwada K. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Takata Y. Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Okura T. Hiwada K. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 298-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that a common mechanism via the CCAAT box also exists in the transcriptional regulation of vascular growth-related receptor genes such as PDGFαR and PDGFβR genes. In the present study, we have clearly demonstrated that an increase in the level of PDGFαR mRNA in VSMC upon treatment with IL-1β is mainly due to the transcriptional activation of the gene but not due to stabilization of mRNA (Fig. 2). As anticipated, Northern blotting revealed that C/EBPδ mRNA expression was drastically induced in the IL-1β-treated VSMC in good accord with results obtained from the supershift assay (Fig. 3 B), immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6), and Western blotting (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 1, this mechanism is supported by a rapid C/EBPδ induction by IL-1β turned on within 30 min and peaking at 3 h that was followed by a slower (3-h) emergence (peaking at 12 h) of PDGFαR mRNA, indicating that C/EBPδ expression is directly related to the transactivation of the PDGFαR gene in VSMC. Furthermore, we have determined the ability of IL-1β to induce C/EBPδ gene expression in the presence of CHX to see if C/EBPδ gene expression is activated by IL-1β without any other de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 5). Although either CHX alone or with IL-1β did not induce PDGFαR mRNA, CHX with IL-1β allowed a marked C/EBPδ mRNA induction. This indicates that C/EBPδ activates the endogenous PDGFαR gene expression in VSMC without de novo synthesis of other proteins. Recently, we have reported that a C/EBP binding site seen in PDGFαR gene promoter region acts as a major regulatory element responsible for its restricting expression in a strain-dependent manner (33Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Hiwada K. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Kolyada et al. (34Kolyada A.Y. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1408-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the C/EBP family is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene in hepatocytes. Hohaus et al. (35Hohaus S. Petrovick M.S. Voso M.T. Sun Z. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5830-5845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the c-fms gene, which belongs to the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family together with PDGFαR and PDGFβR, also has a C/EBP binding site in the promoter region, and either PU.1 (Spi-1) or C/EBPα mainly regulates the cell type-specific gene expression in hematopoietic cells. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the C/EBP family, especially C/EBPδ, is a major determinant of PDGFαR gene transcription in VSMC. Supershift assay and Western blotting indicated that IL-1β markedly induced specific DNA-binding proteins, which are identified as C/EBP family, and inducible C/EBP isoforms, interacting with the C/EBP binding site of PDGFαR promoter region, are C/EBPβ and -δ (Figs. 3 B and 7). Although C/EBPβ was induced by IL-1β, it was also detected even in quiescent VSMC (Figs. 6 and 7). On the other hand, C/EBPδ was identified exclusively in the nuclei after treatment with IL-1β and was actually capable of interacting with the C/EBP binding site of the PDGFαR gene. Furthermore, overexpression studies have demonstrated that C/EBPδ but not C/EBPα or -β specifically transactivated PDGFαR promoter activity in VSMC (Fig. 4 A), and that cell proliferation activity following treatment with PDGF-AA or -BB was significantly enhanced in the transfected VSMC with EBPδ compared with those with MSV (Fig.4 B). Since PDGF-BB can bind to not only PDGFβR but also PDGFαR, enhanced effect on the cell proliferation following treatment with PDGF-BB is mediated by the action through the PDGFαR (but not PDGFβR) up-regulated by C/EBPδ overexpression. Moreover, -fold enhancement of cell proliferation was significantly higher in the VSMC after treatment with PDGF-BB compared with those with PDGF-AA. This result was in agreement with our previous study (17Inui H. Kitami Y. Kondo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17045-17050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which we evaluated the mitogenic activity after treatment with PDGF-AA or -BB by measuring radioactive incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine and found that it was significantly higher in the cells after treatment with PDGF-BB compared with those with PDGF-AA. Previously, we have isolated and characterized the promoter region of the rat C/EBPδ gene to understand the regulatory mechanism of C/EBPδ gene transcription by IL-1β in VSMC (36Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Kohara K. Hiwada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A similar study with respect to the molecular mechanism of rat C/EBPδ gene transcription in human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2, has demonstrated that the C/EBPδ gene is activated by IL-6 through the regulatory domain, which is recognized by acute phase response factor/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (37Yamada T.

Especially, phosphorylation of acute phase response factor/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 by IL-6 increased its DNA binding activity and caused an induction of C/EBPδ gene transcription, suggesting that a similar mechanism may exist on the transactivation of the C/EBPδ gene by IL-1β and giving support to the hypothesis that de novo synthesis of other proteins is not necessary for its action. In conclusion, the present study is aimed at delineating the molecular mechanism in the tissue-specific gene expression of PDGFαR in VSMC. The results obtained herein show a direct evidence for new significant roles of the C/EBP family, especially C/EBPδ, on vascular growth and development and also provide important information to understand the mechanism underlying pathogenesis of vascular remodeling and ensuing atherosclerosis or restenosis.

Here, we demonstrate a unique modulation of N-type calcium channels by farnesol, a dephosphorylated intermediate of the mammalian mevalonate pathway. At micromolar concentrations, farnesol acts as a relatively non-discriminatory rapid open channel blocker of all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels, with a mild specificity for L-type channels. However, at 250 nm, farnesol induces an N-type channel-specific hyperpolarizing shift in channel availability that results in ∼50% inhibition at a typical neuronal resting potential. Additional experiments demonstrated the presence of farnesol in the brain (rodents and humans) at physiologically relevant concentrations (100–800 pmol/g (wet weight)).

Farnesol is an isoprenoid intermediate of the mevalonate pathway, produced by dephosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fig.1) (32Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar, 33Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This pathway plays a central role in cell growth and differentiation; controls the production of ubiquinone and cholesterol; and provides the substrates to G protein prenylation reactions in a number of tissues, including brain (32Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar, 33Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Farnesol was recently shown to induce a low affinity inhibition of L-type calcium currents in vascular smooth muscle (37Roullet J.-B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Chapman J. Bychkov R. Roullet C.M. Luft F.C. Haller H. McCarron D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32240-32246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels might also be regulated by farnesol. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of exogenous farnesol on neuronal voltage-dependent calcium channels exogenously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)1cells. We observed that at submicromolar concentrations, farnesol mediated an N-type channel-selective hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation that resulted in a selective inhibition of N-type calcium channels at a typical neuronal resting potential of −70 mV. To further establish the physiological relevance of our findings in HEK cells, we assessed the presence of farnesol in the brain. Using mass spectroscopy, we were able to detect farnesol in human and rodent brain tissue specimens at concentrations similar to those inducing selective inhibition of the N-type Ca2+ channels in HEK cells. Overall, our data indicate that farnesol is a high affinity inhibitor of N-type calcium channels. The data suggest a novel mechanism for the precise regulation of brain Ca2+ homeostasis and neurotransmitter release implicating the mevalonate pathway and brain farnesol production. Human embryonic kidney TSA 201 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml neomycin. The cells were grown to 85% confluency, split with trypsin/EDTA, and plated on glass coverslips at 10% confluency 12 h prior to transfection. Immediately prior to transfection, the medium was replaced, and the cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding calcium channel α1, β1b, and α2 subunits (at a 1:1:1 molar ratio) using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. After 12 h, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 12 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–2 days prior to recording. Human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing N-type α1B + α2 + β1b channels were maintained and plated for electrophysiological recordings as described previously (29Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to recording, individual coverslips were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution composed of either 20 mmBaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2) or 5 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 87.5 mm CsCl (pH 7.2). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP Version 6.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller, fire-polished using a Narashige Microforge, and showed typical resistances of 2–4 megaohms. The internal pipette solution contained 105 mm CsCl, 25 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). All-trans-farnesol (trans,trans-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrien-1-ol; Sigma) was prepared as a 50 mm stock in 100% ethanol, diluted into the recording solution at the appropriate final concentrations, and perfused directly onto the cell using a home-built gravity-driven microperfusion system. At the applicable concentrations, ethanol by itself had no effect on calcium channel activity. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Inc.). All curve fitting was carried out with Sigmaplot Version 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: Ipeak (normalized) = 1/(1 + exp((V −Vh)z/25.6)), where V and Vh are the conditioning and half-inactivation potentials, respectively, and z is a slope factor. Unless stated otherwise, all error bars are S.E. values; numbers in parentheses displayed on the figures reflect numbers of experiments; and p values given reflect Student's t tests. Brain specimens (∼2 g) were homogenized for 1.5 min with 15 parts (w/v) methanol/ethanol/water mixture (2.5:2.5:95, v/v) using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) set at 2. One-half of each homogenate was added, when appropriate, to 2-cis,6-trans-farnesol used as an internal standard (<0.2% all-trans-farnesol) or all-trans-farnesol (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a 6-ml OASISTM cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). The cartridge was washed with a 5% (v/v) methanol/water mixture, and farnesol was eluted with pure methanol. A mixture of 100 μl of N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and 1% trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce) was used to derivatize the lipids recovered in the eluate. A 2.5-μl aliquot was then injected using splitless injection into a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 5970 mass-selective detector operated in the selected-ion monitoring mode, monitoring ions at m/z 107, 135, and 143 at a dwell time of 100 ms. After an initial hold of 1.5 min at 100 °C, the gas chromatograph oven was programmed at 20 °C/min to 300 °C. Under these conditions, all-trans-farnesol eluted at 8.8 min (8.6 min for cis,trans-farnesol). The area of ion at m/z 107 was used for quantitation, whereas ions at m/z 135 and at m/z 143 were used as qualifying ions by ratioing them to ion at m/z 107. Runs were terminated at 20 min. We have previously shown that farnesol mediates a low (micromolar) affinity inhibition of native smooth muscle L-type calcium channels (37Roullet J.-B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Chapman J. Bychkov R. Roullet C.M. Luft F.C. Haller H. McCarron D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32240-32246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine whether this inhibition was selective for L-type channels, we exogenously applied farnesol to four major types of expressed high voltage-activated neuronal calcium channels (α1A, α1B, α1C, and α1E). Fig.2 depicts the effects of micromolar farnesol concentrations on N-type (α1B + β1b + α2) calcium channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, at a holding potential of −100 mV, application of farnesol resulted in rapidly developing peak current inhibition of N-type calcium channels. This effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 2, A, C, and D) and completely reversible upon washout. There was little if any effect on the position of the peak of the current-voltage relation (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 E compares the effects of 25 μm farnesol on peak current amplitude of four different types of high voltage-activated calcium channels. Under identical experimental conditions (coexpression with α2 and β1b, holding potential of −100 mV, and 20 mm external barium), 25 μm farnesol inhibited α1A, α1B, α1C and α1E peak current levels by 27 ± 5% (n = 8), 57 ± 7% (n = 10), 82 ± 3% (n = 10), and 36 ± 7% (n = 7), respectively. Thus, over the time course of a typical neuronal action potential, L-type channels were the most effectively inhibited channel isoform, followed by N-type channels (IC50 values obtained from dose-response curves for peak current inhibition were as follows: α1B, 21 μm (n = 16) (Fig. 2 D); and α1C, 7.1 μm (n = 15) (data not shown), but see below). These data parallel our previously reported peak current inhibition of high voltage-activated calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (37Roullet J.-B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Chapman J. Bychkov R. Roullet C.M. Luft F.C. Haller H. McCarron D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32240-32246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and reveal a moderate selectivity of farnesol action for the L-type isoform. Upon examination of the current waveform in the presence of farnesol, a dramatic, concentration-dependent, and reversible speeding of the time course of inactivation became apparent (Fig. 2 C). A qualitatively similar behavior was also observed with transiently expressed α1E and α1A channels, albeit to a somewhat reduced degree (data not shown). In principle, this could be due to a drug-mediated promotion of inactivation or to a rapid open channel block that occurs immediately upon channel opening. If a farnesol-bound channel were to simply inactivate at a faster rate, then at a half-maximal concentration, one would expect 50% of the channels to inactivate rapidly, whereas the remaining portion would inactivate with the normal (control) rate. As evident from the raw data in Fig. 2 C, no such biphasic response was observed. Instead, the time course of current decay accelerated with increasing farnesol concentrations and remained monophasic at all concentrations tested. When the time course of current decay was fitted monoexponentially, corrected for the control inactivation rate, and then plotted as a function of farnesol concentration (Fig. 3 A), a linear relation was obtained, consistent with a mechanism by which farnesol rapidly binds to open channels immediately upon membrane depolarization. In this scenario, the slope of the regression line would reflect the association rate constant (4.8 ms−1μm−1), and the intercept on the y axis would be equivalent to the dissociation rate constant (7.6 ms−1), translating into a Kd of 1.6 μm. A dose-response curve for current inhibition at the end of a 100-ms test pulse (i.e. close to equilibrium) yielded an IC50 of 3.5 μm, which is consistent with the Kd value obtained from Fig.3 A. To determine whether a rapid open channel blocking mechanism could account for the observed reduction in peak current levels, we carried out a simple simulation (Fig. 3 B) in which we assumed that a block can occur immediately upon channel opening (and thus, prior to reaching peak current amplitude). With a time constant for current activation of 1.8 ms and using our experimental measurements of the decay rate at various farnesol concentrations, we were able to reproduce the qualitative features of peak current inhibition observed experimentally. Our simulation can also account for the apparent discrepancy between the Kd value obtained from the kinetic analysis (1.6 μm) and the IC50 value obtained from Fig. 2 D (21 μm) since at the time of peak, the open channel block would not yet be fully developed. Unlike α1A, α1B, and α1Echannels, α1C (L-type) channels underwent little change in “inactivation” kinetics in the presence of farnesol (data not shown), but nonetheless exhibited substantial inhibition. This observation suggests that the block of the L-type channels is almost fully developed prior to channel opening (resting block). This is in stark contrast with the inhibition of non-L-type channels, which develops during the course of the test depolarization. Thus, when comparing the IC50 values for peak current inhibition (as in Fig. 2 E), it is important to consider that unlike in the case of L-type channels, the IC50 for peak current inhibition of non-L-type channels likely underestimates the true farnesol affinity (see above). The development and reversal of the peak current block of N-type channels occur at a time scale of ∼1 min (Fig. 2 A); and yet, the rate constants for the N-type channel block and unblock are predicted to occur in the low millisecond range (Fig.3 A). This suggests the involvement of one or more rate-limiting steps independent of the actual farnesol channel interactions. If the development and recovery of the farnesol peak current block were exclusively governed by a bimolecular interaction between the channel and farnesol, then the recovery rate constant obtained from the washout kinetics should be equivalent to that predicted from the concentration dependence of the time constant of block development (i.e. the intercept on the y axis in Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 C, this was not the case, thus further supporting the notion that the true farnesol-channel interaction kinetics are masked by a rate-limiting step. This step is unlikely to be dependent on the farnesol delivery to the cells because our perfusion system allows solution changes in <1 s, but may be due to partitioning of farnesol into and out of the plasma membrane. All of the experiments described above were carried out at a holding potential of −100 mV, at which the complete population of channels is available for opening. To assess whether farnesol was able to interact with inactivated N-type channels, we examined the effects of 25 μm farnesol on steady-state inactivation of expressed N-type calcium channels. As shown in Fig.4, farnesol induced a dramatic (22 mV) and only incompletely reversible hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of the channel, which is consistent with drug binding to the inactivated state of the channel. Whereas this shift does not affect current levels at a holding potential of −100 mV, one would expect a substantial additional inhibition of N-type calcium channels when the cells are held at a typical neuronal resting potential. Many compounds affecting voltage-dependent ion channels exhibit varying affinities for different kinetic states, thus raising the possibility that the shifts in inactivation properties might occur at farnesol concentrations well below those required for an open channel block. To investigate this possibility, HEK cells expressing N-type calcium channels were held at a more depolarized potential (−70 mV), and the concentration of external permeant ion was reduced from 20 to 5 mm to more closely approach the surface potentials experienced by the channels in their native environment. Initially, we applied 2 μm farnesol and observed a >50% inhibition of peak current levels (data not shown). We then further reduced the farnesol levels to 250 and 100 nm and examined the effects on channel activity. As shown in Fig.5 A, at the more depolarized holding potential of −70 mV, application of 100 nmfarnesol resulted in a slowly developing, yet substantial reduction in peak current amplitude, which could only be partially reversed upon washout. Fig. 5 B depicts the effects of 100 nmfarnesol on the position of the steady-state inactivation curve of α1B channels for five paired experiments. Compared with Fig. 4, the half-inactivation potential was shifted 13 mV more negative due to the less effective surface charge screening occurring in 5 mm barium. Upon application of 100 nm farnesol, the half-inactivation potential was shifted further from −58.3 ± 1.3 to −71.2 ± 3.2 mV (p = 0.004), resulting in an ∼45% inhibition of N-type currents at a holding potential of −70 mV, consistent with the data in Fig. 5 A. Fig. 5 C depicts current records obtained from α1B channels in the absence and presence of 250 nm farnesol at a holding potential of −70 mV. Similar to Fig. 5 A, farnesol reduced peak current amplitude in a partially reversible manner. The peak current reduction was accompanied by only a mild increase in the apparent rate of inactivation, which is indicative of a relative lack of the pronounced open channel block observed at higher farnesol concentrations (i.e. Fig. 2 C). There was no detectable effect of submicromolar farnesol on current activation properties. Fig. 5 D compares the effect of 250 nm farnesol (Vh = −70 mV) on the peak current levels of four types of high voltage-activated calcium channels. As shown, the effect of 250 nm farnesol on peak current amplitude was most pronounced for α1B channels (43 ± 4% inhibition, n = 6), whereas only a minor (<10%) reduction in the peak current levels of α1A (P/Q-type) and α1E (R-type) channels was observed. There was no effect on α1C (L-type) channels. Hence, our data show that farnesol is a high affinity inhibitor of N-type calcium channels and constitute the first description of selective blockade of these channels by a small organic molecule. One of the enzymes required for the production of farnesol (farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase) is known to be expressed in the brain (38Ericsson J. Runquist M. Thelin A. Andersson M. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that farnesol could be present endogenously in neuronal tissue. To investigate this possibility, a farnesol assay using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was developed and applied to the detection of farnesol in human and rodent brain lipid extracts. Mouse brains (male BXD mice, weighing ∼25 g) were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after sacrifice. The specimens were then pooled (n = six animals/pool) and processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” As illustrated in Fig.6, authentic all-trans-farnesol was found in these brain extracts. Identification was established by comparison with pure all-trans-farnesol using two criteria: retention time (8.7–8.8 min) and ratios of two qualifying ions (ions at m/z 135 and at m/z 143) to ion at m/z 107 (0.90–0.93 and 0.68–0.76 for ions at m/z 135 and at m/z 143, respectively) (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, there was no detectable cis,trans-farnesol (Fig.6 B), thus allowing the use of cis,trans-farnesol as an internal standard (Fig. 6 C). Farnesol concentrations were estimated to be 417 and 373 pmol/g (wet weight) in these pools. Rat brains (male Harlan Sprague-Dawley, 12–16 weeks of age;n = two to three brains/pool) were also analyzed. Authentic all-trans-farnesol was found in all samples (average concentration = 590 pmol/g (wet weight), range of 180–745). Finally, brain necropsy specimens (frontal cortex) from four individuals, a 42-year-old male who died in a motor vehicle accident, a 55-year-old male who died from a ruptured berry aneurysm, a 70-year-old female with Huntington's disease, and a 46-year-old male with coronary artery disease (specimens collected within 24 h post mortem), were obtained from the Oregon Brain Bank and analyzed. Authentic all-trans-farnesol was detected in all samples at concentrations estimated at 248, 290, 180, and 110 pmol/g (wet weight) for the four specimens, respectively. Under our experimental conditions, none of the untreated rat or human brain extracts had detectable levels of cis,trans-farnesol. These results demonstrate that farnesol is a naturally occurring substance in the brain and provide indirect evidence for a complete metabolic pathway supporting farnesol production and degradation in the central nervous system. More important, our results suggest that brain farnesol levels may be sufficiently high to mediate substantial inhibition of N-type calcium channels by reducing the availability of the channel for opening. Farnesol has previously been shown to mediate a low affinity inhibition of native smooth muscle L-type calcium channels (37Roullet J.-B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Chapman J. Bychkov R. Roullet C.M. Luft F.C. Haller H. McCarron D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32240-32246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we present several novel aspects of the actions of farnesol on voltage-dependent calcium channels from brain tissue. First, at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, farnesol induces a relatively nonselective peak current inhibition of transiently expressed high voltage-activated calcium channels. Second, we have presented evidence that farnesol mediates a selective, high affinity inhibition of inactivated N-type channels, making this compound the first small organic high affinity blocker with selectivity for a non-L-type calcium channel. Finally, we show that these selective effects on N-type channels occur at physiological farnesol concentrations. Thus, farnesol may constitute the first endogenous high affinity ligand to be identified for any type of voltage-dependent calcium channel. At hyperpolarized holding potentials (−100 mV), micromolar concentrations of farnesol mediated a dramatic speeding of the rate of current decay of N-type channels and, to a somewhat lesser extent, α1A and α1E channels. Our kinetic analysis is consistent with a mechanism in which farnesol rapidly blocks the channel immediately subsequent to opening. The open channel-blocking site is probably not accessible directly from the external aqueous phase since development and reversal of the blocking effects required minutes despite the rapid association and dissociation kinetics suggested by our kinetic analysis. Hence, farnesol must likely partition into the membrane phase and perhaps into the cytoplasm before it is capable of producing an open channel block. Consistent with such a mechanism, the presence of farnesol did not interfere with the development of or recovery from ω-conotoxin GVIA block (data not shown), further supporting the notion that farnesol does not directly block the pore from the extracellular side of the channel. Instead, the rapid open channel block by farnesol might occur by physical occlusion of the pore from the cytoplasmic side; however, substantiation of such a hypothesis will require further investigation. Whereas the farnesol-induced reduction in peak current amplitude could be accounted for by assuming that all of the inhibition was due to an open channel block, the peak current inhibition of L-type channels appeared to be mediated by a distinct mechanism. We observed little speeding of the rate of current decay (i.e. open channel block); and yet, L-type α1C channels underwent the largest degree of peak current inhibition. These considerations suggest that the L-type channel block by farnesol may differ from that of non-L-type channels via its state dependence. Whether the site(s) of farnesol action encompasses one of the previously identified antagonist interaction sites of voltage-gated calcium channels (7Kaczorowski, G. J., Slaughter, R. S., and Garcia, M. L. (1994) in Ion Channels in the Cardiovascular System: Function and Dysfunction (Spooner, P., ed) pp. 463–487Google Scholar, 8Zamponi G.W. Drug Dev. Res. 1997; 42: 131-143Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Striessnig, J., Hering, S., Berger, W., Catterall, W., and Glossmann, H. (1994) in Ion Channels in the Cardiovascular System: Function and Dysfunction (Spooner, P., ed) pp. 441–458Google Scholar) or a truly novel binding site needs further study. A second major effect mediated by farnesol was a shift in the steady-state inactivation curve that occurred at farnesol concentrations as low as 100 nm and was fairly selective for N-type channels. At a typical neuronal membrane potential, these shifts in half-inactivation potential resulted in an ∼50% inhibition of peak current amplitude in addition to any open channel block. The detailed mechanisms that underlie these effects on N-type channel availability remain elusive. For example, it is not clear whether the differential affinity of farnesol for open and inactivated channels is due to state-dependent binding to a common blocking site or to interactions with two separate sites on the channel molecule. Whereas our kinetic analysis of the peak indicated that the open channel block likely involved partitioning of farnesol into the membrane, the kinetic profile of the inactivated channel block (slow kinetics of both development and recovery from the block) does not permit us to distinguish between an intracellular and an extracellular site of action for the block of inactivated N-type channels. Finally, we also cannot exclude the possibility that the farnesol effects on channel availability might be indirectly due to modulation of a cytoplasmic messenger. The physiological importance of farnesol has only begun to emerge recently. Farnesol has been shown to act as a transcription factor in the activation of both the farnesoid X-activated receptor and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Fig. 1) (40Forman B.M.

Our data raise the possibility that farnesol may contribute to the intimate regulation of brain function via regulation of N-type calcium channel activity. Both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels mediate neurotransmitter release at presynaptic nerve terminals by means of their physical association with the SNARE protein complex (47Sheng Z. Rettig T. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 48Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl.

Blockers of either N- or P/Q-type calcium channels are known to reduce synaptic transmission (50Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 51Reuter H. Neuron. 1995; 4: 773-779Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this context, our data may provide a mechanism for selective inhibition of neurotransmission carried by N-type channels. Unlike the transient inhibition of these channels by G protein βγ subunits and because of its poor reversibility, such an inhibition would ensure long-term modulation of neurotransmitter release. Since the activity of the enzymes mediating the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate is differentially distributed across various subregions of the brain (52Runquist M. Parmryd I. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Neurophysiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 65: 2299-2305Google Scholar), our data further raise the possibility of a region-specific modulation of N-type calcium channels by farnesol production and, indirectly, by the activity of the mevalonate pathway. Future experiments in which anatomical mapping of brain farnesol concentration will be determined will be necessary to support this hypothesis. Finally, it has been reported that the gene expression of the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway is developmentally regulated in the brain (53Levin M.S. Pitt A.J. Schwartz A.L. Edwards P.A. Gordon J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 54Ness G.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 50: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assuming that farnesol production parallels the activity of the pathway, our results suggest potential new regulatory mechanisms for controlling Ca2+ channel activity and brain function during embryonic and early life development. In conclusion, our data indicate that farnesol is a previously unrecognized selective inhibitor of N-type calcium channels, present at physiologically relevant concentrations in the brain. The findings confirm farnesol in its role as an endogenous signaling molecule and further suggest a novel mechanism for the precise regulation of neurotransmitter release and brain Ca2+homeostasis implicating farnesol and the mevalonate pathway.

The present study was performed to determine whether PKC pathways modulate this particular α/β interaction. We present data indicating that both the rapid inactivation and voltage sensitivity conferred onto Kv1.5 by Kvβ1.3 require PKC phosphorylation after heterologous expression in HEK 293 cells. Thus, the kinase systems active in heterologous systems must be taken into account when comparing currents in native cells to those generated from cloned channels. It remains to be determined whether this PKC requirement involves direct phosphorylation of either the α or β subunits and/or other kinase systems.

Transfection efficiency averaged 30–40% based on green protein fluorescence, and >90% of green cells expressed current showing a complete Kvβ1.3 effect. Recordings were made with an Axopatch-200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Currents were recorded at room temperature (21–23 °C) and were sampled at 1–10 kHz after anti-alias filtering at 0.5 to 5 kHz. Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). To ensure voltage clamp quality, electrode resistance was kept below 3 megaohms. Junction potentials were zeroed with the electrode in the standard bath solution. Gigaohm seal formation was achieved by suction, and after establishing the whole cell configuration, the capacitive transients elicited by symmetrical 10-mV voltage clamp steps from −80 mV were recorded at 50 kHz for calculation of cell capacitance. The intracellular pipette-filling solution contained 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm K4BAPTA, 5 mm K2ATP, and 1 mm MgCl2 and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH, yielding a final intracellular K+ concentration of ∼145 mm. The bath solution contained 130 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose and was adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. The holding potential was −80 mV, and the cycle time for the protocols was 20 s. The standard protocol to obtain current-voltage relationships and activation curves consisted of 250-ms pulses that were imposed in 10-mV increments between −80 and +60 mV. The steady state currents were obtained at the end of the 250-ms depolarizations to +60 mV. Percent inactivation was calculated as 1 − (steady state current/peak current amplitude). Deactivating tail currents were recorded at −30 or −50 mV. The activation curve was obtained from the ratio of tail current amplitudes measured immediately after decay of the capacitive transients. The voltage dependence of channel opening (activation curve) was fitted with a Boltzmann equation, y = 1/1(1 + exp(−(E − E h)/k)), in which k represents the slope factor, and E h represents the voltage at which 50% of the channels are open. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of the differences between two populations. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. The Kvβ1.3 subunit alters Kv1.5 function by 1) inducing a rapid, but incomplete, voltage-dependent inactivation, 2) a hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint of activation, 3) a slowing of deactivation, and 4) enhanced slow inactivation (4England S.K.

Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C1485-C1495Crossref Google Scholar). Our previous work has shown that the fast inactivation conferred by Kvβ1.3 onto Kv1.5 is reduced specifically by PKA phosphorylation of serine 24 in the β subunit (17Kwak Y.G. Hu N.N. Wei J. George A.L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. Murray K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13928-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to determine whether PKC pathways also regulated this α/β interaction. Since PKC inhibitors such as calphostin C directly inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels (20Hartzell H.C. Rinderknecht A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1293-C1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first incubated Kv1.5-transfected HEK 293 cells with a variety of PKC inhibitors to test for direct effects on the Kv1.5 channel. We found that the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine was a potent open channel blocker with a K0.5 value in the low micromolar range when applied to the bath solution (data not shown). This block was apparent within minutes of application to the bath. Given the charge and hydrophobicity of this compound, such open channel block was not surprising because it is structurally similar to well characterized open channel blockers such as quinidine (21Snyders D.J. Knoth K.M. Roberds S.L. Tamkun M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 332-339Google Scholar). However, 3 μm calphostin C, which is structurally distinct from chelerythrine, showed no open channel block of the Kv1.5 current (compare panels A and B, Fig.1), although this agent did slow the rate of both activation and deactivation as well as decrease the slope of the activation curve (panels B, C, and D, respectively). Since direct addition of calphostin C to the bath solution produced these minor effects within 5 min, they most likely represent a direct effect on the channel as opposed to involving kinase pathways. The effects of calphostin C on the Kvβ1.3-induced modification of Kv1.5 current were examined next. As shown in Fig.2, panels A and B, the Kvβ1.3 subunit induced its characteristic fast inactivation upon Kv1.5. Preincubation with calphostin C (3 μm) for 2 h essentially removed the β-induced fast inactivation as shown in panel C. This effect of calphostin C was not observed when the agent was added directly to the bath after seal formation and incubated for 30 min or less. Only when the cells were preincubated with calphostin C for 1–2 h before seal formation or once, when the seal was maintained for more than 30 min after calphostin C addition, was loss of inactivation observed. The data presented in panel D show that 3 μm okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (22Sheppeck J.E.N. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), attenuated the calphostin C effect, as predicted if protein dephosphorylation is required to remove the β-induced inactivation. The data summarized in panel E illustrate that calphostin C also affected the β-induced hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve. Calphostin C completely removed the β-induced voltage shift, whereas okadaic acid prevented this removal. Okadaic acid alone had no effect on the Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 current or the current induced by Kv1.5 alone (data not shown). Although calphostin C removed the β-induced inactivation and the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve, it did not negate the β-induced slowing of deactivation but rather slowed it further (τ = 34.6 versus 41.5 ms, without and with calphostin C treatment, respectively). This calphostin C-induced slowing of deactivation agrees with the data of Fig. 1 indicating calphostin C directly slows Kv1.5 deactivation. The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide also inhibited β-induced inactivation as shown in panel E. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 μm, added directly to the bath or preincubated with the cells for either 2 or 12 h) had no effect on the Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 current (data not shown). Deletion of the N-terminal 68 amino acids of Kvβ1.3 removes the fast inactivation but not the β-induced shift in activation midpoint (9Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C1485-C1495Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether these N-terminal amino acids, including a consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation at serine 34, are required for the calphostin C effects, we examined the effect of calphostin C on this truncated β subunit coexpressed with Kv1.5. As shown in Fig.3, panels A and B, no fast inactivation was observed both in the absence and presence of calphostin C. However, the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation was still present, and calphostin C treatment returned the activation midpoint to that observed in the absence of a β subunit (panel C). These data indicate that the first 68 amino acids of Kvβ1.3, although being essential for the β-induced fast inactivation, are not required for the β subunit to render α/β-derived current PKC-sensitive. The fast inactivation conferred onto Kv1.1 by the Kvβ1.1 subunit requires phosphorylation at a PKA site (serine 446) in the α subunit C terminus (23Levy M. Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 6495-6502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine whether the two PKA and two PKC sites present in the C terminus of Kv1.5 were involved in the PKC regulation of Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 interaction, we studied a C-terminal truncation of Kv1.5 (ΔC57Kv1.5) that is missing these potential phosphorylation sites. As illustrated in Fig. 3 D, the Kvβ1.3 subunit induced its characteristic fast inactivation upon this truncated channel, and calphostin C continued to negate the β-induced inactivation and voltage shift (panels E and F, respectively). Thus, the phosphorylation sites in the Kv1.5 C terminus play no role in either the β-induced inactivation or voltage shift or the PKC regulation of these processes. The Kvβ1 isoforms are produced by alternative splicing of the N terminus. Thus, the N-terminal amino acids differ completely between isoforms, whereas the C-terminal 329 amino acids are identical (4England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, panels A–C, examine the effect of calphostin C treatment on the current generated by Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.2 co-expression. As shown in panel A, Kvβ1.2 confers a rapid inactivation onto Kv1.5 and, as with Kvβ1.3, Kvβ1.2 induces a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve. Panel B shows that calphostin C reduces the β-induced inactivation, and panel C shows that calphostin C returned the activation curve to the position observed in the absence of any β subunit. Therefore, the mechanism of calphostin C action is shared between Kvβ1.3 and β1.2. The Kvβ2.1 protein is derived from a different gene and has a unique N terminus and only 85% identity in the C-terminal region as compared with the Kvβ1 family (4England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This subunit does not confer fast inactivation onto the Kv1.5 channel, but it does produce a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve (7Uebele V.N. England S.K. Chaudhary A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2406-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Panels D and E in Fig. 4 indicate that calphostin C had no effect on Kvβ2.1 action during the 250-ms depolarizing stimulus to +60 mV. Importantly, panel F shows that calphostin C failed to shift the activation curve toward that observed in the absence of any β subunit (V1/2 = 2.7 ± 1.0 mV). Thus, Kvβ2.1 subunit action, which is primarily a 10–12-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve, is resistant to calphostin C treatment. One possible interpretation of the results presented above is that calphostin C either inhibited α/β assembly or induced dissociation of the α/β complexes already on the cell surface. However, it is unlikely that calphostin C was affecting subunit assembly during de novo synthesis, since as little as 30 min of calphostin C treatment was required to remove the inactivation and voltage shift. This amount of time is insufficient to replace all cell surface protein with newly synthesized material, especially at room temperature, because the turnover rate for the Kv1.5 channel is approximately 4 h at 37 °C (24Takimoto K. Fomina A.F. Gealy R. Trimmer J.S. Levitan E.S. Neuron. 1993; 11: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, since subunit dissociation remained a possibility, we constructed a tandem α/β complex in which the C terminus of Kvβ1.3 was fused with the N terminus of Kv1.5. As shown in Fig. 5, this tandem construct retained wild type α/β activity in terms of fast inactivation and the activation midpoint (69.48 ± 2.15% inactivation at +60 mV and 250 ms, V1/2 = −21.47 ± 4.19 mV, n = 12) (panels A and B, respectively). Fig. 5, C and D show that this tandem also had the typical response to calphostin C in that both the fast inactivation and hyperpolarizing voltage shift were removed (22.93 ± 3.07% inactivation at +60 mV and 250 ms, activation midpoint = -9.82 ± 8.64 mV, n = 6). Thus, PKC activity is unlikely to be modulating subunit assembly in this expression system. The Kvβ1.3 subunit alters the function of Kv1.5 by mainly conferring a rapid but incomplete inactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve. Although the PKC inhibitor calphostin C had only minor effects on the current produced by Kv1.5 alone, this agent dramatically altered the current observed in the presence of the Kvβ1.3 subunit. The fast inactivation was removed by calphostin C treatment as was the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve (Table I). There was also a change in the slope of the activation curve in the presence of calphostin C. However, this slope change is likely to be related to removal of the β-induced inactivation. It is inherently difficult to compare activation curves between Kv1.5 alone and Kv1.5 in the presence of an inactivation-inducing β subunit, for the β-induced inactivation probably affects the peak tail currents as previously discussed (9Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C1485-C1495Crossref Google Scholar) and, thus, artificially alters any activation curve generated from peak tail currents. Still, Kvβ1.3 does enhance the voltage sensitivity independent of the induced inactivation, since a hyperpolarizing voltage shift occurs with the Kvβ1.3 N-terminal truncation, and calphostin C treatment returns this activation curve to that observed in the absence of any β subunit (Fig. 3 C). Also arguing against α/β dissociation is the fact that forced assembly via use of the α/β tandem shows the expected calphostin C response. However, it remains possible that calphostin C does induce dissociation with separate proteins, but dissociation is not observed when the two subunits are physically linked, since reassociation is highly favored under these conditions.Table ISummary of the calphostin C-induced effects on the channel kineticsActivation midpoint% Inactivation at +60 mVNumber of experimentsmVKv1.5 Control−2.7 ± 1.08 ± 0.29 Calphostin C (3 μm)0.2 ± 1.96 ± 0.068Kvβ1.3/Kv1.5 Control−21.9 ± 1.466 ± 1.97 PMA (10 μm)−22.6 ± 0.965 ± 3.78 Calphostin C (3 μm)−4.3 ± 2.01-aDenotes statistically significant differences.11 ± 0.251-aDenotes statistically significant differences.10 Okadaic acid (3 μm) + calphostin C−17.6 ± 2.21-aDenotes statistically significant differences.38 ± 1.81-aDenotes statistically significant differences.7DN68Kvβ1.3/Kv1.5 Control−15.6 ± 1.67 ± 0.086 Calphostin C (3 μm)−4.4 ± 2.21-aDenotes statistically significant differences.4 ± 0.045DC57Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 Control−22.1 ± 2.067 ± 25 Calphostin C (3 μm)−1.3 ± 2.31-aDenotes statistically significant differences.9 ± 0.41-aDenotes statistically significant differences.6Kvβ1.2/Kv1.5 Control−22.2 ± 1.457 ± 2.66 Calphostin C (3 μm)−2.1 ± 2.01-aDenotes statistically significant differences.16 ± 0.61-aDenotes statistically significant differences.6Kvβ2.1/Kv1.5 Control−18.7 ± 1.37 ± 0.155 Calphostin C (3 μm)−16.5 ± 2.16 ± 0.065Kvβ1.3/Kv1.5 tandem Control−21.47 ± 4.1969.48 ± 2.1510 Calphostin C (1 μm)−9.82 ± 8.641-aDenotes statistically significant differences.22.93 ± 3.071-aDenotes statistically significant differences.4Parameters are determined as described in text.

Care must be exercised to avoid studying a direct action of calphostin C on ion channel function as opposed to modulating kinase pathways. However, calphostin C had little effect on the current produced by Kv1.5 alone. If calphostin C was having a direct effect on the Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 complex, there would be no preincubation requirement, and okadaic acid would not be expected to antagonize its action. Furthermore, an inactive analog of okadaic acid, okadaic acid tetraacetate (25Swain J.E. Robitaille R. Dass G.R. Charlton M.P. J. Neurobiol. 1991; 22: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), did not antagonize calphostin C action (data not shown). Bisindolylmaleimide, another PKC inhibitor, also prevented the Kvβ1.3-induced inactivation. However, an effect of this inhibitor was observed in only 5 of 10 experiments, and the activation curve was not shifted (data not shown). These data may suggest that complete PKC block is required to shift the activation curve, whereas only a partial block is needed to inhibit inactivation. Alternatively, different PKC isoforms could be involved that show differential inhibitor sensitivity, as has been previously described by other investigators in other systems (23Levy M. Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 6495-6502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Watts S.W. Cox D.A. Johnson B.G. Schoepp D.D. Cohen M.L.

Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Inhibitor peptides that block Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms did not alter Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 interaction (data not shown). This finding agrees with the fact that the BAPTA present in the intracellular solution does not alter Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 current, which is expected if Ca2+-insensitive PKC isoforms are involved in regulating subunit interaction. Two major questions raised by the data presented here are, 1) is direct PKC phosphorylation of the Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 complex occurring, and 2) if direct phosphorylation is occurring, which sites are phosphorylated? Our working hypothesis is that PKC phosphorylation of either the α or β subunit is required to render the Kv1.5 channel sensitive to the β-induced inactivation and voltage shift. Multiple PKC isozymes have been reported in HEK 293 cells (28Martel J. Dupuis G. Deschenes P. Payet M.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as PKC activity in the absence of PKC activators (29Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7155-7161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Eilers H. Schaeffer E. Bickler P.E. Forsayeth J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that aspects of this signaling system are constitutively active and that removal of this phosphorylation requires the use of PKC inhibitors. The time required to observe the calphostin C effects, 1 h on average, is consistent with this proposed mechanism; for time is required for the calphostin C to enter the cell and inhibit the required PKC isoform. Additional time is required for dephosphorylation via protein phosphatases. Also supporting this scenario is the finding that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (22Sheppeck J.E.N. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that alone has no effect on Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 current (data not shown), inhibits the calphostin C effects on both the inactivation and hyperpolarizing voltage shift. Kv channel α and β subunits are basally phosphorylated, and these phosphorylation events probably occur early in biosynthesis (31Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shi G. Kleinklaus A.K. Marrion N.V. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

Hence, it is likely that the channel complex is stably phosphorylated on PKC sites and that this phosphorylation is required for complete α/β functional interaction. Where such a single phosphorylation site may exist is at present unknown. Many potential PKC consensus sequences exist in both the Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.3 proteins (34Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Since the Kvβ1.2 subunit, but not the Kvβ2.1 subunit, is sensitive to calphostin C (Fig. 4), we examined these C-terminal sequences for differences in possible PKC phosphorylation sites. Serine 314 in Kvβ1.3 could be phosphorylated by PKC, and the corresponding site is absent in Kvβ2.1. However, mutation of this serine in Kvβ1.3 to alanine had no effect on the control currents or the calphostin C response (data not shown). Either other sites are involved or there is no direct PKC phosphorylation of the α/β complex. For example, PKC can modulate tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of Kv1.5 expressed without a β subunit (12Huang X.-Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In summary, there is no reason at present to believe we are dealing with only a single PKC site on either the Kv1.5 or Kvβ1.3 proteins that must be phosphorylated to allow the β-induced inactivation and voltage shift. Additional experiments are required to define the mechanism by which calphostin C removes the β-induced inactivation and hyperpolarizing voltage shift in the Kv1.5/Kvβ1.3 complex. Since the bisindolylmaleimide does not fully mimic the calphostin C and all known PKC isoforms that are sensitive to both agents, it is possible that a kinase other than PKC is involved. Whatever the exact mechanism, the data presented here introduce additional complexity to the topic of β subunit modulation of Kv channel function.

The capping structure of this HNK-1 epitope is the same as those found in glycolipids such as sulfo→3GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glcβ→ceramide (9Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C.

The expression of HNK-1 glycan is spatially and temporally regulated and is found on migrating neural crest cells, cerebellum, and myelinating Schwann cells in motor neurons but not on those in the sensory neurons (11Bronner-Fraser M.

Neural outgrowth of mouse motor neurons was facilitated much better by HNK-1 glycolipid substratum than sulfatide or GD1b ganglioside substratum (14Martini R. Xin Y. Schmitz B. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Complementary to this finding, the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by HNK-1 glycan was not observed once the sulfate group was removed (15Mohan P.S. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the homophilic interaction of P0 depends on carbohydrate-protein interaction and anti-HNK-1 antibody inhibits this interaction (16Filbin M.T. Tennekoon G.I.

Res. 1992; 33: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of HNK-1 glycan in molecular details, we and others have cloned a sulfotransferase HNK-1ST that forms HNK-1 glycan on neural cell adhesion molecule and glycolipids (18Ong E.

This was possible because β1,3-glucuronosyltransferase that forms a HNK-1 precursor structure was cloned before (20Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When we compared the amino acid sequence of HNK-1ST to those of Golgi-associated sulfotransferases cloned before (21Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J.

Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although we did not initially detect its homology with cytosolic sulfotransferases, subsequent studies revealed that there are two regions in the catalytic domain that are shared by all sulfotransferases cloned so far (25Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. Trends Glycosci. and Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 65-80Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This homology was also proposed because the crystal structure of a mouse estrogen sulfotransferase became available (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the amino acid residues involved in the interaction with the 5′-phosphosulfate or 3′-phosphate group of PAPS were identified (Fig. 1). The studies thus revealed that a lysine or arginine residue is shared by all sulfotransferases cloned to date in the 5′-phosphosulfate binding (5′-PSB)1 site and an arginine residue is shared by almost all sulfotransferases at the 3′-phosphate binding (3′-PB) motif (25Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K.

Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Moreover, the entirely conserved serine residue at the 3′-PB loop apparently provides a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group of 3′-phosphate (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not reveal how those or other amino acids are involved in the interaction with an acceptor substrate. In the present study, we individually mutated five different amino acid residues in the 5′-PSB and 3′-PB sites of HNK-1ST by site-directed mutagenesis. We first assayed those mutant enzymes for transfer of [35S]sulfate from [35S]PAPS, and then catalytic properties were obtained. Those mutants were also assayed for their binding to a PAP analogue of PAPS. Finally, these results were interpreted in relation to a three-dimensional structure inferred from the crystal structures determined for estrogen sulfotransferase and the human heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/sulfotransferase, HSNST (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that these two regions of the catalytic domain, in particular those amino acids in 5′-PSB site, are involved in the interaction with both acceptor and donor substrates. The cDNA encoding HNK-1ST was cloned as described previously (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a catalytic domain of HNK-1ST fused with an IgG-binding domain of protein A was constructed as described before (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The plasmid, pcDNAI-A·HNK-1ST (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), encoding a soluble protein A-HNK-1ST fusion protein was digested with Bam HI and Spe I to release a 1.6-kilobase pair cDNA fragment. pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was digested with the same restriction enzymes and ligated to the HNK-1ST fragment to give plasmid pBSII KS+-HNK-1ST. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on this plasmid using a ChameleonTMdouble-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 30Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated oligonucleotides covering conservative or nonconservative amino acid replacement were synthesized and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before use. Following site-directed mutagenesis of the required amino acid residue on pBSII KS+-HNK-1ST, a 0.53-kilobase pair fragment flanked by Bsu 36I and Bam HI and containing the specific codon replacement was sequenced to confirm the correct sequence. This 0.53-kilobase pair DNA fragment was released by digestion with Bsu 36I and Bam HI and was used to replace the corresponding sequence in the wild type DNA sequence in pcDNAI-A·HNK-1ST. The plasmid pcDNAI-A·HNK-1ST containing the appropriate mutation was transfected into COS-1 cells using LipofectAMINE® Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following 24 h of growth in a complete medium at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with serum-free OptiMEM solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium containing the fusion protein was collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The fusion protein was isolated by adsorption to IgG-Sepharose 6FF beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (31Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After washing, the fusion protein-containing beads were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, at 50% suspension volume. This was used as the enzyme source. Appropriate controls (both wild type and mock-transfected reactions) were performed. HNK-1ST and the mutant enzymes released were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their amount was estimated by Western blot analysis using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (30Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) purchased from ICN. The acceptor, GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→octyl was synthesized as described previously (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Ding Y. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of the acceptor and the donor, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate, were mixed and dried down under vacuum. The material was then redissolved in 40 μl of a solution containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MnCl2. To this, 10 μl of the 50% suspension of the enzyme solution, prepared as described above, was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with constant, gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding 450 μl of 250 mm ammonium formate, pH 4. The labeled products were applied to C18 reverse-phase chromatography columns (Alltech) and eluted with 70% methanol. A portion of the eluted product was subjected to scintillation counting. Relative activity was measured and standardized against the values obtained for the wild type after subtraction of the background activity for the mock samples. The Km for wild type HNK-1ST and mutant enzymes exhibiting detectable enzymatic activity was determined using a Lineweaver-Burk plot at various concentrations of the acceptor (2.5 μm to 2000 μm) and donor (1 μm to 2000 μm). Following the transfection protocol as described above, the culture medium (20 ml) from the transfected cells was concentrated approximately 20-fold using Centriprep-10 spin columns (Amicon). The concentrated medium containing the enzyme (100 μl) was mixed with 900 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 5 mm MnCl2, applied to 1 ml of adenosine-3′, 5′-diphosphate-agarose (Sigma), washed, and equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, as described previously (33Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After washing the beads with 4 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, the bound enzyme was eluted with a NaCl linear gradient (0–500 mm) with increasing NaCl at 25 mm/ml. The eluted sample (200 μl) from each fraction (1 ml) was coated onto a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After blocking the wells with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (200 μl) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 80, 200 μl of a chromogenic substrate (0.1 mg of o- phenylenediamine/ml of 50 mmphosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5, containing 0.003% H2O2) was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature to allow sufficient color to develop, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2 n sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 490 nm was read using a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad). The active site of HNK-1ST was modeled using the estrogen sulfotransferase and the HSNST coordinates (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The program “O” was utilized to make the changes to the sequence using the program Molscript (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeledgaard M. Acta Crystallography. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that HNK-1ST can be expressed as a soluble protein fused with protein A (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such a soluble chimeric protein has a significant activity and is judged to reflect approximately the catalytic activity of the enzyme present in Golgi (18Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we took advantage of this property, and a soluble chimeric HNK-1ST was used throughout the studies. As shown in Fig. 2, the wild type enzyme exhibits an activity profile typical for a transferase, and substrate inhibition or acceptor inhibition was not observed. We then individually mutated amino acid residues Lys128 in the 5′-PSB site and Arg189, Asp190, Pro191, and Ser197 in the 3′-PB motif (see Fig.1 also). After these mutated enzymes and the wild type enzyme were expressed, the expression of each enzyme was estimated by Western blot analysis using rabbit IgG as a probe because the protein A portion of the chimeric protein can bind to rabbit IgG (Fig.3). After adjusting the amount of the enzyme, the catalytic activity of each enzyme preparation was assayed using standard incubation conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Figure 3Comparison of the amount of wild type and mutant HNK-1ST used. The chimeric enzymes were released from IgG-Sepharose by heating in the sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies. Molecular mass markers are on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, almost no activity remained when Lys128, Arg189, Asp190, Pro191, and Ser197 were individually mutated to an alanine residue. In contrast, the conservative mutation of K128R and D190E maintained 15 and 60% of the activity compared with that of wild type. Mutation of R189K or P191G, on the other hand, was not tolerated, and the mutant enzymes completely lost the activity. To determine how these mutations cause a change in the binding to PAPS, the wild type HNK-1ST and each mutated enzyme were individually applied to a column of PAP-agarose, and the bound enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl. The eluted enzymes were immunochemically detected using rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate. As shown in Fig.5 A, the wild type enzyme bound to the column in a biphasic way, and the majority of the bound enzyme was eluted after the gradient elution of NaCl started. Similar results were reported in a flavonol sulfotransferase (33Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, K128A mutant barely bound to PAP-agarose, whereas the K128R mutant enzyme bound to the same column as much as the wild type enzyme. In a similar assay, the R189K, R189A, S197T, and S197A mutant enzymes did not bind to the PAP-agarose column (Fig. 5, B and D), whereas D190E bound well to the same column (Fig.5 C). These results demonstrated that K128R and D190E mutations did not significantly affect the binding to PAPS, whereas the conservative mutation of R189K and S197T dramatically reduced the binding to PAPS. The above results indicate that the conservative mutation at Lys128 and Asp190 did not significantly affect the binding to PAPS but reduced the catalytic activity. To determine whether such a decrease in activity was due to impaired binding to the acceptor, the enzyme activity was determined using varying concentrations of donor substrate PAPS or the acceptor, GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→octyl. The results shown in Fig. 2, A and B, were replotted for the Lineweaver-Burk plot as seen in Fig. 2, C and D. The Km for the donor substrate PAPS is almost the same between the wild type (66 μm) and the D190E mutant (70 μm) and is even better for the K128R mutant (12 μm) than for the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the Km value for the acceptor was 316 μm for the wild type enzyme and increased 5.6-fold for K128R mutant (1776 μm) and 2.4-fold for D190E mutant (744 μm), respectively. These results suggest that Lys128 and Asp190 may be involved in the binding to the acceptor or very close to the acceptor binding site (see also under “Discussion”). Comparison of sulfotransferases cloned to date revealed that there are two amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among different sulfotransferases (Fig. 1). In the present study, we first demonstrated that mutations of Arg189, Pro191, and Ser197 inactivate the enzyme, indicating that these amino acid residues are important for either binding to the donor PAPS or maintaining the conformation of the enzyme for transfer of the sulfate group to the acceptor molecule. All mutations of these amino acids, including conservative replacement, resulted in the loss of PAPS binding in these mutant enzymes (Fig. 5). These results confirm the previous conclusions that 5′-phosphosulfate and 3′-phosphate binding sites are critical for the binding to PAPS (25Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. Trends Glycosci. and Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 65-80Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More importantly, the present study also revealed that the mutations at Lys128 and Asp190 can be tolerated well for the binding to PAPS, and such a binding became even better after mutation of Lys128 to Arg. The excellent binding of these mutant enzymes to PAPS can be seen in both affinity chromatography using PAP-agarose (Fig. 4) and in kinetic studies (Fig. 2). In contrast, the same kinetic studies showed that these mutant have lower affinity to the acceptor, GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→octyl (Fig.2). These results suggest that these two amino acids may be more intimately involved in the binding of an acceptor than in the binding of a donor substrate. No studies are available on the mutation of Asn131 in the estrogen sulfotransferase, which corresponds to Asp190 in HNK-1ST, although crystal structural studies showed that Arg130, which is next to Asn131, interacts with the 3′-phosphate group of PAP (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our mutation experiments demonstrated that the mutation of Arg189 to either Lys or Ala resulted in the complete loss of the enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). The loss of the activity was accompanied by the loss in the binding to PAP (Fig. 5). The present study also demonstrated that mutation of Asp190to Glu did not inactivate the enzyme, whereas mutation of Arg189 to Lys completely inactivated the enzyme. These results may suggest that Arg189 is critical in the binding to a 3′-phosphate group of PAPS, whereas Asp190 is involved in the binding to an acceptor. However, these results need to be evaluated in relation to the three-dimensional structure of HNK-1ST. The crystal structures of the estrogen sulfotransferase and HSNST demonstrated that the structure of the 5′-PSB and 3′-PB sites is well conserved in these two different enzymes (27Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results, together with the results obtained in the present study, allow us to propose a possible three-dimensional structural model of HNK-1ST, as shown in Fig. 6. Concerning the 3′-PB site, Arg189 and Ser197can interact directly with the 3′-phosphate group of PAP in the model, thus, mutations of Arg189 and Ser197 can profoundly alter PAPS binding, affecting HNK-1ST activity. Asp190 and Pro191 are not in a position to interact directly with the PAP molecule. They reside in a transition of secondary structure from a β-sheet to an α-helix, making for a very tight turn of about 90° (Fig. 6). Through its interactions with backbone N atoms of residues 192 and 193 in the following α-helix, Asp190 may help to stabilize this turn. Thus, mutation of Asp190 may alter the core structure of the PAP binding site, affecting indirectly HNK-1ST activity. Pro191 may also be involved in the stabilization because its mutation abolished HNK-1ST activity. These residues (Arg189, Ser197, Asp190, and Pro191) are located more than 20 Å from the nearest atom in the glucuronic acid molecule and the PAP molecule than the glucuronic acid molecule. They are not in a position to interact directly with the acceptor molecule for HNK-1ST. It would be more of an indirect effect, if any mutations of these residues affected the binding of the acceptor. The R(D/N)P sequence may thus be conserved to maintain the structure of the PAPS binding site. Lys128 (or Arg in some sulfotransferases) is conserved in the 5′-PSB site of all known sulfotransferases (Fig. 1). It can form hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphate group of PAP and is involved in catalysis. Mutations of this residue inactivated HNK-1ST, except that K128R still maintains some of the original activity. Lys128is 9 Å away from the 3-hydroxyl group of the glucuronic acid molecule and is unlikely to interact directly with the acceptor of HNK-1ST. In the mouse estrogen sulfotransferase, the K48R mutation in the 5′-PSB site did not change Km of the enzyme for either estrogen or PAP (35Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K128R mutation of HNK-1ST increased Km toward glucuronic acid in the acceptor molecule more than 5-fold. In the model, the end of the side chain of Arg (at the position of Lys128) can be moved to within 3.2 Å of the 3-hydroxyl group of the glucuronic acid molecule (Fig. 6). A bulkier nonplaner substrate of HNK-1ST may actually come closer to the position of the mutated Arg. Thus the K128R mutation could have an effect on the binding of the acceptor in HNK-1ST. In the mouse estrogen sulfotransferase, Lys48 corresponds to Lys128 in HNK-1ST. In contrast to the results obtained in the present study, the mutation of Lys48 to Arg did not change the Km toward estrogen or PAPS in a previous study (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeledgaard M. Acta Crystallography. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The importance of Lys48 was, however, demonstrated because its mutation to methionine completely inactivated the enzyme in the same study. These results indicate that Lys128 in the HNK-1ST is closer to an acceptor than Lys48 in the estrogen sulfotransferase. This difference is probably due to the difference in acceptor structures (Fig. 6). The present study demonstrated that HNK-1ST and estrogen sulfotransferase share many of the structural requirements for the enzymatic activity. The study, on the other hand, also indicates that acceptor binding sites of different enzymes are distinct from one another. Further studies on the three-dimensional structure of HNK-1ST will be of significance to determine how the acceptor is recognized by the enzyme and provide critical information on the three-dimensional structure of the acceptor oligosaccharide.

Maintenance of oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte progenitor cells requires basic fibroblast growth factor, a growth factor whose action normally depends on a heparan sulfate coreceptor. Biochemical analysis revealed a most surprising result: that the oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte progenitors did not synthesize heparan sulfate, the near ubiquitous N-sulfated cell surface polysaccharide, but the chemically related heparin in a form that was almost completely N- and O-sulfated. The heparin was detected in the pericellular fraction of the cells and the culture medium. In contrast the differentiated glial subpopulations (oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes) synthesized typical heparan sulfate but with distinctive fine structural features for each cell type. Thus heparin is a unique differentiation marker in the glial lineage. Previously heparin has been found only in a subset of mature mast cells called the connective tissue mast cells. Its presence within the developing nervous system on a precise population of progenitors may confer specific and essential recognition properties on those cells in relation to binding soluble growth and/or differentiation factors and the extracellular matrix.

Raff M.C. Nature. 1986; 323: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Small numbers of O-2A progenitors are found in the nerve as early as embryonic day 15 (2Small R.K. Riddle P. Noble M.

Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The O-2A progenitors represent one of the few cell types in which most aspects of differentiation and proliferation can be manipulated in a controlled in vitro environment. O-2A progenitors grown in chemically defined medium in the absence of mitogen differentiate rapidly into oligodendrocytes without additional signals (6Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M.

Differentiation can be inhibited and O-2A progenitor proliferation maintained by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) used either alone or in combination with PDGFA (12Bogler O. Wren D. Barnett S.C.

It is now well established that many growth factors and cytokines act on target cells via a dual receptor system in which one relatively low affinity receptor facilitates transfer to a higher affinity species essential for cell signaling. In the case of bFGF, and other members of the fibroblast growth factor family, the low affinity receptor is heparan sulfate (HS) (13Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M.

The long splice variant of PDGFA falls into the latter category (19Kelly J.L. Sanchez A. Brown G.S. Chesterman C.N. Sleigh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Andersson M. Ostman A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol.

Permutations in HS structure arise from non-random but variable O-sulfation of saccharides within N-sulfated sections (sulfated domains) of the sugar chain and their immediate flanking sequences. These hypervariable sulfated regions are separated by extended sequences of N-acetylated saccharides of low or zero sulfation (reviewed in Ref. 25Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This pattern distinguishes HS from the chemically related heparin, which is essentially highly sulfated along its entire length and in contrast to the ubiquitously distributed HS has so far been found only in a subgroup of mast cells, called the connective tissue mast cells (26Linhart R.J. Ampofo S.A. Fareed J. Hoppensteadt D. Mulliken J.B. Folkman J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12441-12445Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Studies from a number of groups have shown that the patterns of expression of HSPG core proteins and the structure of HS chains are developmentally regulated and tightly controlled at the cellular level (27David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Der Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Such changes modify cell responses to extrinsic growth and differentiation factors and may provide guidance cues for axonal pathfinding in the nervous system (29Walz A. McFarlane S. Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Holt C.E. Development. 1997; 124: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the following investigation, the primary O-2A cells were utilized to study changes in HS composition during differentiation of the bipotential progenitor cells into the two functionally and morphologically distinct glial cell lineages. A remarkable switch from heparin expression in the O-2A progenitors to distinctive HS species in the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes was observed. PDGFA and bFGF for cell culture were gifts from C. George-Nascimento and L. Coussens (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA), recombinant human insulin growth factor-1 a gift from Genentech, ciliary neurotrophic factor from Frank Collins (Synergen) and recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor from John Heath. Recombinant bFGF used in the affinity experiments was given by David Fernig (Liverpool, United Kingdom (UK)). Poly-l-lysine (Mr 175,000), bovine pancreatic insulin, human transferrin, progesterone, putrescine, l-thyroxine, selenium, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and keratanase (endo-β-galactosidase, EC 3.2.1.103) were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). Bovine serum albumin was from Miles Laboratories Inc. d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (20–45 Ci/mol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Stevenage, UK). Heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7) and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinase II (no EC number assigned) and heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8) were obtained from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney Island, UK). Bio-Gel P10 and Affi-Gel 10 were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hemel Hampstead, UK), Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sephacel from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (St Albans, UK), and ProPac PA1 analytical columns from Dionex (Camberley, Surrey, UK). Trizol, Superscript II, oligo(dT) primers, and Elongase polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc. The Advantage PCR pure kit was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). O-2A progenitor cells were isolated from the corpus callosum from 7-day-old rats in order to obtain the number of cells for the biochemical assays. The procedure used was as described previously for the isolation of progenitors from the optic nerve (6Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M. Nature. 1983; 303: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 7Noble M. Murray K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2243-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Progenitor cells were purified using a specific antibody capture assay adapted to the O-2A lineage, which reproducibly yields cell populations that are 95–100% pure (31Raff M.C. Lillien L.E. Richardson W.D. Burne J.F. Noble M. Nature. 1988; 333: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The O-2A progenitor cells were then either maintained as progenitors in the presence of 10 ng/ml bFGF and 10 ng/ml PDGFA (12Bogler O. Wren D. Barnett S.C. Land H. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Differentiation to oligodendrocytes was achieved by culture in the presence of PDGFA alone (32Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and to type-2 astrocytes by addition of 10% fetal calf serum (6Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M. Nature. 1983; 303: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Cell populations that were generated by in vitro differentiation were harvested at a time point where the differentiation process is complete to ensure 99–100% pure homogenous populations (7 days for oligodendrocytes and 4 days for astrocytes). This purity of the cultures was confirmed by staining control dishes with either anti-GalC (a marker for oligodendrocytes) or anti-GFAP, which is expressed on astrocytes. HS and other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were biosynthetically labeled by incubating the cultures with 10 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 48 h, to enable tracing of the material in the subsequent experiments by scintillation counting. 3H-GAGs were analyzed from the medium, trypsin-released (pericellular), and intracellular fractions. The medium was removed from the cells, and after washing in PBS the cells were treated with 3 ml of 50 μg/ml trypsin in PBS plus 2 mm EGTA per flask for 10 min at 37 °C. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (250 μg/ml) was added, the cell suspension was pelleted in a bench-top centrifuge (1,000 rpm for 10 min), and the supernatant (i.e. pericellular fraction) was removed. The cell pellet was digested with 0.5 mg/ml Pronase in 5 ml of PBS for approximately 16 h at 37 °C, centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm, and the supernatant (intracellular fraction) taken for analysis. Each fraction was initially purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (1 cm × 5 cm) equilibrated in PBS. The GAGs were eluted with a gradient of 0.15–1.5 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at 10 ml/h. Fractions containing radiolabeled GAGs were pooled, desalted by G50 gel filtration chromatography (1 cm × 35 cm column) in 0.1m NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. The different GAG types were identified and separated from the heparin/HS using specific degradation enzymes. Briefly HA was detected by treatment with 1 mg/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase in 0.1 m NaAc, 0.15m NaCl, pH 5.0, for approximately 16 h at 37 °C. Similarly, CS/DS was identified by their sensitivity to chondroitinase ABC (32Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and keratan sulfate by digestion with 1 unit/ml keratanase in 0.2 m NaAc, pH 7.4, for 16 h at 37 °C. The extent of degradation was determined by Sephadex G50 gel filtration chromatography. HS and heparin were detected by their sensitivity to low pH nitrous acid (33Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). HS chains were released from proteoglycan core proteins by alkali borohydride treatment and the molecular size distribution determined by CL6B gel chromatography (34Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Heparinase III enzyme digestion was carried out as described by Stringer and Gallagher (34Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Complete depolymerization of the HS chains was carried out by initially digesting with two additions of 20 mIU/ml heparinase I in 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, over at least 18 h and subsequently digesting with two additions of 20 mIU/ml amounts of both heparinase II and III. The extent of breakdown was determined by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography. The disaccharides produced by combined heparinase digestion were repeatedly lyophilized to remove NH4HCO3 and separated by strong anion exchange chromatography on a ProPac column linked to an Anachem HPLC system, equilibrated with double-distilled acidified water, pH 3.0. After sample injection in 2 ml of acidified water, the column was washed with 2 ml of acidified water, followed by elution in a two-step gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, pH 3.0, over 45 ml, then 1–2 m NaCl, pH 3.0, over 3 ml. Disaccharides were identified by comparison with elution positions of eight known standards. To prepare a bFGF affinity gel column, 200 μg of recombinant bFGF was mixed with 200 μg of heparin in 100 μl of coupling buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 80 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The bFGF was then bound to Affi-Gel 10, and the column prepared as described for a hepatocyte growth factor affinity column by Lyon et al. (17Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alongside a control column where the bFGF was omitted. Affinity experiments were performed by application of radiolabeled HS or CS/DS samples in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and pH 7.3. The sample of HS was recirculated through the column at least five times at room temperature to maximize its opportunity to bind to bFGF. The sample was then eluted by a stepwise NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 2.0 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and monitored for radioactivity. Total RNA was isolated from cells or whole tissues by a modification of the guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method using Trizol reagent. cDNA was synthesized from 1–5 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction using Superscript II, a modified Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and oligo(dT)12–18primers according to the Life Technologies, Inc. protocol. Aliquots of cDNA, equivalent to 1/20 of the above reaction, were used in a 50-μl PCR reaction. PCR amplification was performed using Elongase polymerase under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The 5′ and 3′ primers, all written 5′ to 3′, are glypican, GACATACACATTCAGACCC, CTAAGAAACCCACAGACC (product 393 bp); syndecan 1, GACAACTTCTCTGGCTCAGG, CTTCGTCCTTCTTCTTCATCC (735 bp); syndecan 2, GACTATTCTTCTTCTGCCTCTGGC, GGTTTGCGTTCTCCAAGGTC (409 bp); syndecan 3, CCATGCGGTTCATTCCTGAC, CGATGGCATTGTCGTGGAG (800 bp); and syndecan 4, GTCATAGACCCCCAGGACC, CCCTTTTGGGAATGACCTC (267 bp). Reactions were run for 35 cycles. A 10-min incubation at 72 °C added at the end ensured complete extension. The PCR products were purified using the Advantage PCR-Pure kit and their authenticity checked by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion. RNA isolated from primary cultures of O-2A progenitor cells and from cultures allowed to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes was analyzed for expression of the most common HSPG types by RT-PCR. Expression of syndecans 1, 2, 3, and 4 and glypican was found in the progenitors, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. There was no indication of serglycin expression by RT-PCR using two different sets of mouse primers, as unlike the other proteoglycans mentioned there was no rat serglycin DNA sequence information available. RT-PCR analysis also showed that all of the three cell types expressed the bFGF receptor, FGFR2 type IIIc, with FGFR1 type IIIc additionally expressed by the oligodendrocytes (data not shown). Metabolically radiolabeled GAG saccharide chains were isolated and analyzed from primary cultures of O-2A progenitor cells and the differentiated cell types. In all cultures the majority of GAGs were found in the culture medium and CS/DS was consistently the major species (Fig. 1). There was very little intracellular material. HS/heparin, identified on the basis of nitrous acid susceptibility, was present in all cell types with a general tendency for the heparin/HS:CS/DS ratio to increase in the pericellular fraction. There was a dramatic depletion in the level of heparin/HS in the oligodendrocytes compared with the O-2A progenitors with an average decrease of 80% ± 20% in the pericellular fraction, coinciding with a drop in CS/DS levels. In the astrocytes there was always an increase of at least 2-fold in the level of CS in the medium compared with the progenitor cells. Small quantities of HA were present in all of the cultures, and a trace of keratan sulfate was found in the pericellular fraction of the progenitors in one of three preparations of the cells. The heparin/HS was further purified, and the size distribution for each cell type was determined by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL6B (Fig.2). The peak maxima for the progenitors, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes corresponded to Kav values of 0.52, 0.49, and 0.42 respectively (Fig. 2) equivalent to mean molecular masses of 20 ± 1.4, 25 ± 3.8, and 31 ± 2.4 kDa by reference to the published calibration of Wasteson (35Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). No differences were observed in the size range of material isolated from the medium and pericellular fractions for each cell type. The progenitor and oligodendrocyte heparin/HS showed broad size distributions typical of previously isolated HS species, while the astrocyte polysaccharide had a noticeably tighter distribution. Heparin/HS from the medium and pericellular compartments was depolymerized by nitrous acid degradation and heparinase III enzyme to compare their structures. The resultant fragments were separated on a Bio-Gel P10 column. In all cases the polysaccharide from the medium and pericellular compartments within each cell type showed essentially the same characteristics. Treatment with low pH nitrous acid, which cleaves at GlcNSO3 residues, gave striking results for the progenitor polysaccharide, where 94% of the material was broken down to disaccharides, indicating that the material has an N-sulfate content comparable to that of heparin (Fig.3 A). In contrast both the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes showed a typical HS breakdown pattern (Fig. 3, B and C) with a range of different sized nitrous acid-resistant fragments similar to HS extracted from a variety of other cell types (e.g. Ref. 36Desai U.R. Wang H.-M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overall the degrees of N-sulfation of the progenitors, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes were 95%, 42%, and 39%, respectively. It was noticeable that the nitrous acid-resistant fragments from the astrocytes HS contained a greater proportion of hexasaccharide and longer fragments than in the oligodendrocyte HS. Heparinase III is proposed to cleave the linkage GlcNAc/GlcNSO3(± 6S)α1,4GlcA/IdoA (36Desai U.R. Wang H.-M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with a preference for the GlcA-bearing disaccharides. It thereby attacks mainly in the non-sulfated regions releasing N-sulfated fragments enriched in IdoA(2S). The low level of heparinase III cleavage of the progenitor polysaccharide, about 5% susceptible linkages (Fig. 3 D), with most of the material eluting in the column void volume (Fig. 3 D) indicates an IdoA(2S)-rich, polysaccharide species (i.e. heparin). The switch to HS expression was clearly seen in the two differentiated cell types, the oligodendrocytes and the astrocytes, which had 49% and 54% heparinase III-susceptible linkages, respectively, with a range of different sized sulfated domains being identifiable in the elution profiles (Fig. 3, E and F). Again the profile of the astrocytes was distinct from the oligodendrocytes, with a greater proportion of the longer sulfated domains of decasaccharides and above. Disaccharides were prepared from the three cell types by combined heparinase digestion and separation on Bio-Gel P10, followed by strong anion-exchange HPLC. Analysis of the disaccharide composition (Fig.4 A) confirms the distinctive heparin nature of the progenitor HS, which contained 73% trisulfated disaccharides (UA(2S)-GlcNSO3(6S)) and no N-acetylated disaccharides (TableI). The contrast to the disaccharide elution profiles of the differentiated cell types is immediately apparent (Fig. 4, B and C), where a range of all of the eight disaccharide types commonly seen in HS were present (TableI). In both cases there was over 30% non-sulfated disaccharides and less than 15% were trisulfated. The disaccharide composition of the astrocytes was very similar to that found in human skin fibroblast HS (36Desai U.R. Wang H.-M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The oligodendrocytes HS disaccharide composition was distinct from the astrocytes, with a significantly higher level of the trisulfated disaccharide.Table IDisaccharide composition of HS from the progenitors and differentiated cellsDisaccharide standardProgenitorsOligosAstrocytes%%%1ΔHexA-GlcNAc035.643.02ΔHexA-GlcNSO31.120.025.13ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S)04.03.64ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc03.23.35ΔHexA-GlcNSO3(6S)23.55.43.56ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNSO32.817.817.57ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S)000.58ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNSO3(6S)72.614.03.5Disaccharides were prepared by exhaustive heparinase enzymes digestion of the [3H]HS/heparin from the O-2A progenitors, oligodendrocytes (oligos), and astrocytes, resolved by strong anion exchange HPLC as shown in Fig. 4 and quantified.

A. 1990; 87: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), the relative affinities of the different glial HS types for a bFGF Affi-Gel column were compared. In all cases the majority of HS eluted between 0.15 and 1 m NaCl, with a small amount of HS binding at high affinity up to at least 1.6m NaCl (Fig. 5). A control column did not exhibit any binding of HS above 0.15 m NaCl (data not shown). The progenitor heparin showed stronger binding to the bFGF Affi-Gel than the oligodendrocyte HS with a greater proportion of the material eluting at 0.8 m NaCl and above, while the astrocyte HS elution profile was more analogous to the progenitors. The bFGF affinity of the astrocyte HS was not significantly different from mouse fibroblast HS (Fig. 5 B) consistent with their similarity in composition (Fig. 3; Ref. 34Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CS/DS from the progenitors and oligodendrocytes showed much weaker binding to the bFGF Affi-Gel, the majority of material eluting between 0.15 m and 0.4m NaCl with no binding seen above 0.6 m NaCl (data not shown). The results in this paper clearly indicate that O-2A progenitor cells produce heparin (Figs. 3 and 4). Heparin has only previously been found in connective tissue mast cells. This finding was both interesting and unexpected, and on differentiation to either type-2 astrocytes or oligodendrocytes there was a switch to HS expression. Furthermore neuroepithelial cells, which are thought to be developmental precursors to the O-2A progenitor cells (38Rao M.S. Mayer-Proschel M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Mayer-Proschel M. Kalyani A. Mujitaba T. Rao M.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). During heparin/HS biosynthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 25Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem.

Thrombosis Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) enzymes commit the polymeric precursor heparan, composed of repeat sequences of GlcAβ1–4GlcNAc, to heparin or HS by catalyzing the conversion of an appropriate proportion of GlcNAc residues to GlcNSO3. The simplest explanation of the present results would be that the O-2A progenitors express the NDST isoform isolated from the heparin-synthesizing mouse mastocytoma (NDST2), which catalyzes conversion of over 80% of the GlcNAc residues to GlcNSO3 and the differentiated cells express the rat liver isoform (NDST1) assumed to be important for HS biosynthesis (43Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, these enzymes were found to be widely expressed in murine and human tissues, suggesting that the enzymes work in concert to achieve the level of N-sulfation appropriate to the cell type (43Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,44Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mastocytoma enzyme (NDST2) in a human kidney cell line resulted in highly N-sulfated heparin in which the other modifications, e.g. conversion of GlcA to IdoA and polymer O-sulfation were not enhanced (45Cheung W.-F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the overall structure of the polymer in any individual cell type depends on the coordinated expression of all the modifying enzymes and perhaps also on other regulatory proteins. In contrast to the connective tissue mast cells, where heparin is stored in intracellular secretory granules attached to the protease-resistant core protein serglycin (46Stevens R.L. Avraham S. Gartner M.C. Bruns G.A.P. Austen K.F. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7287-7291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the O-2A heparin was only found in the medium and pericellular (i.e. trypsin-releasable) fractions (Fig. 1). Furthermore, RT-PCR studies did not detect any expression of the serglycin proteoglycan (data not shown). RT-PCR studies indicated that all four syndecans and glypican HSPGs are expressed in the O-2A progenitors, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes but it cannot be certain that these O-2A proteoglycans bear the heparin chains. A novel HSPG that appears to be important in central nervous system development has been found in the primitive neuroepithelial cells (47Joseph S.J. Ford M.D. Barth C. Portbury S. Bartlett P.F. Nurcombe V. Greferath U. Development. 1996; 122: 3443-3452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are precursors to the O-2A cells. Analysis of the HS chains from embryonic day 10 (E10) and day 12 (E12) neuroepithelial precursor cells showed that changes in structure in the form of an increase in chain length and 6-O-sulfation in the more committed E12 cells (28Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) corresponded to a switch in growth factor response of the cells from bFGF in E10 to aFGF in E12. bFGF is also known to be important for the self-renewal property of the O-2A progenitors (12Bogler O. Wren D. Barnett S.C. Land H. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In this paper we found that the switch from heparin in the O-2A progenitors to the much lower sulfated HS in the oligodendrocytes corresponded to a significant decrease in the apparent bFGF affinity of the polysaccharide chains (Fig. 5). This might be expected, as both N-sulfation and 2-O-sulfation of the HS chains have been found to be important for bFGF binding (21Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while 6-O-sulfation appears to be critical for biological activation (48Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Caccia P. Dell'Era P. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Vasaina B. Presta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 49Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the astrocyte HS bound bFGF as efficiently as the more highly sulfated progenitor heparin (Fig. 5), possibly as a result of the prevalence of long sulfated domains (dodecasaccharides and larger) within the astrocyte HS (Fig.3 F). Although oligodendrocytes are postmitotic (51Lillien L.E. Raff M.C. Neuron. 1990; 5: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), they still respond to bFGF by down-regulation of myelin-specific markers, re-entrance into the cell cycle without mitosis, and increase in the length of cellular processes (52Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that this response to bFGF may be less reliant on the HS coreceptor, which is at low levels (Fig.1) and has low bFGF affinity (Fig. 5) than other cell systems (13Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar, 14Rapraeger A.C. Krufta A. Olwin B.B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and could possibly be mediated by the signaling receptor FGFR2 type IIIc, which is not found in the the progenitors or astrocytes. The long splice variant of the other key growth factor in this system, PDGFA (12Bogler O. Wren D. Barnett S.C. Land H. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), has recently been discovered to bind to highly sulfated heparin like oligosaccharides, enriched in the trisulfated disaccharides (24Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which form 74% of the O-2A progenitor heparin (Table I). PDGFA is critical for the timing of the O-2A progenitor differentation into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (31Raff M.C. Lillien L.E. Richardson W.D. Burne J.F. Noble M. Nature. 1988; 333: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 51Lillien L.E. Raff M.C. Neuron. 1990; 5: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and heparin may be essential in regulating the PDGFA response. The specific temporal expression of heparin, in the O-2A progenitors, during central nervous system development suggests that heparin must have a function critical to this lineage or to the adjacent neurons. It would be interesting to discover whether heparin is also produced by the subset of glioblastoma multiforme tumors believed to be derived from the small population of adult O-2A progenitor cells (53Noble M. Mayer-Proschel M. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1997; 35: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as it might enhance the activity of the myriad of autocrine growth factors mitogenic to glioblastomas (e.g. Refs. 54Libermann T.A.

Physiol. 1994; 158: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly, during injury of the central nervous system where reactive astrocytes are thought to revert to a more primitive state (for reviews, see Refs.58Norenberg M.D. Aschner M. Kimelberg H.K.K.

NeuroToxicol. 1998; 19: 269-282PubMed Google Scholar), reappearance of heparin expression could possibly aid their rapid response. Further study of the heparin produced by O-2A progenitors could give important insights into the control of heparin and HS biosynthesis and their role in both development and disease states.

Differentiated Trf-R− cells expressed more formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptor (fMLP-receptor) and ability of O⨪2 genaration, as markers of differentiation, than Trf-R+ cells, and Trf-R− cell differentiation was markedly accelerated by the incubation with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). On the other hand, Trf-R+ cells had a tendency to proliferate rather than differentiate, and proliferation was enhanced by G-CSF. These results indicate that Trf-R expression coincides with the commitment to proliferate or differentiate of HL-60 cells, and G-CSF accelerates these commitments. G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 in Trf-R−cells much more than in Trf-R+ cells. Protein 70 S6 kinase expression was higher in Trf-R+ cells than in Trf-R− cells. Furthermore, p70 S6 kinase was hyperphosphorylated by G-CSF in Trf-R+ cells, but not in Trf-R− cells. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase activity, inhibited G-CSF-dependent proliferation of Trf-R+ cells and increased fMLP-R expression on these cells. These results suggest that commitment to proliferation and differentiation in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells is preprogrammed and correlated with Trf-R expression, and G-CSF potentiates the cellular commitment.

The development of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow occurs via the differentiation of multipotential stem cells into progenitor cells that are committed to neutrophilic lineages (1Kanwar V.S. Cairo M.S. Abramson J.S. Wheeler J.G. The Neutrophil. IRL Press, New York1993: 1-21Google Scholar, 2Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As cells develop the characteristics of mature neutrophils, their proliferative ability decreases. However, the mechanism regulating proliferation and maturation of neutrophilic lineage cells remains unclear. Promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells differentiate into macrophages or neutrophils in response to various stimuli. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO),1retinoic acid (RA), and Bt2-cAMP cause neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells, whereas interferon and phorbol ester cause differentiation to macrophages (3Collins S.J.

These characteristics have made HL-60 cells extremely useful for studying proliferation and maturation of neutrophilic lineage cells. Developmental processes of neutrophilic lineage cells are thought to be controlled by several cytokines, which act synergistically in a homotypic or heterotypic manner. One of these cytokines, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), specifically works on cells restricted to the neutrophilic granulocyte lineage (6Nicola N.A. Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1987; 5: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that while G-CSF itself cannot induce neutrophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells, G-CSF potentiates the neutrophilic differentiation of RA- and Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (7Bollag W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 79: 87-91Google Scholar, 8Sakashita A. Nakamaki T. Tsuruoka N. Honma Y. Hozumi M. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A variety of G-CSF activities are mediated by a specific receptor for G-CSF (G-CSF-R). G-CSF-R is a member of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor family (10Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), and had no intrinsic kinase domain (11Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The transferrin receptor (Trf-R) plays an essential role in cell proliferation, as demonstrated by the fact that blocking receptor function causes cells to arrest near the G1-S phase boundary (23Neckers L.M. Cossman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3494-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Trowbridge I.S. Lopez F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trf-R is a homodimeric glycoprotein highly expressed in many proliferating normal and malignant cells as well as in hemoglobin-synthesizing cells. In many types of cells, the expression of the Trf-R increases when the cells are stimulated to proliferate but decreases upon cessation of the cell growth (26Cazzola M. Bergamaschi G. Dezza L. Arosio P. Blood. 1990; 75: 1903-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Neckers L.M. Pathobiology. 1991; 59: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is reported that the expression of Trf-R on neutrophilic lineage cells gradually decreases during maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that heterotypic Trf-R expression in neutrophilic lineage cells correlate with the commitment to proliferate or differentiate. The importance of p70 S6 kinase in cell cycle progression of numerous cells has been reported (28Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, it has not been reported whether or not G-CSF signaling cascade involves p70 S6 kinase. Furthermore, it remains unclear how this signaling pathway coincides with proliferation and differentiation of neutrophilic lineage cells. In this paper, we sorted Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells into Trf-R positive (Trf R+) and negative (Trf-R−) cells, and demonstrated that Trf-R+ cells tend to proliferate and Trf-R− cells tend to undergo neutrophilic differentiation. Furthermore, based on the analysis of G-CSF effects on Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells, we suggest that STAT 3 positively regulates the differentiation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells into neutrophils, while p70 S6 kinase promotes proliferation and negatively regulates neutrophilic differentiation.

Two days after the addition of differentiating agent, magnetic cell sorting was carried out. About 3 × 107 cells pretreated with Me2SO for 2 days were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtrated to avoid unintentional activation of Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells by cell debris. The filtrated supernatant was kept on ice during magnetic cell sorting as conditioned medium and soon used for subsequent culture. The pelleted cells were washed with sorting solution (PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), and then incubated with 100 μl of sorting solution containing mouse anti-human Trf-R antibody diluted 5-fold at 4 °C for 15 min. After washing, cells were incubated with 100 μl of sorting solution containing 75 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4 °C for 15 min. After resuspension in 0.5 ml of sorting solution, cells were applied to the separation column. The cells not adsorbed by the separation column were collected as Trf-R− cells, and the adsorbed cells were collected as Trf-R+ cells. The expressions of Trf-R and G-CSF-R on cells from Trf-R+ and Trf-R− fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry. After resuspension in conditioned medium at a density of approximately 2.5–5.0 × 105 cells/ml, cells were subsequently cultured for 5 days with or without 60 ng/ml G-CSF. The expression of fMLP-R was also analyzed by flow cytometry. In the study of the effect of rapamycin on differentiation of HL-60 cells, 20 ng/ml rapamycin was preincubated with cells for 30 min before the addition of G-CSF. The expression of Trf-R and HGF-R in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells was determined by flow cytometric methods. About 1 × 106 cells pretreated with Me2SO for various periods were collected and incubated with 50 μl of 0.5% BSA/PBS containing mouse anti-human Met antibody or mouse anti-human Trf-R antibody at 4 °C for 15 min. After washing, cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(abγ) fragment. After the incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5% BSA/PBS. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a Cyto ACE-150 Auto Cell Screener (JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The expressions of Trf-R and G-CSF-R on sorted cells was determined as follows. For Trf-R expression assay, cells which had been already labeled with mouse anti-human Trf-R antibody, were incubated with 50 μl of sorting solution containing FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody at 4 °C for 15 min. Washed cells were next resuspended in sorting solution, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. For G-CSF-R expression assay, cells were washed and incubated with 100 μl of sorting solution containing biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human G-CSF-R monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. They were then washed once more and incubated with 100 μl of sorting solution containing FITC-conjugated streptoavidin at 4 °C for 30 min. Washed cells were then resuspended, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. For the formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptor (fMLP-R) expression assay, sorted cells were subsequently cultured with or without G-CSF and/or rapamycin for 5 days. Cells were collected and washed with 1.5 ml of 0.5% BSA/PBS. They were then incubated with 50 μl of 0.5% BSA/PBS containing 100 nm FITC/fMLP at 4 °C for 30 min. Washed cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.5% BSA/PBS, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. For cell cycle analysis, sorted cells were subsequently cultured in conditioned media with or without G-CSF and/or rapamycin for 22 h. Cells were collected and washed with 5 ml of PBS(−), then fixed with 5 ml of 70% ethanol for 30 min. After centrifugation, they were treated with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), stained with 0.5 ml of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 min, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. After cell sorting, Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells were cultured in conditioned media with or without G-CSF for 5 days. The O⨪2generating activity of the differentiated cells was measured in terms of ferricytochrome c reduction assay. The cells (0.4–0.7 × 106) were suspended in substrate solution (50 μm ferricytochrome c, 5 mmd-glucose, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 in HEPES-buffered saline) and the assay was initiated by addition of 200 nm fMLP or 1.25 mg/ml opsonized zymosan. The absorbance increase at 550–540 nm was continuously recorded by a Hitachi 557 double-beam spectrophotometer. For the end point assay, incubation for 6 min was terminated by addition of an equal volume of chilled PBS(−) and the assay mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The absorbance increase of the supernatant at 550–540 nm was measured. After cell sorting, Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells were resuspended with conditioned media with or without G-CSF. Five days after the addition of G-CSF, cells were collected and spun by HEG-SP2 (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) to make a cytospin smear, stained by HEG-ST (Omron) with Wright stain, automatically, and finally photographed by VANOX-S (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan, objectives: Plan Apo × 60 oil immersion). After cell sorting, Trf-R− and Trf-R+ cells resuspended in conditioned medium were stimulated with G-CSF (60 ng/ml). For the inhibition of p70 S6 kinase, cells were preincubated with or without rapamycin (20 ng/ml) for 30 min before being treated with G-CSF. The reaction was terminated by adding an ice-cold mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 mm benzamine, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4 in PBS) and allowed to stand for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation, cells were treated with lysis buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate). The cells were disrupted at 40 watts for 10 s twice with a Branson Sonifier. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% lithium lauryl sulfate, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, and boiled at 100 °C for 1 min. Samples were stored at −20 °C before Western blotting analysis. Cell-free lysates (1–2 × 105 cell extract/line) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). Filters were blocked by incubation with 1.0% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, cells were incubated with various antibodies. The antibodies used for Western blotting were mouse anti-STAT 3 monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT 3 (Tyr705) polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-p70 S6 kinase polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-serine phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (Ser411) polyclonal antibody, and rabbit anti-MAPK polyclonal antibody (29Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). After washing in TBS-T three times, filters were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, then subjected to an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing with different antibodies, blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and reblocked with 1% BSA in TBS-T. The bands that appeared on x-ray films were scanned and the density of each band was determined on a Macintosh <model> computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet within the linear range for quantitation. To detect DNA fragmentation, sorted cells (5 × 105) were subsequently cultured with or without G-CSF (60 μg/ml) and/or rapamycin (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 5 h. As a positive control, HL-60 cells (5 × 105) treated with Me2SO for 2 days were incubated with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D or 1 μm A23187 in RPMI 1640 at 37 °C for 5 h. The cellular DNA was extracted, electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel, stained with SYBR Green ITM using the Apoptosis Ladder Detection Kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and then subjected to Fluor Imager 595 (Molecular Dynamics Japan, Tokyo) analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t test. Human myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60, cells are able to differentiate into neutrophilic cells in response to Me2SO or RA. The alterations of cell surface receptor expression of Trf (CD 71) and HGF (c-Met) in differentiating cells were determined. After incubation with Me2SO for 1 day, HL-60 cells expressed a single peak of Trf-R, whose intensity was less than that on untreated control HL-60 cells (Fig. 1 A). During the incubation with Me2SO for 2–6 days, the Trf-R expression on HL-60 cells was gradually reduced and divided into two peaks. The lower peak of Trf-R was virtually identical to the results obtained by incubation without anti-Trf-R antibody, suggesting that this cell population consisted of Trf-R− cells. We categorized the cell population that expressed the higher peak of Trf-R as Trf-R+ cells. HGF plays a crucial role as a hematopoietic regulator in the proliferation and differentiation of multi-hematopoietic progenitors (30Nishino T. Hisha H. Nishino N. Adachi M. Ikehara S. Blood. 1995; 85: 3093-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the Trf-R expression, Me2SO treatment had no effect on HGF-R expression on HL-60 cells (Fig. 1 B). The same phenomenon was also observed in HL-60 cells treated with RA (data not shown). Two days after the treatment with Me2SO, cells expressing Trf-R were isolated by magnetic cell sorting. Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells were incubated with a combination of mouse anti-human Trf-R monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG microbeads. To confirm the separation of Trf-R expressing and nonexpressing cells, both populations of sorted cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Trf-R+ cells had markedly stronger fluorescence intensity than Trf-R− cells (Fig.2 A), indicating that the cell types could be successfully separated by magnetic cell sorting. Since G-CSF is thought to be a cytokine that specifically works on the neutrophilic lineage cells, the reactivity of each cell population to G-CSF was examined. First, G-CSF-R expression on the cell surface was determined. In contrast to the expression of Trf-R (Fig. 2 A), there was no difference in the expression of G-CSF-R between Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells (Fig. 2 B). In order to compare differentiation and proliferation of Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells, both cell populations were resuspended in the conditioned medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After the cells had been subsequently cultured for 5 days with or without G-CSF (60 ng/ml), the expression of fMLP-R, a marker of neutrophilic differentiation, was examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, the differentiated Trf-R− cells expressed higher levels of fMLP-R than the Trf-R+ cells, and G-CSF potentiated the fMLP-R expression on Trf-R− cells. Incubation with G-CSF induced fMLP-R expression to a lesser extent in the Trf-R+ cells compared with the Trf-R− cells. O⨪2 generating activity stimulated by fMLP or opsonized zymosan is shown in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. After cell sorting, Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells were cultured in conditioned media with or without G-CSF for 5 days. The extent of fMLP-stimulated O⨪2 generation by differentiated Trf-R− cells (Fig. 3B) was 3.3-fold that by Trf-R+ cells, which was significantly higher (**, p < 0.01). G-CSF enhanced the O⨪2 generating activity of Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells, with the amount of O⨪2 produced by Trf-R− cells differentiated with G-CSF being 1.9-fold that by Trf-R+cells cultured with G-CSF, which was significantly higher (**, p < 0.01). These results are supported by the trends in fMLP-R expression (Fig. 3 A). O⨪2 generating activity stimulated by opsonized zymosan showed the same tendency as that stimulated by fMLP (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand, the proliferative activity of Trf-R+cells was much higher than that of Trf-R− cells (Fig.4 A). One day after magnetic cell sorting, no difference between Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells in proliferation was observed. Since the inoculated cell density of both cell types was 3.9 × 105 cells/ml after magnetic cell sorting, Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells increased 2.2- and 2.0-fold after 3 days, and 2.7- and 2.3-fold after 5 days from the initial level, respectively. G-CSF enhanced the proliferation of Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells 1.2- and 1.1-fold after 3 days, and 1.4- and 1.2-fold after 5 days compared with that in the absence of G-CSF, respectively. Fig. 4 B shows a typical profile of cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide by flow cytometry. The area of S phase in Trf-R+ cells altered by G-CSF was largest and the cell types ranked as follows; Trf-R+ + G-CSF > Trf-R+ > Trf-R− + G-CSF > Trf-R−. These results support the results of Fig.8 B. Together, these data suggest that Trf-R− cells are differentiation type cells, and Trf-R+ cells are proliferative type cells. We also sorted Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells from RA (1 μm)-pretreated HL-60 cells, and observed the same tendency of both cell types (data not shown). These results also suggest that G-CSF enhances differentiation in Trf-R− cells and proliferation in Trf-R+cells. Fig. 5 shows the morphology of differentiated Trf-R+ and Trf-R−cells with or without G-CSF. Promyelocyte, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes were observed in both cell types. The ratio of metamyelocytes was significantly higher in Trf-R− cells than in Trf-R+ cells (Fig. 5 B, p< 0.0001), Trf-R− cells are more mature than Trf-R+ cells. Stab cells or segmented cells, however, could not be observed. Moreover, G-CSF did not alter the morphological features of these cells. To clarify what molecular events were induced by G-CSF in Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells, G-CSF-dependent intracellular signaling events were analyzed by immunological methods. G-CSF is known to activate STAT 3 (20Tian S.S. Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the activation of STAT 3 in Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells using anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT 3 antibody (Fig.6 A) and quantitated of the density of each band (Fig. 6 F). Although there was no difference in the protein level of STAT 3 between Trf-R+and Trf-R− cells (Fig. 6 B), tyrosine 705 of STAT 3 in Trf-R− cells was markedly phosphorylated on the addition of G-CSF for 5 and 30 min (Fig. 6 F; *, p < 0.05). G-CSF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 in Trf-R+ cells, but at a lower level than in Trf-R− cells. Protein 70 S6 kinase plays an important role in the progression of cells from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (31Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). It has not been reported whether or not G-CSF signaling cascade involves p70 S6 kinase. So, we examined the activation of p70 S6 kinase in Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells (Fig. 6, C, D, and E). Fig. 6 shows a Western blot analysis of p70 S6 kinase. The protein level of p70 S6 kinase in Trf-R+cells was higher than that in Trf-R− cells. Upon addition of G-CSF, an electrophoretic mobility shift of p70 S6 kinase was clearly observed in Trf-R+ 30 min, suggesting that G-CSF induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. This mobility shift was not observed in Trf-R− cells. A Western blot using anti-serine phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (Ser411) antibody supported that in Fig. 6 C. Ser411 of p70 S6 kinase is located in the autoinhibitory domain and phosphorylation of this site directly affects kinase activity. Serine 411 of p70 S6 kinase in Trf-R+ cells was markedly phosphorylated on the addition of G-CSF for 5 and 30 min (Fig.6, D and G). G-CSF also induced serine 411 phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase in Trf-R− cells, but at a lower level than in Trf-R+ cells. Using anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) antibody, we also confirmed that there was no difference in MAPK content between Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells, and that G-CSF did not stimulate MAPK in either Trf-R+ or Trf-R− cells (Fig.6 E). Considering that the expression of G-CSF-R on Trf-R+ and Trf-R− cells was the same (Fig.2 B), these results indicate that there are differences in G-CSF-induced activation of STAT 3 and p70 S6 kinase downstream of the G-CSF-R in Trf-R+ and Tr"
https://openalex.org/W2137598151,"9-O-Acetylation is one of the most common modifications of sialic acids, and it can affect several sialic acid-mediated recognition phenomena. We previously reported a cDNA encoding a lysosomal sialic acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase, which traverses the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway and localizes primarily to lysosomes and endosomes. In this study, we report a variant cDNA derived from the same gene that contains a different 5' region. This cDNA has a putative open reading frame lacking a signal peptide-encoding sequence and is thus a candidate for the previously described cytosolic sialic acid 9-O-acetylesterase activity. Epitope-tagged constructs confirm that the new sequence causes the protein product to be targeted to the cytosol and has esterase activity. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to distinguish the two forms of message, we show that although the lysosomal sialic acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase message has a widespread pattern of expression in adult mouse tissues, this cytosolic sialic acid 9-O-acetylesterase form has a rather restricted distribution, with the strongest expression in the liver, ovary, and brain. Using a polyclonal antibody directed against the 69-amino acid region common to both proteins, we confirmed that the expression of glycosylated and nonglycosylated polypeptides occurred in appropriate subcellular fractions of normal mouse tissues. Rodent liver polypeptides reacting to the antibody also co-purify with previously described lysosomal sialic acid esterase activity and at least a portion of the cytosolic activity. Thus, two sialic acid 9-O-acetylesterases found in very different subcellular compartments can be encoded by a single gene by differential usage of a signal peptide-encoding exon at the N terminus. The 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends results and the differences in tissue-specific expression suggest that expression of these two products may be differentially regulated by independent promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2043896734,"AMP deaminase (AMPD) converts AMP to IMP and is a diverse and highly regulated enzyme that is a key component of the adenylate catabolic pathway. In this report, we identify the high affinity interaction between AMPD and phosphoinositides as a mechanism for regulation of this enzyme. We demonstrate that endogenous rat brain AMPD and the human AMPD3 recombinant enzymes specifically bind inositide-based affinity probes and to mixed lipid micelles that contain phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, we show that phosphoinositides specifically inhibit AMPD catalytic activity. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is the most potent inhibitor, effecting pure noncompetitive inhibition of the wild type human AMPD3 recombinant enzyme with a K(i) of 110 nM. AMPD activity can be released from membrane fractions by in vitro treatment with neomycin, a phosphoinositide-binding drug. In addition, in vivo modulation of phosphoinositide levels leads to a change in the soluble and membrane-associated pools of AMPD activity. The predicted human AMPD3 sequence contains pleckstrin homology domains and (R/K)X(n)(R/K)XKK sequences, both of which are characterized phosphoinositide-binding motifs. The interaction between AMPD and phosphoinositides may mediate membrane localization of the enzyme and function to modulate catalytic activity in vivo."

Nicotinic receptors are located at the neuromuscular junction and in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Muscle-type nAChRs are pentamers of homologous subunits in the stoichiometry of α2βγδ (or α2βδε) arranged around a central pore (2Unwin N. J. Struct.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a short extracellular C terminus (1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The second transmembrane domain (M2) from each of the five subunits is postulated to line the ion-conducting pore (21Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The subunit composition of nAChRs containing the α7 gene product is not completely clear. The injection of α7 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes results in the formation of ACh-gated ion channels without requiring the co-expression of other neuronal nAChR subunit cRNAs (22Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), suggesting that α7 nAChRs are homo-oligomeric. However, Xenopus oocytes also express low levels of endogenous nAChR α subunits, which can co-assemble with β, γ, and δ muscle-type nAChR subunits to form functional nAChRs (23Buller A.L. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 423-428PubMed Google Scholar). These α-subunits could, potentially, co-assemble with expressed α7 receptors in Xenopus oocytes as well. Based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments, native α7 receptors in rat brain appear to be homo-oligomeric (24Chen D. Patrick J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24024-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas native chick α7 subunits are thought to form both homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric receptors, complexing with α8 (25Schoepfer R.

However, it is possible that the apparent homomeric α7 nAChRs in native tissues could represent heteromeric complexes containing yet unidentified nAChR subunits. α7 nAChRs have been difficult to express in several mammalian heterologous expression systems. The folding, assembly, and subcellular localization of heterologously expressed α7 nAChRs is deficient in some cell lines, due to misfolding and trapping of proteins in the ER (29Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, human α7 nAChRs have been expressed in HEK-293 cells (30Gopalakrishnan M. Buisson B. Touma E. Giordano T. Campbell J.E. Hu I.C. Donnelly-Roberts D. Arneric S.P. Bertrand D. Sullivan J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but attempts to express chick or rat α7 nAChRs in HEK-293 cells have not yet been successful (29Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Rangwala F. Drisdel R.C. Rakhilin S. Ko E. Atluri P. Harkins A.B. Fox A.P. Salman S.B. Green W.N. J.

Another powerful approach to determine whether α7 nAChRs can form functional, homo-oligomeric receptors is to express them in a cell-free system. Muscle-type nAChRs translated in the presence of ER microsomes have been studied biochemically (13Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5598-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Shtrom S.S. Hall Z.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15532-15538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but have not been examined for functional channel activity. Our goal was to express chick α7 nAChRs in vitro, where the co-expression of other nAChR subunits is extremely unlikely, and to study their biochemical and functional properties. Our experimental strategy was to express receptors using rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of ER microsomes, reconstitute the channels into planar lipid bilayers, and record single-channel activity. This method has been used successfully to synthesize and reconstitute functional Shaker potassium channels (35Rosenberg R.L. East J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (36Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and gap junction channels (37Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs expressed in vitro were glycosylated, were processed integrally though the membrane, and formed functional channels when reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. These data also show that α7 nAChR subunits can form functional, homo-oligomeric channels. Chick wild-type α7 nAChR cDNA was a gift from Mark Ballivet (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Wild-type and S2′T/L9′T α7 nAChR cDNAs cloned into the pAMV vector (38Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G. Silverman S.K. Zhong W. Thorson J. Abelson J.N. Davidson N. Schultz P.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A.

The numbering of the residues in the M2 domain follows the convention of Miller (39Miller C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), where the N-terminal (cytoplasmic) residue of the M2 domain is denoted as 1′. The Ser at the 2′ position and Leu at the 9′ position correspond to amino acids Ser240 and Leu247, respectively, in the chick α7 cDNA sequence (22Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The plasmid templates were digested with Not I. Capped cRNA transcripts were generated from the cDNA templates with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cRNA was resuspended in 100 mm KCl and stored at −70 °C. Oocytes were surgically removed from female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) and treated with collagenase as described (40Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to remove the follicular cell layer. Oocytes were injected with 20 ng of α7 cRNA and incubated at 19 °C for 2–5 days in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 0.55 mg/ml sodium pyruvate (41Stühmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier controlled by pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–2.1 MΩ. Oocytes were superfused with ES-EGTA (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) in the presence and absence of ACh. Unless otherwise indicated, oocytes were voltage clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV. Currents from S2′T/L9′T receptors were filtered at 50 Hz (8-pole Bessel low pass) and digitized at 100 Hz with a Digidata 1200 A/D converter. Currents from wild-type receptors were filtered at 250 Hz and sampled at 500 Hz. Additional filtering was added to the traces for display purposes. To adjust for run-down during acquisition of dose-response data, the peak currents from repeated applications of a standard dose of ACh were used to normalize the test responses. Dose-response relationships were fitted to the Hill equation in Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Current-voltage relationships during the sustained maximal response to ACh were generated by applying a series of voltage steps (125 ms, 10 mV intervals) from the holding potential of −60 mV. Leak currents obtained in the absence of ACh were subtracted from ACh-evoked currents. Endoplasmic reticulum microsomes were obtained from canine pancreas (Promega, Madison, WI) or were prepared from the oviducts of mature, laying Japanese quail (42Das R.C. Brinkley S.A. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7933-7940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the magnum portion of the oviduct was minced, suspended in 5 volumes of TKMD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.88 m sucrose, homogenized, and centrifuged at 4000 ×g in an HB4 rotor for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted with TKMD buffer to a final sucrose concentration of 0.6 mand layered onto a sucrose step gradient of TMKD buffer containing 1.5m and 2.0 m sucrose. After centrifugation for 16–20 h at 100,000 × g in an SW28 rotor, the microsomes were harvested from the 1.5 m and 2.0m sucrose interface and resuspended in 20 mmNa-HEPES. The volume was adjusted with 20 mm Na-HEPES to obtain an A260 reading of 0.6 in a sample containing 1% SDS. One-half volume of 750 mm sucrose, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5 was added to the resuspended membranes, which were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Coupled in vitro transcription/translation was performed using the Promega TNT kit. For analysis of translation and processing efficiency, reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 12.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 0.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 μm amino acids minus methionine, 10 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without 1 μg of α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChR cDNA. Reactions were also supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mmoxidized glutathione. Some reactions contained microsomes from canine pancreas (1.8 μl/25-μl reaction) or quail oviduct (1.0 μl/25-μl reaction). Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and stopped by placing on ice. After reserving 3 μl of the reaction mixture for gel analysis (labeled M in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 25 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, washed twice in solution D′ (160 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4), and resuspended in water. Samples were heated for 30 s at ∼95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar). Gels were treated with Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C.Figure 3Endo H cleavage of carbohydrate from α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs expressed in vitro.

An in vitro transcription/translation containing α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChR cDNA, [35S]Met, and canine pancreatic microsomes (lane 2) was centrifuged to separate the supernatant (lane 3) from the membrane fraction (lanes 4 and 5).

The membranes were pelleted (15 min at 14,000 rpm), resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate, 1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.0, and divided into equal fractions. Endoglycosidase H (1 milliunit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or carrier buffer (25 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0) was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by chilling on ice. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at ∼95 °C for 30 s and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pelleted microsomal membranes from a 50-μl coupled transcription/translation reaction were resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer (160 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). Each aliquot was treated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K plus 1% Triton X-100, or water for 45 min on ice. The reactions were stopped by adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and an equal volume of 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reactions were heated immediately at ∼95 °C for 30 s and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coupled transcription/translations containing [35S]Met were performed in the absence or presence of canine pancreatic microsomes as described above. Mixtures (25 μl) from translations performed in the absence of microsomes were diluted to 40 μl in a final concentration of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Translations performed in the presence of microsomes were scaled to a final volume of 100 μl and centrifuged to pellet the microsomes. The microsomes were washed and resuspended in 40 μl of solution D′ and solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 60 min on ice. Samples were layered on top of 5-ml linear 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (44Reynolds J.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2035-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradients run in parallel contained the standard proteins ovalbumin (3.6 S), bovine serum albumin (4.2 S), human gamma globulin (7 S), and catalase (11 S). The gradients were centrifuged for 12 h at 300,000 × g at 4 °C in a SW50.1 rotor. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradients, and the sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined by refractometry. Proteins from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorimetry (35S-labeled protein) or Coomassie Blue staining (standard proteins). Gels or autoradiographs were digitized, and the relative amount of protein in each band was analyzed by densitometry using NIH Image software. Coupled transcription/translations for the incorporation of microsomal vesicles into planar lipid bilayers were performed as described above except that [35S]methionine was omitted, 20 μm amino acids minus cysteine were added to provide the full complement of all unlabeled amino acids, and all volumes were scaled up to make a final volume of 50 μl. After translation, the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 9,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed immediately, and the pellet was washed twice with solution D′ and resuspended thoroughly by gentle trituration in 5 μl of 250 mm sucrose and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Bilayer experiments were generally performed on the same day as translations. Synthetic lipids (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were resuspended in n-decane at concentrations of 15 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml, respectively. Planar lipid bilayers were formed by applying the decane solution across a 200-μm hole in a polyvinyldifluoride partition separating two aqueous chambers denoted cis and trans. Endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomal vesicles from in vitro translations were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers by applying them directly onto the cis face of the bilayer with a fire-polished glass probe (45Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To promote the fusion of vesicles with the bilayer, 0.5 mm CaCl2 was present on the cis side. Acetylcholine was added to both chambers to activate all incorporated nAChRs regardless of membrane orientation. For each 50-μl translation, three to five bilayer experiments could be performed, each of which lasted about 1 h. Bilayers were voltage-clamped with a Warner Instruments patch-clamp amplifier (Hamden, CT). Voltages were assigned as cis relative to trans, with trans corresponding to the luminal side of the ER (the extracellular face). Data were filtered at 200 Hz using a 4-pole Bessel low pass filter, digitized at 1 kHz, and analyzed off-line using in-house analysis programs written in AxoBasic (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The goal of these experiments was to characterize the biochemical and functional properties of α7 nAChRs synthesized in vitro and reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. To study the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in a planar lipid bilayer, agonist is continually present to evoke channel opening events. Because wild-type α7 nAChRs desensitize very rapidly in the continued presence of ACh, we selected a nondesensitizing form of the α7 nAChR so that channel activity could be observed for extended periods of time. This receptor has a serine to threonine mutation at the 2′ position and a leucine to threonine mutation at the 9′ position (α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChR). Fig.1 A shows that wild-type α7 nAChRs activated rapidly and desensitized completely within 1 s of ACh application. In contrast, α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs (Fig.1 B) did not desensitize during a 30-s application of ACh, behavior similar to that of α7 L9′T nAChRs described by Revah et al. (46Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Like wild-type and α7 L9′T nAChRs (47Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiéry A. Revah F. Galzi J.-L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs were completely inhibited by α-BTX (Fig.1 B). Fig. 1 C shows the ACh dose-response characteristics of wild-type and α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs. As was seen with α7 L9′T nAChRs (46Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), the EC50 of α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs (14.1 μm) was much lower than that of wild-type α7 nAChRs (345 μm). Fig. 1 D shows that Ca2+ permeates through α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs. In the absence of any permeant ions in the bath, no ACh-evoked currents were observed. In the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ (and no other permeant ions), robust ACh-evoked currents were recorded. Thus, α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs displayed the nondesensitizing kinetics necessary to sustain channel activity in planar lipid bilayers in the continued presence of agonist. In addition, α7 S2′T/L9′T nAChRs displayed sensitivity to α-BTX, high potency of ACh, and Ca2+permeability, as expected. To determine whether the S2′T/L9′T α7 nAChRs synthesized in vitro were full-length, glycosylated, and correctly folded, we evaluated a number of its biochemical properties. Fig.2 shows a fluorogram of [35S]Met-labeled proteins generated from a coupled transcription/translation performed in the presence and absence of endoplasmic reticulum microsomes derived from quail oviduct. In the absence of microsomes, a ∼41-kDa protein and a 28 kDa protein were observed (lane 3). The primary sequence of wild-type α7 nAChRs indicates a nonglycosylated molecular mass of 54 kDa (22Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 25Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), a value substantially higher than the ∼41 kDa observed. Other nAChR α-subunits also run anomalously fast on SDS-polyacrylamide gels; nonglycosylated α1 subunits from Torpedo and mouse muscle nAChRs have calculated molecular masses of 50 kDa but migrate as 41–43-kDa proteins (33Shtrom S.S. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25506-25514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Chavez R.A. Hall Z. J. Biol.

To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms of transporter function, we have initiated a structure-function analysis of PGT to identify its substrate-binding region. We have found that by introducing the small, water-soluble, thiol-reactive anion Na(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) into the substrate pathway, we were able to cause inhibition of transport that could be reversed with dithiothreitol. Importantly, co-incubation with PGE2 protected PGT from this inhibition, suggesting that MTSES gains access to the aqueous pore pathway of PGT to form a mixed disulfide near the substrate-binding site. To identify the susceptible cysteine, we mutated, one at a time, all six of the putative transmembrane cysteines to serine. Only the mutation of Cys-530 to serine within putative transmembrane 10 became resistant to inhibition by MTSES. Thus, Cys-530 is the substrate-protectable, MTSES-inhibitable residue. To identify other residues that may be lining the substrate-binding site, we initiated cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of transmembrane 10 using Cys-530 as an entry point. On a C530S, MTSES-resistant background, residues in the N- and C-terminal directions were individually mutated to cysteine (Ala-513 to His-536), one at a time, and then analyzed for MTSES inhibition. Of the 24 cysteine-substituted mutants generated, 6 were MTSES-sensitive and, among these, 4 were substrate-protectable. The pattern of sensitivity to MTSES places these residues on the same face of an α-helix. The results of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and molecular modeling of putative transmembrane 10 indicate that the substrate binding of PGT is formed among its membrane-spanning segments, with 4 residues along the cytoplasmic end of helix 10 contributing to one surface of the binding site.

Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Functional studies suggest that PGT transports its substrate as the charged anion and mediates substrate accumulation via electrogenic anion exchange (2Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PGT is related to a family of polytopic membrane proteins that catalyze the transport of a variety of organic anions. These transporters include: oatp-1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide), known to transport bile acids and charged steroids (3Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar); oatp3, known to transport charged steroids and thyroid hormone (4Abe T. Kakyo M. Sakagami H. Tokui T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20719-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All the members of this gene family are predicted to have a 12-membrane-spanning structure and, based on their primary and secondary structure homology, may share a common transport mechanism. Although transport by oatp1 also has been suggested to also occur by anion exchange (7Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol.

Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis has been used extensively as a means to identify residues lining the substrate pathway of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (9Zhang H. Karlin A.

Cysteine substitutions of six residues resulted in inhibition by the negatively charged reagent MTSES, and four of these residues were substrate-protected. The substrate binding region of PGT is likely formed, at least in part, by four residues along helix 10. Na(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and MTS-ethylammonium (MTSEA) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Tritiated PGE2 was from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled PGE2 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. All materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. All mutants were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of full-length rat PGT cDNA cloned into pGEM3z. Oligonucleotides were synthesized to generate the appropriate serine or cysteine mutation and to simultaneously introduce either a unique silent restriction site or antibiotic resistance. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturers' protocol (Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or Gene Editor (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Mutations were identified by restriction digest or growth in antibiotic selection media and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The in vitro mRNA transcription and the preparation and injection of Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (2Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 30 ng of mRNA encoding full-length rat PGT were injected into individual oocytes prior to isotopic PGE2 transport assays. Experiments were performed 2–5 days after mRNA injection. Wild type and mutant rPGT cDNAs cloned in pGEM-3z with coding strand downstream of the T7 promoter were transfected into HeLa cells, and expression was driven by vaccinia vtf7–3 as described previously (2Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). [3H]PGE2 uptake was assayed 18–22 h after transfection. HeLa cell monolayers or Xenopus oocytes were washed twice with a balanced salt solution (BSS) (135 mm NaCl, 13 mm H-Hepes, 13 mm Na-Hepes, 2.5 mm CaCl2 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mmd-glucose). Monolayers or groups of oocytes expressing wild type rPGT or mutant rPGT were incubated with sulfhydryl reagents at the stated concentrations at room temperature for 15 min and then washed four times prior to isotopic influx measurements. In some experiments, cells were incubated with sulfhydryl reagents in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled PGE2 prior to the [3H]PGE2 transport assay. Following two washes with BSS, influx measurements were initiated by the addition of tritiated PGE2 (NEN Life Science Products) to the flux media (BSS). Influx measurements were carried out at room temperature over 10–30 min. Isotopic influx experiments were terminated by aspiration of the incubation media followed by two rapid washings with ice-cold 5% bovine serum albumin in BSS and two additional washings with ice-cold BSS. HeLa cells were scraped into 1 ml of saline, and oocytes were lysed with 10% SDS and then mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Data in figures are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) (Statistica-PC, Statsoft). Pretreatment of PGT-expressing oocytes with the negatively charged thiol-reactive agent MTSES caused a dose-dependent reduction in subsequent [3H]PGE2 uptake (Fig.1). The addition of 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) during the MTSES exposure partially reversed the MTSES inhibition: 99% inhibition without DTT versus 45% inhibition with DTT. These findings indicate that MTSES inhibited transport by the formation of disulfide bonds. Moreover, the addition of 1 mm DTT alone caused a 30% inhibition of subsequent tracer PGE2 uptake, indicating that disulfide bonds may be important for full transport activity of wild type PGT. The presence of PGE2 during the MTSES period, at a concentration 1000-fold lower than the MTSES, completely abrogated the MTSES effect. In contrast to the negatively charged MTSES, positively charged MTSEA was ineffective at inhibiting transport (Fig. 1). These findings support the following hypotheses: 1) the substrates of PGT are attracted into the substrate pathway as anions, and 2) a thiol-reactive, substrate-protectable cysteine(s) lies in the aqueous pore pathway within or near the substrate binding site. To identify the MTSES-inhibitable, substrate-protectable cysteine(s), we mutated, one at a time, each of six putative transmembrane cysteines (Fig. 2) to serine and transiently expressed each mutant in HeLa cell monolayers. Each mutant was assayed for [3H]PGE2transport and tested for MTSES inhibition. Initial MTS experiments were performed in oocytes, as shown in Fig. 1. To confirm that these results could also be obtained in mammalian expression systems, and to take advantage of the technical ease of these systems, these initial experiments were extended in HeLa cells. As we reported for the fundamental transport properties of PGT (2Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we again found the two expression systems comparable, in that MTSES also inhibited PGT, and was substrate-protectable, in the HeLa cell system (data not shown). Most mutants exhibited significant [3H]PGE2transport ranging from 67% to 132% relative to that of wild type, except for C419S, which only transported [3H]PGE2 at 20% that of wild type (Fig.3).Figure 3[3H]PGE2 transport at 10 min by cysteine-to-serine mutants compared with wild type (WT)PGT. All influx values in these and subsequent graphs are from transfected HeLa cells and represent means ± S.E. of paired monolayers for two to eight independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cells transiently expressing wild type PGT or the C37S, C44S, C335S, C411S, or C419S mutants, 1–10 mm MTSES irreversibly inhibited subsequent [3H]PGE2 transport by ≥94%. In contrast, 1–10 mm MTSES inhibited transport of C530S by only 11 ± 14% (Fig.4). Because the mutation C530S confers MTSES resistance, we conclude that Cys-530 within putative transmembrane domain 10 is the MTSES-inhibitable, substrate-protectable cysteine in wild type PGT. We used the MTSES-resistant mutant C530S as the starting point for further cysteine substitution mutagenesis. Starting with C530S, we mutated each residue, from Ala-513 through Leu-536 in transmembrane span 10, one at a time, to cysteine (Table I). We transiently expressed each of the 23 mutants in HeLa cell monolayers and determined its transport activity as compared with C530S. All of the cysteine-substituted mutants had transport activity ranging from 41% to 152% relative to that of C530S (Fig.5). Thus, no residue from Ala-513 to Leu-536 within putative transmembrane span 10 was essential for transport.Table IDNA sequence analysis of cysteine-substituted mutantsMutantMutagenic oligonucleotideQ513CCCCACGTCCTGCGCGTGCCTACTGCTCCCGTCCL514CCGTCCTGCGCGCAGTGCCTGCTCCCGTCCL515CCCTGCGCGCAGCTATGCCTCCCGTCCATCL516CGCGCGCAGCTACTGTGCCCGTCCATCTTCCP517CGCGCAGCTACTGCTCTGCTCCATCTTCCTCS518CGCAGCTACTGCTCCCGTGCATCTTCCTCATTTCCI519CGCTACTGCTCCCGTCCTGCTTCCTCATTTCCP520CGCTCCCGTCCATCTGCCTCATTTCCTTTGCGL521CGCTCCCGTCCATCTTCTGCATTTCCTTTGCGGCGI522CCCGTCCATCTTCCTCTGTTCCTTTGCGGCGCTCS523CCCATCTTCCTCATTTGCTTTGCGGCGCTCF524CCTCCCTCATTTCCTGTGCGGCGCTCATTGCCA525CCCTCATTTCCTTTTGCGCGCTCATTGCCTCCA526CCTCATTTCCTTTGCGTGCCTCATTGCCTCCL527CCCTTTGCGGCGTGCATTGCCTCCATCI528CCCTTTGCGGCGCTCTGTGCCTCCATCTCCA529CGCGGCGCTCATTTGCTCCATCTCCCACI531CGCGCTCATTGCCTCCTGCTCCCACAACCCGCTS532CCTCATTGCCTCCATCTGCCACAACCCGCTCTACH533CGCCTCCATCTCCTGCAACCCGCTCTACATGN534CGCCTCCATCTCCCACTGCCCGCTCTACATGP535CCCATCTCCCACAACTGCCTCTACATGATGGL536CCCCACAACCCGTGCTACATGATGGTCCThe mutagenic primer is in sense orientation.

We transiently expressed each of the mutants in HeLa cell monolayers and tested its susceptibility to MTSES inhibition. We assume that: 1) only residues on the water-accessible surface of the protein will react with the charged, water-soluble MTSES; 2) within a transmembrane span, cysteines that react with MTSES line the aqueous translocation pathway; and 3) cysteine-substituted side chains are in the same position as the wild type side chains. Based on these assumptions, our data indicate that, in addition to Cys-530, the following five residues are exposed to the aqueous pore pathway: Leu-515, Ile-522, Ala-526, Ala-529, and His-533 (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 7, the pattern of inhibition follows that of an α-helix. However, the mutation I519C, predicted to lie on the same face of the α-helix between the MTSES-sensitive A526C and Cys-530, did not react with MTSES, indicating that the helix may be distorted in this region. Alternatively, the mutation I519C may be distorting the helical structure such that this residue becomes inaccessible to MTSES. To identify which of the MTSES-inhibitable cysteine substitutions could be in the substrate-binding site, we pretreated each mutant with MTSES in the presence and absence of 1 μm PGE2, washed, and assayed subsequent transport activity. Because the Km of PGT for PGE2 is 50–100 nm (26Itoh S. Lu R. Bao Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Schuster V.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 738-742PubMed Google Scholar), this dose is saturating. We assume that residues located at or near the binding region would be protected from MTSES inhibition if the substrate PGE2 were present during MTSES pretreatment. Of the six cysteine mutants that were inhibited by MTSES, only A526C, A529C, H533C, and Cys-530 were significantly protected by PGE2(Fig. 8). In the present study, we have attempted to delineate the substrate-binding region of the prostaglandin transporter PGT by testing the susceptibility to covalent inhibition by the charged, hydrophilic, thiol-reactive reagents MTSES and MTSEA. We found that the anionic MTSES caused a dose-dependent reduction in subsequent tracer PGE2 uptake, whereas the cationic MTSEA had no effect. Importantly, co-incubation of MTSES with PGE2 protected PGT from this inhibition, suggesting that MTSES gains access to the aqueous pathway of PGT to form a mixed disulfide near the substrate binding site (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis revealed that Cys-530 is sensitive to MTSES in wild type PGT, that transmembrane span 10 (containing Cys-530) is α-helical, and that several residues of span 10, facing the aqueous pathway, are likely at or near the substrate-binding site. As has been observed by others with a variety of transporters (27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 28Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mutagenesis of cysteines to other residues was generally well tolerated (Fig. 3). All the single cysteine mutants demonstrated significant tracer PGE2 uptake as compared with wild type PGT, except for C419S, which demonstrated 20% wild type activity. Of the six cysteines we mutated, only Cys-419 is conserved in the organic anion transporter family (oatp1 (3Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), oatp2 (5Noe B. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10346-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and OAT-K1 (6Saito H. Masuda S. Inui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20719-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The other conserved cysteines all appear to be clustered within putative extracellular loops 5 and 6. Because we can remodel PGT and also place Cys-419 in putative extracellular loop 5, one explanation for the decrease in activity of the C419S mutant is that a structurally important extracellular disulfide pair was disrupted. Disulfide bonds have functional importance for PGT because treatment of wild type PGT with DTT results in a 30% decrease in transport. Alternatively, the poor function of C419C may be because serine at position 419 has the ability to hydrogen-bond to the backbone and disrupt structure. Of the single cysteine-to-serine mutants generated, only C530S within putative transmembrane 10 was resistant to MTSES inhibition (Figs. 2and 3). These findings support Cys-530 as the residue that reacts with MTSES to inhibit transport function. Using the C530S, MTSES-resistant mutant as a starting point, we applied the substituted cysteine accessibility method developed by Akabas et al. (31Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) to transmembrane 10 in order to identify residues exposed to the binding site region of PGT. On a C530S background, residues Ala-513 through Leu-536 were replaced, one by one, with cysteine and tested for MTSES-sensitivity. We found that cysteine at positions 515, 522, 526, 529, 530, and 533 made PGT sensitive to MTSES. The interpretation of the results is based on several assumptions: 1) that cysteine will generally be a well tolerated substitute for other residues, 2) that the hydrophilic MTSES will only react with residues exposed to the water-accessible surface of the protein, and 3) that the presence of substrate will prevent MTSES-induced inhibition of those residues at or near the binding site. Based on the assumptions above, we can infer from this pattern of inhibition that the secondary structure of transmembrane span 10 is that of an α-helix (Fig. 7). However, the mutation I519C, predicted to lie on the water exposed surface of helix 10, was not inhibited by MTSES, indicating that there may be a disruption in the helix, or that the mutation resulted in a distortion in the protein. Interestingly, there is a proline at position 517 that may be inducing this bend in the helix. In proline, the last atom of the side chain is bonded to the main chain N atom, preventing participation in hydrogen bonding and causing disruption of α-helical conformation. Proline-induced bends in helical domains have been described in the M3 membrane-spanning domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (32Akabas M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the M7 transmembrane segment of the dopamine D2 receptor (33Fu D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Chen J. Javitch J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11278-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because we have experimental evidence using epitope tagging (data not shown) that the large hydrophilic region before transmembrane helix 10 is extracellular (putatively extracellular loop 5), we can correctly orient residue Ala-513 toward the extracellular face and Leu-536 toward the cytoplasm. We do not know whether Leu-536 is in helix 10 or within the cytoplasmic loop. Residues near the cytoplasmic end of a helix or in cytoplasmic loops may not react with the negatively charged MTSES because of repulsion by the inside-negative field across the plasma membrane or because of the reducing environment in the cell. Either of these may account for the lack of apparent reactivity of Leu-536. Because classic anion transport inhibitors, including the stilbene disulfonates and niflumic acid, block PGT-mediated PG uptake (2Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), because the substrate must be anionic in order to bind (26Itoh S. Lu R. Bao Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Schuster V.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 738-742PubMed Google Scholar), and because transport is inhibited by MTSES (anionic) but not MTSEA (cationic), PGT likely transports substrate as the anion. One interpretation of our data is that a positive charge near the external end of the pore screens out positively charged reagents and allows MTSES entry. MTSES, by virtue of covalent attachment to span 10 residues, would then block PGE2 transport either by steric hindrance or by introducing a new negative charge that electrostatically repulses the carboxy group of the substrate. In either case, because the inhibition by MTSES extends over 4 helical turns or >20 Å, MTSES could not be binding to a positive charge before its covalent reaction with the substituted cysteines. An alternative, and we think much less likely, possibility is that binding of substrate causes a structural change in the protein, disrupting its function and causing helix 10 to rotate, thus “burying” the previously MTSES-sensitive residues. In this model, none of the “MTSES-sensitive” residues would need to contact the substrate . Substrate-protectability could occur for residues Ala-529, Cys-530, and His-533 if substrate bound external to them at residue 526 and blocked the accessibility of MTSES. In this model, only residue 526 would need to bind the substrate. Although this remains a possibility, when we constructed a molecular model of transmembrane span 10, we noted that the substrate-protectable residues, Ala-526 to His-533, span a length that corresponds to the length of the substrate (Fig.9), consistent with the contention that these residues contact the substrate. The sequence of rat PGT is related to the sequences of the other members of the oatp (organic anion transporting polypeptides) gene family, but the transporters exhibit no overlap in substrate specificity. Nonetheless, the deduced primary and putative secondary structure homology suggests that members of this gene family may share a common mechanism. By delineating the substrate-binding site of PGT, we may begin to understand which regions, and perhaps which residues, account for the differences in substrate specificities. The results presented here represent the first identification of specific residues that are associated with substrate binding in this gene family. Of the four MTSES-inhibitable, PGE2-protectable residues identified in PGT, none is conserved among the other transporters, suggesting that these may be contributing to the specific binding of prostanoids. Domain swapping and chimera approaches will be required to address these issues more definitively. Our data indicate that the substrate-protectable residues are near the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane span 10. In this regard, it is of interest to consider the general question of the location of substrate-protectable transporter residues relative to transmembrane spans. In the acetylcholine receptor channel α subunit M2 segment, Pascual and Karlin (34Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported partial or complete protection by organic transport inhibitors of several residues over several turns of shared helical faces. These substrate-protected residues are modeled near the cytoplasmic end of the predicted transmembrane spans. In P-glycoprotein, two cysteine-substituted residues, modeled in the middle of transmembrane span 12, and three modeled toward the extracellular end of transmembrane span 6 were substrate-protectable against reaction with the thiol-reactive agent dibromobiomane (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the serotonin transporter, the substrates 5-hydroxytryptamine and cocaine protected the mutants I172C and I176C from attack by methane-thiosulfonates. These residues are predicted to lie on a common helical face near the middle of span 3 (36Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, in lac permease the naturally occurring Cys-148 and the mutant M145C, both of which are likely to be situated near the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane span 5, were substrate-protectable against the thiol-reactive agent 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (37Wu J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken with the present findings, these data suggest that substrate-protectable residues, and thus putative substrate-binding sites, may lie at any location along the length of transmembrane helical spans. The accumulation of more data on a variety of types of transporters (i.e. carriers, channels, pumps) should help to clarify this issue further. Although the most “cytoplasmic” of the substrate-protectable residues, His-533, could theoretically interact electrostatically with the substrate's 1-carboxyl group, the neutral mutant H533C exhibited substantial transport function (see “Results”) at the same Km as wild type PGT. 2B. Chan and V. L. Schuster, unpublished observations. Thus, neither H533 nor a cationic residue at this position is essential for function. We have performed site-directed mutagenesis of several transmembrane-charged residues to address their role in PGT. Those data suggest that Lys-613 of transmembrane span 12 may form an electrostatic interaction with PGE2.2 Because the longest dimension of the PGE2 molecule is roughly equivalent to the linear space occupied by the four substrate-protectable residues of transmembrane span 10, the simplest model is that the substrate's 1-carboxyl group articulates with Lys-613, the cyclo-pentane ring of PGE2 is oriented toward the cytoplasmic end of the tranmembrane spans, and the acyl chain consisting of carbons 12–20 (including the hydroxyl at C-15) undergo hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions with the substrate-protectable residues of transmembrane span 10 as identified here. In summary , our data strongly suggest that transmembrane span 10 of the prostaglandin transporter PGT is an α-helix, and that four residues on a shared face of this helix (Ala-526, Ala-529, Cys-530, and His-533) are substrate-protectable. These residues likely form part of the substrate-binding region of PGT. We thank Mark Girvin for molecular modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2153042655,"Microvilli of the aggressive 13762 ascites mammary adenocarcinoma contain a large, microfilament-associated signal transduction particle whose scaffolding is a stable glycoprotein complex (Li, Y., Hua, F., Carraway, K. L., and Carraway, C. A. C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 25651–25658) associated with the growth factor receptor p185neu. The receptor is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in the cells and microvilli, predicting that it should recruit mitogenic pathway components to this membrane-microfilament interaction site. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine and immunoblotting showed phosphorylated forms of the mitogenic pathway proteins Shc and MAPK in addition to p185neu, suggesting that the Ras to MAPK mitogenic pathway is activated. Immunoblotting of p185neu-containing microvillar fractions revealed the presence in each of stably associated Shc, Grb-2, Sos, Ras, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as the transcription factor-phosphorylating kinase Rsk. All of these pathway components co-immunoprecipitated with p185neu from cleared lysates of microvilli solubilized under microfilament-depolymerizing conditions. The recruitment of constitutively phosphorylated p185neu and the activated mitogenic pathway proteins to this membrane-microfilament interaction site provides a physical model for integrating the assembly of the mitogenic pathway with the transmission of growth factor signal to the cytoskeleton. This linkage is probably a requisite step in the global cytoskeleton remodeling accompanying mitogenesis.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 337-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since both of these effects result from the binding of the factors to a single type of receptor, their pathways must somehow be integrated. One suggestion for this integration is that the receptors and components of the signaling pathways are localized to sites where microfilaments interact with membranes (2Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The EGF1receptor (3Wiegant F.A.C. Blok F.J. Defize L.H.K. Linnemans W.A.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the EGF receptor family member p185neu(ErbB2/HER2) (4Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be associated with microfilaments. EGF receptor binds directly to actin through a motif similar to the actin-binding motif of profilin (5den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the association of p185neu/ErbB2 with microfilaments is presently unclear. Interestingly, p185neu/ErbB2, which has been implicated in tumor cell metastasis, is proposed to play a role in the regulation of cell structure and motility (6De Potter C.R. Quatacker J. J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The receptor is concentrated on microvilli in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Activation of its phosphorylation leads to cell spreading, enlargement of microvilli, formation of pseudopodia, and aggregation of the p185 at the plasma membrane protrusions and pseudopodia (6De Potter C.R. Quatacker J. J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A specific role for p185neu/ErbB2 in these microfilament-dependent processes known to enhance metastatic capability of tumor cells was shown in p185neu-overexpressing transfectants of NCI-H460 lung carcinoma cells (7Yu D. Wang S.S. Dulski K.M. Tsai C.M. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3260-3266PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of a ligand to its receptor tyrosine kinase at the cell surface elicits numerous pleiotypic cellular changes culminating in cell division. This single activation event must integrate and orchestrate both temporally and spatially a multiplicity of pathways regulating metabolism, macromolecule biosynthesis, cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle, and cell division. An early consequence of ligand binding is a stimulation of the normally low level of tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor (8Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 9Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) and autophosphorylation of the receptor on its cytoplasmic domain, commonly on more than one tyrosine residue (11Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Kinase activation triggers events at the plasma membrane cytoplasmic surface that initiate early steps in the transduction of growth signal to the cytoplasm and nucleus. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues create binding sites for other signal transduction components such as adaptor (linker) proteins, via sequence-specific SH2 domains (12Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 13Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. Science. 1993; 262: 1522-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As a consequence, several signaling pathway proteins are recruited from the cytosol to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, resulting in modulation of their functions. The autophosphorylation and recruitment permits at least transient associations of signal transduction proteins into complexes, called signal transduction particles (15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Studies of mitogenesis induced by binding of EGF or platelet-derived growth factor to its receptor have described a putative common mitogenic pathway (16Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first involves activation of Ras by Sos. In this proposed mechanism, the autophosphorylated receptor binds to an adaptor protein such as Grb2 via a phosphotyrosine linkage to an SH2 or a PTB domain (33Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein interacts via its Src homology 3 domain with a proline-rich peptide on Sos (33Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), a nucleotide exchange factor that can activate Ras (33Egan S.E.

This mechanism thus couples the phosphorylated growth factor receptor to the activation of the membrane-associated signal transduction switch Ras. Activation of the growth factor receptor results in localization of the cytosolic Grb2-Sos complex in juxtaposition with membrane-associated Ras via binding of the complex to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the activated receptor (24Downward J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,40Olivier J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Hafen E.

Grb2-Sos can also be recruited indirectly to activated receptors via the adaptor protein Shc (43Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second event requiring membrane localization involves the recruitment of Raf and the downstream members of the MAPK pathway by activated Ras (45Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Instead, an important function of Ras appears to be the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane (45Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 46Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with concomitant activation. During this assembly, Raf becomes activated via an incompletely understood mechanism (52Morrison D.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 53Suen K.L. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar) mediated in some cells by the 14-3-3 protein family (54Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R.

Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of the MAPKs. In this cascade Raf can activate MAPKK, which activates MAPK. MAPK can then phosphorylate transcription factors as part of the mitogenic process (16Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 17Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ruderman J.V. Curr. Opin.

These combined observations suggest the assembly at least transiently of a large, multimeric signaling complex or signal transduction particle (4Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar), which contains many if not all of the components of this pathway. The results cited above suggest that the formation of signaling complexes at membrane-microfilament interaction sites may play important roles in cellular responses to growth factors (57Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Hesketh H.E. Pryme I.F. Treatise on the Cytoskeleton. 2. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1996: 207-238Google Scholar, 58Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway III, K.L. Signal Transduction and the Cytoskeleton. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1998Crossref Google Scholar). Partial pathway complexes have been demonstrated in some instances, although these complexes are often transient and difficult to characterize. Stable complete complexes more amenable to characterization would be expected in the case of cells that are constitutively activated, such as many types of tumor cells. The MAT-C1 subline of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma provides substantial advantages for the investigations of membrane-microfilament interactions and their regulation (59Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. Rev. 1989; 988: 147-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Its cell surface is covered with abundant microvilli, which can be readily isolated in quantity by a simple shearing and differential centrifugation procedure that does not destroy the cells or disrupt the structural organization of the microvilli (60Carraway K.L.

Acta. 1982; 719: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These microvilli provide a highly purified plasma membrane fraction with intact microfilament-membrane interactions. Extraction and fractionation studies on the microvilli have indicated that microfilaments are linked to the membrane via a high molecular mass (>106 Da) complex, designated the transmembrane complex (62Carraway C.A.C. Jung G. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As isolated from microvillar membranes, this complex contains actin, at least five glycoproteins (63Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the TMC has properties that strongly suggest that it is a microfilament-associated signal transduction particle (4Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

From lysates of untreated ascites cells, several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including p58gag, were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (69Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that p58gag is phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine. The membrane skeletal protein may be a substrate for the tyrosine kinases p60srcand/or p120abl, which, along with the receptor kinase p185neu, are components of the large signaling particle (69Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). p58gag has P XX P-containing polyproline motifs, a general feature of retroviral Gag proteins, and was shown to bind to both p60src (70Huang J.

Mayer, and C. A. C. Carraway, manuscript in preparation. The presence of the receptor, the cytoplasmic kinases, and in situ-phosphorylated substrate proteins, along with the aggressive properties of these highly metastatic tumor cells, suggest that p185neu is constitutively phosphorylated and activated (69Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis also predicts that the activated growth factor receptor will recruit components of its signal transduction pathway(s). In the present study, we have used fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation approaches to investigate the presence of components of the Ras/MAPK pathway associated with the TMC. The results of these studies provide additional evidence for the presence of a microfilament-linked signal transduction particle at the cell surface in the microvilli of these cells. Moreover, they suggest that the STP/TMC is a site for association of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway components at the plasma membrane and provide a physical mechanism by which the cytoskeleton and mitogenic pathways can be coupled. To our knowledge, the isolation of a microfilament-associated, growth factor receptor-containing signaling complex containing all of the components of the mitogenic pathway has not been reported.

The functions of 15-LO are still being elucidated. 15-LO has the capacity to utilize phospholipids as a substrate, oxidizing arachidonic acid and linoleic acid esterified at the SN2 position (27Takahashi Y.

Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The direct oxidation of intracellular membranes may be an intermediate step in membrane degradation and turnover in the differentiation of certain cells (27Takahashi Y. Glasgow W.C. Suzuki H.

It has also been suggested that 15-LO plays a role in the initiation of atherogenesis by oxidizing fatty acids esterified in cholesterol esters (30Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelan I.

The production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in hematopoietic cells might require the liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids prior to oxidation. 15-LO has been reported to associate with membranes after stimulation of hematopoietic cells (5Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not known whether it can be co-localized with the leukotriene forming enzymes on the nuclear envelope. The assembly of multiprotein complexes on specific membrane boundaries is now recognized as a process of general importance. It is a feature of signal transduction systems such as cytokine receptor complexes on the plasma membrane and enzyme systems such as the NADPH oxidase complex of activated phagocytes, and it may regulate leukotriene formation at the nuclear envelope. A growing number of peptide motifs are being identified which mediate precise targeting of the protein components (33Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). These include motifs which mediate direct binding to phospholipids such as PH domains, or motifs which mediate protein-protein interactions such as SH2 and SH3 domains. Whereas enzyme activity is critically dependent on the tertiary structure of a protein, targeting motifs are modular in nature. Both 5-LO and 15-LO have a proline-rich sequence that resembles an SH3 binding domain located 95 aa from the C-terminus (11Dixon R.A.F. Jones R.E. Diehl R.E. Bennett C.D. Kargman S. Rouzer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Sigal E. Craik C.S. Highland E. Grunberger D. Costello L.L. Dixon R.A.F. Nadel J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 15-LO has a second proline-rich sequence between aa 326–338, and it is possible that the two enzymes have other targeting motifs which are currently unrecognized. We have studied the localization of 5-LO and 15-LO in stimulated RAW macrophages and demonstrate that 5-LO, but not 15-LO, translocates to the nuclear envelope in these cells. Because 5-LO and 15-LO are related enzymes and share common structural features, we considered the possibility that selective targeting of 5-LO is mediated by a relatively small domain with a distinct targeting motif. 5-LO has three putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) that are not observed in 15-LO (35Matsumoto T.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NLS domains target proteins to the nuclear pore for transport into the nucleus, a distinct process from the targeting of proteins to membrane locations. 5-LO was not imported into the nucleus in RAW macrophages, enabling translocation to the nuclear membrane to be studied independently of NLS-mediated transport through the nuclear pore. We created chimeras of 5-LO and 15-LO to determine which regions of 5-LO are essential for translocation to the nuclear envelope. Our results provide evidence that a complex interaction of domains throughout the molecule is required for membrane targeting and suggest that no small linear sequence by itself can sustain nuclear envelope localization. The cDNAs coding for human 5-LO (11Dixon R.A.F. Jones R.E. Diehl R.E. Bennett C.D. Kargman S. Rouzer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deletion mutants of 5-LO were made by digestion of the coding region with Bam HI (CΔ:110 and NΔ:564), Not I (CΔ:79), or Xho I (CΔ:33) prior to ligation. EGFP-C2 does not contain a Not I cloning site and CΔ:79 was ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and excised with Eco RI and Apa I for cloning into EGFP-C2. Chimeric 5-LO/15-LO molecules were made from the EGFP-C2 plasmid constructs. Chimera A was made by cutting EGFP-C2/5-LO with Bgl II (cuts in cloning site of EGFP-C2 upstream of 5-LO) and Xcm I (cuts at cDNA residue 749 in 5-LO) and replacing the excised fragment with the corresponding fragment derived from EGFP-C2/15-LO with Bgl II and Xcm I (cuts at residue 693 in 15-LO). Chimera B was made by cutting EGFP-C2/5-LO with Bam HI (cuts in cloning site of EGFP-C2 downstream of 5-LO) and Ppu MI (cuts at residue 1369 in 5-LO) and replacing the excised fragment. The corresponding segment of 15-LO was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer corresponding to bp 1309–1332 with a Ppu MI site added at the 5′-end (5′-AAGGACCTAACCTACAGCTCCTTCTGTCCC-3′), and a reverse primer corresponding to bp 1992–1969 with a Bam HI site added at the 5′-end (5′-GGATCCTTAGATGGCCACACTGTTTTCCAC-3′). Chimera C was made by cutting EGFP-C2/15-LO with Xcm I (cuts at residues 693 and 1211 in 15-LO) and replacing the excised fragment. The corresponding segment of 5-LO was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer corresponding to bp 744–770 (5′-GGCTACCAGTTCCTGAATGGCTGCAAC-3′), which contains the endogenous Xcm I site, and a reverse primer corresponding to bp 1286–1260 with an additional 4 bp at the 5′-end to generate an Xcm I site (5′-CCAGCTGCTCCCTGGCCTTGGTGTTGATTGC-3′). The cycling conditions used for polymerase chain reactions were 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min: 25 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10-min extension time. All constructs were sequenced at the Massachusetts General Hospital Molecular Biology Core Facility to confirm their identity. RAW 267.4 mouse macrophages were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown to 50% confluency on double chamber slides (Falcon) and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA/chamber using DEAE-dextran or SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen). Transfection efficiencies were determined to be 5–10% by EGFP fluorescence or by parallel transfections with pcDNA3.1(−)myc-His-lacZ (Invitrogen) followed by staining with X-gal solution. HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were differentiated by incubating 5 × 105 cells/ml with 1.3% Me2SO for 5 days. Cells were washed three times in PBS 48 h after transfection and were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 mmCa2+ and 5 μm A23187. The cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice in PBS, and mounted under coverslips in Gel/Mount (Biomeda). EGFP fusion proteins were localized by direct fluorescence. Representative results from multiple transfection/cell activation experiments are shown. In control experiments, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in PBS without A23187 or were preincubated in PBS containing 1 μm MK-886 for 5 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of A23187. As an alternative to A23187 stimulation, some cells were incubated with PMA (100 ng/ml) or dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm) for 20 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. For indirect immunofluorescence of lamin B, nontransfected cells were fixed as before and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. They were blocked in 10% goat serum for 30 min and then incubated with rabbit anti-lamin B (Dr. J. Casanova, Massachusetts General Hospital) diluted 1:1000 for 1 h, followed by fluoresceinated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 for 40 min. Fluorescence was analyzed under fluorescein filters (490/525 nm) using a Nikon FXA photomicroscope, and images were processed using IP Spectrum acquisition analysis software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA). The expression of the constructs was confirmed by Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody to EGFP (CLONTECH). 48 h after transfection, the cells were extracted in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The cell lysate was incubated with anti-EGFP diluted 1:500 for 1 h and then with protein G-agarose (Boehringer) for 3 h. The agarose beads were washed, and bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose Trans-Blot membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with anti-EGFP diluted 1:500 and sheep anti-mouse peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 and were processed for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For analysis of FLAP, RAW macrophages or HL-60 cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm PMSF, and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C using a Vibracell probe sonicator (3 × 1 min, setting 4, 50% output, 107 cells/ml). The sonicate was fractionated on a 15% gel (84 μg of protein/well), transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed with anti-FLAP antibody (Dr. F. Fitzpatrick, Huntsman Cancer Institute) diluted 1:200. EGFP-15-LO and EGFP-5-LO were detected as immunoreactive bands with the expected molecular mass of 100 and 105 kDa, respectively, following immunoprecipitation analysis of transfected RAW cells (Fig.1). EGFP-5-LO was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of unstimulated RAW cells (Fig.2 A). When cells were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187, EGFP-5-LO translocated to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2 D). The distribution of fluorescence around the nucleus appeared the same as that observed following staining for lamin B (Fig. 2 C). RAW macrophages therefore provide a convenient model system for studying nuclear envelope translocation, and demonstrate that the machinery for translocation (19Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D.

RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with EGFP-5-LO (A and D) or EGFP-15-LO (B and E). The transfected cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and either 5 μm A23187 (D and E) or no A23187 (A and B). The cells were fixed, and EGFP fusion proteins were localized by direct fluorescence. The distribution of a chimeric 5-LO/15-LO molecule (chimera A) expressed as a fusion protein with EGFP is shown in A23187-stimulated cells (F). The nuclear envelope was stained by indirect immunofluorescence of nontransfected cells using rabbit anti-lamin B followed by fluoresceinated goat anti-rabbit IgG (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No enrichment of fluorescence was observed on the nuclear envelope in unstimulated RAW cells, indicating that overexpression of 5-LO is insufficient to drive equilibrium binding to the membrane in the absence of a calcium signal. Stimulation of cells with PMA or dibutyryl cAMP did not induce translocation (data not shown). Western blot analysis detected FLAP in Me2SO-induced HL-60 cells but did not detect FLAP in uninduced HL-60 cells or RAW cells (data not shown). In addition, translocation of 5-LO in RAW cells was not inhibited by 1 μm MK-886. These data are consistent with the model proposed by Kargman et al. (20Kargman S. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in which 5-LO translocation and FLAP interaction can be two separate processes. EGFP-15-LO was expressed in unstimulated RAW macrophages with the same distribution as EGFP-5-LO (Fig. 2 B) but did not change its distribution with the addition of calcium ionophore (Fig.2 E). It can be concluded that 15-LO does not translocate to membranes in RAW macrophages by the same mechanism as 5-LO. This difference may prevent the two lipoxygenases competing for the same pool of arachidonic acid in cells that express both enzymes. Previous studies suggest that 15-LO can associate with nonnuclear membranes in a calcium-dependent manner (5Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Watson A. Doherty F.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the resolution of our assay system does not rule out this possibility. The results obtained here do not necessarily extend to the movement of 15-LO in epithelial cells but are consistent with observations in eosinophils and monocytes (5Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We created a series of deletion mutants of 5-LO to search for domains required for translocation to the nuclear envelope (Fig.3). The mutants were expressed as EGFP fusion proteins and were all localized to the cytoplasm of unstimulated RAW cells. Deletion of the C-terminal 110 aa (CΔ:110) abolished the ability of the fusion protein to localize to the nuclear envelope. A number of domains located in this deleted region have been suggested to play a role in translocation. A proline-rich sequence between amino acids 565–577 resembles an SH3 binding domain and has been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (34Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence suggests a role for MAP kinase mediated phosphorylation as a requisite for both nuclear envelope localization and activity (38Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), presumably by phosphorylation of a MAP kinase/Cdc2 kinase site at aa 662–667. The ability of these domains to support translocation by themselves was tested using the NΔ:564 mutant in which the C-terminal 110 aa were expressed as an EGFP fusion protein. The protein could not translocate to the nuclear envelope, indicating that although this C-terminal region is required for translocation it is not by itself sufficient. Smaller deletions of the C-terminal (the CΔ:79 truncation which includes the proline-rich domain but not the MAP kinase site, and the CΔ:33 truncation which lacks the kinase site but contains an extended portion of the C-terminal) do not localize to the nuclear envelope on cell stimulation. However, these deletion mutants had a low level of expression, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the deletions affect folding and disrupt the molecule over a more extensive region. Deletion of the C-terminal isoleucine is sufficient to prevent co-ordination with iron and probably results in improper folding which blocks enzyme activity (14Hammarberg T. Zhang Y.Y. Lind B. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we created a series of chimeras between 5-LO and 15-LO (Fig.4). These were chosen to allow the chimeric molecule to retain common LO structural properties in an intact configuration while replacing domains of 5-LO with those of the homologous nontargeted 15-LO molecule. For example, 15-LO contains a C-terminal isoleucine that can participate in binding iron so as to maintain structural integrity. It was not considered essential to retain enzyme activity in the chimeras because targeting domains are often modular and generally less sensitive to small variations in folding. The chimeras, that were expressed as EGFP fusion proteins, all localized to the cytoplasm of resting RAW cells. When aa 1–237 at the N-terminal of 5-LO were replaced with the corresponding aa 1–232 of 15-LO, the resulting molecule (chimera A) retained the ability to translocate after addition of A23187 (Fig.2 F). The fluorescence observed on the nuclear envelope, however, was of lower intensity than that seen with the native 5-LO fusion protein. This might indicate a reduced efficiency of translocation, but nuclear envelope localization was clearly discernible and distinct from unstimulated cells. In contrast, replacement of the C-terminal 231 aa of 5-LO with the corresponding aa of 15-LO (chimera B) abolished translocation. This chimeric molecule lacks the C-terminal MAP kinase site but contains a proline-rich region the same distance from the C-terminal as in native 5-LO. The C-terminal proline-rich regions of 5-LO and 15-LO are closely related (10 aa are identical in the 13 aa sequence). Both contain two prolines in critical positions for binding the polyproline helix to an SH3 domain. Exchange of the proline-rich domains is therefore unlikely to account for the loss of targeting of chimera B. This domain might mediate interactions with cytoskeletal proteins in the cytoplasm (34Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) rather than with the nuclear envelope. 15-LO contains a second proline-rich region between aa 326–338. This also resembles an SH3 binding domain but has a different context and might mediate different interactions. It is centrally located in a region which contains the most hydrophobic portions of the molecule. Hydropathy plots derived by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (40Kyte M. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) are very similar for both 15-LO and 5-LO, and the moderately hydrophobic domains shown in Figs. 3 and 4 (hatched boxes) correspond to aa 278–326 and 352–424 in 5-LO (41Sigal E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L13-L28PubMed Google Scholar). The latter segment contains hydrophobic amino acids that form a binding pocket for arachidonic acid and two histidines that coordinate iron at the active site. 5-LO and 15-LO appear structurally similar throughout this region, but 5-LO does not contain a central proline-rich domain. We considered the possibility that this domain might be sufficient to prevent translocation of 15-LO to the nuclear envelope by mediating inhibitory interactions or alternative targeting. We replaced the central core of 15-LO (aa 233–403) with the corresponding region (aa 238–411) of 5-LO. The resulting molecule (chimera C) localized to the cytoplasm but remained unable to translocate to the nuclear envelope after cell stimulation with A23187, ruling out this possibility. The lack of targeting of chimera C and the CΔ:110 deletion mutant indicate that the hydrophobic regions in the core of 5-LO are insufficient for membrane association. These mutant molecules remained exclusively in the cytoplasm and did not show any detectable localization to membrane boundaries. The C-terminal portion of the molecule is also insufficient for targeting (deletion mutant NΔ:564) but the results using chimera B confirm its importance. The critical part of the C-terminal cannot be localized to the proline-rich domain because this is substituted with a homologous domain in chimera B. Collectively our results demonstrate that no small linear domain by itself can sustain nuclear envelope localization of 5-LO, and targeting must depend on cooperative interactions between different parts of the molecule. The N-terminal 237 aa of 5-LO do not appear to be essential for membrane interaction but may still participate. Chimera A was able to translocate to the nuclear envelope on cell stimulation but with reduced efficiency. The N-terminal of 15-LO contains a lipase-like β-barrel of 115 amino acids (16Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) which might serve a permissive role in mediating membrane localization of chimera A. The N-terminal portions of 5-LO and 15-LO (aa 1–237) share 56% amino acid identity and might exhibit similar secondary structures. Recent studies describe localization of 5-LO in the nucleus of certain cells (42Woods J.W. Coffey M.J. Brock T.G. Singer I.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 43Chen X.S. Naumann T.A. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Import of proteins into the nucleus is mediated by NLS sequences, and the 5-LO molecule has three putative NLS domains that may contribute to this transport step (35Matsumoto T. Funk C.D. Radmark O. Hoog J.O. Jornvall H. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, transport of 5-LO through the nuclear pore probably represents a distinct event from targeting to the membranes of the nuclear envelope. For example, a nuclear pool of 5-LO is associated with alveolar macrophages and recruited neutrophils, but this is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and still requires a calcium stimulus to translocate to the nuclear membrane (45Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 46Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study no fluorescence was detected in the nucleoplasm of RAW macrophages in resting cells or at any observation time up to 20 min after the addition of A23187. This suggests that translocation occurs from the cytoplasm to the outer nuclear membrane and is independent of the NLS domains in the 5-LO molecule in these cells. 15-LO lacks putative NLS domains, but this may not be a sufficient explanation for its failure to target to the outer nuclear membrane in RAW macrophages which do not appear to import 5-LO into the nucleus. The role of NLS domains in 5-LO has been investigated with EGFP fusion proteins (36Chen X.S. Zhang Y.Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This work is distinct from our study because it analyzes movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm rather than translocation to the nuclear envelope. Taken together the two studies suggest considerable complexity in both nuclear transport and nuclear envelope localization. It has recently been suggested that there may in fact be mechanistic links between the two events (37Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), for example docking of 5-LO at the nuclear pore might be an intermediate step which enables 5-LO to engage other binding partners in the plane of the membrane. A putative NLS at aa 652–656 was implicated in participating in nuclear envelope localization (37Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our observations do not rule out this possibility because NLS[652–656] is located within the critical C-terminal domain required for translocation of 5-LO in RAW macrophages. Unlike cPLA2 and conventional isoforms of protein kinase C, 5-LO does not contain an obvious calcium-binding domain. 5-LO co-localizes with cPLA2 and FLAP in the nuclear envelope, but no direct interactions with these proteins have yet been demonstrated. Despite recent analyses of putative nuclear localization signals (36Chen X.S. Zhang Y.Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 5-LO still has no clearly identifiable targeting motif to direct translocation to the nuclear envelope. Our comparison of 5-LO with a homologous nontargeted enzyme (15-LO) in RAW macrophages suggest that multiple domains participate in mediating translocation to the nuclear envelope and demonstrate that the two enzymes use separate mechanisms to access a common substrate.

In this study, we have used these approaches to analyze the membrane disposition and organization of the 16-kDa proteolipid, a highly conserved integral membrane subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)1 (6Stevens T.H.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These endomembrane-bound proton pumps have a bipartite structure similar to that of the F1F0-ATPase (8Boekema E.J.

The proteolipid itself plays a direct role in the proton translocating function of the complex, mediated by a crucial transmembrane glutamate residue, which is the site of DCCD modification (9Arai H. Berne M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Not only is the 16-kDa proteolipid a functional analogue of the 8-kDa subunit c of the F-ATPase, but the two polypeptides also show sequence similarity and may have arisen from a common ancestor, with the V-ATPase subunit constituting a tandem repeat of its distant relative, subunit c (10Mandel M.

Such similarities between F- and V-ATPase subunits at the primary structure level (6Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and in the overall macromolecular appearance of the enzymes, has led to speculation that the V-ATPase may operate by a rotational mechanism similar to that of the F-ATPase (12Noji H.

However, any functional model of the V-ATPase must remain unsubstantiated while there is no plausible structural framework on which it can be based, and it is with this particular issue that this study is concerned. Studies in our laboratory have made extensive use of the 16-kDa proteolipid from the arthropod Nephrops norvegicus (7Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Jones P.C.

The cDNA for this proteolipid has the ability to complement mutation of the VMA3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with the arthropod proteolipid becoming assembled into an active V-ATPase in place of the endogenous Vma3p proteolipid (16Harrison M.A. Jones P.C.

This factor, coupled to the paucity of naturally occurring cysteines and the availability of specific antisera, makes the Nephrops proteolipid a particularly good vehicle for the type of study described here.

Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The spatial relationships between transmembrane segments within the proteolipid monomer and the intersubunit contacts governing its macromolecular organization in the V0 sector remain to be determined. We have examined these contacts by analyzing the capacity of cysteines placed in transmembrane segments to form cross-links under oxidizing conditions. To supplement this approach, we have used the lipophilic reagent N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PM) as a site-specific probe for cysteines accessible from the hydrophobic region of the membrane (21Wu J.H. Fillingos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8257-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Sedgwick E.G. Meuller J. Hou C. Rydstrom J. Bragg P.D.

The survey of helical interactions provided by the disulfide cross-linking approach and the map of lipid-accessible positions obtained by site-specific labeling combine to produce a detailed structural model of the proteolipid complex. Individual cysteine replacements were introduced into the cDNA for the Nephrops 16-kDa proteolipid by the PCR-based method of Landt et al. (24Landt O. Grunert H. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Initially, the wild type Cys54 was mutated to serine (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the resulting cDNA subcloned between Hin dIII (5′) and Xba I (3′) sites of pSK-Bluescript (Stratagene) to provide a template for subsequent mutations. Cysteine replacement cDNAs were subcloned between Hin dIII (5′) and Xba I (3′) sites of pYES2 (Invitrogen), and the mutations confirmed by automated sequencing from overlapping internal primers using the ABI Prism system. Double cysteine replacements on helix 1 and helix 2 of the proteolipid were constructed by excising a 350-base pair Eco 52I-Xba I fragment from pYES2 plasmids bearing cDNAs for helix 1 single cysteine mutants and replacing it with the corresponding fragment from helix 2 cysteine mutants. The Eco 52I site is located in the region of the proteolipid cDNA corresponding to the cytoplasmic loop between helix 1 and helix 2. Double cysteine replacements on helix 2 and helix 4 were constructed by removing a 380-base pair Pvu II-Pvu II fragment from pYES2 plasmids bearing cDNAs for helix 4 single cysteine mutants, replacing it with the same fragment extracted from plasmids for helix 2 single cysteine mutants, and checking the orientation of the insert in the reconstructed cDNA. Pvu II sites are located at the extreme 5′ end of the pYES2 multiple cloning site, and at a position in the proteolipid cDNA corresponding to the mid-helix 3 region. Helix 3-helix 4 and helix 2-helix 3 double cysteine mutants were constructed by superimposing the second mutation onto single cysteine mutant template cDNAs, using the PCR method described above. In the case of the helix 1 double cysteine replacement at positions 25 and 27, both mutations were incorporated into a single, extended mutagenic PCR primer. For constitutive expression in S. cerevisiae, proteolipid cDNAs were subcloned into the 2μ-based vector pPMA1 (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cells (W303–1B; MATα, his3, leu2, ade2, trp1, ura3, LEU2::vma3; Ref. 25Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) were transformed using the lithium acetate procedure (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were routinely grown on minimal medium (0.67% w/v yeast nitrogen base, 1% glucose) buffered to pH 5.5 with 25 mmMOPS/MES and supplemented with the appropriate amino acids for maintaining selection. To test for complementation of the vma3 mutation, cells transformed with pYES2 or pPMA1 plasmids were transferred to yeast extract-peptone plates buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm MOPS/MES (25Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), supplemented with 1% galactose or 1% glucose, respectively. To confirm the identities of suppressor mutations, plasmids were extracted from yeast transformants growing at pH 7.5 (27Philippsen P. Strotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), used to transform XL1-Blue Escherichia coli, then recovered and resequenced as above. Vacuolar membranes were isolated and ATPase activities determined as in Ref. 20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Labeling of cysteines with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) was performed with membranes resuspended to 0.25 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6. PM was added from 100 mm stock in dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture vortexed thoroughly before incubation at 30 °C for 1 h in the dark. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT to 20 mm, and the protein precipitated with nine volumes of acetone/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at −20 °C, before pelleting in a microcentrifuge. For solvent extraction of proteolipid, protein precipitates were resuspended to 0.5 mg/ml protein in water and extracted with seven volumes of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) by repeated cycles of vortexing and chilling over 3 h. The separated organic phase was dried under vacuum, and the residual material washed twice with acetone/ethanol (1:1) and once with acetone/ethanol/water (4.5:4.5:1) to remove remaining traces of lipid and PM, and then dried. The protein pellet was redissolved in 50 μl of 1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. A proportion of the extracted proteolipid was prepared for SDS-PAGE by mixing 1:1 with 2× concentrated sample buffer (130 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% v/v glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 10% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol). Disulfide cross-linking was induced by incubation of vacuolar membrane isolated from cells expressing double cysteine mutant proteolipids (resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 7.6) with 2.5 mm Cu(II) phenanthroline (28Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), or aqueous iodine solution (0.2 mm) (4Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Lee G.F. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5416-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of a mixture of iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide (0.5 and 2.5 mm, respectively), followed by precipitation with acetone/ethanol as above. Samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reductant, but supplemented with iodoacetamide/N-ethylmaleimide. Disulfide cross-links were reduced by addition of DTT to 50 mm and incubating under nitrogen at 30 °C for 1 h. As a negative control, the corresponding single cysteine mutants were screened for oxidative cross-linking, but no cross-linked species were detected. To screen for assembly of V-ATPase complexes containing mutant proteolipids, vacuolar membranes were solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and fractionated by centrifugation on glycerol gradients (16Harrison M.A. Jones P.C. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, resuspended to 2 mg/ml protein in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 7.5, and solubilized on ice for 30 min with 3% w/v dodecyl maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (4 °C, 1 h in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor), and the resulting supernatant (0.5 ml) layered onto 4.6-ml discontinuous glycerol gradients comprising 20–50% glycerol in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% w/v dodecyl maltoside. Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 18 h at 150,000 × g in a Beckman SW50.1, after which they were divided into nine fractions and stored at −70 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% acrylamide gels using the Tricine buffer system (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with polyclonal antiserum raised against the native Nephrops proteolipid. Binding of monoclonal antibodies to Vma1p, Vma2p, and Vph1p (all from Molecular Probes), and Vma5p and Vma6p (kindly provided by Prof. T. H. Stevens, University of Oregon) was used in an assay for V-ATPase assembly. Immunoblots were developed using the alkaline phosphatase or Roche Molecular Biochemicals chemiluminescent systems. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA system (Pierce). For chloroform/methanol-extracted proteolipids at very low concentration, the CBQCA fluorescent assay system was used (Molecular Probes). Fluorimetric measurement of PM modification was made with 200–300 ng of solvent-extracted proteolipid in a cuvette volume of 2 ml (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS). Fluorescence emission (at 20 °C) was measured across the range 355–455 nm, with excitation at 342 nm, using a Perkin-Elmer LS50 scanning spectrofluorimeter. Excitation and emission monochromator slit widths were set at 7.5 nm. Growth of S. cerevisiae at pH 7.5 requires a functional V-ATPase (25Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and the ability of cells to grow at this pH after transformation with cDNAs for mutant proteolipids provides a useful diagnostic test of function. Using this complementation assay, mutation of the single, naturally occurring cysteine in the Nephrops proteolipid (Cys54) to serine was found not to affect V-ATPase function, and transformants were able to assemble an active V-ATPase and grow at non-acidic pH (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A number of single cysteine replacements subsequently introduced into putative helix 2 of the proteolipid abolished the ability of the cDNA to complement the vma3 mutation (Table I). Four cysteine replacements on helix 2 were found not to affect function. Assuming α-helical periodicity, the positions of two of these residues (positions 58 and 61) would approximate to the same face of helix 2. On helix 3, a number of glycine residues which occur with helical periodicity were all sensitive to mutation. On the same segment of the proteolipid, three mutationally insensitive positions (103, 107, and 111) would also be spaced approximately one α-helical turn apart. Replacement of two hydrophobic Leu and one Ala residue in helix 4 also gave rise to functional proteolipids, but all other changes on this segment were detrimental to function. The effects of cysteine mutations in helix 1 on V-ATPase function have previously been described (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In general, cysteine replacement of Ser, Ala, or Val tended to be less compromising of V-ATPase function, whereas Tyr, Ile, and especially Gly residues tended to be more mutationally sensitive.Table IComplementation of the vma3 disruption in Saccharomyces by cysteine replacement mutants of the Nephrops 16-kDa proteolipidSaccharomyces cells (vma3::LEU2) were transformed with plasmids harboring Nephrops proteolipid cDNAs with double cysteine replacements.

In a number of cases, addition of a second cysteine appeared to have a suppressing effect on the inhibitory effect of the initial mutation (Table I). Combinations of cysteines in helix 1 and helix 2 at positions Ala25/Ile56, Leu27/Met60, and, to a lesser extent, Ala30/Gly62 gave functional proteolipids, although in each case the corresponding helix 2 single mutations did not. Similarly, combining a lethal cysteine at position Val141 on helix 4 with a non-lethal replacement of Val59 restored function. In the cases of cysteine combinations at positions Val59/Val141, Met60/Ile137, and Met60/Val141, pairs of lethal cysteine mutations appeared to have a mutually suppressing effect. Proteolipids were also engineered with cysteine combinations in helix 3 and helix 4 (data not shown). Only the cysteine combination at positions Ser103/Ile148 appeared to be a suppressor pair. Assays of vacuolar membrane ATP hydrolyzing activities for each single cysteine mutant gave values typically in the range 3.6–8.8 μmol of phosphate/mg of protein/h, compared with activities of 10.0, 5.0, and 4.7 μmol of phosphate/mg of protein/h for membranes from wild type yeast and from cells expressing non-mutated or C54S Nephrops proteolipids, respectively. Corresponding activities in vitro for apparent suppressor mutants were in the range 4.3 (27/60 mutant) to 2.8 (25/56 mutant) units/mg protein. There was considerable variability in the activities of membranes between preparations and individual transformants, and at the effectively saturating Mg-ATP concentration used in the assays, there did not appear to be any strong correlation between vacuolar membrane ATP hydrolyzing activity in vitro and functionality in vivo. However, as previously reported (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we observed that the activities of non-functional mutants had apparent Km values for Mg-ATP of 5 ± 1 mm, whereas those for recombinant enzymes able to support yeast growth at pH 7.5 were in the range 0.4–0.6 mm. Further, the activities of non-functional mutants were not inhibited by DCCD or bafilomycin, but all activities were equally sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide or nitrate treatment, suggesting that the residual ATP hydrolyzing activity of non-functional mutants may arise from “uncoupled” turnover by normally assembled V1 subunits. Direct monitoring of assembly of V1 in non-functional mutants is discussed below. Work from our laboratory has previously shown that helix 1 of the 16-kDa proteolipid is in contact with the same helix of an adjacent proteolipid monomer, with Ala26 of helix 1 oriented toward a central, water-accessible pore (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A testable prediction of these conclusions is that cysteines placed diametrically opposite each other within a single turn of helix 1 should result in close proximity between sulfhydryl side chains of residues on neigh-boring monomers. Helix 1-helix 1 contacts can then be verified by oxidative disulfide cross-linking. Accordingly, cysteines were introduced in place of Ser25 and Leu27 in helix 1 of the proteolipid, and their ability to form cross-links in situ in the vacuolar membrane analyzed (Fig. 1). This double cysteine mutant proteolipid was fully functional, and isolated vacuolar membranes showed high rates of ATPase activity (6.8 μmol of phosphate/mg of protein/h). Treatment with Cu(II) phenanthroline resulted in formation of a cross-linked proteolipid dimer of apparent mass 29 kDa, with subsequent reduction by DTT resulting in reversion of this species to monomer (Fig. 1). Approximately 50% of the expressed Nephrops proteolipid was incorporated into dimer. This proportion could not be increased either by extended oxidation time, higher oxidant concentration, or incubation with bis-maleimide homobifunctional cross-linkers (data not shown). Oxidizing treatment also reversibly inhibited 70–80% of ATP hydrolyzing activity, presumably as a consequence of disulfide formation between native cysteines within the active site of V1 (31Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine replacements of residues Ser6 and Ser44, in the extramembranous N-terminal and helix 1-helix 2 loop regions of the proteolipid, respectively, also form disulfide cross-links (20Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we combined these mutations into an active double mutant in an effort to produce higher order cross-linked structures that might reflect proteolipid stoichiometry in V0. However, even with both cysteines present on each polypeptide, only a dimeric species could be generated (Fig. 1). Unlike in the case of the Ser25/Ala27 cysteine replacement combination, oxidation resulted in a complete shift to the dimeric species. Because of its ability to partition into the hydrophobic phase of the membrane, and to form a fluorescent species only after reaction with thiols, N-(1-pyrene)maleimide is particularly useful as a probe for cysteines at lipid/protein interfaces (21Wu J.H. Fillingos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8257-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Kim J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4680-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, vacuolar membranes were isolated from Saccharomyces cells constitutively expressing single cysteine mutant proteolipids and incubated with PM in order to assess lipid accessibility of the individual replacement sites. Expression from the pPMA1 plasmids gave equivalent levels of all mutant proteolipids, as assessed by immunoblotting of vacuolar membranes (data not shown). PM-modified proteolipids were extracted into chloroform/methanol and the extent of modification determined from the fluorescence yield of the pyrenyl adduct (Fig.2). Fluorescence spectra for PM-modified proteolipids in SDS solution showed an emission maximum at 382 nm, with excitation at 342 nm. For accurate normalization of fluorescence yield, concentration of the extracted proteolipids was determined using the fluorescent CBQCA method, which we found to be sensitive in the 20–500 ng range. Typically, 0.5–1.0 μg of proteolipid was recovered from an initial 0.2 mg of vacuolar membrane protein. There was a variable degree of PM labeling of all helix 4 cysteine replacements, with significant modification being consistently found only in the case of the cysteine replacement of Leu142 (Fig. 2 A). Although cysteines introduced into helix 3 appeared overall less susceptible to modification (Fig. 2 B), a cysteine replacement of Ile111 did show significant levels of labeling. None of the individual replacements on helix 2 showed significantly elevated labeling (data not shown). Quantitatively, the Leu142 → Cys mutant proteolipid gave 113 fluorescence units/μg of protein, equivalent to approximately 1.9 units/pmol of proteolipid, a"

Sequence analysis of the RNAs indicated a single base difference between the conformers at position 133 (C in 7SL II and U in 7SL I) located in domain III. This change appears to be the result of a post-transcriptional editing event, since the single-copy 7SL RNA gene codes exclusively for a C at this position. The edited form (7SL I) was found preferentially in the cytoplasm, and the pre-edited form in the nucleus. 7SL I is mainly bound to ribosomes, whereas 7SL II is more abundant in ribosome-free particles. Mutations introduced in regions outside the editing site were found to occur in a single conformation, suggesting that the editing event is not the only factor that determines the conformation of the molecule. This study is the first description of an editing event on a small RNA other than tRNA and is the first report of C → U editing in trypanosomes. We propose a novel role for RNA editing in controlling the conformation of the 7SL RNA in vivo.

Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). SRP was shown in vitro to bind the signal sequence emerging from translating ribosomes and to trigger a transient pause in elongation. The arrest in translation was documented by canine SRP in a wheat-germ cell-free system (2Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) but not when canine SRP was added to either reticulocyte lysate or HeLa cell extracts (3Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2031-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, SRP was shown to cause translational pausing at multiple sites in the nascent polypeptide in reticulocyte lysates (4Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the second step of the SRP cycle, elongation arrest is relieved when SRP interacts with the SRP receptor. The SRP is released and can recycle, whereas the ribosome remains attached to the membrane and the nascent chain is then translocated co-translationally into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).The best studied eukaryotic SRP is the canine particle that is composed of one RNA molecule, the 7SL RNA, and six proteins: SRPs 9, 14, 19, 54, 68, and 72 (5Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with canine SRP indicated that SRP54 binds the signal peptide as it emerges from the ribosome, SRP9/14 bind to domain I and function in elongation arrest, SRP68/72 promote translocation into the ER, whereas SRP19 facilitates the binding of SRP54 to the RNA (6Siegel V. Walter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 3: 314-316Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SRP exists in the cell in different states. About 15% of the SRPs are found as free (∼11 S) particles, and the remainder are divided almost equally between ribosomes and microsomal membranes (7Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The association of SRPs to monosomes is weak compared with its tight binding to polysomes (7Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).7SL RNA was cloned and sequenced from a variety of eukaryotes and these RNAs appear to fit a canonical secondary structure model (8Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite extensive phylogenetic studies on the 7SL RNA, the only experimental data supporting the secondary structure model are the nuclease digestion (9Gundelfinger E.D. Carlo M.D. Zopf D. Melli M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2325-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and α-sarcin cleavage data (10Siegel V. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1801-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The trypanosome 7SL RNA also fits the canonical secondary structure model, except that domain I appear to deviate in length and structure from the human RNA (11Michaeli S. Podell D. Agabian N. Ullu E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 1: 55-65Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Only 70% identity exists between the 7SL RNAs of the monogenetic trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma and Trypanosoma brucei (13Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas domains I and IV of these trypanosomatid 7SL RNAs are highly conserved, domain III is divergent (13Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of a co-migrating tRNA-like molecule, which co-purifies with the T. brucei 7SL RNA (12Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem.

Using affinity selection with antisense biotinylated oligonucleotide, we have recently demonstrated that L. collosoma SRP complex is indeed composed of two RNA molecules, the 7SL RNA and a tRNA-like molecule (sRNA-85). 2H.

Michaeli, submitted for publication.The exact function of the 7SL RNA within the SRP complex is unknown. 7SL RNA most probably does not function simply as a passive scaffold for the SRP proteins but rather has an active role in the translocation process. SRP may therefore undergo structural rearrangements during the functional cycle of the SRP. Indeed, one study, performed on soluble polysome-bound and membrane-bound SRPs, revealed that the secondary structure of the 7SL RNA in these particles is different, suggesting that the 7SL RNA may play an active role in the SRP cycle (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The potential for the 7SL RNA to exist in more than one conformation was observed for human 7SL RNA (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Zwieb C. Ullu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 4: 4639-4658Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the sequences that are essential for adopting the different conformations were determined (15Zwieb C. Ullu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 4: 4639-4658Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar,16Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).RNA editing is a process that co or post-transcriptionally modifies RNA primary sequence from that encoded by the gene by either deletion, insertion, or base modification (17Smith H.C. Gott J.A. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). The phenomenon was first described in trypanosomatid mitochondrial mRNA and was shown to occur through a guide RNA-mediated cleavage and ligation (18Stuart K. Allen T.E. Kable M.L. Lawson S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). RNA editing has since been found in diverse lower and higher eukaryotes. The process can occur in the nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondria, and it involves base modification such as C → U, U → C, and A → I transitions on mRNAs (17Smith H.C. Gott J.A. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). RNA editing was also shown to alter the sequence of tRNA and rRNA (17Smith H.C. Gott J.A. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that the L. collosoma 7SL RNA is present in the cell in two stable conformational states. The conformational change is associated with an RNA editing event of C → U conversion at position 133. This event, however, is not the only factor that determines whether 7SL RNA will undergo the structural changes, since 7SL RNA mutants, altered in regions outside the editing site, were found in a single conformation. The conversion between the two conformations is a dynamic process that takes place in the cytoplasm; 7SL I was also found preferentially attached to ribosomes. This is the first report that correlates conformational change of a small RNA molecule with RNA editing and is the first to report the existence of C → U editing in trypanosomes.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the trypanosomatid 7SL RNA undergoes a conformational change in vivo that is associated with an RNA editing event. This is the first description of a C → U editing on a small RNA apart from tRNA, and is also the first case of C → U editing in trypanosomes.The L. collosoma 7SL RNA, unlike all 7SL RNA described so far, is not fully denatured in 7 m urea. Such a property was previously observed for E. coli 5 S rRNA (26Digweed M. Kumagai I. Pieler T. Erdmann V.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the fast migrating molecule carried a U in position 92, whereas the slow migrating variant contained a C in the same position (26Digweed M. Kumagai I. Pieler T. Erdmann V.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This is exactly the case in this study, since the fast migrating 7SL I carries a U in position 133 and the slow migrating molecule (7SL II) carries a C in the same position. In the case of the 5 S rRNA, it was suggested that the only difference observed between the two variants is responsible for the drastic reduction in the stability of the two 5 S rRNA molecules (26Digweed M. Kumagai I. Pieler T. Erdmann V.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether this is also the case in the L. collosoma 7SL RNA. However, the findings that mutated 7SL RNAs located outside the editing site were found in a single conformation may suggest that the editing is not the only factor that controls the structural change. The mechanism that elicits the conformational change of 7SL RNA is unknown. Since the editing site is situated close to loop III and to the region that was shown to bind SRP19 in the canine SRP (30Siegel V. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1801-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it may alter SRP19 binding. Alternatively, the editing event may affect long range tertiary interactions.The differences in pause sites observed between 7SL I and 7SL II may represent regions on the molecule that present obstacles for reverse transcriptase due to RNA structures that are not melted because of strong secondary or tertiary interactions. The differential stops between 7SL I and 7SL II reflect differences in the structures of the two molecules. These different structures are mostly located in domains II and III. Previous studies performed on naked human 7SL RNA indicated that in vitro transcribed human 7SL RNA can exist in two different conformations that can be separated on native gels (15Zwieb C. Ullu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 4: 4639-4658Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By site-directed mutagenesis, different sites were shown to be important for the formation of these two conformations. Most of the mutations affecting the conformation of the RNA were located in domains II and III of the RNA (16Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These are also the domains where major differences were seen in stop sites between the trypanosomatid 7SL I and II. A small region located between positions 129 to 134 of the mammalian 7SL RNA, which is part of the SRP 19 binding site was shown to be most critical for the conformational change that the mammalian 7SL RNA undergoes (16Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The editing site detected in this study is located in this same domain.Studies performed on ribosome-bound, membrane-bound, and free canine SRPs have indicated that the 7SL RNAs in these SRPs are found in different conformations. This conclusion was based on variation in sensitivity of the different SRPs to chemical modifications (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Initially, it was expected that polysome-bound SRP should be less sensitive to chemical modification than free SRPs because of potential protection of the particles by ribosomes. Instead, the converse was found, and chemical accessibility of polysome-bound SRP was actually higher than that of soluble SRPs, suggesting that the polysome-bound SRP has a more open conformation than that of the 7SL RNA in free particles (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study supports this notion, since 7SL I, which is preferentially associated with ribosomes, is the molecule that was found to be more accessible to chemical modification and therefore has a more open structure, whereas the 7SL II, which is found mostly associated with free SRPs possesses a more closed structure, as revealed by the many strong pause sites and inaccessibility to modification by DEPC. The location of the pause sites observed on the 7SL RNA agrees well with the regions that were shown to be involved in binding to ribosomes or to the rough ER membrane (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In particular, attention should be drawn to the region around nt 120 in domain III, since homologous regions on the mammalian 7SL RNA were shown to bind to ribosomes or the ER membrane. In addition, the regions in domain II around nt 220 were also shown in the mammalian system to be involved in binding to ribosomes or ER membrane (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only domain I of the 7SL I but not of 7SL II was accessible to interaction with DEPC, suggesting major differences in the structure of this Alu-like domain between the conformers. In the mammalian SRP, however, the Alu domain was less accessible to chemical modification compared with S domains II and III (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).It is currently unknown why the 7SL RNA undergoes a conformational change during the translocation cycle. Two steps in the translocation cycle may require changes in the 7SL RNA: first when SRP interacts with the ribosome and induces an arrest or a pause in translation, and again when SRP is released from the ribosome after its interaction with the SRP receptor (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Conformational changes of rRNA have been shown to take place in the transition from inactive to active 30 S ribosomal subunits (31Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), in the assembly of subunits to monosomes (32Stebbins-Boaz B. Gerbi S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 217: 93-112Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and during tRNA translocation (33Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In this context, the 7SL RNA may cause translation arrest by interacting with the rRNA, thus interfering with the conformational changes rRNA undergoes during protein synthesis. However, the arrest function of SRP was shown to be mediated by domain I (6Siegel V. Walter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 3: 314-316Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that domain I functions in protein arrest by mimicking the shape of a tRNA and thereby blocking the entry of incoming tRNAs. Our finding that a tRNA-like molecule is present in the SRP complex in a 1:1 ratio with the 7SL RNA supports the notion that the tRNA-like domain may play a role in the arrest (2Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper, as well as the studies on the canine SRP (14Andreazzoli M. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the structure of domains II and III are different in ribosome-free and ribosome-bound SRP, suggest that additional interactions apart from the domain I but with domains II and III of the molecule are also essential for the interaction of the SRP with the ribosome. Further studies are needed to accurately map the site of interaction of 7SL RNA with rRNA, e.g. by in vivo UV-induced psoralen cross-linking.C → U conversion is among the best documented RNA editing events and has been shown to take place in mitochondria, chloroplast, and the nucleus (17Smith H.C. Gott J.A. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). The first reported C → U editing by base deamination was for the apolipoprotein B mRNA that takes place in the nucleus post-transcriptionally (17Smith H.C. Gott J.A. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). C → U editing was found also in the mitochondria and chloroplast of land plants (34Marchfelder A. Binder S. Brennicke A. Knoop V. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 307-323Google Scholar). This type of editing is, however, not restricted to mRNA and was found to modify the anticodon loop and acceptor stem of tRNAs (35Price D. Gray M.W. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 289-305Google Scholar). Whereas the editing of apoB mRNA is directed by a mooring sequence located adjacent to the editing site, tRNA editing, especially editing sites in the acceptor stem, may be guided by the base-paired region opposite the edited nucleotide (34Marchfelder A. Binder S. Brennicke A. Knoop V. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 307-323Google Scholar, 35Price D. Gray M.W. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 289-305Google Scholar). This could also be the case for the 7SL RNA editing, since the site is present in an 8-base pair stem-loop structure. It is currently unknown what type of activity could mediate the editing event revealed in this study. However, the conversion of C → U may “freeze” the 7SL I. Since the results presented in this study suggest that the conversion of 7SL I to 7SL II is a dynamic process, it may imply that an activity that mediates U → C conversion should also exist to convert 7SL I to 7SL II. U → C editing was reported mainly in the mitochondria and chloroplast of land plants and mammalian tRNAs (34Marchfelder A. Binder S. Brennicke A. Knoop V. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 307-323Google Scholar). This conversion could be achieved by transamination.The finding of C → U editing in trypanosomes is especially interesting because it suggests that U insertion and deletion present in the kinetoplast (18Stuart K. Allen T.E. Kable M.L. Lawson S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is not the only editing pathway in trypanosomes and that two different mechanisms of editing can co-exist in the same organism. Because of the early divergence of trypanosomes from the eukaryotic lineage, the finding of C → U editing in trypanosomes suggests that this process evolved early in eukaryotic evolution.The localization of 7SL I in the cytoplasmic fraction suggests that this editing takes place in the cytoplasm. We could not, however, rule out the possibility that editing takes place in the nucleus and that the edited RNA is rapidly translocated to the cytoplasm. The finding that 7SL RNA mutants examined in this study exist in a single conformation may suggest that only 7SL RNA molecules that engage active particles undergo the conformational change. We therefore favor the hypothesis that the editing function may be associated with the ribosome. This hypothesis is not unprecedented, since deaminases involved in editing were found in the cytoplasm of plants (34Marchfelder A. Binder S. Brennicke A. Knoop V. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 307-323Google Scholar).The combination of the unique properties of the L. collosoma 7SL RNA with the ability to express in vivo mutated 7SL RNA will be further used to identify sequences that are involved in: (a) the editing event, (b) the ability to undergo the conformational change, and (c) binding of ribosomes. The establishment of an in vitro system that is amenable to convert 7SL II is essential for better understanding the mechanism and machinery that carries out this novel editing event. We anticipate that other editing events of C → U on small RNAs, such as tRNAs and other cellular and kinetoplast mRNAs, may be found in trypanosomes. The signal recognition particle (SRP)1 functions as an adaptor between the protein synthesis machinery and the protein translocation apparatus (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). SRP was shown in vitro to bind the signal sequence emerging from translating ribosomes and to trigger a transient pause in elongation. The arrest in translation was documented by canine SRP in a wheat-germ cell-free system (2Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) but not when canine SRP was added to either reticulocyte lysate or HeLa cell extracts (3Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2031-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, SRP was shown to cause translational pausing at multiple sites in the nascent polypeptide in reticulocyte lysates (4Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the second step of the SRP cycle, elongation arrest is relieved when SRP interacts with the SRP receptor. The SRP is released and can recycle, whereas the ribosome remains attached to the membrane and the nascent chain is then translocated co-translationally into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The best studied eukaryotic SRP is the canine particle that is composed of one RNA molecule, the 7SL RNA, and six proteins: SRPs 9, 14, 19, 54, 68, and 72 (5Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with canine SRP indicated that SRP54 binds the signal peptide as it emerges from the ribosome, SRP9/14 bind to domain I and function in elongation arrest, SRP68/72 promote translocation into the ER, whereas SRP19 facilitates the binding of SRP54 to the RNA (6Siegel V. Walter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 3: 314-316Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SRP exists in the cell in different states. About 15% of the SRPs are found as free (∼11 S) particles, and the remainder are divided almost equally between ribosomes and microsomal membranes (7Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The association of SRPs to monosomes is weak compared with its tight binding to polysomes (7Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 7SL RNA was cloned and sequenced from a variety of eukaryotes and these RNAs appear to fit a canonical secondary structure model (8Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite extensive phylogenetic studies on the 7SL RNA, the only experimental data supporting the secondary structure model are the nuclease digestion (9Gundelfinger E.D. Carlo M.D. Zopf D. Melli M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2325-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and α-sarcin cleavage data (10Siegel V. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1801-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The trypanosome 7SL RNA also fits the canonical secondary structure model, except that domain I appear to deviate in length and structure from the human RNA (11Michaeli S. Podell D. Agabian N. Ullu E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 1: 55-65Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Only 70% identity exists between the 7SL RNAs of the monogenetic trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma and Trypanosoma brucei (13Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas domains I and IV of these trypanosomatid 7SL RNAs are highly conserved, domain III is divergent (13Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of a co-migrating tRNA-like molecule, which co-purifies with the T. brucei 7SL RNA (12Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that the trypanosomatid SRP may differ from other SRPs and is composed of two small RNAs. Using affinity selection with antisense biotinylated oligonucleotide, we have recently demonstrated that L. collosoma SRP complex is indeed composed of two RNA molecules, the 7SL RNA and a tRNA-like molecule (sRNA-85). 2H.

https://openalex.org/W2055958222,"Previous results from this laboratory have shown that human kidney (293) cells transfected with the rat follitropin receptor (rFSHR) internalize agonist (<i>i.e.</i> human follitropin, hFSH) at a rate similar to that of other agonist-G protein-coupled receptor complexes while 293 cells transfected with the rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (rLHR) internalize agonist (human choriogonadotropin, hCG) at a rate that is about 1 order of magnitude slower. Taking advantage of this difference and the high degree of homology between the rLHR and rFSHR, we have now used chimeras of these two receptors to begin to delineate structural features that influence their internalization. Analysis of six chimeras that exchanged only the transmembrane domains (designated FLF and LFL), only the COOH-terminal domains (FFL or LLF) or both domains (FLL or LFF) show that the origin of the extracellular domain is at least as important, if not more, than the origin of the transmembrane and COOH-terminal domains in determining the rate of internalization of the gonadotropin receptors. Thus, the rates of internalization of agonist internalization mediated by FFL, FLF, and FLL more closely resemble rFSHR than rLHR, while the rates of agonist internalization mediated by LLF, LFL, and LFF more closely resemble rLHR than rFSHR. The importance of the extracellular domain was also evident even upon overexpression of arrestin-3, a protein that enhances the rate of internalization of the wild-type receptors and chimeras by binding to their intracellular regions."
https://openalex.org/W2035422980,"A prominent feature of the interaction of MS2 coat protein with RNA is the quasi-symmetric insertion of a bulged adenine (A−10) and a loop adenine (A−4) into conserved pockets on each subunit of the coat protein dimer. Because of its presence in both of these adenine-binding pockets, Thr45 is thought to play an important role in interaction with RNA on both subunits of the dimer. To test the significance of Thr45, we introduced all 19 amino acid substitutions. However, we were initially unable to determine the effects of the mutations on RNA binding because every substitution compromised the ability of coat protein to fold correctly. Genetic fusion of coat protein subunits reverted these protein structural defects, allowing us to show that the RNA binding activity of coat protein tolerates substitution of Thr45, but only on one or the other subunit of the dimer. Single-chain heterodimer complementation experiments suggest that the primary site of Thr45 interaction with RNA is with A−4 in the translational operator. Either contact of Thr45 with A−10 makes little contribution to stability of the RNA-protein complex, or the effects of Thr45 substitution are offset by conformational adjustments that introduce new, favorable contacts at nearby sites.

The structure of the binding site for coat protein is shown in Fig. 1 A. In the RNA-protein complex, the bulged A at position −10 and the loop A at −4 project outward from the body of the RNA, with the planes of the two bases aligned roughly parallel to the helix axis. A−4 and A−10 form quasi-symmetric contacts with coat protein, inserting themselves into pockets comprised of Val29, Thr45, Ser47, and Lys61 on different subunits of the dimer. Because operator RNA is asymmetric, so too is the RNA-protein complex and we may distinguish the two subunits of the dimer. Here we use the convention of Valegard (11Valegard K. Murray J.B.

Inspection of the crystal structure of the RNA-protein complex suggests that ThrA45 makes H-bonds with N6 and N7 of A−4, while on the other subunit ThrB45 seems to H-bond with N1 and N6 of A−10. However, it is difficult to predict reliably the separate contributions of these individual interactions to binding energy on structural grounds alone.We previously mapped genetically the MS2 RNA-binding site by isolating a series of repressor-defective mutants in which the ability to bind operator RNA was reduced (7Peabody D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These mutants were isolated using a two-plasmid genetic system in which coat protein expressed from one plasmid represses translation of a replicase-β-galactosidase fusion expressed from a second plasmid. Repressor-defective mutants make blue colonies on plates containing the chromogenic β-galactosidase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal).1 To ensure that these mutational defects were confined to the RNA-binding site, each mutant was screened for the ability to assemble into a virus-like particle. This allowed us to discard mutants having gross perturbations of protein structure. In this manner, we identified 10 different amino acids, each residing on the surface of the coat protein β-sheet, whose substitution specifically disrupted RNA binding activity (Fig.1 B). Given the apparent importance of Thr45 in RNA binding, however, we were surprised by the absence of substitutions identifying Thr45as a binding site residue. Here we describe the introduction of all 19 amino acid substitutions at position 45. Unexpectedly, every mutation reduced the ability of coat protein to fold correctly, apparently explaining our initial failure to find repressor-defective, assembly-competent Thr45 substitutions. At first, this frustrated our efforts to determine the effects of the mutations on RNA binding, but genetic fusion of coat protein subunits reverted these structural defects and allowed investigation of the RNA-binding role of Thr45. The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is a symmetric dimer that serves both as the major structural protein of the virus particle and as a repressor of viral replicase translation.

The S10b ATPase is a component of the 26 S proteasome, and its concentration and that of its mRNA increase dramatically during development in a manner similar to other ATPases of the 19 S regulator of the 26 S proteasome. The S10b and S6′ (TBP1) ATPases are also present in a complex of ∼220 kDa in intersegmental muscles. The 220-kDa complex markedly activates (2–10-fold) the 26 S proteasome, even when bound to anti-S10b antibodies immobilized on Sepharose, and increases in concentration ∼5-fold like the 26 S proteasome in the intersegmental muscles in preparation for the programmed death of the muscle cells. A similar activator complex is present in human brain and placenta. Free activator complexes cross-activate: the Manduca complex activates rat skeletal muscle 26 S proteasomes, and the placental complex activates Manduca 26 S proteasomes. The placental activator complex contains S10b and S6′, but not p27.

After emergence, these cells die within 24–36 h in response to changes in circulating levels of ecdysteroid hormone. Previous studies have shown that eclosion is preceded in ISM by a massive increase in polyubiquitin gene expression (5Schwartz L.M. Myer A. Kosz L. Engelstein M. Maier C. Neuron. 1990; 5: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and a large increase in ubiquitinylated proteins (6Haas A.L. Baboshina O. Williams B. Schwartz L.M. J. Biol.

In the muscles of larvae at stage 0, before the hormone-dependent changes in gene expression activate the death process, proteasomes appear to be depleted in some regulatory ATPases (e.g. S4 and S7). 2The ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome have been named according to Ref. 1Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Marked increases in several ATPases (S4, S6, and S7) then occur, so that by stage 8, just before cell death, the 26 S proteasomes prepared from muscle contain at least four of the regulatory ATPases (S4, S6, S6′, and S7). The simplest explanation is that proteasomes are increased in number and equipped with the ATPases needed to degrade the accumulating multi-ubiquitinylated proteins during the programmed elimination of the muscles (8Dawson S.P.

Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As an extension of studies on these ATPases in programmed cell death in ISM during eclosion in M. sexta (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L. Kloetzel P.M. Tanaka K. Mayer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1850-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we have cloned a second S10b (SUG2) ATPase and shown that this ATPase is not only associated with 26 S proteasomes, but is also found in a much smaller complex, of ∼220 kDa, with the S6′ (TBP1) ATPase. The concentration of the 220-kDa complex increases in ISM during programmed cell death at the same time as that of the 26 S proteasome, suggesting a role for the 220-kDa complex in muscle cell death. A modulator complex containing the S10b and S6′ ATPases and a p27 protein has been previously described (17DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3112-3118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Complexes similar to the Manduca 220-kDa complex are present in human brain and placenta and contain the S10b and S6′ ATPases, but not p27. The 220-kDa complexes can activate preparations of 26 S proteasomes across species barriers, indicating the evolutionary conservation of these proteasomal activators. Their potential roles in the proteolytic mechanisms of the 26 S proteasome and other possible functions of the S10b, S6′, and other ATPases in the cell are discussed. The insects were raised, the stages of pre-ecdysial development recognized, and muscles collected as described previously (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C.

Degenerate primers matching the ATPase boxes A and B (18Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar) were used to clone several different ATPase sequences from Manduca genomic DNA. The two primers TAYGGNCCNCCNGGNACNGGNA (corresponding to the protein sequence YGPPGTG) and GGNGCRTCRATYTCRTCRATRAA (antisense strand for the protein sequence FIDEIDA) were used at a concentration of 0.5 μm in a 50-μl PCR containing 50 μm dNTPs, 200 ng of genomic DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Lewes, United Kingdom). A 200-base pair product was cloned into the Eco RV site of the pSK− plasmid (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) and manually sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method. This sequence information was used to design oligodeoxynucleotides for subsequent reverse transcription-PCR. PCR/3′-RACE was used to obtain the 3′-end of a clone that showed good homology to other proteasomal ATPases, but appeared to represent a distinct gene (“AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) clone”). RNA (1 μg) obtained from stage 7 Manduca ISM (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) was reverse-transcribed (37 °C, 2 h) in the following 20-μl reaction: 100 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.125 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, St. Albans, UK), and 0.5 μg of T17 adapter primer (GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT). Next, 2 μl of the reaction was used in a 50-μl PCR as described above, but with 25 pmol of adapter primer (GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA) and 25 pmol of AAA clone-specific primer (AACTACGCGCGCGACCACCAG) (annealing temperature of 60 °C, 35 cycles). A 650-base pair product was cloned into pSK− as described above and sequenced. PCR/5′-RACE was used to obtain the remaining sequence of the AAA clone transcript. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 50–100 μg of total RNA using the PolyATtract kit (Promega, Southampton, UK). Reverse transcription was performed as described above using 20 ng of poly(A)+ RNA and 0.5 μg of an oligo(dT) primer. Excess primers were removed with an S-400 microspin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and after concentration, the 3′-end of the cDNA was tailed (37 °C, 20 min) using 20 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 pmol of dGTP. The tailing reaction was halted by addition of EDTA and NaCl. The tailed cDNA was pelleted using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl of 1 mNaCl, and then repelleted by centrifugation following addition of ethanol and 0.25 μg of glycogen. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and PCR was performed as with 3′-RACE, but with the addition of 25 pmol of C17 adapter primer (GACTCGAGTCGACATCGACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) and another AAA clone-specific primer (CAGACTATTATTATTATTACAATGC). Following the initial reaction, a second round of PCR was performed with 2 μl of the initial reaction product, the adapter primer, and a second AAA clone-specific primer (AAATCTATGAAGTAATTACAGAT). A 1350-base pair PCR product was ligated into the Eco RV site of the pSK− plasmid and sequenced. Finally, the full-length coding sequence of the Manduca homologue of S10b was amplified (annealing temperature of 55 °C, 35 cycles) with 2.5 units of the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 500 μm dNTPs, and 25 pmol of primers ATGCCTGCCGGACCTTCC and AAATCTATGAAGTAATTACAGAT using reverse-transcribed RNA obtained from stage 7 ISM; a 1200-base pair product was cloned into the Eco RV site of pSK−and named pSK.S10b.cds. Frozen (−70 °C) ISM (500–1000 mg) taken from different developmental stages of M. sexta was homogenized in 4 volumes of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.5)) using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected (S2, soluble muscle extract). Human placental extract was prepared as described for ISM. Homogenized human brain was similarly processed except, that one centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 20 min was carried out. Supernatants (S2) were taken for gradient fractionation. Fraction II was prepared from human erythrocytes essentially as described (17DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Proteins bound to DE52 were eluted with buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl and then 0.5m NaCl, pooled, and used directly for glycerol gradient centrifugation. Soluble ISM extract (5 mg of protein) was loaded onto 14-ml 10–40% (v/v) glycerol gradients containing the same Tris-HCl, ATP, and MgCl2 concentrations as in homogenization buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 24,000 rpm in an SW 6 × 16.5 rotor for 20–22 h (Rav = 70,000 × g) at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected by displacement with Maxidens (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). Human placental (9 mg), brain (9.6 mg), and erythrocyte (10 mg) soluble proteins were fractionated in the same way. Fractions were assayed for peptidase activity (insect muscle, 5 μl; and human tissue extracts, 10 μl) (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L.

ISM extract (from ∼200 μg of tissue) was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Soluble proteins (up to 200 μl) were applied to a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted (flow rate of 400 μl/min) using homogenization buffer. Thirty-six fractions (200 μl) were collected (from 6.8- to 14-ml elution volume). For activation assays, glycerol gradient fractions containing activator complex (fractions 3–5) or Superose fractions (150–250 kDa) were incubated with 26 S proteasomes from the glycerol gradients (fractions 12–15) at 37 °C for 30 min before carrying out chymotrypsin assays. The Manduca S10b coding sequence was cut from pSK.S10b.cds, using Eco RI and Hin dIII restriction enzymes, and ligated into pRSET.C (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). His-tagged S10b fusion protein was prepared by transforming the plasmid construct into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) and inducing expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 3 h at 37 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in 0.2 volumes of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.8) and sonicated. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the His-tagged ATPase was purified by chromatography on nickel-charged chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature (8Dawson S.P.

Eluted protein was dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C, freeze-dried, checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits. Antiserum to S10b ATPase was tested against the expressed fusion protein by Western analysis of whole cell extract from isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-treated E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pSK.S10b.cds. The anti-S6 antibody was raised against the recombinant Manduca protein expressed from pSMS73c (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L. Kloetzel P.M.

Anti-S6′ and anti-S10b antibodies was raised against His-tagged human S6′ and S10b expressed from pET recombinant plasmids (Novagen, Abingdon, UK) as described above. Antisera to Manduca and human S10b and human S6′ were affinity-purified by binding to purified His-tagged recombinant antigen protein, coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma, Poole, UK), and eluting with 1 m glycine (pH 2.5). Antiserum to a control (irrelevant) peptide (AG93, a fragment of pro-islet amyloid precursor protein) was similarly affinity-purified on immobilized AG93 peptide. Monoclonal antibodies to human S10b, S6′, S7, and S8 ATPases and the 20 S subunits HC2/MCP20 and Z/MCP205 were kindly provided by Dr. Klavs Hendil (August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen). Polyclonal antiserum to human recombinant p27 was from Prof. Keiji Tanaka (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan). Western analyses were performed as described (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L. Kloetzel P.M. Tanaka K. Mayer R.J. J. Biol.

Affinity-purified Manduca anti-S10b and human anti-S10b (10 ml) and anti-AG93 (equivalent to 2.5 ml of antiserum) antibodies were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (1 ml). Activator complexes from glycerol gradient fractions 3–5 were bound to the matrices by inversion for 1–2 h at room temperature. After repeated washing with homogenization buffer, activator complexes were eluted from the immunoaffinity matrices for Western analyses with 1 m glycine (pH 2.5), and residual bound material was released by boiling in urea/SDS loading buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). As part of the characterization of all proteasomal regulatory ATPases from Manduca, multiple DNA sequences encoding the region between the two elements of the Walker ATP-binding motifs were amplified and cloned. Sequencing of individual clones revealed five different sequences, some of which bore very close homology to previously identified proteasomal ATPases. One clone that bore less homology to known proteasomal ATPases was chosen for further study, and full-length cDNA sequences were obtained using PCR/RACE. The DNA and predicted protein sequences of the ATPase shown in Fig.1 are closely homologous to the 19 S regulatory S10b (SUG2) ATPase (1Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 3The nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1 has been scanned against the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank, and there are scores of related sequences, including human S10b (accession numberD78275), yeast S10b (accession number U43720), and squirrel CADp44 (accession number U36395). As is the case for many other members of this subgroup of the AAA superfamily, the S10b ATPase has a putative coiled-coil motif, the Walker A and B nucleotide-binding motifs, and putative DNA helicase motifs. The S10b ATPase mRNA and protein increase ∼5-fold in concentration in the muscles in preparation for cell death (data not shown). Again, these changes are similar to those observed for Manduca S4, S6, and S7 ATPases during the same period (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L.

The S10b ATPase is a component of the 26 S proteasome as shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig.2); this analysis also demonstrates that the increase in the tissue content of the S10b ATPase is mainly associated with the 26 S proteasome.Figure 2Glycerol gradient analysis of 26 S proteasome catalytic activities and S10b ATPase content at developmental stages 0 and 7. Soluble protein (5 mg) from stage 0 (A) and stage 7 (B) ISM was fractionated by centrifugation through a 10–40% glycerol gradient. Protein and chymotrypsin activity were determined and immunoassay of M. sexta S10b ATPase in the fractions was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western analysis results shown in the inset are from 2-min exposures of the transfers.

The nature of these complexes was further investigated by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12. Western analysis of the fractions after gel filtration shows that both the S10b and S6′ ATPases elute as if present in complexes of ∼220 kDa (Fig.3, A, B, and D). The relatively weak immunoreactivity of S6′ is probably due to the fact that the affinity-purified anti-S6′ antibody was raised against the human S6′ protein. The S6 ATPase is not enriched in complexes of this size, with the antigen detected in this region probably representing the trailing edge of proteasomal antigen spread by diffusion during chromatography (Fig. 3, E and F). The 220-kDa complex is found in muscles at the beginning (stage 0) and toward the end (stage 7) of the period of preparation for muscle cell death. The volumes of the stage 7 fractions analyzed by Western blotting were five times less than those of stage 0 since the total ATPase content of ISM increases ∼5-fold during pupal development. The similar intensities of the S10b bands in the 220-kDa complex from stages 0 and 7 (Figs. 2 and 3) therefore demonstrate that, like the proteasomal ATPases (8Dawson S.P. Arnold J.E. Mayer N.J. Reynolds S.E. Billett M.A. Gordon C. Colleaux L. Kloetzel P.M. Tanaka K. Mayer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1850-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the concentration of the complexes containing the S10b ATPase increases ∼5-fold in the muscle cells during preparation for cell death. The amounts of the ATPases in the 220-kDa complex do not change when soluble extracts are prepared from muscles in the absence of ATP, indicating that the complex containing the S10b ATPase is unlikely to be produced by dissociation of 26 S proteasomes on homogenization (data not shown). The fact that the S6 ATPase is not in the 220-kDa complex (Fig. 3, E and F) also supports the notion that the complex is not produced by dissociation of ATPases from the 26 S proteasome. A careful analysis of the relative amounts of the S10b ATPase in the 26 S proteasome compared with the 220-kDa activator indicates there is ∼3–5% of the S10b ATPase in the activator relative to the 26 S proteasome (data not shown). Glycerol gradient fractions containing the 220-kDa complex from stage 7 (fractions 1–8) were incubated with similarly prepared 26 S proteasomes to investigate whether the 220-kDa complex was able to directly influence the peptidase activity of the proteasome (Fig. 4). Fractions enriched in the 220-kDa complex (fractions 3–6) cause considerable activation of the chymotrypsin activity of the 26 S proteasome in a concentration-dependent manner. The Manduca activator was further characterized to determine whether it is related to the modulator complex isolated from human erythrocytes, which stimulates assembly of 26 S proteasomes from 20 S cores and 19 S regulators (17DeMartino G.N.

In Experiment C, 20 S proteasomes were incubated in the absence of ATP with an ∼3- or 6-fold molar excess of purified human placental 11 S (PA28) activator. Proteasomal activities were in the range of 40–190 units/assay. In one experiment, apyrase was included in the incubation. Activation represents the chymotrypsin activity measured with activator plus proteasomes (20 S or 26 S) minus the sum of activity measured when activator and proteasomes were assayed separately, expressed as a % of the proteasomal activity.

The capacity of the Manduca activator complex to increase the chymotrypsin-like activity of fractions enriched in the 26 S proteasome varied between different preparations, from >10-fold (Fig.4) to ∼2-fold (Table I). This presumably reflects variation both in the activator complex itself and in the capacity of the 26 S proteasome to respond in different experiments. Activation capacity does not appear to depend on the proportions of 20 S and singly or doubly capped 26 S proteasomes in the preparation since the glycerol gradient fractions showing peak peptidase activity were activated by the 220-kDa complex to a greater extent than leading or trailing edges of the proteasome peak (Table I, Experiment B).

However, it has also been reported to activate ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the absence of nucleotides. KATP channels comprise Kir6.2 and sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1 in pancreatic beta cells, SUR2A in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and SUR2B in smooth muscle). We explored the effect of vanadate (2 mm), in the absence and presence of magnesium nucleotides, on different types of cloned KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Currents were recorded from inside-out patches. Vanadate inhibited Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by ∼50% but rapidly activated Kir6.2/SUR2A (∼4-fold) and Kir6.2/SUR2B (∼2-fold) currents. Mutations in SUR that abolish channel activation by magnesium nucleotides did not prevent the effects of vanadate. Studies with chimeric SUR indicate that the first six transmembrane domains account for the difference in both the kinetics and the vanadate response of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A. Boiling the vanadate solution, which removes the decavanadate polymers, largely abolished both stimulatory and inhibitory actions of vanadate. Our results demonstrate that decavanadate modulates KATP channel activity via the SUR subunit, that this modulation varies with the type of SUR, that it differs from that produced by magnesium nucleotides, and that it involves transmembrane domains 1–6 of SUR.

The sulfonylurea receptor subunit belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and two large cytosolic loops that contain consensus sequences for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (4Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar,13Higgins C.F. Annu.

Like the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) of other ABC transporters, those of the sulfonylurea receptor each possess a Walker A and a Walker B motif. Adenine nucleotides exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on KATP channel activity that are mediated by separate subunits. Thus, interaction of ATP with Kir6.2 causes the channel to close, whereas interaction of MgADP or MgATP with the NBDs of SUR enhances KATP channel activity (14Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M.

A number of studies have directly demonstrated ATP binding and hydrolysis by the nucleotide-binding domains of several members of the ABC transporter family, including P-glycoprotein (MDR; Ref. 18Urbatsch I.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vanadate is routinely used as a tool to trap magnesium nucleotides in the catalytic site of ATPases. ADP is trapped by vanadate both as a result of ATP hydrolysis and also when it is added directly to the solution (22Okamoto Y. Sekine T. Grammer J. Yount R.G. Nature. 1986; 324: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is likely to be because orthovanadate acts as an analogue of phosphate. Among eukaryotic ABC transporters, vanadate trapping has been demonstrated for both MDR (18Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and MRP (19Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 377: 285-289Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling experiments with 8-azido-[32P]ATP have revealed that ATP binds with high affinity to NBD1 of SUR1 and that MgADP binds to NBD2 (23Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Unlike other ABC transporters, however, nucleotide binding to SUR1 is not enhanced by vanadate (23Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The effects of vanadate on KATP channel currents are variable. It has been reported to enhance the activity of KATP channels in skeletal muscle (24Neumcke B. Weik R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in ventricular myocytes (25Nakashima H. Kakei M. Tanaka H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 233: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but it had no effect on the cloned KATPchannel Kir6.2/SUR1 in the presence of magnesium nucleotides (16Shyng, S. L., Ferrigni, T., and Nichols, C. G. (1997)110, 643–654Google Scholar). One explanation for these disparate findings is that different types of KATP channel exhibit different sensitivities to vanadate. Another reason may be that vanadate interacts with a third protein, not present in the heterologous expression system, to modulate KATP channel activity. A third possibility is that, because vanadate exists in solution in a number of different polymeric forms (e.g. orthovanadate and decavanadate), the concentration of the different vanadate complexes might vary in the experimental solutions used by different investigators. In this paper, we examine the effects of orthovanadate and decavanadate on the activity of cloned KATP channels containing different types of SUR subunit, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We show that the major effects of vanadate on KATP channel activity are mediated via the sulfonylurea receptor subunit, with different SURs producing different modulatory effects. We further demonstrate that the interaction of vanadate with SUR is not mediated via the nucleotide-binding domains and that the first six transmembrane domains are required for activation of SUR2 by vanadate. This region also determines the different kinetics of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2 channels. Mouse Kir6.2 (GenBankTMaccession number D50581, Refs. 5Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J.

In SUR1, this corresponds to K719A and K1385M and in SUR2A to K707A and K1348A. A single lysine mutation in NBD1 of SUR2B was also introduced (SUR2B-KA). SUR chimeras containing different segments of SUR1 were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. The chimeras were composed of the following segments, where the numbers refer to the sequences of SUR1 (GenBankTM accession number L40624) or SUR2A (GenBankTM accession number D83598) as appropriate: SUR21-u, (1–416, SUR2A)-(424–700, SUR1)-(689–1545, SUR2A); SUR21 -v (1–1248, SUR2A)-(1285–1581, SUR1); SUR21-w (1–307, SUR1)-(308–1545, SUR2A); SUR21 -x (1–1013, SUR2A)-(1035–1277, SUR1)-(1242–1545, SUR2A).

Female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized with MS222 (2 g/liter added to the water). One ovary was removed via a minilaparotomy, the incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. Once the wound had completely healed, the second ovary was removed in a similar operation, and the animal was then killed by decapitation while under anesthesia. Immature stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 0.1 mg/ml collagenase (type V, Sigma) and then manually defolliculated. In most experiments, oocytes were injected with ∼2 ng of mRNA encoding SUR (either the wild-type or mutant form of SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) and ∼0.04 ng of Kir6.2 mRNA. In some experiments, oocytes were injected with 2 ng of mRNA encoding Kir6.2ΔC36. The final injection volume was ∼50 nl/oocyte. Isolated oocytes were maintained in Barth's solution, and currents were studied 1–4 days after injection (26Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled glass and had resistances of 250–500 kilo-ohms when filled with pipette solution. Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant inside-out patches using an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List Electronik, Darmstadt, Germany) at 20–24 °C (26Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The holding potential was 0 mV, and currents were evoked by repetitive 3-s voltage ramps from −110 to +100 mV. Currents were filtered at 0.2 kHz, digitized at 0.5 kHz using a Digidata 1200 Interface, and analyzed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The data were also stored on video tape (filter = 10 kHz), and records for display in the figures were resampled at 20 Hz. Single-channel currents were recorded at −60 mV, filtered at 5kHz, and sampled at 20 kHz. The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.6; and HEPES, 10 (pH 7.4 with KOH). The internal (bath) solution contained (in mm): KCl, 135; MgCl2, 5; KOH, 5; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10 (pH 7.2 with KOH); and nucleotides as indicated. Sodium vanadate (Na3VO4, Sigma) was added to the solution at a concentration of 2 mm, and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. At concentrations higher than ∼100 μm, vanadate exists in solution in a number of polymeric forms (27Kotowski, A. (ed) (1967) Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, Vanadium, Part B, Division 1, System Number 48, 8th Ed., pp. 132-157, Verlag ChemieGoogle Scholar). At room temperature and pH 7.2, the vanadate monomer (orthovanadate) coexists in equilibrium with small amounts of divanadate and tetravanadate (28Lobert S. Isern N. Hennington B.S. Correia J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6244-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A small amount of decavanadate is also generated immediately after pH readjustment, and its presence is indicated by the characteristic yellow color of the solution (27Kotowski, A. (ed) (1967) Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, Vanadium, Part B, Division 1, System Number 48, 8th Ed., pp. 132-157, Verlag ChemieGoogle Scholar). Because decavanadate is not stable at pH 7.2 and slowly decomposes with time (27Kotowski, A. (ed) (1967) Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, Vanadium, Part B, Division 1, System Number 48, 8th Ed., pp. 132-157, Verlag ChemieGoogle Scholar), solutions were made up just before starting the experiment and were only used for 1–2 h. To prevent chelation of vanadate species by EGTA, we used a low concentration of the chelator (1 mm) and increased the Mg2+ concentration to 5 mm. Boiling the vanadate solution for ∼30 min permanently removes decavanadate, which can be visualized by a change of color from yellow (decavanadate) to colorless (27Kotowski, A. (ed) (1967) Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, Vanadium, Part B, Division 1, System Number 48, 8th Ed., pp. 132-157, Verlag ChemieGoogle Scholar). Boiled solutions contain mostly orthovanadate, although bivanadate and tetravanadate may also be present (28Lobert S. Isern N. Hennington B.S. Correia J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6244-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this paper, we refer to the unboiled solution as “vanadate solution” and the boiled solution as “decavanadate-free vanadate solution.” Solutions containing vanadate were made up fresh each day, and the pH was readjusted after addition of Na3VO4 with HCl. For decavanadate-free solutions, ADP was added after boiling. Rapid exchange of solutions was achieved using a rapid solution changer (RSC-2000, Biologic, Claix, France). The slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the current-voltage relation between −100 mV and −20 mV; the average of five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution. Currents were corrected by subtraction of the background current measured in water-injected oocytes (∼5 pA at −100 mV). Conductance was expressed as a fraction of the mean of that obtained in control solution before and after ATP application. All data are given as mean ± S.E. The symbols in the figures indicate the mean, and the vertical bars represent one S.E. (where this is larger than the symbol). Statistical significance was tested by Student's t test. The concentration dependence of the activatory and inhibitory effects of vanadate on channel activity were fitted according to Equations 1 and2,G/G0=(1+Gmax∗([V]/EC50)h)/(1+([V]/EC50)h)Equation 1 G/G0=L+(1−L)/(1+([V]/EC50)h)Equation 2 where G and Go are the macroscopic conductances in the presence and absence of decavanadate, respectively, [V] is the total vanadate concentration, EC50 is the concentration of vanadate at which the effect is half-maximal, h is the Hill coefficient, Gmax is the maximal fractional activation of vanadate, and L is the fraction of remaining current unblocked by vanadate. For analysis of the inhibitory effect of decavanadate, all values were corrected for the small inhibitory effect of the decavanadate-free solution on Kir6.2/SUR1 currents (4%; see Table I).Table IEffect of vanadate species on KATP currentsVanadatenDecavanadate-free vanadatenKir6.2/SUR145 ± 91895.9 ± 1.211Kir6.2/SUR2A454 ± 127793.4 ± 2.67Kir6.2/SUR2B174 ± 24894.5 ± 1.98Kir6.2ΔC3694 ± 31293.4 ± 2.46SUR1–KA/KM46 ± 81197.2 ± 2.97SUR2A–KA/KA227 ± 35693.4 ± 2.95SUR2B–KA173 ± 41692.0 ± 2.55Macroscopic conductance measured in the presence of sodium vanadate.

Open table in a new tab Macroscopic conductance measured in the presence of sodium vanadate. The conductance recorded in the presence of vanadate is expressed as a percentage of its value in control solution (vanadate-free). Fig.1, A and B, shows that intracellular application of 2 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4) produced a marked stimulation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents and a somewhat smaller increase in Kir6.2/SUR2B currents; the mean increase in the conductance was 454 ± 127% (n = 7) for Kir6.2/SUR2A and 174 ± 24% (n = 8) for Kir6.2/SUR2B (TableI). In contrast, vanadate blocked Kir6.2/SUR1 currents (Fig. 1 C). The extent of this block varied between oocyte preparations, with a mean inhibition of 55 ± 9% (n = 18). The block was slow and only partially reversible. In some experiments (Fig. 1 C, bottom), removal of vanadate caused an initial decrease and then an increase in current, suggesting that the ion might exert more than one effect on Kir6.2/SUR1. When Kir6.2ΔC36 was expressed in the absence of SUR1, vanadate produced only a very small (∼5%) inhibition of the current (Fig.1 D and Table I). This result indicates that the SUR subunit, rather than Kir6.2, is primarily responsible for the effects of vanadate on the wild-type KATP channel, a view that is supported by the disparate actions of vanadate on KATPchannels containing different types of SUR subunit. We next explored whether the effects of vanadate were mediated by the decavanadate species. To address this question, we boiled the vanadate solution to remove decavanadate. As shown in Table I, the decavanadate-free vanadate solution was without marked effect on the amplitude of Kir6.2ΔC36, Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, or Kir6.2/SUR2B currents. The mean conductance, expressed as a percentage of its value in control solution, was 93%, 96%, 93%, and 95% for Kir6.2ΔC36, Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B currents, respectively (Table I). These results indicate that the effects of vanadate solutions on channels containing SUR subunits are not mediated by the orthovanadate complex but rather by the decavanadate form. The small decrease in current observed for all types of KATP channel is similar to that observed for the effect of vanadate solution on Kir6.2ΔC36 currents and argues that this effect is mediated via interaction with the Kir6.2 subunit and by vanadate species other than decavanadate. To compare the sensitivity of cloned and native KATP channels, we measured the concentration-response curves for the effects of vanadate on Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR1 currents (Fig.2). The EC50 for vanadate activation of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents was 0.59 ± 0.03 mm, with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 ± 0.2 and maximum activation of 3.25 ± 0.06 (n = 5). The EC50 was slightly lower than the value (1.5 mm) reported by Neumcke and Weik (24Neumcke B. Weik R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for native cardiac KATPchannels but similar to that obtained by Nakashima et al. (25Nakashima H. Kakei M. Tanaka H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 233: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in the presence of 300 μm ATP (0.5 mm). The inhibitory effect of vanadate on Kir6.2/SUR1 had an EC50 of 0.28 ± 0.02 mm and a Hill coefficient of 2.9 ± 0.5 (n = 5). Approximately 30% of the current was unaffected by vanadate. That the Hill coefficients for both activation and inhibition of KATPcurrents were larger than one suggests that the cooperative action of more than one vanadate molecule is involved in these effects. The fact that vanadate was without effect at a concentration of 0.1 mm supports the idea that the effects are mediated by vanadate polymers, which are only generated in solutions containing >0.1 mm vanadate (27Kotowski, A. (ed) (1967) Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, Vanadium, Part B, Division 1, System Number 48, 8th Ed., pp. 132-157, Verlag ChemieGoogle Scholar). Vanadate-trapping effects are generally assigned to the orthovanadate species (30Chasteen N.D. Struct. Bonding. 1983; 53: 105-138Crossref Google Scholar, 31Hrycyna C.A. Ramchandra M. Ambudkar S.V.

Magnesium nucleotides enhance KATP channel activity, with the most dramatic effects being caused by MgADP. Therefore, we examined the effect of decavanadate-free solution on the ability of MgADP to enhance the activity of the KATP channel. If orthovanadate causes nucleotide trapping, we would expect it to influence the stimulatory effect of MgADP. In control solution, 3 μm and 100 μm MgADP increased Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by ∼28 and ∼700%, respectively (Fig. 3 and TableII). There was no change in the effect of MgADP when the nucleotide was applied in the presence of decavanadate-free vanadate solution. Shyng et al. (16Shyng, S. L., Ferrigni, T., and Nichols, C. G. (1997)110, 643–654Google Scholar) have also reported that vanadate has no effect on the potentiatory action of MgADP on Kir6.2/SUR1 currents.Table IIEffect of decavanadate-free solution on the response to MgADPControlDecavanadate-free3 μmMgADP128 ± 4122 ± 2100 μm MgADP786 ± 229728 ± 315Macroscopic conductance in the presence of MgADP is expressed as a percentage of its value in control (nucleotide-free) solution.

The number of patches was six in all cases. Our results indicate that the effects of decavanadate are mediated by the sulfonylurea receptor and not by the Kir6.2 subunit. The stimulatory effects of MgADP and of potassium-channel openers such as diazoxide are impaired by mutations in the NBDs of SUR (14Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 15Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J.

To determine whether this is also the case for decavanadate, we examined the effects of mutations that are known to disrupt the activation of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by both MgADP and diazoxide (14Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 16Shyng, S. L., Ferrigni, T., and Nichols, C. G. (1997)110, 643–654Google Scholar); thus we changed one or both lysines in the Walker motifs of NBD1 and NBD2 to alanine or methionine. The effect of vanadate solution on KATPchannels containing SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B carrying these mutations was unchanged, indicating that the mechanism of vanadate activation is distinct from that of MgADP (Table I). To identify regions of SUR2 involved in the activation of the KATP channel by decavanadate we constructed a range of chimeras between SUR1 and SUR2A, based on the sequence of SUR2A, and coexpressed these chimeric SURs with Kir6.2. The results are summarized in Fig.4. SUR2A containing the second nucleotide-binding domain of SUR1 (chimera SUR21 -u) or possessing transmembrane domains (TMs) 8–11 of SUR1 (chimera SUR21 -v) behaved like SUR2A. There was also no effect of transferring TMs 12–17 (chimera SUR21 -x), which contains the tolbutamide binding site (32Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When the first six TMs of SUR2A were replaced with those of SUR1 (SUR21-w), however, the current was not activated but was instead inhibited by vanadate solution in a manner similar to Kir6.2/SUR1 (see Fig. 6 B). This suggests that the first six TMs of SUR are responsible for the different decavanadate sensitivities of SUR1 and SUR2A. As previously reported (33Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), exchange of this region also influenced the gating properties of the KATP channel. Like Kir6.2/SUR1, channels comprising Kir62./SUR21-w exhibited shorter bursts and shorter long closed states than Kir6.2/SUR2A (Fig.5). The data presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that decavanadate interacts with the sulfonylurea receptor subunit of the KATP channel and that the effect of this interaction varies with the type of SUR subunit, being largely inhibitory for channels containing SUR1 and stimulatory for channels containing SUR2A or SUR2B. Thus, decavanadate can be used as a tool to determine which type of SUR subunits are present in KATP channels from various tissues. The different effects reported previously for vanadate action on native KATP channels in skeletal muscle (24Neumcke B. Weik R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and on cloned Kir6.2/SUR1 channels (16Shyng, S. L., Ferrigni, T., and Nichols, C. G. (1997)110, 643–654Google Scholar) therefore result from differences in the SUR subunit of these channels (skeletal muscle is believed to contain SUR2A; see Ref. 6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) rather than from differences in native and cloned channels per se. The fact that Shyng et al. (16Shyng, S. L., Ferrigni, T., and Nichols, C. G. (1997)110, 643–654Google Scholar) observed results similar to those we report when Kir6.2/SUR1 was expressed in mammalian cells further demonstrates that the action of vanadate is not influenced by the choice of expression system. Our results suggest that the effects of vanadate are mediated by the decavanadate polymer and that orthovanadate is without marked effect either in the absence or presence of magnesium nucleotides, because the effects of vanadate on both SUR1 and SUR2A are abolished by boiling the solution, which destroys the decavanadate form. Furthermore, vanadate was without a substantial effect at a concentration of 0.1 mm, where vanadate polymers are virtually absent. This is in agreement with experiments demonstrating that orthovanadate does not influence MgATP binding to the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (23Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this respect, SUR1 differs from other members of the ABC transporter family, such as MDR and P-glycoprotein, where nucleotide trapping by orthovanadate has been demonstrated in binding studies (18Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 19Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16631-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Two pieces of evidence demonstrate that decavanadate interacts with the SUR, rather than the Kir6.2, subunit of the KATP channel. First, decavanadate is largely ineffective when Kir6.2ΔC36 is expressed in the absence of SUR. Second, the effect of vanadate is influenced by the type of SUR subunit that the KATP channel contains. In contrast to SUR2A, SUR1 is inhibited by decavanadate. It is possible that decavanadate also exerts an inhibitory effect on SUR2A but that this is masked by the presence of an additional stimulatory action. The fact that decavanadate blocks a chimera consisting of SUR2A with the first six TMs of SUR1 might be consistent with this view. Conversely, the variable extent of inhibition of SUR1 produced by vanadate might suggest that the ion also exerts a small stimulatory effect on SUR1. Previous studies have suggested that decavanadate activates cardiac KATP channels in a way similar to MgADP (25Nakashima H. Kakei M. Tanaka H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 233: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In particular, both compounds enhance the channel activity without affecting the single-channel conductance, both are able to reactivate rundown channels, and both require Mg2+ for their action. Our results indicate, however, that the mechanism of action of vanadate and MgADP is not identical, because decavanadate is able to stimulate Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels when MgADP activation has been abolished by mutation of the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR. Instead, our studies suggest that the first six transmembrane domains and/or the cytosolic loop between TMs 5 and 6 play a critical role in channel activation either because this region contains the binding site for decavanadate or because it is involved in transducing binding into channel activation. It is noteworthy that the first six TM of SUR are involved not only in the action of vanadate but also mediate the effect of SUR on channel gating. Thus this region may be important for transduction of vanadate binding to SUR into changes in channel gating."

Cadherin is involved in the intercellular interactions at cell junctions through Ca2+-dependent homophilic associations (13Kemler R. Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Curr. Opin.

In both of these cases tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins have been localized to these membrane-microfilament interaction sites. In other cases, glycoprotein multimers provide the docking sites for cytoskeletal or membrane skeletal proteins. For example, in the neuromuscular junction a major membrane-microfilament interaction site is the acetylcholine receptor, a multimeric integral membrane protein complex that forms a ligand-activated ion channel (20Pumplin D.W. Bloch R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 113-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Froehner S.C. Annu. Rev.

The multimeric dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in muscle cells (24Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) provides a site for interaction with microfilaments (25Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex containing four integral mem- brane glycoproteins is also linked to the ion channel to form more complex structures in neuromuscular junctions (26Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This complex is associated with a peripheral membrane glycoprotein α-dystroglycan (27Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which in the neuromuscular junction is a receptor for agrin, an extracellular matrix protein that promotes clustering of the acetylcholine receptor (28-30). Multisubunit receptors of the immune system, including the T cell antigen receptor, the B cell antigen receptor, and the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E, form associations with the cytoskeletal matrix upon cell activation (reviewed in Ref. 31Caplan S. Baniyash M. Immunol. Res. 1995; 14: 98-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In each of these examples, microfilaments are attached to a transmembrane complex containing multiple integral membrane protein subunits. In microvilli (32Carraway K.L. Huggins J.W. Cerra R.F.

The TMC is a major membrane-microfilament interaction site in the abundant microvilli of the ascites cells (34Carraway C.A.C. Jung G. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The core of the complex is a large transmembrane glycoprotein complex (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1208-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the cytoplasmic protein was not required for the binding of the glycoproteins to actin, we postulated that the glycoprotein-actin interaction is direct (34Carraway C.A.C. Jung G. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Complete cDNA sequencing of p58 characterized it as a truncated retroviral Gag-like protein lacking the nucleic acid-binding domain (39Juang S.-H. Huang J. Li Y. Salas P. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C.

The TMC glycoprotein complex, which comprises the core or scaffolding of the membrane-microfilament interaction site in the ascites microvilli, contains at least five major membrane glycoproteins, with molecular masses of 120, 110, 80, 65, and 55 kDa (35Carraway C.A.C.

Additionally, it contains the (proto)oncogene receptor p185neu/ErbB2 (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been implicated in both mitogenesis and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 43Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) in epithelial cells and is overexpressed in many human breast cancers (44Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A.

The presence of the receptor kinase as well as the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases p60c-src and c-Abl (45Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar) in stable association with microvillar microfilaments via interaction with the TMC suggested that this large complex serves as a microfilament-linked, plasma membrane signal transduction particle (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TMC glycoproteins have been purified by gel filtration as a high Mr glycoprotein complex from detergent lysates of either microvillar membranes or microfilaments extracted under high pH, high salt conditions (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16238-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we report a new isolation method for the TMC-gps in which the glycoproteins of the complex are separated by ConA affinity chromatography after complete dissociation under denaturing conditions from p60src, c-Abl (45Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar), and other cytoplasmic membrane skeletal and signaling proteins (57Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the p185neu-containing glycoprotein complex can be reconstituted and use this preparation for reconstitution studies to analyze specific interactions of the TMC-gps with the other major components of the TMC, actin and p58gag. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the TMC-gps are the core of a stable organization site for microfilaments at the membrane in the microvilli (34Carraway C.A.C. Jung G. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As such, the glycoprotein complex can be viewed as another class of scaffolding protein (46Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1998; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar) involved in the organization of signaling proteins. Further, the following paper (57Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) describes the association of the components of the Ras to mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogenic pathway with this p185neu-containing TMC, supporting our suggestion that this major membrane-microfilament interaction site is a signal transduction particle (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the constitutively activated 13762 ascites mammary tumor cells (45Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). MAT-C1 subline cells of the 13762 ascites rat mammary adenocarcinoma were grown by intraperitoneal injection of 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells in 0.1–0.3 ml of 0.9% NaCl into 60–90-day-old female Fischer 344 rats (36Carraway K.L. Doss R.C. Huggins J.W. Chesnut R.W. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were collected from the peritoneal cavity after 7 days, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in PBS. Microvilli were isolated by gently shearing the cells through a 14-gauge needle, and the cell bodies were removed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min (32Carraway K.L. Huggins J.W. Cerra R.F.

Acta. 1982; 719: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The microvilli in the supernatant were obtained by differential centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and washed twice with PBS (47Carraway C.A.C. Cerra R.F. Bell P.B. Carraway K.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Microfilament cores were prepared by extraction of microvilli in a microfilament-stabilizing buffer (TPK buffer; 0.2% Triton, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mmPIPES, pH 6.8) for 15 min and centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min (48Carraway C.A.C. Jung G. Hinkley R.E. Carraway K.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 157: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reconstituted TMC (rTMC) was prepared from microfilament cores as described previously (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16238-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Liu Y. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1208-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microfilament cores were solubilized in high salt (1 m KCl) buffer at 4 °C for 2.5 h to depolymerize actin and release actin-associated proteins. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed against isotonic (100 mm KCl) buffer overnight at 4 °C. The resulting reassociated TMC complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to yield a sedimentable complex containing predominantly actin, p58gag, and the TMC glycoproteins. Antisera were prepared using two different sources of TMC glycoprotein. The first was the early TMC-gp complex peak from Sephacryl S-1000 gel filtration (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was solubilized in SDS, lyophilized, and reconstituted in Freund's complete adjuvant prior to injection into rabbits. The animals were boosted four times at 2–3-week intervals with 150–200 μg of protein prior to screening against TMC-gp-enriched microvillar fractions. In the second method, ConA affinity-purified TMC-gps from the glycoprotein-enriched rTMC were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained briefly with Coomassie Blue, and the bands were excised and eluted from the gel, mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected into mice. After four or five boosts at 2–3-week intervals, immunoblotting on microvilli and microvillar fractions was performed with the resulting mouse polyclonal antiserum to determine the titer and specificity of the antibody. For production of mouse polyclonal antisera to TMC-gp55 the ConA-agarose-purified TMC-gps were separated on SDS-PAGE, and TMC-gp55 was excised from the gel. The TMC-gp55 gel band (10–40 μg) was homogenized in 0.9% NaCl and injected into the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice, and booster injections were made at 2-week intervals. After the fifth boost (total of ∼150 μg of TMC-gp55 injected), the mice were bled, and anti-TMC-gp55 antibody was detected by screening against the ConA-Sepharose-purified TMC-gps. For screening by immunoblot, cells and cell fractions were solubilized in electrophoresis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. For tissue screening, rat tissues were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to homogenization in buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenates were solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting, as described previously (42Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Vanderpuye O. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Microfilament core or reconstituted TMC was solubilized in 2% SDS, boiled for 5 min, diluted to 0.05% SDS, and incubated with ConA-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose suspension was packed into a column and washed with 20 bed volumes of 0.05% SDS in 20 mm TES, pH 7.8. The glycoproteins were eluted from the column with 1 ml of the same buffer containing 0.3 m α-methylmannoside. For reconstitution of the complex, PBS containing Triton X-100 was added to give a final Triton concentration 5 times the concentration of SDS. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the TMC-gp complex (about 80 μg of protein) was analyzed by Sephadex G-500 gel filtration in PBS or by immunoprecipitation with anti-p185neu. For analysis by gel filtration, the ascites cells were initially metabolically labeled with [14C]glucosamine as described previously for the detection of glycosylated proteins (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16238-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound fraction from the ConA column containing TMC-gp's from either microfilament core or rTMC was incubated in PBS with or without Triton-100 and loaded onto a Sephadex G-500 column (1.0 × 95 cm) equilibrated with 0.05% Triton in PBS. Fractions were eluted with the same buffer. Aliquots of column fractions were assayed for the glycoproteins by scintillation counting for radioactivity. The14C-containing fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for analysis by ConA blotting (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J.

IRL Press, Oxford1992: 123-150Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with anti-p185neu, aliquots of reconstituted or unreconstituted TMC-gp complex from ConA-Sepharose were mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads and either 1 μg of anti-p185neu (Ab 3, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) or 1.5–3 μg of normal mouse serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with PBS and eluted from the beads with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-p185neu, anti-gp55, and ConA blots. Reconstituted TMC in SDS was biotinylated by treatment with 0.1 mm N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotin (water-soluble biotin; Pierce) for 2 h before loading onto the ConA affinity column. The separated flow-through and bound fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% skim milk. The membranes were incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase, and stained bands were detected using the RenaissanceTM chemiluminescence assay kit (NEN Life Science Products). Actin was purified from rabbit muscle by the method of Pardee and Spudich (52Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biotinylated actin was prepared by the method of Okabe and Hirokawa (53Okabe S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1581-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Actin (25 mg) polymerized in 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 10 min was incubated with 8 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotin (at a concentration of 100 mg/ml in Me2SO) for 10 min. The labeling reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 mg of sodium glutamate, and the biotinylated F-actin was isolated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and depolymerized in 2 ml of 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol. After two cycles of polymerization-depolymerization, the biotinylated actin pellet was resuspended in 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm ATP and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The G-actin was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 min, frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. TMC-gp and flow-through fractions from the ConA affinity fractionation of microfilament cores were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking in denaturation buffer containing 7 mguanidine-HCl, 50 mm TES (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h and in renaturation buffer (50 mm TES, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 30 mm TES, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with biotinylated actin in actin polymerization buffer (plus 0.02% Triton) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes in 30 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and two washes in 30 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 120 mmNaCl, the blot was incubated with avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 2 h and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. In vitro translation of p58gag was performed as described previously (39Juang S.-H. Huang J. Li Y. Salas P. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15067-15075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA template of p58gag (2 μg/50-μl reaction) was mixed with 25 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 40 units of RNasin inhibitor, 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), amino acid mixture minus methionine, and T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and the product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Reconstituted TMC-gp, obtained by Triton treatment of the eluted fraction from the ConA affinity column, was incubated with the in vitro-translated p58gag in PBS containing 0.05% Triton at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant of the mixture was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads and either 1.5–2 μg of anti-gp55 antibody or 1.5–3 μg of normal mouse serum at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed with PBS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As a first approach toward understanding the structure and interactions of proteins in the large, microfilament-associated transmembrane complex, we initiated studies to dissociate and reconstitute the signal transduction particle components. This approach was complicated by the major difficulty that the stability of the complex resulted in the co-purification of cytoplasmic proteins, including c-Src and c-Abl (45Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar) and sometimes actin and associated proteins (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16238-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to purify the glycoproteins under various conditions short of denaturing conditions were unsuccessful. To assure the removal of actin and other tightly associated components, the starting material (microfilament cores or other TMC-enriched fraction) was first solubilized in SDS. Since the TMC-gps are ConA-binding proteins (35Carraway C.A.C. Hua F. Ye X. Juang S.-H. Liu Y. Carvajal M. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16238-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ConA affinity chromatography was then used in a one-step purification method, which greatly improved the yield.

Here we show that the mtHSP70 subunit confers broader sequence specificity, greater stability, and higher activity on the 50-kDa subunit. The 50-kDa subunit alone displayed weaker activity and highly sequence-specific endonuclease activity. The 50-kDa protein exists as a heterodimer with mtHSP70 in vivo, allowing Endo.SceI to cleave specifically at multiple sites on mitochondrial DNA. Endo.SceI may have evolved from a highly specific endonuclease that gained broader sequence specificity after becoming a stable partner of mtHSP70.

The 50-kDa subunit alone displayed weaker activity and highly sequence-specific endonuclease activity. The 50-kDa protein exists as a heterodimer with mtHSP70 in vivo, allowing Endo.SceI to cleave specifically at multiple sites on mitochondrial DNA. Endo.SceI may have evolved from a highly specific endonuclease that gained broader sequence specificity after becoming a stable partner of mtHSP70. mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock protein 70-kDa heat shock protein reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin glutathione S-transferase base pair kilobase pair Endo.SceI is a yeast mitochondrial endonuclease having multisequence specificity (1Watabe H.

The 50-kDa subunit shares the consensus amino acid sequence LAGLIDADG (5Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol.

The Endo.SceI endonuclease is unique among these endonucleases in that it tolerates degeneracy at several positions within the cleavage sequence (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its broad sequence specificity, Endo.SceI cleaves randomly at over 30 sites on yeast mitochondrial DNA both in vitro and in vivo (Ref. 11Shibata T. Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Adv. Biophys. 1995; 31: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and data shown below). The function of Endo.SceI is important during the process of mitochondrial fusion when haploid cells are mated to form zygotic cells. During this process, Endo.SceI cleaves mitochondrial DNA to induce genetic recombination among the heterogeneous mitochondrial DNAs inherited from the parents (12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The 50-kDa protein is not the sole binding partner of mtHSP70. mtHSP70 is a member of the HSP70 family and has broad affinity for proteins in the unfolded state. Molecular genetics and biochemical analysis have revealed that mtHSP70 transiently binds to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins which become unfolded during their transfer from the cytosol across the mitochondrial membrane. mtHSP70 is essential for the import of these proteins into mitochondria and their subsequent folding (13Scherer P.E. Krieg U.C. Hwang S.T. Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Shilling J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). More than 10 homologs of HSP70 have been detected or cloned from the genome sequence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The HSP70 family functions in a diverse set of processes, including regulation of the heat shock response, quality control of proteins and protein folding, as well as protein translocation across organellar membranes (20Morimoto R.I.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar).The 50-kDa protein is unique among the binding partners of HSP70 in that mtHSP70 does not chaperone the 50-kDa protein as a transient partner but becomes stably incorporated as part of the heterodimer complex. The diverse functions of HSP70 described above are accomplished through transient binding of HSP70 to proteins in an unfolded state. HSP70 prevents the unfolded proteins from aggregating and misfolding, until the proteins are either properly folded, transferred into organelles, or degraded by proteases (21Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of mtHSP70 and the sequence motifs found in the 50-kDa subunit led us to speculate that mtHSP70 might somehow modulate the structure and activity of the 50-kDa subunit. It has been difficult, however, to examine if mtHSP70 has a regulatory role for the endonuclease activity because the heterodimer is so stable under nondenaturing conditions that the 50-kDa protein cannot be functionally analyzed in the absence of mtHSP70 (4Nakagawa K. Hashikawa J. Makino O. Ando T. Shibata T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Standard overexpression systems have not been applied to the 50-kDa protein because it is encoded by a mitochondrial gene whose translation requires mitochondrial specific codon usage. To examine the role of mtHSP70 in the heterodimer, we established overexpression and purification systems for the 50-kDa subunit. To our surprise, the purified 50-kDa protein by itself showed endonuclease activity that was not multisequence-specific but unisequence-specific. The Endo.SceI heterodimer was easily reconstructed by incubating the 50-kDa protein with mtHSP70 in the presence of ADP. The 50-kDa protein did not appear to bind to the substrate binding domain of mtHSP70 but to the ATPase domain. By comparing the enzyme activities of the 50-kDa protein with the reconstructed heterodimer, we found that mtHSP70 converts the unisequence-specific 50-kDa endonuclease into a multisequence-specific enzyme. Thus, multisequence specificity, the characteristic feature of Endo.SceI, is dependent on the stable binding of mtHSP70.RESULTSOverexpression of the 50-kDa Subunit in E. coliThe 50-kDa subunit is encoded by a mitochondrial gene whose coding sequence contains 37 mitochondrial specific codons (5Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 50-kDa subunit gene was modified so that the whole amino acid sequence could be directed by universal codons and expressed in widely used overexpression systems. Briefly, 13 cycles of site-directed mutagenesis (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4884) Google Scholar) were performed by using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. Up to 16 primers were used at a time to reduce the number of mutagenesis cycles, unless the primer sequences overlapped with one another. For easier purification of the 50-kDa protein, its N terminus was tagged with a hexahistidine sequence. We overexpressed the hexahistidine-tagged 50-kDa protein in E. coli and purified it by affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography (Fig.1 A). Since DnaK, a bacterial HSP70, is present in E. coli cells, the 50-kDa protein sample was examined for contamination with DnaK. Western blot analysis with an anti-DnaK monoclonal antibody showed that bacterial HSP70 could not be detected in the 50-kDa protein sample (Fig. 1 A). For reconstruction of Endo.SceI in vitro, mtHSP70 was purified from the isolated mitochondria of yeast cells which overexpress mtHSP70 (Fig. 1 A) as reported previously (25Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopolous C. Jeno P. Kronidou N. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We used a yeast strain that lacked the functional gene for the 50-kDa protein to avoid possible contamination of the mtHSP70 sample with the 50-kDa protein (5Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The quaternary structure of the purified 50-kDa protein was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. The purified 50-kDa protein was eluted as a single symmetrical peak between the elution positions of bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) and ovalbumin(43 kDa), suggesting a globular and monomeric structure (Fig. 1 B).The Purified 50-kDa Protein Is a Unisequence-specific EndonucleaseIn general, the function of HSP70 is accomplished through its transient binding to unfolded or denatured proteins (13Scherer P.E. Krieg U.C. Hwang S.T. Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Shilling J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 28Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.E. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 29Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). According to this rationale, mtHSP70 binding to the 50 kDa would occur because the chaperone function of mtHSP70 recognizes unfolded structures in the 50-kDa subunit. However, the gel filtration profile of the 50-kDa protein suggests that it is a globular protein of 50 kDa with a properly folded structure. To analyze further the functional and structural nature of the 50-kDa protein, we measured the circular dichroism spectrum and endonuclease activity of the subunit.The monomeric form of the 50-kDa protein showed a typical spectrum for α-helix containing proteins with two minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig.1 C). The value of the ellipticity suggested that the percentage of α-helix content in the 50-kDa protein was around 38% with no indication of an unusually high percentage of random structures (30Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). This result, together with the gel filtration pattern, suggests that the 50-kDa protein has a native structure and intrinsic endonuclease activity in the absence of the mtHSP70 subunit.Actually we found that the 50-kDa protein alone can cleave a specific sequence within the mitochondrial oli2 gene cloned into pUC119 (Fig. 1 D). This specific site in the oli2 gene has been shown to be cleaved by Endo.SceI in vivo, and cleavage at this site induces efficient gene conversion between heterologous mitochondrial DNAs inherited from parental cells during mating (12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sizes of the cleaved products (3.4 and 1.4 kb) suggest that the cutting site of the 50-kDa protein was identical to that of the Endo.SceI dimer. The 50-kDa protein did not digest the oli2 mutant sequence (12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) containing an altered Endo.SceI cutting site (data not shown). These results, as well as the physical properties of the 50-kDa protein, indicate that the 50-kDa protein possesses a native structure and acts as a functional endonuclease. However, the 50-kDa protein did not exhibit multisequence specificity which is a characteristic feature of the Endo.SceI heterodimer. The 50-kDa protein could not cleave plasmid DNAs, phage DNAs, or yeast mitochondrial DNA except for the oli2 sequence, whereas all of these DNAs have been used to detect Endo.SceI endonuclease activity (see below). For instance, the purified 50-kDa protein did not cleave a cutting site in pBR322 DNA which has been used in the standard assay for Endo.SceI (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nakagawa K. Hashikawa J. Makino O. Ando T. Shibata T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data suggested that mtHSP70 possesses a novel function distinct from its normal role in protein folding.Reconstruction of the Endo.SceI HeterodimerTo investigate the role of mtHSP70 in the Endo.SceI heterodimer, we tried to reconstruct the heterodimer from each subunit in vitro. HSP70 can be found in three states depending on the nature of the bound nucleotide as follows: ATP-bound HSP70, ADP-bound HSP70, and nucleotide-free HSP70. In general, ADP-bound HSP70 makes a more stable complex with unfolded proteins than ATP-bound HSP70. The dissociation constants of ADP-bound HSP70 with substrates are between 5- and 85-fold lower than those of ATP-bound HSP70, although the ADP-bound form has slower binding rates for substrates (for a review, see Ref. 31Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). As an initial trial, the active 50-kDa protein was incubated with ADP-bound mtHSP70 without prior denaturing treatment of the endonuclease. We chose 25 °C as the temperature for the complex formation reaction because the 50-kDa protein loses little activity in terms of its ability to cleave within the oli2 sequence when incubated at this temperature even after several hours (data not shown). After the 50-kDa subunit was incubated with a stoichiometric amount of ADP-mtHSP70, the protein mixture was loaded onto a gel filtration column to analyze complex formation. The 50-kDa subunit was detected in fractions from the column by Western blot analysis and the endonuclease assay. The elution profile suggested that the Endo.SceI heterodimer was efficiently formed in vitro from the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70, as the position of the peak fraction (fraction 68) corresponded to a molecular size of around 125 kDa (Fig.2). It should be noted that dimer formation did not require denaturing treatment of the 50-kDa protein. The endonuclease assay using the oli2 substrate revealed that the Endo.SceI activity could only be observed in the fraction containing the heterodimer. No complexes of the 50-kDa subunit appeared at the elution volume of the heterodimer when the 50-kDa subunit was incubated alone (data not shown). The nucleotide dependence of heterodimer formation, as well as the nature of the binding between the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70, will be described below.Figure 2Heterodimer formation of the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70 in vitro. A mixture of the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70 was incubated at 25 °C for 90 min and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution positions of marker proteins are indicated by arrowheads (aldolase, 158-kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa). The endonuclease activity of the eluted proteins was assayed by using pMITO DNA (upper panel). Eluted fractions were also analyzed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-6xHis monoclonal antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of mtHSP70 Binding on the Endonuclease Activity of the 50-kDa SubunitSubstratesAfter establishing the conditions for complex formation, we quantitatively analyzed the effect of mtHSP70 binding on the activity of the 50-kDa protein. Two DNAs were chosen as substrates in the nuclease assay. The first one contained the mitochondrial oli2 sequence, which is the natural substrate efficiently cleaved by Endo.SceI in vivo (12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the 50-kDa protein in vitro (Fig. 1 D). The other substrate contained the Endo.SceI-cleavable sequence of pBR322 (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cleavage sequence of Endo.SceI is not unique but multiple, we determined the consensus sequence for Endo.SceI cleavage by comparing the cleavable sequences found in phage and plasmid DNAs (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). Unlike bacterial restriction enzymes, Endo.SceI recognizes and binds to at least 26-bp regions of DNA (10Kawasaki K. Takahashi M. Natori M. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5342-5347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavable sequences of oli2 and pBR322 used in the present experiment contained four and six mismatches to the consensus sequence, respectively (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Binding of mtHSP70 to the 50-kDa protein confers greater stability and broader sequence specificity. A, the cleavage sites for the Endo.SceI dimer.Top, the consensus sequence for the Endo.SceI cleavage as previously determined (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol.

Middle, the cleavage site in the mitochondrial oli2 region (12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Bottom, the cleavage site found in pBR322 (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B, stability of the endonuclease activity. The 50-kDa protein (1 μg/ml) with or without ADP-mtHSP70 (1.5 μg/ml) was preincubated at 37 °C for each indicated time in the assay mixture without the substrate, and then the reaction was started by the addition of the oli2 plasmid. Without preincubation, the substrate was partially cleaved (up to about 80%) by the endonuclease. C, enhancement of the endonuclease activity. The 50-kDa protein with or without ADP-mtHSP70 was incubated with the oli2 substrate at 37 °C for 1 min. The amount of the 50-kDa protein used is shown in the figure. For comparison, the activity of the endogenous enzyme (Endo.SceI) is also plotted in the figure. D, the endonuclease activity of the reconstructed Endo.SceI heterodimer. The pBR322 substrate (pBR1) was cleaved by the reconstituted dimer (lanes 1–5). The amounts of 50-kDa protein as heterodimer in the digestion were 0 (lane 1), 0.125 (lane 2), 0.25 (lane 3), 0.50 (lane 4), and 1.0 μg/ml (lane 5). Major cleavage products are indicated by arrowheads on the left side. Cleavage at minor sites within the vector backbone (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also evident after longer incubation. pBR1 was not cleaved by the 50-kDa protein alone (lanes 6–10). The amounts of the monomeric form of the 50-kDa protein were 0 (lane 6), 2 (lane 7), 4 (lane 8), 8 (lane 9), and 16 μg/ml (lane 10). Lane M denotes a Hin dIII digest of phage λ DNA. E, specific interaction of the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70 is required for cleavage of the pBR322 substrate. The pBR322 substrate (pBR1) was incubated with various combinations of proteins. The 50-kDa protein used for the digestion was 1.0 μg/ml. Either mtHSP70 or E. coli DnaK that had been loaded with ADP was incubated with the 50-kDa protein at a 1:1 molar ratio prior to digestion. F, modulation of sequence specificity of the 50-kDa protein by mtHSP70. Mitochondrial DNA was completely digested with Bam HI and Pst I and then treated with the 50-kDa protein, either with or without mtHSP70. The amount of the monomeric 50-kDa protein was 5.3 μg/ml, whereas 1.0 μg/ml of the 50-kDa protein was used for digestion in the presence of mtHSP70. The DNA fragments generated by the cleavage at the oli2 sequence are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thermostability and Specific ActivityWe have observed that Endo.SceI is a heat-sensitive enzyme that loses its activity at 37 °C within 2 h (1Watabe H. Shibata T. Ando T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 2H. Mizumura, T. Shibata, and N. Morishima, unpublished data. Thus, we expected that the 50-kDa protein would be even more heat-labile. Since one of the biological functions of HSP70 is to protect unfolded proteins from aggregation and irreversible inactivation (for a review, see Ref. 21Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar), we examined the thermostability of the 50-kDa protein in the presence or absence of mtHSP70. After preincubation of the 50-kDa protein at 37 °C the endonuclease reaction was done for 1 min to compensate for the possible inactivation of the 50-kDa protein during the reaction (note that the standard assay for Endo.SceI uses 30–60 min for digestion). Fig. 3 B shows that the endonuclease activity of both the 50-kDa monomer and the reconstructed Endo.SceI decreased during the preincubation at 37 °C. However, the 50-kDa protein displayed reduced thermostability in the absence of the other subunit. After 15 min of preincubation, the residual activity of the 50-kDa monomer was less than 40% of the original activity, and it further decreased below 20% after 30 min preincubation. Under the same conditions, the reconstructed dimer was more resistant to inactivation, as its endonuclease activity remained stable with over 80% of the original activity remaining after 30 min of preincubation. These results indicate that the 50-kDa protein is heat-labile and that the mtHSP70 subunit confers thermoresistance on the 50-kDa protein. In a separate experiment, addition of mtHSP70 to the 50-kDa protein inactivated at 37 °C did not restore the endonuclease activity, suggesting that the loss of activity under these conditions is due to irreversible inactivation.We next examined the specific activity of the 50-kDa protein with or without mtHSP70, as we observed that the endonuclease activity of the reconstituted dimer was always higher than that of the 50-kDa monomer. The assay was again done for 1 min because this short assay time contributed little to the time difference in heat inactivation between the monomer and the Endo.SceI dimer as shown by the above results. Fig.3 C shows an approximately 3–4-fold enhancement of endonuclease activity for the reconstructed dimer up to a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The specific activity of the reconstituted dimer is comparable to that of the endogenous Endo.SceI heterodimer within the similar range of protein concentrations (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the binding of mtHSP70 to the 50-kDa protein confers higher specific activity as well as greater thermostability.Sequence SpecificityWith the oli2 DNA, the endonuclease activity of the monomeric 50-kDa subunit was approximately one-third that of the heterodimer (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that we might be able to detect cleavages of other substrate DNAs by the 50-kDa subunit at similar efficiency unless the multiple sequence specificity is different from that of the Endo.SceI dimer. Preliminary experiments showed that the 50-kDa protein could not cleave pBR322, although Endo.SceI can specifically cleave it. A simple explanation for the result is that the apparent change in sequence specificity might be the result of mtHSP70 enhancement of the overall activity of the 50-kDa protein. Another possibility is that the 50-kDa protein has very narrow sequence specificity compared with the reconstituted mtHSP70/50-kDa heterodimer. To examine these possibilities, we quantitatively compared the endonuclease activity of the reconstructed dimer with that of the 50-kDa protein using the pBR322 substrate.In agreement with previous observations of Endo.SceI endonuclease specificity, Fig. 3 D shows that the reconstructed dimer cleaved the pBR322 substrate as well as the oli2 sequence (2Shibata T. Watabe H. Kaneko T. Iino T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10499-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the pBR322 substrate was not cleaved by the 50-kDa subunit at all. Cleavage of the pBR322 substrate was not observed even at concentrations of up to 16 μg/ml of the 50-kDa protein, whereas the cleavage of the same substrate was evident with only 0.125 μg/ml of the 50-kDa protein included in the reconstituted dimer (Fig.3 D). Neither the 50-kDa protein alone nor mtHSP70 showed endonuclease activity on the pBR322 substrate (Fig. 3 E), indicating that the 50-kDa protein gained multiple sequence specificity on association with mtHSP70. The interaction between the 50-kDa protein and mtHSP70 appears to be specific because the 50-kDa protein preincubated with ADP-loaded DnaK at a 1:1 molar ratio did not show cleavage activity on the pBR322 substrate (Fig.3 E).To compare the sequence specificity of the reconstructed dimer with that of the 50-kDa monomer in a more comprehensive manner, we used yeast mitochondrial DNA as a substrate for the endonuclease assay. We prepared Bam HI/Pst I double restriction digests of mitochondrial DNA, which was then treated with either the 50-kDa protein or Endo.SceI. The mitochondrial DNA used has a unique Pst I site within the 50-kDa protein gene, which is located at about 1.2 kb downstream of the Endo.SceI cleavage site in the oli2 gene (5Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakagawa K.-I. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 F shows that the 50-kDa protein monomer (5.3 μg/ml) generated fragments of 1.2 and 8.4 kb from the mitochondrial DNA, indicating specific cleavage at the oli2 sequence. No additional fragment appeared even at concentrations up to 10.6 μg/ml of the 50-kDa protein (data not shown). This result favors the idea that the oli2 gene is the unique cleavage site for the 50-kDa protein within mitochondrial DNA. In contrast to the apparent unisequence specificity of the 50-kDa protein, the Endo.SceI heterodimer at a concentration equivalent to 1"
https://openalex.org/W2086986073,"Sea urchin stage-specific activator protein (SSAP) activates transcription of the late H1 gene at the mid-blastula stage of development. Its C-terminal 202 amino acids form a potent glycine/glutamine rich activation domain (GQ domain) that can transactivate reporter genes to levels 5-fold higher than VP16 in several mammalian cell lines. We observed that, unlike other glutamine-rich activation domains, the GQ domain activates transcription to moderate levels in yeast. We utilized this activity to screen in yeast for intragenic mutations that enhance or inhibit the transcriptional activity of the GQ domain. We identified 37 loss of function and 23 gain of function mutants. Most gain of function mutations increased the acidity of the domain. The most frequently isolated mutations conferred enhanced transcriptional activity when assayed in mammalian cells. These mutations also enhance the ability of SSAP to up-regulate the late H1 promoter in sea urchin embryos. We conclude that the GQ domain fundamentally differs from other glutamine-rich activators and may share some properties of acidic activators. The ability of acidity to enhance SSAP-mediated transcription may reflect a mechanism by which phosphorylation of SSAP activates late H1 gene transcription during embryogenesis.

Transcriptional activators make up one brigade of this molecular army (1Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These proteins typically contain a transcriptional activation domain, separable from the DNA-binding domain, which confers upon it the ability to up-regulate its target genes. A functionally accurate grouping of this brigade into divisions and subdivisions has escaped investigators for years. The lack of discrete, conserved structural elements between different activation domains has bred instead a loose classification scheme based upon overall amino acid content. The major families include acidic activators, such as Gal4 (2Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and VP16 (3Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), glutamine-rich activators, such as Sp1 (4Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), proline-rich activators, such as CTF1 (5Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and basic activators, such as that in T3Ra (6Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most evidence suggests that activation domains exist under physiological conditions as unstructured, sticky polypeptide chains (Ref. 7O'Hare P. Williams G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 1Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Their job entails establishing protein-protein interactions with components of the basal transcription machinery, either directly or via coactivators and mediator proteins, and thereby stimulating any of several steps in the complicated pathways of transcription initiation or elongation (reviewed in Ref. 8Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). At the level of amino acid sequence, the motifs or characteristics that confer these biological activities upon a polypeptide remain elusive. Initial mutagenesis studies on the acidic Gal4 domain implicated acidity as an overall biochemical property that confers activation potential upon a polypeptide (9Gill G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Gill G. Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies suggested that other, nonacidic residues in acidic domains may contribute to the induction of secondary structure upon protein binding. In particular, the periodic spacing of hydrophobic residues in VP16 (11Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and other acidic domains (13Ruden D.M. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Sainz M.B. Goff S.A. Chandler V.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that binding of an activator to its partner may induce an α-helical structure that, in turn, stabilizes the interaction. For at least one acidic activator, this has been shown to be the case: the acidic domain of CREB assumes an α-helical conformation upon binding to its in vivo interacting partner CBP (15Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). A similar controversy exists with respect to the glutamine-rich activators. Whereas individual glutamine residues themselves appear to lack critical significance, periodic spacing of hydrophobic residues seems to be important for activation mediated by these proteins as well (16Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Some activities of transcription factors have even been mimicked by synthetic synthesis of polypeptide chains (17Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), suggesting that perhaps the only property necessary for a domain to function in activated transcription is the ability to bind to a general transcription factor (8Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In all cases, however, the attributes that distinguish an activation domain from a random polypeptide remain to be determined. Stage-specific activator protein (SSAP)1 is a sea urchin transcription factor responsible for the developmental activation of the late H1 histone gene at the mid-blastula stage of embryogenesis (18DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, this protein binds as a dimer to three sites in a stage-specific enhancer 300 bases upstream of the late H1 transcription initiation site (19Edelmann L. Childs G. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 133-147PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analysis revealed that the SSAP mRNA encodes a 41-kDa protein composed of two separable domains (20DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Li Z. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3684-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal 180 amino acids make up the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of SSAP and are sufficient to target the protein to its native binding site. The C-terminal 202 amino acids form a glycine-glutamine rich domain, the GQ domain, which shares homology with the glutamine-rich activation domains of the EWS and TLS proteins. When fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of Gal4, the GQ domain can activate transcription in several mammalian cell lines to levels 5-fold higher than VP16 (21DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the standard benchmark for potent transcriptional activation. Deletion analysis indicates that SSAP requires most, if not all, of its amino acid sequence to function as an activator. We reasoned that this strict sequence requirement might indicate that the primary amino acid sequence of SSAP encodes highly specific motifs that function in concert as requisite determinants of transcriptional activity. In this study, we address the question of what amino acid requirements exist for transcriptional activity of the GQ domain using random mutagenesis. Using a yeast one-hybrid-based functional screen, we identified 37 loss of function and 23 gain of function mutants to the GQ domain, as defined by their ability to activate transcription to levels below or above wild type, respectively. Most gain of function mutations increased the acidity of the domain and localize to the C-terminal half of the domain. Several of these mutants confer enhanced transcriptional activity upon the GQ domain in mammalian cells as well. Finally, we show that these mutations to the GQ domain enhance its ability to up-regulate the sea urchin late H1 promoter in vivo. We conclude that the glutamine-rich domain of SSAP fundamentally differs from other glutamine-rich activators. We suggest that the property of acidity in enhancing transcriptional activity may reflect a mechanism by which phosphorylation of SSAP temporally activates transcription of the late H1 gene during embryogenesis. To generate a library of GQ domain mutants, 20 ng of plasmid pBTM116-GQC (22Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Red (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 200 μl of the transformation was plated on LB/Amp plates and allowed to grow for 24 h. 10 ml of LB broth was swirled over the plate, decanted to a tube, and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. DNA was prepared from this culture using standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and represented the mutant library. Primer design and mutagenesis were based on the methods of Lehming et al. (24Lehming N. McGuire S. Brickman J.M. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10242-10246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To generate mutant GQ fragments, primers 5′-TGACGAAGTTACCGTTAAGCG-3′ and 5′-TGTGGTCAATAAGAGCGACC-3′ were used to amplify a 1089-base pair fragment from pBTM116-GQC that encompassed the entire GQ domain as an Eco RI fragment along with regions of overlap with the wild type plasmid both 5′ and 3′ to the Eco RI sites. PCR conditions were essentially those of Cadwell and Joyce (25Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mutagenic PCRs were set up in a total volume of 100 ml containing 1 ng of pBTM116, 20 pg of each primer, 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After an initial denaturing step of 94 °C for 3 min, PCR was performed for 30 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. This protocol was estimated to produce approximately three base pair changes per insert. Transformation of L40 yeast was performed using the lithium acetate method (26Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 27Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Donald G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). 100 ml of competent L40 cells was mixed with either 2 μof g mutagenized pBTM116-GQC DNA or, in the case of gap repair mutagenesis, 2 mg of Eco RI-cut pBTM116 and 800 ng of PCR product added directly from the PCR. For screening, transformations were plated on 150-mm plates containing selective medium lacking Trp at an average density of ∼5 × 103 colonies/plate to select initially for the presence of the plasmid. Colonies formed after 3 days of growth. Selection for mutant plasmids was performed using one of two methods. In the case of whole plasmid mutagenesis, colonies were lifted to nitrocellulose and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay (28Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Colonies that turned either dark blue or white were picked from the parent plate to fresh selective plates lacking Trp for propagation of the candidate plasmid. Plasmids were isolated and retransformed to confirm the phenotype. The Eco RI fragment containing the GQ domain was then excised from the candidate plasmid and subcloned into fresh Eco RI-cut pBTM116, and this new plasmid was then retransformed to confirm that the mutation(s) occurred within the GQ domain. Plasmids retaining the mutant phenotype after subcloning of the insert were sequenced to identify the mutations. In the case of gap repair mutagenesis, after 3 days of growth on selective plates lacking Trp colonies were replica-plated to new 150-mm plates lacking Ura, Trp, His, and Lys but containing 50, 20, and 0 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). Colonies were grown in the selection medium for 5 days. Colonies that either grew at 50 mm 3-AT or failed to grow at 20 mm 3-AT but grew in less stringent conditions were picked to fresh plates as above. Isolated plasmids were retransformed to confirm the mutant phenotype. The entire GQ domain of the mutant plasmids was then sequenced to identify the mutations. Yeast extracts were prepared from saturated 10-ml cultures as described (29Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1988) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). 100 μl of extract was added to 900 μl of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol). 200 μl of 4 mg/ml of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z buffer was added to start the reaction, and tubes were incubated at 30 °C for color development until a pale yellow color was visible. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. A420 values were taken and normalized against the protein concentration of individual extracts. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gal4-GQ fusion plasmids were prepared by subcloning the Eco RI fragment from pBTM116-GQ plasmids into the Eco RI site of pSG424. pSG424-GQ plasmids were then purified using the Wizard Maxiprep kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA mixtures for transfection contained 2 μg of the indicated CAT reporter plasmid and 1 μg of pGK-β-galactosidase control plasmid. pIBI31 (IBI) was used as carrier DNA when necessary to make sure that each transfection mixture contained the same amount of total DNA. Cells were transfected using the Lipofectin lipid transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer, except that 2 h prior to transfection, the media was replaced with 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. DNA-Lipofectin mixtures were prepared in serum-free Opti-MEM. After incubation at 37 °C for 7 h, the transfection mixture was replaced with normal medium. Cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection and lysed by freeze-thaw treatment (21DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were normalized among all samples according to β-galactosidase activity expressed from the control plasmid. Normalized extracts were then used in CAT assays as described previously (30La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Detection of CAT activity was accomplished by exposing the chromatography plates from the CAT assays on a Phosphor storage screen (Molecular Dynamics), scanning the screen using a Molecular Dynamics STORM system and quantitating the samples using ImageQuant version 1.2 for Macintosh. To check the expression of GQ domain GOF mutants in transfected HepG2 cells, normalized extracts from samples used in CAT assays were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. GQ domain expression was detected using anti-bacterially expressed SSAP antibodies affinity purified against bacterially expressed LexA-GQ. The procedure used to inject S. purpuratus zygotes was essentially that of McMahon et al. (31McMahon A.P. Novak T.J. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7490-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Colin (32Colin A.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and exactly as described by Lai et al. (33Lai Z.C. DeAngelo D.J. DiLiberto M. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Templates for capped mRNA synthesis were prepared by PCR using pGC391 as a template, a 5′ T7 primer, and the following three 3′ primers: 1) for wild type SSAP, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTATCGACTGTACGGATGG; 2) for R382L, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTATAGACTGTACGGATGG; and 3) for K369Estop, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTACTCGCCGTAGTTGTTGG. Capped mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the mMessage mMachineTM T7 polymerase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microinjection mixtures contained 30 ng/ml mRNA and 20 ng/ml reporter in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated deionized distilled sterile water. Embryos were harvested at 16 h postfertilization, and CAT assays were performed on embryo extracts as described (30La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). All glutamine-rich activation domains studied to date fail to activate transcription from integrated reporter genes in the yeast S. cerevisiae (34Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,35Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Glutamine residues make up 21% (42 of 202) of the GQ domain, solidly supporting its classification as a glutamine-rich domain. Surprisingly, our laboratory has observed that the GQ domain can, in fact, activate transcription in S. cerevisiae to moderate levels (22Zhang D. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6868-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The L40 yeast two-hybrid strain, in which these observations were recorded, harbors integrated LexA-driven HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes. Wild type L40 is a histidine auxotroph and produces white-colored colonies on media containing histidine and X-gal in the growth media. L40 colonies transformed with plasmid pBTM116-GQC, which encodes a LexA-GQ fusion protein driven by the yeast ADH1 promoter, become His+ and form light blue colonies in the presence of X-gal. We characterized the growth phenotype of the transformants in the presence of varying concentrations of 3-AT, a HIS3 inhibitor. Colonies maintained a wild type growth rate in the presence of 3-AT concentrations as high as 20 mm. Growth was inhibited noticeably as 3-AT concentrations exceeded 20 mm. In 3-AT concentrations of 40 mm, no growth was observed after a 6-day incubation at 30 °C. This demonstrates that the GQ domain, when fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain, stimulates transcription of LexA-driven integrated reporter genes in yeast to moderate levels and distinguishes it from other previously characterized glutamine-rich domains. We took advantage of the phenotypes described above to perform a functional screen for mutants that positively or negatively affect the ability of the GQ domain to mediate transcriptional activation (Fig.1). We randomly mutagenized the GQ domain using, in separate experiments, whole plasmid or PCR mutagenesis (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Mutant plasmids, or mutant fragments in conjunction with linearized pBTM116, were transformed into L40 yeast and plated on histidine-containing media. After 3 days, transformants were replica-plated to HIS−plates containing 0, 20, and 50 mm 3-AT. Gain of function mutants were defined by their ability to grow at 50 mm3-AT, whereas loss of function mutants were defined by their inability to form colonies at 20 mm 3-AT. The mutant phenotypes were subsequently confirmed using the second measure of β-galactosidase expression via a blue-white filter assay. The GQ domain from each mutant was manually sequenced to identify the sequence alterations. Using these methods, 37 loss of function mutants and 23 gain of function mutants were isolated. Of the 37 loss of function mutants, 13 were identified in the whole plasmid mutagenesis screen, and 24 in the PCR mutagenesis screen. All 37 contained +1 or −1 frameshifts, leading to missense reads and premature truncation of the protein. The most distal frameshift isolated was at position 310 (see Fig.2 for GQ amino acid sequence). Thus, amino acids between 310 and 382 contain residues critical for GQ-mediated transcription in S. cerevisiae. This is consistent with our previous findings in mammalian cell culture studies that amino acids 181–290 of SSAP fused to a Gal4(1–147) DNA-binding domain have no transcriptional activity and that truncation of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of the GQ domain at amino acid 352 severely cripples its ability to transactivate reporter genes (21DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Table I lists the twenty-three gain of function mutants, termed GOF 1–23, and the amino acid substitutions that result from the identified DNA base changes. Unexpectedly, we isolated four mutants (GOFs 5, 20, 22, and 23) encoding truncated forms of the GQ domain as gain of function mutants. GOF 5 and GOF 20 contained an A → T transition that introduced a stop codon at residue Lys-369, whereas GOF 22 and GOF 23 contained a C → T transversion that similarly introduced a stop codon at residue Arg-382. The isolation of these mutations, and of GOF 23 in particular, which contains the deletion as the only mutation in its sequence, argues that the final 14 amino acids of the GQ domain are dispensable for full transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the identification of this deletion in a gain of function screen suggests that residues between amino acids 369 and 382 may negatively modulate its transcriptional activity, possibly through the three basic residues situated in this region (see below).Table IMutants that increase the transcriptional activity of the GQ domain in yeastMutantMutations foundGOF 1K369EGOF 2K369EGOF 3N366I/K369EGOF 4N297D/S302R/N327D/P344Q/K369EGOF 5Q237H/Q238E/K369E/R382ΔGOF 6Y279N/K369EGOF 7Y212D/N395SGOF 8N295S/D309NGOF 9Q205PGOF 10N204YGOF 11G207DGOF 12G320D/N329DGOF 13G193D/T339AGOF 14R325GGOF 15Y362F/G363DGOF 16F377LGOF 17R382LGOF 18R382LGOF 19H378Y/R382LGOF 20Q350L/R382ΔGOF 21G219A/G223R/Q251R/N371SGOF 22N295I/K369ΔGOF 23K369ΔPlasmids encoding LexA-GQ fusion proteins were isolated from yeast colonies that demonstrated, based upon growth phenotypes and blue-white color assays, increased LexA-GQ driven expression of HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids encoding LexA-GQ fusion proteins were isolated from yeast colonies that demonstrated, based upon growth phenotypes and blue-white color assays, increased LexA-GQ driven expression of HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes. The entire GQ domain of these plasmids was sequenced, and the amino acid changes resulting from the alterations in each individual DNA sequence are listed below. The mutants are named GOF, for gain of function, and numbered 1–23. Lys-369 and Arg-382, the targets of the mutations described above, also distinguish themselves as the most frequent targets of missense mutations (Fig. 2). Overall, six mutants (GOFs 1–6) carried a K369E substitution, whereas three others (GOFs 17–19) contained a R382L substitution. These mutations and the nonsense mutations described above all eliminate basic residues, and, in the case of the K369E mutation, replace them with an acidic residue. Overall, 19 of the 23 gain of function mutants introduced a negative charge and/or eliminated a positive charge, thereby increasing the acidity of the domain. These results, achieved in the context of a glutamine-rich domain, parallel the results obtained when similar studies were performed upon the acidic activation domains of Gal4 and VP16. These results suggest that in addition to its sequence identification as a glutamine-rich activator, SSAP shares mechanistic similarities with acidic activators that are enhanced by the introduction of acidity to its domain. These properties of the GQ domain, in turn, may account for its transcriptional activity in S. cerevisiae. We quantified the relative effects of several mutants in yeast extracts using liquid β-galactosidase assays. This assay indicates that the mutants confer a 2–11-fold increase in transcriptional activity (Fig.3). More mutations were identified closer to the C terminus of the protein, and overall, these mutations show more significant effects when assayed in isolation. The K369E mutation and the R382L mutation each conferred a 4-fold increase in activity in the absence of other mutations. The combination of multiple acidic mutations appears to have an additive effect on the fold enhancement (compare, for example, GOF 1 and GOF 5, or GOF 17 and GOF 19). Western blots of yeast extracts show that all the mutant proteins are expressed in roughly equal amounts relative to wild type (data not shown). Furthermore, our screen yielded no false positives; all gain of function mutants isolated in the screen contained, upon sequencing, base changes that altered the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. This suggests that enhanced transcription of reporter genes is indeed attributable to the altered amino acid(s) and not simply to expression levels. Some of the mutations generate relatively small enhancements (for example, GOF7 and GOF15); because of this, we cannot exclude the possibility that some small increases may result from a position effect. Clearly, the generally larger effects and the overall trend of acidic mutations support the hypothesis that acidity increases the activity of the GQ domain. We next investigated whether the mutations we isolated function via a conserved mechanism by testing the ability of our gain of function mutants to enhance transcription of reporter genes in HepG2 cells. Fragments containing the indicated mutations were subcloned into pSG424, allowing expression of mutant GQ domains as Gal4(1–147) fusion proteins. Equal amounts of wild type or mutant DNA were cotransfected with CAT reporter genes containing one (G1E4CAT) or five (G5E4CAT) Gal4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E4T promoter (36Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We observed that GOF 5, 6, 15, and 17 all increased transcription in HepG2 cells from the G1E4CAT reporter (Fig.4 A). The R382L mutation alone (GOF 17) conferred a 3.7-fold increase over wild type levels, comparable to the effect observed in yeast. GOF 15, a weaker set of mutations in yeast, also retained its ability to enhance transcription. GOF 5 and GOF 6, both of which contain the K369E mutation, increased transcription by 2.7- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Both of these values represent significant drops with respect to the fold activity observed in yeast, but still reflect a gain of function. The difference between them can, as in yeast, be attributed to the presence of other acidic mutati"

The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter and/or neuropeptide phenotypes are encoded during development is not well understood. However, it is evident that multiple signaling pathways to the VIP gene must be utilized to allow VIP to be expressed in unique combinations with other hormones and neurotransmitters throughout the neuroendocrine axis.VIP gene expression is in part controlled by growth factors and neurotransmitters that signal to several cis-active elements on the VIP gene, via protein kinase, calcium, and cAMP-mediated signal pathways (15Waschek J.A.

The molecular basis for cell-specific and inducible transcription of the VIP gene has been studied in cell lines derived from neuroblastomas, tumors of neural crest origin oncogenically transformed in the course of peripheral autonomic development. Constitutive expression of the VIP gene in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells requires the contribution of at least five distinct domains of the VIP gene 5′-flank (17Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Biol.

These include an upstream 425-bp tissue specifier element (TSE) located at about −4.3 kb from the start of transcription, a promoter-proximal cAMP-responsive element (VIP-CRE), and three consecutive domains between −1.37 and −0.9 kb. Induction of VIP transcription by neurotrophic factors that activate the Jak-STAT tyrosine kinase signaling pathway requires a 180-bp cytokine-responsive element (CyRE) located at −1.33 kb in the VIP 5′-flank, containing binding sites for STAT and AP-1 proteins (19Symes A. Lewis S. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Symes A. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1436-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The cis-active sequences responsible for VIP gene regulation by serine-threonine kinase activation and their relationship to the domains required for constitutive and neurotrophin/cytokine induction of VIP gene transcription have not yet been defined.In this study, candidate domains for regulation of VIP gene transcription by activation of protein kinase C have been tested using deletional and mutational analysis in the context of a VIP reporter gene that supports constitutive, tyrosine kinase-mediated, and serine/threonine kinase-mediated transcriptional regulation. Both the STAT and ncAP-1 sites of the VIP-CyRE bound AP-1-related protein complexes and were required for phorbol ester-stimulated transcription in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells and also for constitutive VIP gene transcription in SH-EP cells. The AP-1 complexes formed on these two elements were different, however, in SK-N-SH and SH-EP cells. The role of these two noncanonical AP-1 sites may be to recruit multiple, unique AP-1-related complexes to the transcriptional platform of the gene depending on first messenger signaling and cellular context.RESULTS5.2 kb of the VIP gene 5′-flank (Fig.1 A) contains sequences necessary for constitutive expression in SH-EP and SH-IN neuroblastoma cells, and for PMA and forskolin induction in SY-5Y and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (16Waschek J.A. Hsu C.-M. Eiden L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9547-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Progressive deletions from this construct were used to pinpoint the cis-active sequences responsible for PMA induction of the VIP gene in SK-N-SH cells. Deletion of the VIP gene from −5.2 to −2.5 kb removes the upstream TSE, causing a decrease in basal expression in SK-N-SH cells as reported for SH-EP and SH-IN VIP-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines (17Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but did not decrease the -fold induction of gene transcription by PMA (Fig. 1 B). Further deletion from −2.5 to −1.37 kb caused no further reduction in fold stimulation of reporter gene expression by PMA compared with the VIP5.2 construct, indicating that the single consensus TRE in the VIP gene located at −2.25 kb (TGACTCA; see Fig. 1 A) does not mediate PMA-stimulated transcription in SK-N-SH cells. Removal of sequences from −1.37 to −1.28 kb, however, abolished PMA stimulation, indicating that this region (domain c in Fig. 1 A) contains sequences important for PMA induction in SK-N-SH cells. Removal of domain d from VIP gene constructs in which domain c was retained also abolished PMA stimulation, which was restored by adding back a 5′ portion of domain d between −1.28 and −0.904 kb (Fig. 1 C). Thus, deletional analysis suggests that domains c and d′ are both required for PMA-inducible expression of the VIP gene in SK-N-SH cells.Mutational analysis of the VIP-luciferase reporter gene was employed to determine which cis-active sites within domains c and d′ of the VIP gene are required for PMA-stimulated transcription in SK-N-SH cells. We have previously reported that domains c and d′, acting in combination with other elements in the gene, separately contribute positive and negative regulatory functions required for neuroendocrine cell-specific expression of the VIP gene and its silencing in non-VIPergic cells (18Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17086-17094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Domain c contains a highly conserved dyad symmetry sequence (22Sena M. Bravo D.T. Agoston D.v. Waschek J.A. DNA Seq. 1994; 5: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), likely to be functionally significant. The junction between domains c and d also contains a 180-bp CyRE, which, when fused to a heterologous promoter, confers up-regulation of transcription by cytokines of the CNTF family in NBFL neuroblastoma cells (20Symes A. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The CyRE contains separate STAT and AP-1 protein binding sites, both required for CNTF regulation of gene transcription (20Symes A. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Mutations in either the STAT site or the AP-1 binding site (ncAP-1 site; see Fig. 1 A), reduced the absolute level of expression after PMA treatment by 88 and 89%, respectively, and -fold induction by PMA by 62 and 77%, respectively (Fig.2 A). A STAT and ncAP-1 double mutation completely abolished PMA induction, indicating that these two cis-acting sequences play a critical role in PMA-inducible expression of the VIP gene. Mutations in the dyad symmetry sequence had little effect on the level of expression after PMA compared with untreated control cells and did not reduce fold induction by PMA.Figure 2STAT and ncAP-1 sites of the VIP gene are required for both PMA-inducible expression in SK-N-SH cells and constitutive expression in SH-EP cells. A, a transient expression assay was performed in SK-N-SH cells using the VIP1.55 construct in which luciferase expression is driven by 1.55 kb of the VIP gene 5′-flank with or without the following mutations. The Dyad construct contains a 7-bp substitution of the 25-bp dyad symmetry sequence in domain c. STAT and ncAP-1 constructs contain 4- and 3-bp substitutions and are located in domains c and d′, respectively (see Fig. 1 A). The STAT + ncAP construct contains mutations in both the STAT and ncAP-1 sites. The mean and S.E. for triplicate paired determinations from a single experiment are shown. In the inset, data are expressed as -fold induction in the presence of 50 nm PMA compared with basal expression in the absence of PMA. B, a transient expression assay was done in SH-EP cells using VIP1.55-TSE constructs with or without mutations in the dyad symmetry, STAT, or ncAP-1 sequences. The mean and S.E. for triplicate paired determinations from a single experiment are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both the STAT and ncAP-1 sites are located within the domains of the VIP gene (domains c and d′, respectively; see Fig.1 A) that are also important for cell-specific constitutive expression of VIP in SH-EP cells (18Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17086-17094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of mutations in these sites on constitutive expression of the VIP-luciferase reporter gene in SH-EP cells (Fig. 2 B). For these experiments, the VIP1.55-TSE construct, containing all five domains of the VIP gene necessary for cell-specific and inducible expression (domains a, b, c, d, and e; see Fig. 1 A) was used. The VIP1.55-TSE construct was expressed at a 26-fold higher level than the VIP1.55 construct in SH-EP cells. Mutation of the dyad symmetry, STAT, and ncAP-1 sites resulted in decreases of 40, 38, and 74%, respectively, in the level of the VIP1.55-TSE reporter gene in SH-EP cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the STAT and ncAP-1 sites of the VIP gene are involved both in PMA-stimulated up-regulation of the gene in SK-N-SH cells and its constitutive expression in SH-EP cells, while the dyad symmetry element is required only for basal expression of the VIP gene.Figure 3AP-1 proteins are stimulated by PMA to bind both the ncAP-1 and STAT sites in SK-N-SH cells. Gel shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled ncAP-1 probe (A) or STAT probe (B). Nuclear extracts were prepared from SK-N-SH cells treated with 50 nm PMA (or ethanol for control) for 5 h. For competition and supershift assays, a molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides or specific antibodies were mixed with the nuclear extract before the addition of the probe. The ncAP-1/m3 and STAT/m4 oligonucleotides contain three and four mutated bases, respectively. VIP-TRE is the oligonucleotide spanning the TRE consensus sequence of the VIP gene located at −2.25 kb. APRE, represents acute phase response element (or interleukin-6-response element) of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene (23Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide is from the human collagenase gene (25Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Pan-Fos and pan-Jun antibodies broadly react with c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 and with c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gel mobility shift assays were performed to identify nuclear proteins binding to the STAT and ncAP-1 sites in SK-N-SH cells after PMA treatment. Nuclear extracts from SK-N-SH cells treated with PMA exhibited binding of specific protein complexes to both the ncAP-1 and STAT sites, absent from untreated cells (Fig. 3). Complex formation was observed in extracts from cells treated with PMA for 2 h, was maximum in cells treated for 4 h, and persisted, with decreasing intensity, for up to 72 h (data not shown).PMA-inducible binding of SK-N-SH nuclear proteins to the labeled ncAP-1 probe (Fig. 3 A) was completely blocked with excess unlabeled ncAP-1 oligonucleotide or AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide. An oligonucleotide containing the consensus TRE (TGACTCA) at −2.25 kb in the VIP gene also competed with labeled ncAP-1 probe for binding of the SK-N-SH nuclear proteins. Mutated ncAP-1 (ncAP-1/m3) and a STAT binding consensus sequence (acute phase response element or interleukin-6 response element of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene (23Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar)) failed to compete with the labeled probe. Pan-Fos and pan-Jun antibodies that broadly recognize Fos and Jun transcription factor family members, respectively, completely blocked binding of SK-N-SH nuclear proteins to the ncAP-1 oligonucleotides in antibody supershift/competition assays. When antibodies that specifically recognize individual members of Fos and Jun families were used in supershift assays, anti-c-Fos antibodies showed strong blockade of complex formation, with smaller effects of FosB and Fra-1 and Fra-2 antibodies. None of the antibodies to specific members of the Jun family gave complete blockade of ncAP-1 complex formation. Thus, the AP-1 complex binding to the ncAP-1 site of the VIP gene is probably a dimer of c-Fos and a Jun-related protein in SK-N-SH cells.Similar results were obtained when the STAT oligonucleotide was used as a probe (Fig. 3 B), indicating that although this cis-active element binds STAT proteins in response to cytokine treatment (19Symes A. Lewis S. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it functions as an AP-1 binding site after exposure to PMA.PMA induction of endogenous VIP mRNA and gel shift complex formation on the ncAP-1 oligonucleotide were both unaffected by blockade of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide, and both were blocked by treatment with H-7, a broad specificity serine-threonine protein kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4). Thus, the c-Fos and Jun-related components of the AP-1 complex regulating VIP transcription in SK-N-SH cells are activated via a post-translational mechanism involving protein phosphorylation and are not produced by de novo biosynthesis, following treatment with PMA.Figure 4PMA-inducible binding of AP-1 and VIP mRNA expression in SK-N-SH cells does not require new protein synthesis but is dependent on serine-threonine protein kinase pathways. Effects of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (0.5 μg/ml), and protein kinase inhibitor H-7 (0.1 mm) on PMA-inducible binding of AP-1 (A) and VIP mRNA expression (B) were investigated in a gel shift assay and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Cells were preincubated with inhibitors (or vehicles for control) for 30 min before the addition of PMA (50 nm). Cells were harvested 5 and 20 h after PMA for the gel shift and Northern assays, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gel shift assays were also performed with SH-EP cell nuclear extracts to identify candidate trans-acting factors operating on the STAT and ncAP-1 sites to mediate constitutive VIP expression. Specific binding of nuclear proteins to the ncAP-1 and STAT oligonucleotides was readily detected in extracts from untreated SH-EP cells (Fig.5). Specific complex formation on both ncAP-1 and STAT oligonucleotides was observed with SH-EP cell nuclear extracts and was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled AP-1 consensus or VIP-TRE oligonucleotides in molar excess (Fig. 5). Both pan-Jun and pan-Fos antibodies interacted with the complex formed by SH-EP cell nuclear proteins on the ncAP-1 and STAT oligonucleotides (Fig. 5). Supershift analyses revealed that the AP-1 complex formed on both the STAT and ncAP-1 elements in SH-EP cell nuclear extracts consisted of a dimer of c-Jun and Fra-1 or Fra-2 (Fig. 5). The STAT and ncAP-1 sites of the VIP gene are therefore occupied by different AP-1 complexes in SH-EP and PMA-stimulated SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells.Figure 5AP-1 proteins from SH-EP nuclear extracts binding to the ncAP-1 and STAT sites of the VIP gene are distinct from those in PMA-treated SK-N-SH cell nuclear extracts. Gel shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled ncAP-1 probe (A) or 32P-labeled STAT probe (B) and SH-EP nuclear extract. Competition assays and supershift assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAP-1 is composed of dimers of members within the jun gene family (c-Jun, JunB, or JunD) or dimers between members of the jun and fos gene families (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2; for a review see Ref. 24Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). AP-1 binds to a cis-active element present on many genes (TRE; TGA(C/G)TCA) defined by its ability to mediate phorbol ester-dependent induction of transcription (25Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). This report identifies two elements contained within the VIP gene capable of recruiting distinct AP-1 complexes in a cell context-dependent fashion, to achieve both stimulus-conditional and constitutive expression in neuroendocrine cells. Despite the fact that neither are consensus sequences for AP-1, binding of AP-1-related proteins to these relatively closely positioned sites (STAT and ncAP-1 sites at −1.32 and −1.20 kb, respectively) is apparently required for both PMA-inducible expression in SK-N-SH cells and constitutive expression in SH-EP cells. Interestingly, a single TRE consensus sequence in the VIP gene (at −2.25 kb), although capable of binding AP-1, is apparently not involved in either PMA-inducible expression in SK-N-SH cells or constitutive expression in SH-EP cells (18Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17086-17094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the cis-activation potential of a given AP-1 site may depend both on its position in the gene and on proteins binding to neighboring sequences that enhance or forbid access to co-activators and other proteins that make up the pretranscriptional platform. Members of the Ets family of transcription factors, for example, are in some cases required for transcription activation by AP-1, binding to an adjacent site and cooperating with AP-1 in the recruitment of additional proteins to the gene (26Wasylyk B.

The VIP gene contains Ets-like core sequences (AGGA(A/T)) several bases downstream of the STAT and ncAP-1 sites that could function in this manner. On the other hand, the AP-1 consensus site at −2.25 kb may exert some AP-1-dependent function in another VIPergic cellular context, in which cis-active elements neighboring it recruit appropriate AP-1-cooperative trans-activating proteins.In SK-N-SH cells, PMA caused an activation of pre-existing AP-1 (c-Fos and JunB or related proteins) in a protein phosphorylation-dependent manner without requiring new protein synthesis. How this c-Fos-Jun complex acquires the ability to bind both the ncAP-1 and STAT sites of the VIP gene after stimulation by PMA is a subject of current investigation. Several distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades have been implicated in the control of AP-1 activity in response to various extracellular stimuli (for a review, see Ref. 30Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). One type of cascade, initiated by growth factors, culminates in the activation of extracellular stimulus-responsive kinase, phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Elk-1, and increased transcription of the c-fos gene, leading to increased levels of c-Fos protein (31Kyriakis J.M.

Another type of cascade, initiated by stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor or UV irradiation leads to the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase and the Fos-regulating kinase, which phosphorylate c-Jun and c-Fos, respectively, allowing binding to AP-1 sites and trans-activation of target genes (32Derijard B.

A protein synthesis-independent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, like that involving activation of pre-existing Jun and Fos proteins, may be utilized in PMA-inducible expression of the VIP gene in SK-N-SH cells.AP-1 binding to the STAT and ncAP-1 sites of the VIP gene in SH-EP cells is likely to be a Fra-c-Jun dimer rather than a c-Fos-Jun-related protein dimer as in SK-N-SH cells. Signaling pathways leading either to induction of AP-1 protein synthesis or post-translational activation of AP-1 proteins could be responsible for activation of AP-1-dependent VIP gene transcription in SH-EP cells, depending on whether VIP expression in these cells is driven by continuously produced autocrine factors or constitutively activated signal transduction components within the cell, respectively.While PMA induction of VIP mRNA does not require new protein synthesis in SK-N-SH cells, it does depend on new protein synthesis in primary cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. 2H.

To identify proteins that serve as interacting partners of the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) in heart, DNA-protein binding studies were performed with an RXR-responsive element (NRRE-1) derived from the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene promoter and nuclear protein extracts prepared from adult rat heart. NRRE-1 is a pleiotropic RXR-responsive element comprised of three potential recognition sites for class II members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Gel mobility shift assays performed with an NRRE-1 probe in the absence or presence of bacterially overproduced RXRα and nuclear protein extracts prepared from adult rat heart, liver, or brain identified a cardiac-specific, RXR-dependent DNA-protein interaction. The NRRE-1-RXR·cardiac-enriched RXR-interacting protein (CERIP) complex exhibited a distinct mobility compared with NRRE-1-RXR·peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NRRE-1-RXR·retinoic acid receptor, or NRRE-1-RXR·thyroid receptor complexes. Mutational analysis demonstrated that two of the three potential binding half-sites of NRRE-1 (an everted repeat separated by an 8-base pair spacer) are required for the NRRE-1-RXR·CERIP interaction. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that CERIP interacted with RXRα and RXRγ but not with RXRβ, indicating a receptor subtypespecific binding preference and suggesting an RXR AB region-dependent interaction. The RXR·CERIP complex did not form on NRRE-1 when a mutant GST-RXRα fusion protein lacking the NH2-terminal AB region (but containing the receptor dimerization domain) of RXRα was added in place of the full-length RXRα, confirming a role for the AB region in the RXR·CERIP interaction. DNA-protein cross-linking studies demonstrated that CERIP is a DNA-binding protein of approximately 110 kDa. These results provide evidence for the existence of a cardiac-enriched DNA-binding protein that interacts with RXRα via the AB region and suggest a mechanism whereby cardiac retinoid signaling is controlled in an RXR subtype-specific manner.

The existence of three distinct RXR subtypes (α, β, and γ) and multiple isoforms generated by alternate promoter utilization and/or differential splicing adds to the complexity of RXR-mediated transcriptional regulatory pathways (13Mangelsdorf D.J.

Several lines of investigation have indicated that retinoid signaling pathways are involved in cardiac development and function. Offspring of rodents fed a vitamin A-deficient diet display a variety of congenital cardiac defects (14Wilson J.G. Warkany J. Am. J.

The incidence of conotruncal defects and other cardiac malformations is high in RXRα mutants (20Gruber P.J. Kubalak S.W. Pexieder T. Sucov H.M. Evans R.M.C.K.R. J. Clin.

RXR has also been shown to control the expression of genes involved in postnatal cardiac metabolism and contractile function. We have shown that RXRα activates the transcription of the genes encoding medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD; Refs. 22Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J.

Previous studies have also shown that the slow sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca+ ATPase (28Rohrer D.K. Harting R. Dillman W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8638-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiac α and β myosin heavy chain genes (29Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V.

Res. 1987; 60: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) are regulated by RXR/thyroid receptor heterodimers. Lastly, two studies have demonstrated that RXR-dependent pathways suppress the cardiac myocyte hypertrophy program (31Zhou M.D. Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Wu J. Garami M. Cheng T. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies define an important role for RXR and retinoid signaling in postnatal heart. Despite the explosion of new information regarding the diverse mechanisms whereby retinoid receptors control gene expression, little is known about the mechanisms involved in cell-, organ-, and developmental stage-specific actions of RXR. Such specificity could be achieved via distinct RXR subtypes/isoforms, heterodimeric partner selection, or ligand availability. The recent identification of a diverse number of RXR-interacting proteins suggests another mechanism for cell- and tissue-specific control of retinoid signaling, through the availability of specific co-activators or co-repressors of RXR. However, the majority of RXR interacting proteins identified to date are ubiquitously expressed and generally do not exhibit receptor specificity. We speculated that one potential mechanism for the cardiac-specific action of RXR is via interactions with cardiac-enriched interacting proteins or DNA-binding partners. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the known pleiotropic RXR response element identified within the human MCAD gene promoter termed nuclear receptor response element 1 or NRRE-1 (22Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRRE-1 is a complex retinoid-responsive element comprised of three potential hexameric binding sites for class II members of the nuclear hormone superfamily (23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The various pairwise combinations of the binding sites within NRRE-1 define at least three separate elements: an everted repeat separated by 8 base pairs (ER8), an imperfect direct repeat (DR0), and an everted repeat separated by 13 base pairs (ER13) (23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments performed in vitro have demonstrated that NRRE-1 is capable of binding alternative pairs of RXR heterodimers including RXR·RAR and RXR·PPAR in vitro (22Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) but not RXR homodimers. NRRE-1 also interacts with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TF I) homodimers and estrogen-related receptor α homodimers in an RXR-independent manner (23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Murine transgenic experiments have shown that NRRE-1 is necessary for appropriate expression during cardiac perinatal development and in the adult heart (26Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because NRRE-1 is capable of interacting with a variety of RXR heterodimers in vitro and given its importance in the control of metabolic gene expression in heart, it was utilized as a target element for the identification of RXR partners in nuclear protein extracts prepared from adult rat heart. In this report, we describe the identification of a cardiac-specific, RXR-dependent NRRE-1-binding protein. Surprisingly, the interaction of this cardiac enriched RXR-interacting protein (CERIP) with RXR is isoform-specific and requires the amino-terminal AB region of RXR rather than the classical dimerization domain. In addition, based on UV cross-linking studies, CERIP is a DNA-binding protein. These findings identify a potentially novel cardiac-enriched RXR partner, define an important role for the AB domain of this nuclear receptor, and suggest a mechanism for the cardiac- and subtype-specific actions of RXR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (34Carter M.E. Gulick T. Raisher B.D. Caira T. Ladias J.A. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

DNA-protein binding studies were performed to identify cardiac proteins that interact with the RXRα on the pleiotropic retinoid-responsive element, NRRE-1. EMSA were performed with a double-stranded NRRE-1 probe and crude cardiac nuclear protein extracts in the absence or presence of bacterially overexpressed RXRα. In the absence of exogenously added RXRα, long exposure (24–48 h) of the EMSA autoradiograph demonstrated that two NRRE-1-protein complexes formed with the cardiac nuclear protein extract (data not shown). Previous antibody recognition studies have shown that the two faint NRRE-1-cardiac nuclear protein complexes contain homodimers of the orphan nuclear receptors, COUP-TF and estrogen-related receptor α (26Disch D.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but not RXR. However, addition of increasing amounts of RXRα to the sample containing the cardiac nuclear protein extract and the NRRE-1 probe resulted in the formation of a prominent RXR-dependent complex of low mobility (Fig.1, lane 4). The low mobility RXR-dependent complex did not form on NRRE-1 in the absence of cardiac nuclear proteins (Fig. 1, lane 3). Competition experiments with a molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded NRRE-1 DNA or a size-matched, unrelated DNA fragment (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8) confirmed that the RXR-dependent, cardiac nuclear protein-dependent NRRE-1-protein complex was specific. Addition of the RXR ligand, 9-cis retinoic acid, did not significantly alter the formation of the NRRE-1-protein complex (data not shown). To determine whether the formation of the low mobility RXR-dependent NRRE-1-protein complex was unique to cardiac-derived nuclear proteins, the EMSA were performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from adult rat brain or liver. Although two light NRRE-1-protein complexes were observed with protein extracts derived from all three tissues in the absence of exogenously added RXRα, in the presence of added RXRα the prominent low mobility complex was only observed with extracts derived from heart (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2 compared with lanes 3–6). Moreover, the RXR-dependent complex did not form with nuclear protein extracts prepared from rat skeletal muscle, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, or the HIB brown adipocyte line (data not shown). These data identify a cardiac-enriched RXR interacting protein. We have shown previously that NRRE-1 is a complex nuclear receptor response element that contains three potential nuclear receptor-binding sites (Fig.3 A, sites 1, 2, and 3). EMSAs were performed with a series of mutant NRRE-1 probes to delineate the binding site requirements for the RXR·CERIP-DNA complex (complex RC). Complex RC did not form with mutant NRRE-1 probes containing a deletion of site 1 (Δ1) or a deletion of sites 2 and 3 (Δ2, 3, Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). To explore further the requirements for sites 1–3 in the RXR·CERIP-NRRE-1 interaction, EMSA were performed with point mutant NRRE-1 probes (M1, M2, and M3), each containing a cytidine substitution for the “invariant” second position guanine within one of the three potential hexamer binding sites (Fig. 3 A). We have shown previously that each binding site mutation abolishes nuclear receptor binding (23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex RC did not form with M1 or M2 but did form with the M3 probe (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6). Thus, NRRE-1 site 3 is dispensable, but sites 1 and 2, which comprise an imperfect everted repeat separated by 8 base pairs, are required for the formation of complex RC. To determine whether the RXR·CERIP complex recognized other RXR response elements, EMSA were repeated with a probe containing a known RXRE comprised of a direct repeat sequence separated by a single base pair (DR-1; 5′-gatctaggtcaaaggtcatctag-3′). A second probe containing NRRE-3, a nuclear receptor response element distinct from NRRE-1 present in the human MCAD gene (sense strand sequence, 5′-gatccgagtatgtcaaggccgtgacccgtgtg-3′; Ref. 42Leone T.C.

Neither the DR-1 nor the NRRE-3 probe formed the RXR·CERIP complex (data not shown). In contrast, a probe containing a homologue of NRRE-1, previously identified in the mouse MCAD gene promoter region (mNRRE-1; Ref. 35Tolwani R.J. Farmer S.C. Johnson K.R. Davisson M.T. Kurtz D.M. Hinsdale M.E. Cresci S. Kelly D.P. Wood P.A. Gene. 1996; 170: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) formed an RXR-dependent, cardiac nuclear protein-dependent complex of identical mobility to that of complex RC (Fig. 4). The mNRRE-1 DNA sequence contains significant homology with that of the human NRRE-1 (Fig. 4) but contains only one class II nuclear receptor-binding half-site consensus sequence (RGGTTNA). Taken together, these results indicate that RXR·CERIP binds specific recognition sites within the mouse and human MCAD gene promoter regions, each containing an RXR-binding half-site and additional upstream sequence requirements. To determine whether the formation of complex RC is dependent on RXR subtype, the EMSA were repeated with in vitro translated murine RXRα, β, or γ1 in the presence of cardiac nuclear protein extract (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–3). Complex RC formed with RXRα but not RXRβ and was barely detectable with RXRγ1. To control for the integrity and relative amount of the in vitro translated proteins, EMSA were performed with the NRRE-1 probe incubated with RARβ (produced in bacteria) in the presence of equivalent amounts of each of the RXR subtypes. We have shown previously that RXR·RAR heterodimers bind to NRRE-1 (22Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the DNA-protein complexes formed with RXR·RAR were similar among each of the RXR subtypes (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6), confirming that equivalent amounts of receptor was present in each lane. The results shown above indicate that the RXR·CERIP interaction is subtype-specific. The RXR subtypes exhibit high amino acid homology in the DNA-binding and dimerization/ligand-binding domains (C-F domains) (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). However, the NH2-terminal AB region is more highly conserved for a given subtype between species than across subtypes within the same species (43Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether the subtype specificity of the RXR·CERIP interaction was conferred by the RXR AB region by performing EMSA with the NRRE-1 probe and cardiac nuclear extracts in the presence of a mutant GST-RXRα fusion protein in which the AB region was deleted (RXR(ΔAB)). As expected, RXR(ΔAB), which contains the D"
https://openalex.org/W2085184401,"Abstract In order to decrease significantly the oxygen affinity of human hemoglobin, we have associated the mutation βF41Y with another point mutation also known to decrease the oxygen affinity of Hb. We have synthesized a recombinant Hb (rHb) with two mutations in the β chains: rHb βF41Y,K66T. In the absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, additive effects of the mutations are evident, since the doubly mutated Hb exhibits a larger decrease in oxygen affinity than for the individual single mutations. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, the second mutation did not significantly increase the P 50 value relative to the single mutations. However, the kinetics of CO binding still indicate combined effects on the allosteric equilibrium, as evidenced by more of the slow bimolecular phase characteristic of binding to the deoxy conformation. Dimer-tetramer equilibrium studies indicate an increase in stability of the mutants relative to rHb A; the double mutant rHb βF41Y,K66T at pH 7.5 showed a K 4,2 value of 0.26 μm. Despite the lower oxygen affinity, the single mutant βF41Y and double mutant βF41Y,K66T show only a moderate increase of 20% in the autoxidation rate. These mutations are thus of interest in developing a Hb-based blood substitute."
