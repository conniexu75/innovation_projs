https://openalex.org/W2037543813,"Unusual deformation structures, similar to those observed in rocks from known and suspected meteorite impact craters, are observed in inclusions of basement rock in the Onaping formation at Sudbury, Ontario. These features, which include planar sets in quartz parallel to the (0001) and (10ī3) planes, suggest that the Onaping formation consists of shocked and melted material deposited immediately after a meteorite impact which formed the Sudbury basin."

Midway was built above the sea by flows that were weathered and partially truncated in pre-Miocene time. After submergence, volcanic clays were reworked and covered by limestones. Overall ubmergence was interrupted at least twice by emergence. The limestones have been leached, recrystallized, and partially dolomitized."
https://openalex.org/W2074586846,"Paleomnlagnietic polarity changes have been detected in nine deep-sea sedimentary cores (from the Pacific-Antarctic Basin) in which an extinction horizon of a radiolarian assemblage was previously independently determined. The depths of the polarity change 0.7 million years ago and the faunal boundary are closely correlated, confirming that the faunal extinction was locally virtually synchronous. Although the reason for the faunal extinction is unknown. the possibility of causal relationships between faunal extinction and factors directly involved with sedimentation rate, sedimentation rate variation, and sediment type appears to be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W2083236930,"We have examined an 18 hour-long record made as part of our program of measturements of the fluxes of a number of discrete radio sources. Since our radiometer employed an absolute reference, it was possible to obtain absolute background data from the reference region observed around each of the 29 sources investigated that day. From the study of a plot mode from this data, we conclude that there is no large-scale deviation from isotropy of more than 0.1 degrees K at 4080 megahertz."
https://openalex.org/W1987271825,"Surface-wave magnitudes (M(8)) of 4.1 and 3.2 are determined for two events in southern Algeria. The corresponding body-wave magnitudes (m(b)) are 5.8 and 4.9, respectively. The surface waves from these events are much smaller than would be expected from most earthquakes of comparable body-wave magnitudes, which fact suggests that these waves were generated by underground explosions."

https://openalex.org/W2005066771,"Dicke has interpreted his recent measurement of the sun's oblateness as implying a fast (1.8-day period) rotation of the solar radiative interior. We find that differentially rotating solar models, such as the one proposed by Dicke, are unstable. The rate of turbulent diffusion in the unstable regions of these models is so rapid that it appears to preclude a fast spinning solar interior. As a corollary of the stability analysis, we conclude that the loss of a significant fraction of a star's angular momentum must be accomnpanied by the mixing of material below its convective zone. Such mixing inevitably leads to the depletion of lithium in the star's photosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2058441641,"The neutron buildup processes of heavy-element synthesis in stars have left us a number of tantalizing nuclear clues to the early history of solarsystem material. Considerable illumination of our past history has been achieved through studying the correlations between abundance and neutroncapture cross section. Measurement of these cross sections required the development of new techniques for measuring time of flight of pulsed neutron beams. A clear conclusion is that many of our heavy elements were produced inside stars, which can be thought of as giant fast reactors. Extensions of these capture studies have given a clearer picture of additional. violent processes which produced some heavy elements, particularly thorium and uranium. In addition, the correlations have been used for obtaining an independent measure of the time that has elapsed since the solar-system material was synthesized. Finally, data on capture cross section relative to abundance will enable us to determine rather accurately the solar-system abundances of gaseous, volatile, and highly segregated elements."

https://openalex.org/W2101161241,"The recent detection of radioactive Al26 in marine sediments has led to the conclusion that it is brought into the earth's atmosphere by micrometeorites which have been exposed, in interplanetary space, to solar high-energy protons. The Al26 method is not precise enough to yield directly a reliable value for the mass accretion rate to the earth to better than about 3 orders of magnitude, but it is sufficiently accurate to allow a crucial decision between two widely differing models of interplanetary dust which have been proposed to explain observations of the zodiacal light. The two models lead to Al26 concentrations which would differ by about 5 orders of magnitude. Thus, the presence of Al26 is consistent only with the zodiacal dust model with particles of some tens of microns rather than with submicron particles. From this model a mass accretion to the earth can then be calculated which is set at 1250 (upper limit, 2500; lower limit, 250) tons per day, or 2.8 × 10-15 g/cm2 sec, or 4.5 × 1011 g over the earth per year. This value does not depend on the flux of the solar high-energy particles, which may be uncertain by an order of magnitude or more. The presence of Al26 supports the idea that an important fraction of the dust is stony in composition and material density, and thus eliminates some more exotic dust models, such as one consisting entirely of carbon grains. We may also conclude that the accreted dust particles have been in the solar system and exposed to protons from solar high-energy particles for a time interval which is greater than a significant fraction of the Al26 half-life (0.74 × 106 years)."

https://openalex.org/W2088764205,Observations of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) at 2695 megahertz reveal more detail than do earlier measurements at lower frequency. The region is highly confused but there is apparently a more dense clustering of sources within the optical outline of the galaxy than without. One source (OA33) near M31 has an interesting. flat spectrum.
