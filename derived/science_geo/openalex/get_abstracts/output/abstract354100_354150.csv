Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8). Here we show, however, that extrinsic stimuli are dispensable for the derivation, propagation and pluripotency of ES cells. Self-renewal is enabled by the elimination of differentiation-inducing signalling from mitogen-activated protein kinase. Additional inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 consolidates biosynthetic capacity and suppresses residual differentiation. Complete bypass of cytokine signalling is confirmed by isolating ES cells genetically devoid of STAT3. These findings reveal that ES cells have an innate programme for self-replication that does not require extrinsic instruction. This property may account for their latent tumorigenicity. The delineation of minimal requirements for self-renewal now provides a defined platform for the precise description and dissection of the pluripotent state."

To understand the coevolution of the mammals and their indigenous microbial communities, we conducted a network-based analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of humans and 59 other mammalian species living in two zoos and in the wild. The results indicate that host diet and phylogeny both influence bacterial diversity, which increases from carnivory to omnivory to herbivory; that bacterial communities codiversified with their hosts; and that the gut microbiota of humans living a modern life-style is typical of omnivorous primates."
https://openalex.org/W2025176940,"The multiprotein mTORC1 protein kinase complex is the central component of a pathway that promotes growth in response to insulin, energy levels, and amino acids and is deregulated in common cancers. We find that the Rag proteins—a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)—interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid–sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that is constitutively bound to guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with mTORC1, and its expression within cells made the mTORC1 pathway resistant to amino acid deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Rag mutant prevented stimulation of mTORC1 by amino acids. The Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the kinase activity of mTORC1, but, like amino acids, promote the intracellular localization of mTOR to a compartment that also contains its activator Rheb."
https://openalex.org/W1979991507,"Aluminium adjuvants, typically referred to as 'alum', are the most commonly used adjuvants in human and animal vaccines worldwide, yet the mechanism underlying the stimulation of the immune system by alum remains unknown. Toll-like receptors are critical in sensing infections and are therefore common targets of various adjuvants used in immunological studies. Although alum is known to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that alum does not require intact Toll-like receptor signalling to activate the immune system. Here we show that aluminium adjuvants activate an intracellular innate immune response system called the Nalp3 (also known as cryopyrin, CIAS1 or NLRP3) inflammasome. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18 by macrophages in response to alum in vitro required intact inflammasome signalling. Furthermore, in vivo, mice deficient in Nalp3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) or caspase-1 failed to mount a significant antibody response to an antigen administered with aluminium adjuvants, whereas the response to complete Freund's adjuvant remained intact. We identify the Nalp3 inflammasome as a crucial element in the adjuvant effect of aluminium adjuvants; in addition, we show that the innate inflammasome pathway can direct a humoral adaptive immune response. This is likely to affect how we design effective, but safe, adjuvants in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2050103984,"The absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into the ocean lowers the pH of the waters. This so-called ocean acidification could have important consequences for marine ecosystems. To better understand the extent of this ocean acidification in coastal waters, we conducted hydrographic surveys along the continental shelf of western North America from central Canada to northern Mexico. We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of approximately 40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area."
https://openalex.org/W2168221215,"Even in clonal populations of cells, there is significant phenotypic variation from cell to cell. This could reflect the 'noise' inherent in gene expression: or the various cell states could represent stable phenotypic variants. Chang et al. analysed the behaviour of an 'outlier' in clonal populations of mouse haematoipoietic stem cells that had very high expressions of the stem cell marker Sca-1 and found that outliers possessed distinct transcriptomes. Though the transcriptomes eventually reverted back to that of the median cells, while they differed they could drive the cells to express characteristics of distinct cell fates. Thus clonal heterogeneity of gene expression may not be due to noise in the expression of individual genes, but rather is a manifestation of metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome. These fluctuations may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision. Even in clonal populations of cells, there is significant phenotypic variation from cell to cell: Huang and colleagues analyse the behaviour of an 'outlier', which had very high expressions of the stem cell marker Sca-1, and conclude that clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is a manifestation of metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome. These fluctuations may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision. (See Nature Reports Stem Cells). Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of ‘gene expression noise’1,2,3,4,5,6, or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants7. Such ‘non-genetic cell individuality’7 can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels8 in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous ‘outlier’ cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a >200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a >15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision."
https://openalex.org/W2102027817,"Trust and betrayal of trust are ubiquitous in human societies. Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.

In nonhuman mammals the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) plays a central role in the ability to form social attachments and affiliations, including parental care, pair bonding, and social memory (Carter, 1998Carter C.S.

In addition, OT shows significant binding in the limbic system, including the amygdala (Huber et al., 2005Huber D. Veinante P. Stoop R.

Initial behavioral experiments indicate that OT also seems to be a potent modulator of social interaction behavior and social cognition in humans (Bartz and Hollander, 2006Bartz J.A. Hollander E.

Neuropeptides and social behavior: effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in humans.Prog. Brain Res. 2008; 170: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). OT has recently been shown to influence a person's ability to infer another's mental state, an ability that is referred to as “mind-reading” (Domes et al., 2007bDomes G. Heinrichs M. Michel A. Berger C. Herpertz S.C. Oxytocin improves “mind-reading” in humans.Biol. Psychiatry. 2007; 61: 731-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has shown that OT increases people's willingness to trust others (Kosfeld et al., 2005Kosfeld M. Heinrichs M. Zak P.J. Fischbacher U. Fehr E. Oxytocin increases trust in humans.Nature. 2005; 435: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OT's effect on trust was not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. Instead, OT specifically affected individuals' willingness to take social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. The behavioral impact of OT on trust offers a unique chance to gain a deeper understanding into the neural circuitry of trust and trust adaptation after betrayal of trust by combining behavioral experiments with pharmacological intervention and neuroimaging methods. To date, however, no study on the effects of this peptide on the neural circuitry associated with human trusting behavior is available. Moreover, it is not known how OT affects trust after subjects experienced that their trust had been betrayed, i.e., we do not know whether subjects receiving OT respond to this betrayal with a decrease in trust or whether they maintain their trusting behavior. We thus examined the effects of intranasally administered OT on both brain activity and individuals' decisions in a trust and a risk game with real monetary stakes after subjects received feedback indicating that their trust had been betrayed or that their risky investment resulted in no payback in about half the cases. Our work is based on the combination of neuroscientific tools with economic experiments which recently gained momentum through the neuroeconomics research agenda (Camerer et al., 2005Camerer C.

We apply, in particular, a suitably modified version of the trust game (Berg et al., 1995Berg J. Dickhaut J. McCabe K. Trust, reciprocity, and social-history.Games Econ. Behav. 1995; 10: 122-142Crossref Scopus (2585) Google Scholar, Camerer and Weigelt, 1988Camerer C. Weigelt K.

Does fairness prevent market clearing? An experimental investigation.Q. J. Econ. 1993; 108: 437-459Crossref Scopus (683) Google Scholar) to address our research questions. In a trust game (Figure 1), two subjects interacting anonymously are in the role of an investor (who is in the scanner) and a trustee. The investor first has the chance of choosing a costly trusting action by giving money to the trustee. If the investor transfers money, the total amount available for distribution between the two players increases because the experimenter triples the investor's transfer. Initially, however, the trustee reaps the whole increase. Then the trustee is informed about the investor's transfer and can then honor the investor's trust by sending back money (“sharing”), so that both subjects earn the same amount of money. Thus, if the investor gives money to the trustee and the latter shares, both players end up with a higher and equal monetary payoff. However, the trustee also has the option of violating the investor's trust by not sharing the money. In this case, the investor loses all the money he sent to the trustee, an event that investors typically interpret as a breach or betrayal of trust (Bohnet and Zeckhauser, 2004Bohnet I. Zeckhauser R. Trust, risk and betrayal.J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2004; 55: 467-484Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Since sharing the money is costly for the trustee, a selfish trustee will never honor the investor's trust because the investor and the trustee interact only once in the experiment. In the risk (lottery) game, the investor faces the same choices and exactly the same probabilistic risk as in the trust game, but a random computer mechanism implements the payback and no interaction with a trustee takes place. Thus, the only difference between the two games is that the investor's risk in the trust game arises from the uncertainty regarding the trustee's behavior—that is, a social interaction with a specific trustee constitutes the risk—whereas a nonsocial random mechanism determines the investor's risk in the lottery game. The risk game constitutes an important control condition because economic theories (Falk and Fischbacher, 2006Falk A. Fischbacher U. A theory of reciprocity.Games Econ. Behav. 2006; 54: 293-315Crossref Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, Fehr and Schmidt, 1999Fehr E. Schmidt K.M. A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation.Q. J. Econ. 1999; 114: 817-868Crossref Scopus (5255) Google Scholar, Rabin, 1993Rabin M. Incorporating fairness into game theory and economics.Am. Econ. Rev. 1993; 83: 1281-1302Google Scholar) and previous empirical research (Bohnet and Zeckhauser, 2004Bohnet I. Zeckhauser R. Trust, risk and betrayal.J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2004; 55: 467-484Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar) has shown that many people have an aversion against being betrayed when they trust another person (Bohnet and Zeckhauser, 2004Bohnet I. Zeckhauser R. Trust, risk and betrayal.J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 2004; 55: 467-484Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar), but betrayal aversion cannot play a role in situations involving nonsocial risks. In addition, OT has been shown to increase trust but not nonsocial risk taking, suggesting the conjecture that OT reduces the special fears that are associated with social betrayal (Kosfeld et al., 2005Kosfeld M. Heinrichs M. Zak P.J. Fischbacher U. Fehr E. Oxytocin increases trust in humans.Nature. 2005; 435: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Therefore, OT may affect brain activity in these two games differently. An investor either received OT or placebo. We had a total of 49 investors, each of whom played 12 risk periods (games) and 12 trust periods (games) that took place in a random order. The investor faced a new trustee in every trust period. Figure 2 depicts a timeline for one period of a trust and a lottery game for subjects in the scanner. After the first 12 periods, in which six risk games and six trust games took place, the investors received feedback that informed them how often their investment was successful in the risk game and how often the trustee paid back money in the trust game. Thus, the investors received feedback only once—at the end of the first 12 periods. The feedback information told the investors that their investment led to a return or their trust was repaid only in about 50% of the cases (see Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures section for detailed description of feedback administration). In the following, we refer to the first six risk and six trust games as the prefeedback phase, while the periods after the feedback are referred to as the postfeedback phase. Taken together our experimental design creates thus three main variables: group (OT, placebo), phase (prefeedback, postfeedback), and game (trust, risk). Previous findings from neuroimaging and lesion studies led us to hypothesize that subcortical brain structures such as the amygdala and brainstem effector sites—that process fear, danger, and perhaps also risk of social betrayal—are involved in trusting behaviors. The amygdala has been shown to exhibit increased activation in social avoidance and phobia (Stein et al., 2002Stein M.B. Goldin P.R. Sareen J. Zorrilla L.T. Brown G.G. Increased amygdala activation to angry and contemptuous faces in generalized social phobia.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2002; 59: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, Tillfors et al., 2001Tillfors M. Furmark T. Marteinsdottir I. Fischer H. Pissiota A. Langstrom B. Fredrikson M. Cerebral blood flow in subjects with social phobia during stressful speaking tasks: a PET study.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2001; 158: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and while viewing untrustworthy faces (Winston et al., 2002Winston J.S. Strange B.A. O'Doherty J. Dolan R.J. Automatic and intentional brain responses during evaluation of trustworthiness of faces.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Decreased amygdala activation has also been linked to genetic hypersociability (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2005Meyer-Lindenberg A. Hariri A.R. Munoz K.E. Mervis C.B. Mattay V.S. Morris C.A. Berman K.F. Neural correlates of genetically abnormal social cognition in Williams syndrome.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and lesion studies have indicated that patients with bilateral amygdala damage are impaired in judging the trustworthiness of other people's faces. These patients all judged other people to look more trustworthy and more approachable than did normal viewers (Adolphs et al., 1998Adolphs R. Tranel D. Damasio A.R. The human amygdala in social judgment.Nature. 1998; 393: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Finally, during the processing of fearful stimuli, subjects receiving OT have reduced amygdala activation and reduced connectivity of the amygdala with brainstem regions involved in automatic fear reactivity (Domes et al., 2007aDomes G. Heinrichs M. Glascher J. Buchel C. Braus D.F. Herpertz S.C. Oxytocin attenuates amygdala responses to emotional faces regardless of valence.Biol. Psychiatry. 2007; 62: 1187-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, Kirsch et al., 2005Kirsch P. Esslinger C. Chen Q. Mier D. Lis S. Siddhanti S. Gruppe H. Mattay V.S. Gallhofer B. Meyer-Lindenberg A. Oxytocin modulates neural circuitry for social cognition and fear in humans.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11489-11493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with a recent animal study that demonstrates in vitro that OT acts on the central amygdala by inhibiting excitatory information from the amygdala to brainstem sites mediating the autonomic fear response (Huber et al., 2005Huber D. Veinante P. Stoop R. Vasopressin and oxytocin excite distinct neuronal populations in the central amygdala.Science. 2005; 308: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Given that the amygdala is crucially involved in the processing of risks arising in social situations, we hypothesized that oxytocin might affect the amygdala response to these social risks, thereby facilitating prosocial approach behavior—such as trust. Other relevant evidence comes from neuroimaging studies using economic experiments involving social interaction paradigms (Delgado et al., 2005aDelgado M.R. Frank R.H. Phelps E.A. Perceptions of moral character modulate the neural systems of reward during the trust game.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, King-Casas et al., 2005King-Casas B. Tomlin D. Anen C. Camerer C.F. Quartz S.R. Montague P.R.

Pagnoni G. Berns G. Kilts C. A neural basis for social cooperation.Neuron. 2002; 35: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). These studies suggest the striatum could play a role in our experiment; it is thought to be part of a neural circuit that guides and adjusts future behavior on the basis of reward feedback (O'Doherty et al., 2004O'Doherty J. Dayan P. Schultz J. Deichmann R. Friston K. Dolan R.J.

Fiez J.A. Modulation of caudate activity by action contingency.Neuron. 2004; 41: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Moreover, a study of reward-related (nonsocial) probability learning has shown that activation in this region in response to reward feedback diminishes, as cues learned through trial and error begin to predict how actions and outcomes are related, thus making feedback less informative (Delgado et al., 2005bDelgado M.R. Miller M.M. Inati S. Phelps E.A. An fMRI study of reward-related probability learning.Neuroimage. 2005; 24: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This finding has been extended to a repeated-interaction trust game in which participants faced the same opponent and gradually learned whether their partner is trustworthy through experience. Over time, as the partner's response became more predictable, the activity in the dorsal striatum decreased in this game (King-Casas et al., 2005King-Casas B. Tomlin D. Anen C. Camerer C.F. Quartz S.R. Montague P.R. Getting to know you: reputation and trust in a two-person economic exchange.Science. 2005; 308: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Trial and error is not the sole method for learning predictability, however. It has been recently shown that the perceptions of moral character alone suffice to modulate the dorsal striatum during both the decision and the outcome phases of a trust game (Delgado et al., 2005aDelgado M.R. Frank R.H. Phelps E.A. Perceptions of moral character modulate the neural systems of reward during the trust game.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Participants made risky choices about whether to trust hypothetical trading partners after having read vivid descriptions of life events indicating praiseworthy, neutral, or suspicious moral character. Activations in the striatum differentiated between positive and negative feedback as well as between no-trust and trust decisions, but only for the “neutral” partner, whereas no differential activity was observed for the “good” partner despite the fact that (by experimental design) neutral and good partners responded in the same way to trusting decisions. This finding suggests that prior social and moral information can diminish reliance on brain structures such as the dorsal striatum that are important for behavioral adaptations to feedback information. These brain structures may also be recruited in our experiment as the subjects may feel the need to adjust their behaviors following meager information feedback. Therefore, if OT indeed diminishes the behavioral adaptation to this feedback, such an effect might be modulated by a diminished reliance on brain structures involved in behavioral adaptation. Regarding the two different phases of the study (pre- and postfeedback phase), it is important to note that subjects in the prefeedback phase have an incentive to explore different strategies in order to maximize the informativeness of the feedback. In order to maximize learning about the trustworthiness of the trustees' subject pool, for example, the investors may have an incentive to make more trusting decisions in the prefeedback phase because the gleaned knowledge about the trustees' trustworthiness can be valuable for behavioral adaptation after the feedback. An additional motive for trusting choices in the prefeedback phase thus exists that is absent in the postfeedback phase. Note too that in order to enable a clean comparison between the two games in the postfeedback phase, subjects received the same feedback in the risk and the trust game because the probability distribution of investment successes in the risk game replicated the probability distribution of the trustees' responses in the trust game (see Experimental Procedures section for details). Our main behavioral measure consists of each individual's average investment in the risk and the trust game during the prefeedback and the postfeedback phase, yielding four observations per individual. We performed a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA based on these observations for the risk and the trust game (controlling for potential personality differences in general trust [M. Siegrist, C. Keller, T.C. Earle, and M. Hanselmann, personal communication], general risk seeking propensity [Zuckerman and Link, 1968Zuckerman M. Link K. Construct validity for sensation-seeking scale.J. Consult. Clin. Psychol. 1968; 32: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar], and feedback information; see Experimental Procedures section for details). This analysis reveals a significant interaction effect in the trust game (group × phase, F(1,40) = 4.06, p = 0.05, ETA2 = 0.11), which is absent in the risk game (group × phase, F(1,40) = 0.04, p = 0.85, ETA2 = 0.001). Subjects receiving the placebo decreased their trusting behavior after they were informed that their interaction partner did not pay back in about 50% of the cases, whereas subjects receiving OT demonstrated no change in their trusting behavior in the postfeedback phase (see Figure 3 and see Table S1 available online) despite having received the same information. In the risk game, however, both groups showed no behavioral adaptation to the feedback information. Thus, it seems that OT only affects the behavioral adaptation to the feedback information if social risks are involved, but not if nonsocial risks are involved. The specific impact of OT on behavioral adaptation in the trust but not in the risk game is complemented by similarly specific response time differences between the OT and placebo group. Individuals in the OT group exhibit considerably smaller response times than those in the placebo group (t = −2.77, p < 0.01) during the postfeedback phase, whereas no significant differences (t = 0.51, p = 0.61) are present during the prefeedback phase (see Table S2). This difference in the postfeedback phase is, in particular, due to the significant decline in responses times in the OT group in the postfeedback phase compared to the prefeedback phase (t = 2.72, p < 0.05). The response time effect of OT in the trust game contrasts with the risk game, in which we observe no significant differences between the two groups in the prefeedback and in the postfeedback phase. In order to control for nonspecific effects that might be associated with OT administration, we explicitly measured mood, calmness, and wakefulness before substance administration and 10 min after the end of the scanning session (after subjects had played both the risk and trust game). We observed no significant group differences (independent t tests, all p > 0.26; see Table S3) neither before the scanning session nor afterwards. Finally, we asked subjects at the end of the experiment whether they believed they had received OT or the placebo. Thirty-four percent of subjects in the placebo group and 30% of subjects in the OT group reported the impression they had received OT. A correlation between this belief question and the effective administration of OT or the placebo showed no significant correlation (Spearman correlation, r = −0.107, p = 0.470), thus clearly indicating that neither subjects in the OT nor in the placebo group recognized whether they had received OT or a placebo. We conducted analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the decision phase of the trust and the risk game. A random-effects general linear model (GLM) analysis was conducted using each condition (trust and risk game) and period (six prefeedback periods and six postfeedback periods) as predictors. We generated statistical maps contrasting the OT and the placebo groups using serial subtraction terms, separately for prefeedback and postfeedback periods. The serial subtraction term consisted either of trust > risk contrasts or risk > trust contrasts and was exclusively masked at p < 0.05 with the reversed second contrast of the serial subtraction term (see Experimental Procedures section for explanation). For example, one important statistical map in the postfeedback phase concerns (Trust > Risk)P > (Trust > Risk)OT, exclusively masked with the reverse second contrast (Risk > Trust)OT. Here, OT denotes oxytocin and P indicates placebo. The results of this map reveal the brain activations that are specific to trust taking (relative to risk taking) in the placebo (P) group, i.e., the extent to which OT reduces brain activations when individuals make choices in the trust game. Significant results are reported at p < 0.005 (uncorrected) with a cluster threshold of ten voxels. In case of significant unilateral activations in our main regions of interests, including the amygdala and striatum, we lowered the significance threshold to p < 0.01 (uncorrected) with the same voxel extent to verify whether a bilateral activation pattern could be found at this threshold. A few differences were observed b"

Understanding the mechanism of shape determination in cells has proved to be extremely challenging due to the numerous components involved and the complexity of their interactions. Here we harness the natural phenotypic variability in a large population of motile epithelial keratocytes from fish (Hypsophrys nicaraguensis) to reveal mechanisms of shape determination. We find that the cells inhabit a low-dimensional, highly correlated spectrum of possible functional states. We further show that a model of actin network treadmilling in an inextensible membrane bag can quantitatively recapitulate this spectrum and predict both cell shape and speed. Our model provides a simple biochemical and biophysical basis for the observed morphology and behaviour of motile cells."

Here we report the identification of a new ubiquitin receptor, Rpn13/ARM1, a known component of the proteasome. Rpn13 binds ubiquitin through a conserved amino-terminal region termed the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin (Pru) domain, which binds K48-linked diubiquitin with an affinity of approximately 90 nM. Like proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn10/S5a, Rpn13 also binds ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains of UBL-ubiquitin-associated (UBA) proteins. In yeast, a synthetic phenotype results when specific mutations of the ubiquitin binding sites of Rpn10 and Rpn13 are combined, indicating functional linkage between these ubiquitin receptors. Because Rpn13 is also the proteasomal receptor for Uch37, a deubiquitinating enzyme, our findings suggest a coupling of chain recognition and disassembly at the proteasome. The 26S proteasome is a multisubunit complex that selectively degrades ubiquitin conjugated proteins. Two studies show that a known component of the proteasome, Rpn13 functions as a novel ubiquitin binding receptor. Structural studies reveal a novel mode of ubiquitin recognition.

In resting human lymphocytes, thioredoxin-1 actively denitrosylated cytosolic caspase-3 and thereby maintained a low steady-state amount of S -nitrosylation. Upon stimulation of Fas, thioredoxin-2 mediated denitrosylation of mitochondria-associated caspase-3, a process required for caspase-3 activation, and promoted apoptosis. Inhibition of thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductases enabled identification of additional substrates subject to endogenous S -nitrosylation.

Viruses were matched to their hosts by analyzing spacer sequences that occur among clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) that are a hallmark of virus resistance. Virus population genomic analyses provided evidence that extensive recombination shuffles sequence motifs sufficiently to evade CRISPR spacers. Only the most recently acquired spacers match coexisting viruses, which suggests that community stability is achieved by rapid but compensatory shifts in host resistance levels and virus population structure."

Throughout history supernovae were discovered chiefly through their delayed optical light, preventing observations in the first moments (hours to days) following the explosion. As a result, the progenitors of some supernovae and the events leading up to their violent demise remain intensely debated. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of a supernova at the time of explosion, marked by an extremely luminous X-ray outburst. We attribute the outburst to the break-out of the supernova shock-wave from the progenitor, and show that the inferred rate of such events agrees with that of all core-collapse supernovae. We forecast that future wide-field X-ray surveys will catch hundreds of supernovae each year in the act of explosion, and thereby enable crucial neutrino and gravitational wave detections that may ultimately unravel the explosion mechanism."

The enhanced toughness is attributed to a delamination that was a result of crack branching on the aligned {100} cleavage planes in the bundles of the ultrafine elongated ferrite grains strengthened by nanometer-sized carbides. In the temperature range from 60° to –60°C, the yield strength was greater, leading to the enhancement of the toughness."

Rpn13 is also a receptor for a deubiquitinating enzyme, suggesting a linkage between ubiquitin chain recognition and disassembly. Targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome. It is currently unclear how the proteasome recognizes its substrates, as the only established ubiquitin receptor intrinsic to the proteasome is Rpn10/S5a (ref. 1), which is not essential for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in budding yeast2. In the accompanying manuscript we report that Rpn13 (refs 3–7), a component of the nine-subunit proteasome base, functions as a ubiquitin receptor8, complementing its known role in docking de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 (refs 4–6) to the proteasome. Here we merge crystallography and NMR data to describe the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of Rpn13. We determine the structure of Rpn13 alone and complexed with ubiquitin. The co-complex reveals a novel ubiquitin-binding mode in which loops rather than secondary structural elements are used to capture ubiquitin. Further support for the role of Rpn13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor is demonstrated by its ability to bind ubiquitin and proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously. Finally, we provide a model structure of Rpn13 complexed to diubiquitin, which provides insights into how Rpn13 as a ubiquitin receptor is coupled to substrate deubiquitination by Uch37."

In mammalian cells, Smo-dependent signaling requires translocation to primary cilia. We demonstrated that beta-arrestins mediate the activity-dependent interaction of Smo and the kinesin motor protein Kif3A. This multimeric complex localized to primary cilia and was disrupted in cells transfected with beta-arrestin small interfering RNA. beta-Arrestin 1 or beta-arrestin 2 depletion prevented the localization of Smo to primary cilia and the Smo-dependent activation of Gli.

However, if animals have access to food only during their normal sleep cycle, they will shift most of their circadian rhythms to match the food availability. We studied the basis for entrainment of circadian rhythms by food and light in mice with targeted disruption of the clock gene Bmal1 , which lack circadian rhythmicity. Injection of a viral vector containing the Bmal1 gene into the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus restored light-entrainable, but not food-entrainable, circadian rhythms. In contrast, restoration of the Bmal1 gene only in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus restored the ability of animals to entrain to food but not to light. These results demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains a Bmal1 -based oscillator that can drive food entrainment of circadian rhythms."

https://openalex.org/W2063576205,"Disruptions in dopamine signalling have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and drug addiction. The phosphoprotein DARPP-32 is a prominent mediator of dopamine signalling in the striatum, a part of the brain where dopaminergic activation has been linked to reward and learning. Now a novel signal transduction cascade involving nuclear accumulation of DARPP-32 has been discovered, induced by both drugs of abuse and natural stimuli such as food. Disruption of this cascade alters the behavioural effects of the drugs and decreases motivation for food, suggesting a role for this mechanism in the in vivo actions of dopamine signalling. Dopamine orchestrates motor behaviour and reward-driven learning. Perturbations of dopamine signalling have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, and in drug addiction. The actions of dopamine are mediated in part by the regulation of gene expression in the striatum, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here we show that drugs of abuse, as well as food reinforcement learning, promote the nuclear accumulation of 32-kDa dopamine-regulated and cyclic-AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32). This accumulation is mediated through a signalling cascade involving dopamine D1 receptors, cAMP-dependent activation of protein phosphatase-2A, dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser 97 and inhibition of its nuclear export. The nuclear accumulation of DARPP-32, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1, increases the phosphorylation of histone H3, an important component of nucleosomal response. Mutation of Ser 97 profoundly alters behavioural effects of drugs of abuse and decreases motivation for food, underlining the functional importance of this signalling cascade."

The number of subunits that make up the Hv1 channel is not known. Also unknown are the number and location of the permeation pathway(s). The lack of a conventional pore domain implies a unique mechanism of gating and of coupling between gate and voltage sensor, but these too are unknown. To address these issues, we set out to determine the number of subunits in Hv1 and to probe the conduction pathway and gating mechanism. We find that Hv1 is a dimer and that each subunit contains its own permeation pathway and gate controlled by a voltage sensor. Our experiments suggest a mechanism of gating for Hv1 channels, which resembles those of the omega pathway recently described in a mutant Shaker potassium channel (Tombola et al., 2007Tombola F.

The twisted ion-permeation pathway of a resting voltage-sensing domain.Nature. 2007; 445: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereby the voltage sensor also serves as the channel's gate. To determine the number of subunits present in the Hv1 channel, we used a single-molecule technique of subunit counting that we recently developed (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Single-molecule measurements remove ensemble averaging, allowing detection of the behavior of individual molecules, thus providing the frequency distribution of that behavior, rather than just the average behavior of the population, which may blur out distinct properties of discrete subpopulations (Das et al., 2007Das S.K.

The density of channels was kept low enough to minimize the chance of incidental overlap of two channels within a diffraction-limited spot, yielding 20–200 channels in each field of view (13 μm on a side, Figure 1A). Single Hv1 channels were observed as laterally diffusing fluorescent spots. The movement made it difficult to observe multiple bleaching events from the same spot. However, cooling the cells to 4°C reduced the diffusion, enabling us to count the number of irreversible steps of photobleaching (Figure 1B). Because each channel contains as many GFP tags as it does subunits, counting the number of bleaching steps amounts to counting the subunits. The majority of the fluorescent spots from Hv1-GFP channels displayed two bleaching steps (65 ± 3%, n = 11, Figure 1C). This behavior was similar to what we observed in channels that are known to contain two GFP-tagged subunits (i.e., an NMDA receptor made of two NR1 plus two NR2B-GFP subunits, in which the NR2B subunit was tagged with GFP) and was very distinct from what is seen in channels containing only one subunit (a GFP-tagged Cav2.3 α1E channel, which is made of four connected pseudosubunits and contains one GFP at its C-terminal end) (Figure 1D and Table 1). Moreover, this behavior was distinct from channels containing four GFP-labeled subunits, as shown previously (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The ∼1/3 of events with one bleaching step is expected for a pure dimer when one takes into account that ∼20% of the GFP tags are nonfluorescent, as observed previously (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Data available online).Table 1Bleaching-Step Distributions for the Fluorescently Labeled Hv1 Constructs#Channel1 Step (%)2 Steps (%)3+ Steps (%)nAvg # of SpotsDiscarded Spots (Avg. in %)1NR1 + NR2B-GFP36 ± 363 ± 31.0 ± 0.79509.22Hv1 WT w/o Kv1.4C33 ± 365 ± 32.7 ± 1.11143103Hv1 WT∗29 ± 467 ± 34.3 ± 0.7310510.54NVSP-Hv1∗60 ± 1.339 ± 1.40.7 ± 0.46524.45Hv1-CVSP∗97 ± 1.83.2 ± 1.804228.76Hv1-CSh93 ± 2.57.3 ± 2.505347.37NVSP-Hv1-CVSP∗94 ± 0.75.9 ± 0.7071037.68NHv-VSP-CHv∗49 ± 2.351 ± 2.30.7 ± 0.573910.19Cav2.3α94 ± 1.55.8 ± 1.505557.2∗Constructs fused with Kv1.4 C terminus and coexpressed with PSD-95. Open table in a new tab ∗Constructs fused with Kv1.4 C terminus and coexpressed with PSD-95. The reference channels with a known number of subunits to which we compared Hv1 (the NMDA receptor subunits and the Cav2.3 channel) contain native PDZ-binding motifs at their C termini, which reduce their mobility in the plasma membrane, likely due to interaction with the cell's PDZ proteins. Therefore, in order to compare Hv1 to these other channels under similar conditions, we also examined Hv1 following fusion of the C terminus of the potassium channel Kv1.4 to the C terminus of Hv1-GFP. As expected, fusion of the Kv1.4 C terminus and coexpression of the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 increased the fraction of immobile Hv1 channels. The fraction of spots with two bleaching steps remained essentially the same (67% ± 3%, n = 3) as what we first observed without the added anchoring domain (Figure 1D). This and our previous result on the voltage-gated phosphatase Ci-VSP (Kohout et al., 2008Kohout S.C. Ulbrich M.H. Bell S.C. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit organization and functional transitions in Ci-VSP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the addition of the Kv1.4 C terminus reduces the mobility but does not cause aggregation or interfere with oligomer formation. These experiments indicate that Hv1 is made of two subunits. Having found that the Hv1 channel is made of two subunits, we next set out to ask whether there are one or two pores per channel. To find manipulations that block the proton current, we screened for residues in the Hv1 protein that, when substituted by cysteine, make the channel sensitive to block by trimethylaminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), a thiol-modifying reagent that covalently adds a positively charged group to accessible cysteines (Akabas et al., 1992Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Acetylcholine receptor channel structure probed in cysteine-substitution mutants.Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). We measured the proton currents of WT and cysteine-substituted channels in inside-out patches from oocytes and tested the effect of MTSET added to the intracellular side of the membrane. We found that WT channels are insensitive to intracellular MTSET, while the mutant N214C was almost completely (96% ± 1%, n = 4) inhibited by MTSET (Figures 2A and 2B). The small residual current had the same voltage dependence as before MTSET treatment (Table 2 and Figure 4), consistent with this effect being due to pore block. This observation, coupled with the fact that proteins that contain an arginine at the homologous position (e.g., voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels, as well as the VSD-containing phosophatase, Ci-VSP) have no proton current (Figure 2C), suggested that a charged residue at this position is incompatible with proton conduction. We tested this notion by substituting arginine for the native asparagine at this position in Hv1 (N214R) and found that, although GFP-tagged N214R channels reached the cell surface, as gauged by TIRFM, no proton current could be detected (data not shown).Table 2Fit Parameters for the G-V Curves of Different Hv1 Constructs#ChannelV1/2 (mV)kT/zeo (mV)n∗1Hv1 WT53 ± 311.6 ± 0.652Hv1 GFP-tagged54 ± 311.1 ± 0.453TD WT-WT47 ± 212.6 ± 0.644NVSP-Hv-CVSP68 ± 215.0 ± 0.265TD WT-214C45 ± 114.9 ± 0.846TD WT-214C after MTSET51 ± 411.3 ± 1.247TD 214C-214C43 ± 114.3 ± 0.648TD 214C-214C after MTSET48 ± 312.0 ± 0.84∗Number of oocytes. Open table in a new tab ∗Number of oocytes. We next reasoned that, if the positively charged guanidinium group of the arginine side chain is what blocks the proton current in Hv1(N214R), as the first S4 arginine has been shown to block the omega current through the Shaker and Nav1.2 channel VSDs (Sokolov et al., 2005Sokolov S.

Indeed, we found that intracellular guanidinium reversibly blocked Hv1 with a Kd of 1.05 ± 0.07 mM, %inhib(max) = 92 ± 2, and a Hill coefficient of 0.91 ± 0.04 (n = 5, Figures 2D and 2E). The Hill coefficient of approximately 1 suggests that one guanidinium ion is sufficient to block the pore of Hv1. Ammonium, the smaller positively charged group of the lysine side chain, also blocked the Hv1 current, but less effectively (Figures 2D and 2E). We constructed a tandem dimer of Hv1 that would allow us to independently manipulate the two subunits constituting the channel by mutagenesis. In case the channel has one central pore, manipulations that block the proton flow when made in both subunits would also change the conduction properties of the common pore when made in only one of the two subunits, although likely to a lesser extent. If the protein contains two separate pores, then we would expect two possible scenarios depending on whether the perturbation remains confined to the manipulated (mutant) subunit or whether it also propagates to the nonmanipulated (WT) subunit. In the scenario of confined perturbation, we expected the block of the pore in the mutant subunit to leave unaltered the proton flow through the WT subunit. This scenario is clearly different from the case of one pore per dimer where modification of either one or both subunits causes alterations in the proton flow through the common pore. In the scenario of propagating perturbation, we expected the block of the pore in the mutant subunit to be accompanied by a change in the proton flow through the WT subunit producing results similar to the case of one pore per channel. Thus, a lack of effect of the pore-blocking manipulation in one subunit on half the current flow would argue for the presence of a second and separate pore in the WT subunit, which is not affected by the manipulation of the mutant subunit (nonpropagating perturbation). We constructed the tandem dimers by connecting the C terminus of one Hv1 subunit to the N terminus of a second Hv1 subunit via a 17 aa long flexible linker (Figure 3A, Experimental Procedures). We refer to the linkage of two WT subunits as the WT-WT dimer. We then generated tandem dimers in which one or both subunits contained the N214C substitution, which we had shown to be subject to modification by MTSET, yielding WT-214C, 214C-WT, and 214C-214C. We reasoned that, if each Hv1 subunit has one pore, then MTSET should block two pores in 214C-214C, one pore in WT-214C and 214C-WT, and none in WT-WT. In addition, if, after MTSET block, WT-214C and 214C-WT still have one functioning WT pore, the inhibition by guanidinium of the proton current carried by this unmodified pore should be the same as the inhibition of the WT channel. On the other hand, if two subunits are needed to form a single Hv1 pore, then MTSET should block it not only in 214C-214C but also in WT-214C and 214C-WT. Such block of a common pore by two MTSET molecules in 214C-214C would be near complete, while block by one MTSET of WT-214C and 214C-WT may be only a fraction of the block of 214C-214C (Figure 3A). Such fractional block would be unlikely to be the same for different MTS reagents, which have different side chain volumes and charge (Figure 2F). MTS modification of 214C-214C, WT-214C, and 214C-WT blocked the proton current (Figure 3) with little effect on the voltage dependence of channel activation (Figures 4A and 4B), enabling us to monitor block with repeated steps to a single voltage at the top of the conductance-voltage relations before and after MTS treatment (Figures 4A and 4B). As shown in Figure 3 (panels B and C), MTSET modification blocked 214C-214C almost completely (similar to block of channels formed by expression of the unlinked 214C), blocked WT-214C and 214C-WT by ∼40%, and did not block WT-WT at all. The two-pore model would predict that the ∼60% residual current in the WT-214C and 214C-WT would flow almost entirely through the WT subunit, because the 214C-subunit would be almost completely blocked by the MTSET. We tested this prediction by following MTSET exposure with exposure to 10 mM guanidinium. The block by 10 mM guanidinium of the residual current following MTSET treatment in the two linked heterodimers, WT-214C and 214C-WT, was 81.0% ± 0.4% (n = 4) and 80.4% ± 1.3% (n = 4), respectively. This degree of guanidinium block is indistinguishable from the guanidinium block of the linked homodimeric WT-WT channel (79.8% ± 0.5%, n = 4) and the channel formed by the unlinked monomeric WT subunit (81.2% ± 2.4%, n = 4), consistent with the idea that the linked heterodimer contains two separate pores: one WT pore and one N214C pore, with the N214C pore being completely blocked by MTSET, thus leaving the residual current to flow through the WT pore, which displays the typical WT block by guanidinium. If the WT and N214C subunits had pores with the same conductance, then the MTSET block of the linked heterodimer would have been 50%. We found that the block was actually ∼40%, suggesting that the N214C subunit's pore has a conductance that is ∼25% smaller than the WT subunit (see Experimental Procedures). We next tested the two-pore model in a way that does not depend on the relative conductances of the WT and N214C pores. If there are two separate pores in the dimer, as suggested above, then the inhibition of WT-214C and 214C-WT is expected to be a fraction of the inhibition of 214C-214C, and this fraction should be the same for all MTS reagents, regardless of their chemical properties and differences in the degree of block that they induce on 214C. Having found that block by MTSET of WT-214C and 214C-WT is ∼40% of the block of 214C-214C, we next tested two other thiol-modifying reagents: guanidinoethyl-guanidinoethanethiosulfonate (GEGETS) and aminocarbonylethyl-methanethysulfonate (MTSACE). GEGETS attaches to the cysteine a group that resembles an arginine side chain, with a positive charge carried by a guanidinium group, while MTSACE attaches an uncharged group that resembles the original asparagine side chain present at position 214 in WT (Figure 2F). We found that 214C-214C was fully blocked by GEGETS and that the inhibition of WT-214C and 214C-WT was 40.7% ± 2.0% (n = 6) and 39.2% ± 2.0% (n = 5), respectively (Figures 3D and 3E), very similar to what was seen for MTSET modification (Figure 3C). On the other hand, MTSACE produced only a partial block of 33% ± 2.1% (n = 5) of the 214C-214C homodimer, and the block of the two heterodimers WT-214C and 214C-WT was 14.5% ± 1.9% (n = 6) and 12.1% ± 2.1% (n = 6), respectively, i.e., once again ∼40% of the block of 214C-214C (Figures 3F and 3G). These findings provide further support for the idea that there are two separate pores in each Hv1 dimer. In a third test of the two-pore model, we considered the following. Because both MTS modification of 214C and intracellular guanidinium block the proton pore, we reasoned that conjugation of an MTS reagent that only partly blocks conduction, such as MTSACE, would alter block by guanidinium in a detectable manner. As shown in Figure 5 (panels B and C), we found that, after MTSACE exposure, 10 mM guanidinium blocked the WT-WT channel by 80%, the same degree of block as seen without MTSACE exposure, i.e., as expected for the unmodified pore. In contrast, following MTSACE treatment, the block by 10 mM guanidinium of homodimeric 214C-214C was only 25%. Whether this lowering of apparent guanidinium affinity by MTSACE modification at 214C reflects interaction with guanidinium in the pore or an allosteric effect of MTSACE conjugation on guanidinium binding (Figure S1), it enabled us to test the two-pore model in the following way. The effect of MTSACE conjugation on guanidinium block for the two-pore model predicts that the residual current through WT-214C and 214C-WT, following modification by MTSACE, would undergo guanidinium block that would be a combination of the 80% block typical of the WT pore and the 25% block that we had demonstrated for the MTSACE-conjugated 214C pore, adjusted for the relative contributions of the two pores to the proton current (see Experimental Procedures). Our results were consistent with there being two pores per dimer, one of which is partially blocked by MTSACE (214C) and therefore has a reduced guanidinium affinity and the other of which (WT) is fully conducting (no MTSACE) and has a normal affinity for guanidinium (Figure 5C). The results were not consistent with the single-pore model in which MTSACE treatment would be expected to change guanidinium block even if only one subunit contains 214C conjugated to MTSACE (Figure S1). In summary, three lines of evidence point to a two-pore construction of the Hv1 dimer, with one pore in each subunit: (1) the high similarity in the degree of block by a variety of distinct MTS reagents of the heterodimeric WT-214C and 214C-WT constructs compared to the block of the 214C-214C homodimer, despite the differences in the steric and electrostatic properties of the MTS reagents, consistent with block of two separate pores and unlikely for additive effects of two MTS reagents binding in a common pore; (2) when MTSET is used, which completely blocks 214C, then further block by guanidinium of WT-214C and 214C-WT follows exactly what would be expected for block of the separate WT pore; and (3) in contrast to (2), when MTSACE is used, which only produces partial block of 214C, then the 214C subunit continues to conduct most of its current, and guanidinium block of WT-214C and 214C-WT follows the predicted combination of normal block of the WT pore and reduced block of the 214C-MTSACE pore, with the degree of block quantitatively matching the prediction for two separate pores. The above findings led us to ask which parts of Hv1 mediate the dimerization. We recently found that the Hv-related VSD-containing protein Ci-VSP (Murata et al., 2005Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Phosphoinositide phosphatase activity coupled to an intrinsic voltage sensor.Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) exists in the membrane as a monomer (Kohout et al., 2008Kohout S.C. Ulbrich M.H. Bell S.C. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit organization and functional transitions in Ci-VSP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, by making chimeric proteins between Hv1 and Ci-VSP, we could identify the region of Hv1 responsible for dimerization. In both oligomeric channels with a single intersubunit pore and in oligomeric channels with multiple pores, interactions between the transmembrane portions of adjacent subunits and interaction between cytoplasmic domains contribute to assembly (Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes.Third edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). We replaced the cytosolic N and/or C termini or the transmembrane domain of Hv1 with the corresponding parts of Ci-VSP, producing four different chimeric proteins: (1) NVSP-Hv, (2) Hv-CVSP, (3) NVSP-Hv-CVSP, and (4) NHv-VSP-CHv (see Experimental Procedures). In a fifth chimera, Hv-CSh, we replaced the C terminus of Hv1 with the C terminus of Shaker. We expressed GFP-tagged versions of these chimeras in oocytes and counted the subunits (Figures 6A and 6B), as done above. After counting the numbers of fluorescent spots with one and two bleaching steps in the chimeric proteins, we compared these observations to the reference two-GFP-containing NMDA receptor (tagged only on NR2B) and the reference one-GFP-tagged Cav2.3 channel. We found that Hv-CVSP and Hv-CSh almost always bleached in a single step, similar to the reference monomer, and that NVSP-Hv dimerized at a lowered efficiency, intermediate between the reference dimer and the reference monomer (Figure 6B). These results suggest that the transmembrane domain plays little or no role in dimerization, while the N and C termini play an important role. To test the idea further, we asked whether the Hv1 N and C termini could make the normally monomeric Ci-VSP into a dimer. Indeed, we found that the NHv-VSP-CHv chimera dimerizes almost as well as does the native Hv1 (Figure 6B). The results indicate that the N and C termini of Hv1 are both necessary and sufficient to induce dimerization. Having found that Hv1 is a dimer and that each subunit contains its own pore, we wondered whether the monomeric chimeras would function. We therefore investigated the function of the NVSP-Hv-CVSP chimera, which contains the Hv1 transmembrane domain but is monomeric because it lacks the Hv1 N and C-terminal dimerization domains (Figure 6B). We found that this monomeric version of the Hv1 VSD functions as a voltage-gated channel (Figures 6C–6E), providing a strong fourth line of evidence that each subunit of Hv1 contains a pore of its own. The kinetics of opening and closing for the monomeric NVSP-Hv-CVSP chimera was found to be faster than the opening and closing kinetics of the WT dimeric channel (Figure 6E). In addition, the G-V of the chimera was ∼30% less steep than the G-V of WT (Table 2 and Figure 6C). Despite these differences between the monomeric NVSP-Hv-CVSP chimeric channel and the WT channel, the finding that one Hv1 subunit on"

Little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly in response to elevated activity. We report that, in hippocampal neurons experiencing heightened activity, the activity-inducible protein kinase Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2, also known as SNK) was required for synaptic scaling-a principal mechanism underlying homeostatic plasticity. Synaptic scaling also required CDK5, which acted as a ""priming"" kinase for the phospho-dependent binding of Plk2 to its substrate SPAR, a postsynaptic RapGAP and scaffolding molecule that is degraded following phosphorylation by Plk2. RNAi knockdown of SPAR weakened synapses, and overexpression of a SPAR mutant resistant to Plk2-dependent degradation prevented synaptic scaling. Thus, priming phosphorylation of the Plk2 binding site in SPAR by CDK5, followed by Plk2 recruitment and SPAR phosphorylation-degradation, constitutes a molecular pathway for neuronal homeostatic plasticity during chronically elevated activity."

Here, we subjected mice that lack olivary coupling to paradigms that require learning-dependent timing. Cx36-deficient mice showed impaired timing of both locomotion and eye-blink responses that were conditioned to a tone. The latencies of their olivary spike activities in response to the unconditioned stimulus were significantly more variable than those in wild-types. Whole-cell recordings of olivary neurons in vivo showed that these differences in spike timing result at least in part from altered interactions with their subthreshold oscillations. These results, combined with analyses of olivary activities in computer simulations at both the cellular and systems level, suggest that electrotonic coupling among olivary neurons by gap junctions is essential for proper timing of their action potentials and thereby for learning-dependent timing in cerebellar motor control."

Here, we demonstrate that Nervous wreck (Nwk), a negative regulator of synaptic growth at Drosophila NMJs, interacts functionally and physically with components of the endocytic machinery, including dynamin and Dap160/intersectin, and negatively regulates retrograde BMP growth signaling through a direct interaction with the BMP receptor, thickveins. Synaptic overgrowth in nwk is sensitive to BMP signaling levels, and loss of Nwk facilitates BMP-induced overgrowth. Conversely, Nwk overexpression suppresses BMP-induced synaptic overgrowth. We observe analogous genetic interactions between dap160 and the BMP pathway, confirming that endocytosis regulates BMP signaling at NMJs. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation between synaptic growth and pMAD levels and show that Nwk regulates these levels.

During progression to metastatic competence, carcinoma cells acquire mesenchymal gene expression patterns and properties through EMT, which results in coordinated alterations in adhesive properties, activation of proteolysis and motility, and competence to metastasize and establish secondary tumors at distant sites (1Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Fibrosis is characterized by an increased number of myofibroblasts that deposit interstitial extracellular matrix. Mounting evidence indicates that a significant fraction of these myofibroblasts arise from the resident epithelial cells via EMT during renal and lung fibrogenesis (2Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin.

Family members of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β are among the most potent inducers of EMT in a variety of physiological and pathological contexts (7Zavadil J. Bottinger E.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The aberrant expression of TGF-β1 is well documented in the tumor microenvironment and fibrotic lesions where TGF-β1 is widely believed to promote tumor progression and tissue fibrosis (7Zavadil J. Bottinger E.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have elegantly demonstrated EMT of lung alveolar epithelial cells in biopsies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in experimental pulmonary fibrosis (4Kim K.K.

A host of evidence indicates an essential role for SMAD3 in the expression of a panel of EMT-related genes upon translocation into the nucleus (9Roberts A.B. Tian F. Byfield S.D. Stuelten C.

The molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β1-induced EMT are not completely understood and are under intensive investigation. HDAC and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) regulate acetylation of lysine residues, which has emerged as a key component of the cellular signaling network that coordinates fundamental cellular processes. Eighteen human HDACs have been identified to date and are divided into four classes. HDAC6 belongs to class II and distinguishes itself from other family members in that it contains two HDAC domains and a ubiquitin-binding motif, the BUZ finger, at its C terminus (10Seigneurin-Berny D.

HDAC6 deacetylates α-tubulin via a process that requires its second HDAC domain and results in an increase in cell motility (13Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M.

Moreover, HDAC6 deacetylates heat shock protein 90, which is essential for heat shock protein 90-mediated maturation of the glucocorticoid receptor (18Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J. Gaillard S. Zhao X.

A recent study has demonstrated up-regulation of HDAC6 expression by estrogen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and further suggests that HDAC6 mediates an estrogen-induced increase in cell motility (20Saji S.

The exact role for HDAC6 in tumor progression, however, remains unclear. The current study investigated a role of HDAC6 in TGF-β1-induced EMT. We showed that TGF-β1 induced HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin in human lung epithelial cells, which was concurrent with the expression of EMT markers. Inhibition of HDAC6 attenuated the TGF-β1-induced expression of EMT markers as well as activation of SMAD3. In addition, inhibition of SMAD3 activation abrogated HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin and the expression of EMT markers induced by TGF-β1. Reagents and Plasmids—Tubacin, an HDAC6-selective inhibitor, and the inactive structural homologue niltubacin were kindly provided by Dr. S. L. Schreiber at Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (14Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Culture—A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line with features of type II alveolar epithelium, was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A549 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h prior to exposure to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml or the indicated doses) for the indicated durations. To inhibit SMAD3 or HDAC6, A549 cells were pretreated with SIS3 (5 μm for 1 h) or tubacin (5 μm for 6 h), followed by exposure to TGF-β1. A549 variants with intact HDAC6 expression (pS) or reduced HDAC6 expression by RNA interference (KD) were generated using retroviral siRNA expression vectors as previously described (15Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Primary human lung arterial endothelial cells and fibroblasts were purchased from Cambrex Bio-products (Walkersville, MD). The primary cultures were maintained for experiments until passage 6 per the provider's instructions. Immunoblots—Total cellular proteins were extracted from the treated cells using 1× Laemmli buffer. An equal amount of total protein from each sample was separated using precast Nupage gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted for the proteins of interest as previously described (24Shan B. Xu J. Zhuo Y. Morris C.A. Morris G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44009-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblots: rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for HDAC6 (H-300) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) used at 1:500; rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for E-cadherin (CS-4065), phosphorylated SMAD2 (CS-3101), phosphorylated SMAD3 (CS-9514), SMAD3 (CS-9513), and α-tubulin (CS-2144) from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) used at 1:1,000; mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for vimentin (V9) used at 1:500; acetylated α-tubulin (6-11B-1) used at 1:4,000 from Sigma. The secondary antibodies (IRDye800- or IRDye700-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used at a dilution of 1:15,000 and detected using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences). The ratios of the proteins of interest over the loading control α-tubulin were determined by densitometry using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and a -fold change of each protein upon treatment was obtained by setting the values from the control groups to 1. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were isolated from A549 cells exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 1 h as previously described (25Shan B. Morris G.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An equal amount of total protein was loaded for immunoblots. Immunofluorescence—The formation of stress fibers was visualized using Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Briefly, A549 cells were cultured in 8-well chamber slides and exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 48 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, followed by incubation with phalloidin. The digital images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope along with the accompanying program IPLab, version 3.6.5 (Nikon). Immunofluorescence was carried out to examine the distribution of SMAD3 (antibody at 1:50 dilution) and acetylated α-tubulin (antibody at 1:500 dilution) using the appropriate primary antibodies on A549 cells exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml). Alexa 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (at 1:1500 dilution) were used to visualize SMAD3 and acetylated α-tubulin, respectively. The nucleus was stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium VectorShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The subcellular distribution of SMAD3 and acetylated α-tubulin was analyzed using a Leica DMRXA deconvolution microscope (Morphology and Imaging Core of the Gene Therapy Program at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center). The morphological changes of A549 cells upon exposure to TGF-β1 were assessed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—A549 cells and its variants were transfected with either the reporter constructs or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as previously described (26Shan B. Zhuo Y. Chin D. Morris C.A. Morris G.F. Lasky J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1103-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The siRNAs targeting human HDAC6 (HDAC6si, ID number 120450; Ambion, Austin, TX) or SMAD3 (pRS-SMAD3) or the negative control siRNA (CTLsi or pRS-Vec) were transfected to knock down HDAC6 or SMAD3 expression. For luciferase reporter assays, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h, followed by exposure to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 24 h. The treated cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as per the provider's instructions. Variation in transfection efficiency was monitored and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity from the co-transfected pRL-TK. A -fold change of normalized luciferase activity was obtained by setting the values from the untreated cells to 1. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine mRNA levels of genes of interest in A549, and its variants that were subjected to the indicated treatments as previously described (26Shan B.

The primers used were as follows: human 36B4 (NM_001002), forward primer (positions 97-116; 5′-CGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 205 to 188; 5′-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG-3′); human HDAC6 (NM_006044), forward primer (positions 1415-1433; 5′-CAACTGAGACCGTGGAGAG-3′) and reverse primer (positions 1538 to 1521; 5′-CCTGTGCGAGACTGTAGC-3′; human E-cadherin (NM_004360), forward primer (positions 2288-2308; 5′-ATTCTGATTCTGCTGCTCTTG-3′) and reverse primer (positions 2423 to 2405; 5′-AGTCCTGGTCCTCTTCTCC-3′); human vimentin (NM_003380), forward primer (positions 364-384; 5′-GCAGGACTCGGTGGACTTCTC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 472 to 452; 5′-GTTGGCGAAGCGGTCATTCAG-3′); human PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type I) (NM_000602), forward primer (positions 629-647; 5′-GGCTGGTGCTGGTGAATGC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 732 to 712; 5′-AGTGCTGCCGTCTGATTTGTG-3′); human collagen type I-α1 (NM_000088), forward primer (positions 5172-5190; 5′-CGGAGGAGAGTCAGGAAGG-3′) and reverse primer (positions 5285 to 5264; 5′-CACAAGGAACAGAACAGAACAG-3′); human PDGF-B (NM_033016), forward primer (positions 719-740; 5′-ACAAGACGGCACTGAAGGAGAC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 862 to 841; 5′-GAGACAGACGGACGAGGGAAAC-3′); mouse PDGF-B (NM_011057), forward primer (positions 901-918; 5′-GAAATGCTGAGCGACCAC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 1036 to 1018; 5′-AGCTTTCCAACTCGACTCC-3′); mouse TIMP1 (NM_011593), forward primer (positions 182-201; 5′-ATCTCTGGCATCTGGCATCC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 347 to 327; 5′-ACGCTGGTATAAGGTGGTCTC-3′); mouse CTGF (NM_010217), forward primer (positions 548-565; 5′-GCAGCGGTGAGTCCTTCC-3′) and reverse primer (positions 779 to 758; 5′-AATGTGTCTTCCAGTCGGTAGG-3′). The -fold change of the expression of each gene was obtained by correction with the housekeeping gene 36B4 and by setting the values from the untreated cells to 1. An RT2 Profiler PCR array for human TGF-β and the BMP signaling pathway was carried out on the RNA samples collected from pS and KD cells as per the provider's instructions (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD). Statistical Analyses—The results that were obtained from three independent experiments were presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical evaluation was performed between individual treatment groups by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, version 3). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. HDAC6-dependent Deacetylation of α-Tubulin during TGF- β1-mediated EMT—To investigate the role of HDAC6 in EMT, we employed A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line that has been demonstrated to undergo EMT upon exposure to TGF-β1 (27Kasai H. Allen J.T. Mason R.M. Kamimura T. Zhang Z. Respir. Res. 2005; 6: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). First, we examined the expression of EMT markers in the cells stimulated with TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) through 48 h. TGF-β1 substantially reduced the protein levels of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker (Fig. 1A) and ablated the membrane expression of E-cadherin as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (data not shown). In contrast, TGF-β1 induced a significant increase in vimentin, a mesenchymal cell marker (Fig. 1A). Equal loading of each sample was confirmed by immunoblots for α-tubulin (Fig. 2A). TGF-β1 induced transient phosphorylation of SMAD2 with a peak occurring at 1 h postexposure, which indicated activation of the canonical SMAD pathway (Fig. 1A). Moreover, TGF-β1 stimulated A549 cells to lose their typical epithelial cell morphology and to become scattered and spindle-like, thus resembling mesenchymal cell morphology (Fig. 1B; see arrow). Visualization of filamentous actin revealed the TGF-β1-induced formation of stress fibers, which are typically rich in the cells of mesenchymal lineage (Fig. 1D). These results validated A549 as an experimental system to examine the role of HDAC6 in EMT.FIGURE 2HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin induced by TGF- β1. A, serum-starved A549 cells were exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for the indicated durations, and protein levels of α-tubulin and acetylated α-tubulin were examined by immunoblots at 48 h after exposure. B, serum-starved A549 cells were exposed to increasing doses of TGF-β1 for 48 h, and protein levels of α-tubulin and acetylated α-tubulin were examined as in A. C, culture conditions were similar to those in A, except that the protein levels of α-SMA, α-tubulin, and acetylated α-tubulin were examined in the primary cultures of human lung fibroblasts and arterial endothelial cells exposed to TGF-β1 (3 ng/ml) for 48 h. D, serum-starved A549 cells were exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) with either tubacin or niltubacin (5 μm) for 48 h. The protein levels of α-tubulin and acetylated α-tubulin were examined as in A. E, serum-starved A549 cell variants were exposed to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 48 h, and the protein levels ofα-tubulin, acetylatedα-tubulin, and HDAC6 were examined as in A. α-Tubulin-ac, acetylated α-tubulin. HPAEC, human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. HLF, human lung fibroblasts. T and N, tubacin and niltubacin, respectively. KD, A549 cells that express HDAC6-targeting siRNA. pS, control A549 cells. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also measured the levels of acetylated α-tubulin (Fig. 2A), a well established substrate of HDAC6 (13Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). The expression of acetylated α-tubulin declined as early as 24 h after exposure to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) and was reduced to 46 ± 4% of the base line by 48 h (Fig. 2A, average and S.D. values from three independent experiments; p < 0.01). The reduction persisted through 72 h (data not shown). Moreover, acetylated α-tubulin declined in a dose-dependent manner following treatments with increasing doses of TGF-β1 (0-5 ng/ml) for 48 h (Fig. 2B). We further examined the levels of acetylated α-tubulin in primary cultures of human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β1 (3 ng/ml) for 48 h. Both cell types exhibited a robust induction of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 2C), and disparate responses of acetylated α-tubulin were observed in these two cell types exposed to TGF-β1. Similar to A549 cells, the endothelial cells exhibited a 50% reduction in acetylated α-tubulin in response to TGF-β1, whereas the fibroblasts displayed little change in the levels of acetylated α-tubulin (Fig. 2C; average from two independent experiments). To test whether deacetylation of α-tubulin was dependent upon HDAC6, tubacin, a small molecule inhibitor of HDAC6 (14Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), was utilized to inhibit HDAC6 activity. Tubacin (5 μm) elevated the expression of acetylated α-tubulin to 1.7-fold over the base line in the absence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 2D; average from two independent experiments). More importantly, tubacin restored the levels of acetylated α-tubulin to 94% of the base line in the presence of TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) (Fig. 2D). In contrast, niltubacin, an inactive structural homologue to tubacin, exhibited little effect on the levels of acetylated α-tubulin (Fig. 2D). To further confirm the HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin, an A549 variant that stably expresses HDAC6-targeting siRNA (KD) and the matching control (pS) were exposed to TGF-β1 (1 and 2.5 ng/ml) for 48 h. Quantitative RT-PCR for HDAC6 revealed a more than 70% reduction in HDAC6 transcript regardless of the presence of TGF-β1 in KD but not pS cells (data not shown). Immunoblots for HDAC6 confirmed siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC6 (Fig. 2E). When compared with pS cells, KD cells exhibited higher basal levels of acetylated α-tubulin, 1.2-fold over the base line, and restored acetylated α-tubulin to 97% of the base line in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 2E; average from two independent experiments). Similar profiles of acetylated α-tubulin were observed when the cells were transiently transfected with HDAC6-targeting siRNA (data not shown). In contrast to HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin in response to TGF-β1, TGF-β1 did not alter the expression of HDAC6 at either the mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 2E) (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin during TGF-β1-induced EMT. Requirement of HDAC6 for the Expression of EMT Markers—Our findings described above indicated up-regulated activity of HDAC6 in conjunction with TGF-β1-induced expression of EMT markers, which implicated a role of HDAC6 in EMT. Therefore, we examined the expression of EMT markers in the same cell lysates that exhibited HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of α-tubulin (Fig. 2E). Expression of HDAC6 targeting siRNA in KD cells attenuated the expression of EMT markers induced by TGF-β1, as evidenced by 1) restored expression of E-cadherin, up to 81% of the base line versus a decrease to 18% of the base line by TGF-β1 in pS cells, 2) diminished induction of vimentin to a 3 ± 1.8-fold increase over the base line versus a 6.8-fold increase over the base line by TGF-β1 (Fig. 3A; average from two independent experiments). Equal loading of total protein was verified by immunoblots for α-tubulin, as illustrated in Fig. 2E. Consistently, KD cells exhibited reduced alteration of E-cadherin and vimentin transcripts in response to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) when compared with that of pS cells. Repressed expression of E-cadherin mRNA by TGF-β1 was partially rescued in KD cells as demonstrated by a 30 ± 5% reduction in KD cells versus an 85 ± 22% reduction in pS cells (Fig. 3B, average and S.D. from three independent experiments, p < 0.05). Activated expression of vimentin mRNA by TGF-β1 was substantially inhibited in KD cells as illustrated by a 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase in KD cells versus a 3.2 ± 0.2-fold increase in pS cells (Fig. 3B, average and S.D. from three independent experiments, p < 0.01). Two other HDAC6-inhibitory approaches were undertaken to confirm the requirement of HDAC6 for the maximal expression of EMT markers. First, the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubacin (5 μm) was employed. Tubacin, but not niltubacin, restored the expression of E-cadherin with a modest 24% reduction in the mRNA levels of E-cadherin by TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml), whereas TGF-β1 repressed the expression of E-cadherin to a 71% reduction in the absence of tubacin (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, TGF-β1-induced expression of vimentin was significantly inhibited by tubacin from a 3.4-fold increase in the absence of tubacin down to a 2.2-fold increase in the presence of tubacin (Fig. 3C). Consistently, tubacin restored the protein levels of E-cadherin in the presence of TGF-β1 to 83% of the base line in contrast to a reduction to 15-20% of the base line in the TGF-β1 with or without niltubacin groups (Fig. 3D; average from two independent experiments). On the other hand, induction of vimentin was substantially reduced to a 2.9-fold increase by tubacin versus a 6-7-fold increase over the base line by TGF-β1 with or without niltubacin. Second, transient transfection of a second pair of HDAC6-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (30 nm), but not the control siRNA, efficiently compromised TGF-β1-altered expression of E-cadherin and vimentin at the mRNA levels (Fig. 3E). In addition, we examined the role of HDAC6 in the expression of another hallmark feature of EMT, the formation of stress fibers. KD cells exhibited little formation of stress fibers after exposure to TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) as compared with the robust induction of stress fibers in pS cells (Fig. 3F). In concert, these results demonstrate a requirement of HDAC6 for the maximal expression of a panel of EMT markers induced by TGF-β1. We expanded our analyses to the expression of a broad range of genes that are regulated by TGF-β1 using a targeted RT2 Profiler PCR array for human TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways.

Of perhaps any canyon studied, Box Canyon, Idaho, most strongly meets the proposed morphologic criteria for groundwater sapping because it is incised into a basaltic plain with no drainage network upstream, and approximately 10 cubic meters per second of seepage emanates from its vertical headwall. However, sediment transport constraints, 4 He and 14 C dates, plunge pools, and scoured rock indicate that a megaflood (greater than 220 cubic meters per second) carved the canyon about 45,000 years ago. These results add to a growing recognition of Quaternary catastrophic flooding in the American northwest, and may imply that similar features on Mars also formed by floods rather than seepage erosion."

A major advantage of the rat as a model of sexual differentiation is that treatment of neonatal females with estradiol will permanently induce the male phenotype. During the development of other systems, exuberant innervation is followed by activity-dependent pruning necessary for elimination of spurious synapses. In contrast, we demonstrate that estradiol-induced organization in the hypothalamus involves the induction of new synapses on dendritic spines. Activation of estrogen receptors by estradiol triggers a nongenomic activation of PI3 kinase that results in enhanced glutamate release from presynaptic neurons. Subsequent activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors activates MAP kinases, thereby inducing dendritic spine formation. These results reveal a transneuronal mechanism by which estradiol acts during a sensitive period to establish a profound and lasting sex difference in hypothalamic synaptic patterning.

Determining the mechanisms underlying the formation of functional neuronal circuits is central to understanding brain development. Variation in neuronal activity, hormonal milieu, or environmental cues can permanently change the formation of specific circuits and the phenotype of individual neurons during a developmental sensitive period. This concept is well established in the visual cortex (Desai et al., 2002Desai N.S. Cudmore R.H. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G.

Appropriate synaptic connections must also be achieved in male and female brains wherein fundamental neuronal differences mediate the well-known sex differences in physiology and behavior. In rodents, these sex differences are determined during a critical period of development by estradiol, which is aromatized from testicular androgens in the male (Naftolin et al., 1971Naftolin F.

Early estradiol exposure permanently differentiates the male from the female rodent brain by establishing sex differences in synaptic connections and neuronal morphology that affect behavior (De Vries and Simerly, 2002De Vries G.J.

In newborn rats, males have twice the number of dendritic spines on hypothalamic neurons as females, and treatment of females at birth with testosterone, which is centrally aromatized to estradiol in the brain, increases the number of dendritic spines to that of males (Todd et al., 2007Todd B.J. Schwarz J.M. Mong J.A. McCarthy M.M. Glutamate AMPA/Kainate receptors, not GABAA receptors, mediate estradiol-induced sex differences in the hypothalamus.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism or mechanisms by which estradiol permanently organizes a sex difference in dendritic spines in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) remain unknown. The classic model of estradiol action involves ligand binding to a nuclear receptor, dimerization and recruitment of coactivators, and initiation of gene transcription at estrogen response elements (ERE) found in the promoter region of estrogen-responsive genes. Estrogen receptors (ER) are members of a superfamily of nuclear transcription factors that regulate gene expression (Beato, 1989Beato M.

Activated ER can also indirectly promote gene transcription independent of EREs via activation of kinases that in turn activate specific promoter elements.

Estrogen levels regulate the subcellular distribution of phosphorylated Akt in hippocampal CA1 dendrites.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2340-2347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ER activation can be localized to the membrane, yet induce a host of effects that induce or facilitate transcriptional activity dependent on or independent of the ERE (Vasudevan and Pfaff, 2007Vasudevan N. Pfaff D.W. Membrane-initiated actions of estrogens in neuroendocrinology: emerging principles.Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To date, membrane-initiated effects of estradiol have not been reported in the developing brain, and in fact would seem unlikely given that rapid membrane effects are presumed to be not conducive to permanent organizational changes. We now report that estradiol promotes spine formation in the developing hypothalamus via rapid, nongenomic activation of PI3 kinase in presynaptic neurons, enhancing glutamate release and glutamate receptor activation in postsynaptic neurons. AMPA- and NMDA-receptor-dependent activation of postsynaptic MAP kinases then triggers a protein synthesis-dependent increase in dendritic spine number. On the day of birth, males had significantly more dendritic spines on Golgi-Cox impregnated hypothalamic neurons than females (main effect F3,19 = 8.80, p = 0.0007, post hoc p = 0.001; Figure 1A). Treatment of females with estradiol or NMDA for 6 hr significantly increased the number of spines compared with that of vehicle-treated females (p = 0.001) to levels equivalent with those seen on male neurons. Further analysis of the Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons revealed that the increase in spine number was accompanied by an elongation of neuronal dendrites of 34% (F3,19 = 3.47, p = 0.036; Figure 1A). There was no difference in the density of dendritic spines (data not shown). Newborn males also had significantly more spinophilin protein in the MBH than females, as determined by western blot analysis, confirming the previously reported correlation between increased dendritic spine number and increased spinophilin levels (Amateau and McCarthy, 2002aAmateau S.K.

Glutamate AMPA/Kainate receptors, not GABAA receptors, mediate estradiol-induced sex differences in the hypothalamus.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of females with estradiol (250 μg) increased spinophilin levels to those of males within 6 hr (F2, 15 = 15.8, p = 0.002; Figure 1B). To determine whether the effect of estradiol on dendritic spines at 6 hr was maintained at later time points, brains were also collected from animals 48 hr after a single injection of estradiol. Spinophilin levels remained significantly elevated 48 hr after estradiol treatment compared with those of control (F3,20 = 4.09, p = 0.031; Figure 1C) and were not different from 6 hr of estradiol exposure (p = 0.901), confirming that estradiol-induced dendritic spines are maintained for an extended period of time. The MBH is thus sexually dimorphic at birth with regard to spinophilin level and spine number, and the levels seen in males can be induced in females by treatment with estradiol or activation of NMDA receptors. We hypothesized that activation of glutamate receptors is necessary for the estradiol-induced increase in dendritic spine number in the developing hypothalamus. We first treated animals with the AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist NBQX (2.5 μg subcutaneously [s.c.]) prior to estradiol treatment; NBQX prevented the estradiol-induced increase in spinophilin (F3,17 = 7.04, p = 0.002; Figure 2A). Treatment with NBQX alone had no effect. To determine if NMDA receptors are also required for estradiol-induced spinophilin, animals were pretreated with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (10 μg s.c.) prior to estradiol treatment. MK801 completely blocked the estradiol-induced increase in spinophilin (F3,13 = 13.29, p = 0.0003; Figure 2A). Treatment with MK801 alone had no effect on spinophilin levels. These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation is necessary for estradiol to induce dendritic spines. The ability of NMDA treatment in vivo to increase dendritic spines detected by Golgi impregnation suggested that NMDA glutamate receptor activation is sufficient as well. We further confirmed this by treatment of female pups on the day of birth with estradiol, NMDA (10 μg s.c.), or vehicle. Direct activation of NMDA receptors mimicked the effect of estradiol on spinophilin levels (F2,20 = 7.70, p = 0.002; Figure 2B). These data confirm the NMDA-mediated increase in dendritic spines seen using Golgi impregnation of VMN neurons (Figure 1A) and are consistent with previous reports indicating that activation of AMPA receptors also increases dendritic spines in the developing female hypothalamus to the same degree as estradiol (Todd et al., 2007Todd B.J. Schwarz J.M. Mong J.A. McCarthy M.M. Glutamate AMPA/Kainate receptors, not GABAA receptors, mediate estradiol-induced sex differences in the hypothalamus.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We conclude that estradiol does not induce increases in spinophilin protein directly, but rather does so indirectly in a glutamate-receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, activation of glutamate receptors is not only necessary but also sufficient to induce sex differences in dendritic spine number in the developing hypothalamus. The pivotal observations from the previous experiments suggest that activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors is required for estradiol-induced increases in dendritic spine number. There are two potential mechanisms by which this could occur: (1) estradiol might alter the number or function of postsynaptic AMPA and/or NMDA receptors, or (2) estradiol might act presynaptically to promote glutamate release directly from hypothalamic neurons. To test the first hypothesis, male and female hypothalami were assessed by quantitative western blot for levels of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 and the requisite NMDA subunit, NR1. There was no sex difference in, and no effect of estradiol treatment on, the amount of GluR1 (F2,18 = 0.378, p = 0.690), GluR2 (F2,16 = 0.488, p = 0.623), or NR1 (F2,14 = 0.788, p = 0.474) in the neonatal MBH (Figure S1A, available online). In another experiment females were treated with or without estradiol (100 μg/0.1 ml sesame oil, s.c.) on postnatal day 0 (PN0), 1, and 2. Slices were made from the hypothalamus of these animals on PN4–5, and AMPA-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded from ventrolateral VMN (vlVMN) neurons. Estradiol-induced dendritic spines are fully established at this age (Matsumoto and Arai, 1986aMatsumoto A. Arai Y. Development of sexual dimorphism in synaptic organization in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus in rats.Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 68: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). We found no significant effect of estradiol on the median amplitude (t16 = −0.87, p = 0.238), frequency (t16 = −1.22, p = 0.396), or decay time (t16 = −0.57, p = 0.572) of mEPSCs in the developing hypothalamus (n = 8–10 cells from vehicle-treated or estradiol-treated animals; Figure 3A). We conclude that estradiol has no effect on the number of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors in these neurons. We also found no effect on the computed ratio of synaptic AMPA-to-NMDA receptors, seen by measuring the peak amplitude of EPSCs mediated by AMPA receptors and the amplitude of the NMDA-receptor-mediated component of the EPSC (p = 0.8, n = 7 cells from each; (Figure 4A). Estradiol also had no effect on glutamate-induced calcium responses in cultured hypothalamic neurons, as measured with the fluorescent ratiometric calcium-sensitive dye fura-2. We found no difference in either the number of neurons that responded to glutamate (χ2 = 1.65, p = 0.200) or the peak amplitude of the calcium response to glutamate (K-S test: χ2 = 2.12, p = 0.697, Figure S1B).Figure 4Estradiol Enhances Glutamate Release from Hypothalamic NeuronsShow full caption(A) Representative EPSCs evoked from neurons treated with or without estradiol (E2).

(B) In the same neurons, EPSCs elicited with pairs of stimuli (interstimulus interval = 50 ms, holding potential = −80 mV) indicated that estradiol pretreatment significantly decreased the paired-pulse ratio (amplitude of second EPSC divided by amplitude of first EPSC), consistent with an increase in the probability of glutamate release after estradiol treatment (t21 = −2.72; ∗p < 0.05 compared with vehicle). Graphical representation of electrophysiological analysis indicates the mean ± SEM for each treatment group. Recorded neurons were filled with biocytin from a patch pipette and their morphology was analyzed. Consistent with the morphological analysis of Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons (Figure 1A), neurons treated with estradiol had more dendritic spines along the primary dendrite compared with those of control (t7 = 2.67, p = 0.031), and the overall length of the dendrite was greater (t7 = 2.41, p = 0.060; Figure 3B). There was no effect of estradiol on the number of branches per dendrite or the dendritic spine density (data not shown). Concluding that estradiol does not affect glutamatergic transmission postsynaptically, we hypothesized that estradiol promotes presynaptic glutamate release to increase dendritic spines. To test this hypothesis, we measured whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to compare the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) in brain slices from female pups treated with or without estradiol for up to 6 hr on PN2. The PPR is inversely correlated with release probability (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSC elicited in response to the second of two stimuli delivered at an interstimulus interval of 50 ms was considerably facilitated compared with the first EPSC in cells in vehicle-treated slices (PPR = 1.85 ± 0.21, n = 11). In cells from estradiol-treated slices, the amplitude of the second EPSC was also facilitated, but to a significantly smaller extent (PPR = 1.22 ± 0.09, n = 12) (t21 = −2.72, p = 0.0127; Figure 4A). The decrease in the PPR in the estradiol-treated slices is consistent with an estradiol-induced increase in the probability of release at glutamatergic synapses. We next used the fluorescent styryl dye FM4-64 to assay the effects of estradiol on release probability more directly. Presynaptic boutons were labeled with FM4-64 and the probability of transmitter release was assayed by the rate of FM4-64 destaining in response to either KCl-induced depolarization or electrical field stimulation (Brager et al., 2003Brager D.H.

Post hoc analysis of hypothalamic neurons revealed 100% colocalization of FM4-64 staining and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) immunostaining, indicating the terminals analyzed for transmitter release were glutamatergic (vehicle: n = 32 boutons; estradiol: n = 36 boutons from two separate cultures; Figure 5A). Treatment of hypothalamic neurons with estradiol for only 3 hr significantly increased the total fluorescence lost after 30 s of depolarization with either 50 mM KCl or stimulation at 1 Hz via an electrode positioned near the imaged region, compared with untreated cultures (F3,16 = 3.94, p = 0.027; Figure 5B). After 120 s of depolarization, the total fluorescence lost for all groups was not significantly different (p = 0.223), indicating that the size of the recycling vesicle pool was not affected by estradiol. Treatment with the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (i.e. ICI) alone had no effect on the rate of destaining (p = 0.239; Figure 5C) but completely prevented estradiol-induced enhancement of FM4-64 destaining (F3,7 = 6.29, p = 0.032), indicating that estradiol-enhanced glutamate release requires activation of the ER. There was no effect of estradiol treatment on the density of FM4-64-labeled boutons (F3,25 = 0.86, p = 0.470) or the area of these boutons (F3,25 = 0.26, p = 0.850) compared to that of controls (Figure S3). When analyzed separately, neurons treated with estradiol for less than 2 hr showed an increase in neurotransmitter release when compared with those that underwent vehicle treatment for the same amount of time (p = 0.05; Figure 5C inset), demonstrating that estradiol rapidly enhances the release of glutamate from developing hypothalamic neurons via activation of classical ER. Notably, the increase in release probability within 2 hr precedes the increase in the number of dendritic spines, first detectable at 6 hr, and the activation of MAP kinase (see below), which is not detectable until 3 hr post-estradiol. The rapid effect of estradiol on glutamate release from hypothalamic neurons suggested a nongenomic mechanism of action. Using 30 μM cycloheximide (CHX) to block RNA translation, we tested whether estradiol-enhanced neurotransmission required synthesis of new proteins. Blocking protein synthesis had no effect on estradiol-enhanced FM4-64 destaining in cultured hypothalamic neurons after 3 hr (F3,24 = 3.66, p = 0.67; vehicle: n = 8, E2: n = 8, CHX + E2: n = 8, CHX: n = 4 coverslips); however, CHX treatment did block the estradiol-induced increase in spinophilin protein (F3,18 = 3.17, p = 0.0498; vehicle: n = 6, E2: n = 6, CHX + E2: n = 6, CHX: n = 4 coverslips; Figure 6A), confirming effective inhibition of protein synthesis and a requirement for protein synthesis in the promotion of spine formation. We conclude that estradiol can enhance neurotransmitter release by activating ER; however, the enhancement does not require the synthesis of new proteins. A time course analysis of phosphorylation of the PI3 kinase substrate Akt at ser473, using western blot, indicated that estradiol rapidly activated PI3 kinase within only 1 hr (F5,21 = 3.89, p = 0.048; Figure 6B), and that this activation was maintained at 3 hr and 6 hr after estradiol treatment (p = 0.038 and p = 0.0247, respectively; n = 4–5 coverslips for each group). The activation of PI3 kinase by estradiol therefore just precedes the enhancement of glutamate release, which occurs at 2–3 hr after treatment, suggesting that it may underlie the increase in release probability. We tested this hypothesis by blocking PI3 kinase activation with the specific inhibitor LY294002 (10 μM) and found that it completely prevented estradiol-enhanced neurotransmitter release (F3.22 = 3.91, p = 0.023; vehicle: n = 7, E2: n = 7, LY + E2; n = 8, LY: n = 4 coverslips; Figure 6B). If enhanced glutamate release via estradiol-induced activation of PI3 kinase is necessary for increasing dendritic spine number, then blocking estradiol-enhanced glutamate release with LY294002 would also block the ability of estradiol to increase dendritic spines in these neurons.

A pharmacological hallmark of these channels is their distinct sensitivity to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Here we report that Orai3 currents can be robustly stimulated by 75 μm 2-APB independent of Stim1, whereas 2-APB at similar concentrations inhibited store-operated Orai1 currents. 2-APB did not only promote currents through Orai3 channels but also dramatically altered ion selectivity of Orai3 channels.

An Orai3-R66W mutant, which lacked in analogy to the severe combined immune deficiency mutant Orai1-R91W store-operated activation, was also found to be resistant to 2-APB stimulation.

A major mechanism for many cell types to maintain long-lasting elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is the use of store-operated Ca2+ influx (1Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Initiated by the second messenger inositol 3-phosphate, Ca2+ is released from the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, Stim1 located in the endoplasmic reticulum senses via a luminal EF-hand the Ca2+ content and redistrib utes after store-depletion to dynamically couple and activate the Orai1 channel, also named CRACM1 (2Muik M.

Although Orai1 and Stim1 coexpressing cells were stimulated by low concentrations of 2-APB, high concentrations (50 μm) completely inhibited Orai1 and partially suppressed Orai2 currents when coexpressed with Stim1 (6Lis A.

In contrast, coexpression of Orai1 and Stim2 resulted in robust stimulation by 2-APB (50 μm), exhibiting a typical inward-rectifying current-voltage relationship of Orai1 (10Parvez S. Beck A.

It is proposed that 2-APB displaces the inhibitory calmodulin from the Stim2·Orai1 complex (10Parvez S. Beck A. Peinelt C. Soboloff J. Lis A. Monteilh-Zoller M. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Penner R.

Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 794-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this study that 2-APB stimulates Orai3 currents and concomitantly changes the selectivity of the channel via an increase in the minimal dimension of the pore size, independent of Stim1. Molecular Cloning and Mutagenesis—Human Orai1 (Orai1; accession number NM_032790) was kindly provided by A. Rao, Harvard Medical School and human Orai3 (Orai3; accession number NM_152288) was kindly provided by L. Birnbaumer, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health. For fluorescence labeling of Orai1 at its N terminus the construct was cloned into the pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) expression vector via its SalI and SmaI restriction sites. Orai3 was cloned into the pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) expression vector via its BamHI and XbaI restriction sites also for N-terminal labeling. For the generation of the R66W mutant pEYFP-C1 Orai3 was used as a template. Suitable primers exchanged the corresponding codon from CGC to TGG (R66W) using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pEYFP-C1 Orai3 was also used as template for the generation of the E165D and E165Q mutants. For the E81D mutant pECFP-C1 Orai3 was used as template. Suitable primers exchanged the corresponding codon from GAA to GAT (E81D and E165D) or from GAA to CAA (E165Q). All point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Human Stim1 (Stim1; accession number NM_003156) N-terminal CFP-tagged was kindly provided by T. Meyer, Stanford University. Transfection Procedure—The cells were transferred every 3–4 days and typically used for 12–14 passages. Transient transfection was carried out with 6 μl of Transpass (New England Biolabs) with 2 μg of DNA of CFP- or YFP-tagged Stim1 or 400 nm validated siRNA against human Stim1 (purchased from Ambion) and/or 3 μg of DNA of CFP- or YFP-tagged Orai3 or YFP-Orai3 pore mutants. Transfected cells were identified directly via YFP/CFP-tagged proteins. Measurements were carried out about 24 h following transfection. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 21–25 °C, using the patch clamp technique in whole cell recording configurations. An Ag/AgCl electrode in combination with a 3 m KCl-filled agar bridge was used as reference electrode. For Stim1- and Orai1/Orai3-mediated currents voltage ramps were applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV, covering a range of -90 to 90 mV over 1 s. The internal pipette solution designed for passive store depletion of Orai-derived currents contained (in mm): 145 Cs methane sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 3.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.2. Standard extracellular solution consisted of 145 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 10 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Divalent free solution included 150 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 10 EDTA. Where indicated, 150 NaCl was substituted by 150 CsCl, methylamine HCl, dimethylamine HCl, or trimethylamine HCl. Applied potentials were corrected for a liquid junction of +12 mV resulting from a Cl--based bath solution and a sulfonate-based pipette solution. All substances were purchased from Sigma. 2-APB Stimulates Orai3 Independent of Stim1—Coexpression of human YFP-Orai3 and CFP-Stim1 in HEK cells yielded activation of inwardly rectifying currents following passive store depletion with 10 mm EGTA in the pipette and a 10 mm Ca2+ containing bath solution (Fig. 1A). Voltage ramps depict a highly positive reversal potential of >50 mV for store-operated Orai3 currents (Fig. 1C). Application of 2-APB (75 μm) stimulated Orai3 inward currents ∼7-fold and was accompanied by a profound change in current-voltage relationships (Fig. 1D). In contrast to inwardly rectifying store-operated Orai3 currents induced by store depletion, currents observed following perfusion with 2-APB (75 μm) displayed a double rectifying current-voltage relationship with a pronounced outward current component (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the selectivity is changed. Overexpression of Orai3 without Stim1, as expected, failed to generate a store-operated conductance. Nevertheless, 75 μm 2-APB induced Orai3 currents to a similar extent as in the presence of Stim1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, Orai3 current stimulation by 2-APB (75 μm) was similarly obtained when endogenous Stim1 expression was inhibited by siRNA against Stim1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Effectiveness of Stim1-siRNAI has been verified by clear suppression of YFP-tagged STIM1 (2Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R. Kahr H. Madl J. Gruber H. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 282: 8014-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). All 2-APB evoked Orai3 currents exhibited comparable maximal current densities (Fig. 1B), similar current-voltage relationships (Fig. 1D), and reversal potentials (Stim1 + Orai3 coexpression, Vrev = +3.2 ± 1.0 mV; Orai3, Vrev =+3.3 ± 0.7 mV; and Orai3 + siRNA-Stim1, +4 ± 1 mV). On the contrary, 75 μm 2-APB abolished store-operated currents of cells coexpressing Orai1 and Stim1, whereas 10 μm 2-APB transiently stimulated Orai1 currents, yet without altering the inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship (data not shown). 2-APB-stimulated Orai3 inward as well as outward currents were robustly blocked by addition of 10 μm La3+ (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we investigated an Orai3-R66W mutant analogous to the Orai1-R91W mutant that is linked to severe combined immune deficiency and was reported to lack any store-operated activation (4Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether 2-APB is able to alternatively stimulate Orai3-R66W. Yet Orai3-R66W coexpressed with Stim1 neither gave rise to any significant current activation by store depletion nor displayed any sensitivity to stimulation by 2-APB (75 μm) (Fig. 1F), indicating that this mutation prevents permeation through Orai3 channels independent of the mode of activation. These experiments demonstrated that 2-APB is able to stimulate Orai3 currents independent of Stim1. 2-APB Alters Selectivity of Orai3 Currents—Analysis of the current-voltage relationship of Orai3 conductance during 2-APB stimulation revealed that the reversal potential shifted from >+15 mV of initial 2-APB-evoked Orai3 currents (after 5s) to 3.3 ± 0.7 mV in the presence of 2-APB at maximum Orai3 stimulation (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Ca2+ selectivity of store-operated Orai3 currents was altered. When Ca2+ was omitted from the bath solution, 2-APB-stimulated inward currents of Orai3 were significantly larger than those in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2B) and resulted in a more linear current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2C). It is reasonable to assume that Ca2+ ions hinder monovalent Na+ ions to enter the pore at negative potentials in 2-APB-modified Orai3 channels. To further explore the selectivity of 2-APB-stimulated Orai3 currents, after reaching maximum activation, standard Ca2+ bath solution was replaced by a 150 mm Na+-based divalent free solution (Na-DVF). This Na+-based solution resulted in a pronounced current increase of 2-APB-stimulated Orai3 channels that exhibited a linear current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2, D and F) with a reversal potential of -7.5 ± 0.2 mV. In an analogous approach, a Cs+-based DVF solution also increased Orai3 currents (Fig. 2, E and F), with a reversal potential of -2 ± 0.7 mV. In control experiments using a similar protocol in the absence of 2-APB, the store-operated conductance generated by coexpression of Stim1 and Orai3 resulted also in a pronounced current increase when Ca2+ solution was exchanged to Na-DVF, yet maintaining inward rectification with a reversal potential above +50 mV (Fig. 2, G and I). In contrast, store-operated Orai3 currents were robustly suppressed in a Cs-DVF solution (Fig. 2, H and I), suggesting that the selectivity profile of Orai3 channels is dramatically altered in 2-APB-stimulated versus store-operated Orai3 currents. Hence, 2-APB application alters Orai3 permeability from a highly Ca2+ selective to a nonselective current that passes both Na+ as well as Cs+. 2-APB Increases Minimum Pore Size of Orai3 Channels—To investigate whether the 2-APB-induced change in the permeation/selectivity properties of ORAI3 channels is accompanied by a modification/increase in their minimal dimension of pore size, we made use of methylated derivates of ammonium, an approach recently carried out with Orai1 pore mutants (8Yamashita M. Navarro-Borelly L. McNally B.A. Prakriya M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The narrowest region of native CRAC and Orai1 channels is only ∼3.9 and 3.8 Å wide, respectively, suggesting that the low Cs+ permeability (∼3.8 Å) might in part reflect steric hindrance to its permeation (8Yamashita M. Navarro-Borelly L. McNally B.A. Prakriya M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Based on the Corey-Pauling-Koltun space-filling models (13Liu D.M. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) the diameter of methylammonium is 3.78 Å, dimethylammonium is 4.6 Å, and trimethylammonium is 5.34 Å. We initially focused on Stim1-mediated Orai3 currents after maximum store-depletion activation, as pore size of Orai3 has not yet been addressed. Store-operated currents of coexpressed Stim1 and Orai3 were monitored in a standard 10 mm Ca2+ solution followed by perfusion with a 150 mm methylammonium-DVF solution (Fig. 3A). This resulted in a further increase of Orai3 currents that still exhibited an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship (Fig. 3C). The larger dimethylammonium was not anymore permeable for store-operated Orai3, as examined in a similar approach, resulting in completely suppressed currents upon perfusion with 150 mm dimethlyammonium-DVF solution (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, 2-APB (75 μm)-stimulated Orai3 channels showed large currents in 150 mm dimethylammonium-DVF solution, yielding a linear current-voltage relationship (Fig. 3, D and F). Moreover, 2-APB (75 μm) modified Orai3 currents still increased about 3-fold upon exchange of a 10 mm Ca2+ containing bath solution by 150 mm trimethylammonium-DVF solution (Fig. 4, E and F). The current-voltage relationship revealed a more negative reversal potential for trimethylammonium (Vrev = -37.8 +/2.1 mV) than dimethylammonium (Vrev =-16.8 ± 3.4 mV) or sodium (Vrev =-7.5 ± 0.2 mV), suggesting that selectivity or permeability for larger cations is steadily decreasing (Fig. 3F). These experiments demonstrate that 2-APB is able to increase the effective pore size of Orai3 channels to more than 5.34 Å concomitant with a profound alteration in channel selectivity, whereas the Ca2+ selectivity of store-operated Orai3 channels is associated with an effective pore size of about 3.8 Å. Mechanistically, it is tempting to speculate that 2-APB via its positive charge (14Tao L. Harris A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) might interact with the ORAI3 selectivity filter that results in the altered permeation properties. This hypothesis was further evaluated by generating Orai3 pore mutants analogously to Orai1 that are expected to display a modified response to 2-APB.FIGURE 4Store-operated activation of Orai3 pore mutants and their Cs+ permeability.

Hence, 2-APB might have modified pore configuration of Orai3 in a way that resembles at least in part that obtained by a mutation in the selectivity filter. We therefore focused on the conserved glutamates in transmembrane domains 1 and 3 that have previously been shown to affect permeation properties of Orai1 (8Yamashita M. Navarro-Borelly L.

In brief, mutation of Glu-106 in the TM1 domain to Asp (Orai1-E106D) results in a more linear current-voltage relationship of Orai1, whereas a similar mutation at position 190 (Orai1-E190D) did not affect Orai1 Ca2+ selectivity (15Vig M. Beck A. Billingsley J.M. Lis A. Parvez S. Peinelt C. Koomoa D.L. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Curr.

However, substitution of Glu-190 to neutral Gln (Orai1-E190Q) yields a double rectifying current-voltage relationship in 10 mm Ca2+ containing bath solution (8Yamashita M. Navarro-Borelly L.

Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The amino acids that contribute to the selectivity filter of the Orai3 pore have not yet been investigated. Therefore in analogy to Orai1, we mutated the conserved Glu-81 in TM1 to an Asp (Orai3-E81D) that corresponds to E106D in Orai1 and Glu-165 in TM3 to Asp (Orai3-E165D) or Gln (Orai3-E165Q). Coexpression of Orai3-E81D and Stim1 yielded activation of store-operated currents with a linear current-voltage relationship and a reversal potential of 2 ± 1.5 mV in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+-containing bath solution (Fig. 4, A and B). Perfusion with 150 mm Cs+-containing divalent free solution resulted in a large increase of the current in the inward rather than outward direction and a reversal potential around 0 ± 2 mV (Fig. 4, A and B) similar as previously observed for Orai1-E106D (16Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Cs+ permeability of the Orai3-E81D has largely increased in comparison to wild-type Orai3, which was almost impermeable for Cs+. Furthermore, this Orai3-E81D mutant showed some similarity to 2-APB-modified Orai3 currents in that Cs+ permeability was markedly increased, yet with an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. Next, we examined the Orai3-E165D mutant coexpressed with Stim1. Store-operated currents in 10 mm Ca2+ containing bath solution exhibited inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship with a high reversal potential of >50 mV (Fig. 4, C and D) suggesting preservation of high Ca2+ selectivity. Exchange of bath solution by a Cs+ divalent-free solution substantially decreased currents suggesting minor permeability to Cs+ (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the Orai3-E165D mutant resembled in its permeation properties the wild-type Orai3 channel. In accordance, Prakriya et al. (16Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) have previously reported similar permeation properties of the analogue Orai1-E190D mutant in comparison to wild-type Orai1. In contrast to the Asp substitution, Orai3-E165Q coexpressed with Stim1 yielded store-operated conductance in the 10 mm Ca2+-containing bath solution with a more linear current-voltage relationship displaying some outward rectification (Vrev = 8.5 ± 4 mV). Exchange of bath solution by a Cs+ divalent free one resulted in a clear increase in both inward and outward currents with a linear current-voltage relationship and a reversal potential of -3 ± 1 mV. Thereby, the Orai3 E165Q mutation mimicked the conductance phenotype of the 2-APB-stimulated Orai3. All three Orai3 pore mutants failed to activate detectable store-operated currents in the absence of Stim1 (data not shown). Stim1 and Orai3 pore mutant coexpressing cells showed a similar delay in activation by passive store depletion with 10 mm EGTA and comparable inward current densities in 10 mm containing Ca2+ solution as wild-type Orai3, suggesting comparable coupling to Stim1, similar as reported for Orai1-E106A (18Lioudyno M.I. Kozak J.A. Penna A. Safrina O. Zhang S.L. Sen D. Roos J. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Orai3-E165Q Mutant Almost Lacked 2-APB Stimulation—We hypothesized that Orai3 pore mutants upon store depletion probably adopted a similar pore configuration as wild-type Orai3 following 2-APB stimulation. Therefore, addi tion of 2-APB to such pore mutants might not be able to further stimulate these channels. We initially monitored maximum store depletion-activated currents derived from coexpression of Stim1 and Orai3-E81D in a 10 mm containing Ca2+ bath solution followed by addition of 75 μm 2-APB (Fig. 5A). 2-APB induced an increase in both inward and outward currents with a linear current-voltage relationship that reversed at -4.4 ± 2 mV (Fig. 5B), and was distinct to that of 2-APB evoked double-rectifying currents from wild-type Orai3. Following a subsequent exchange of bath solution by a 150 mm Cs+-divalent free solution, the current-voltage relationship remained almost unchanged with a slight, yet not significant rightward shift of the reversal potential to -2.3 ± 1.6 mV (Fig. 5, A and B). As the Orai3-E81D mutant was still amenable to stimulation by 2-APB and failed to show a subsequent increase in Cs+ conductance, its behavior does not mimic that of Orai3 in the presence of 2-APB. Next we examined the Orai3-E165D mutant coexpressed with Stim1 that exhibited similar store-operated currents as wild-type Orai3 in a 10 mm Ca2+ bath solution. Following full activation of the highly Ca2+-selective store-operated Orai3-E165D currents, application of 2-APB (75 μm) produced a double rectifying current-voltage relationship with a leftward shift in the reversal potential to +20 ± 3 mV (Fig. 5, C and D). Perfusion of a Cs+-DVF solution resulted in further increased linear currents reversing at +0.6 ± 2 mV. Qualitatively, the response of this mutant to 2-APB in both Ca2+ and Cs+ containing solution was similar to wild-type Orai3. Hence this Orai3-E165D mutation is suggested to barely affect pore properties and behaved as expected similar to wild-type Orai3. Finally, the Orai3-E165Q mutant in coexpression with Stim1 was monitored in the standard Ca2+ bath solution. When store-operated Orai3-E165Q currents were fully developed, addition of 2-APB (75 μm) failed to elicit a clear stimulating response yielding a double-rectifying current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential of about 24 ± 2.7 mV (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, closer inspection of the time course upon application of 2-APB revealed a transient inhibition of Orai3-E165Q currents (Fig. 5G) that was followed by a modest recovery. In contrast to the dramatic 2-APB stimulation of store-operated wild-type Orai3 currents, the response to 2-APB of the Orai3-E165Q mutant was almost abolished. Subsequent application of the Cs+-DVF solution in the continuous presence of 2-APB increased Orai3-E165Q currents, leading to a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential of -2.6 ± 1 mV (Fig. 5, E and F) as previously observed with this mutant in the absence of 2-APB (see Fig. 4F). The transient inhibition following 2-APB application (Fig. 5G) probably occurred analogously to the known inhibitory effect of 75 μm 2-APB on Orai1 that is masked in wild-type Orai3 and the other pore mutants by a more rapid onset and stronger 2-APB stimulation. Thus, the Orai3-E165Q mutation qualitatively mimicked the 2-APB-stimulated wild-type Orai3 channel, with similar Cs+-permeation properties. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of 2-APB in the Orai3-E165Q mutant was almost abolished. This is further underlined in Fig. 5H displaying similar normalized current-voltage relationships in a 10 mm Ca2+ bath solution for store-operated activated Orai3-E165Q and, following stimulation by 2-APB, for Orai3, Orai3-E106D, and Orai3-E165Q. The membrane-permeable 2-APB is a well characterized inhibitor for native store-operated channels and has been demonstrated to block Orai1 and Orai2 (6Lis A. Peinelt C. Beck A. Parvez S.

Physiol. 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect on native CRAC currents has been suggested to be based on an increase in the number of active CRAC channels (12Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the effect of 2-APB to stimulate Orai3 currents is associated with an alteration of the channels' permeability from highly Ca2+-selective to a non-differentiating monovalent one. While this paper was under review, consistent results have been reported from Peinelt et al. (19Peinelt C. Lis A. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. J. Physiol. 2008; 283: 17662-17671Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (23Zhang S.L. Kozak J.A. Jiang W. Yeromin A.V. Chen J. Yu Y. Penna A. Shen W. Chi V. Cahalan M.D. J. Biol.

Even in the absence of endogenous Stim1, as shown here utilizing Stim1-siRNA, comparable stimulation of Orai3 by 2-APB was obtained that is characterized by a leftward shift in reversal potential and a double rectifying current-voltage relationship, in accordance with Refs. 19Peinelt C.

This 2-APB-induced stimulation of Orai3 channels comes along with an increase in Orai3 channels' pore size and represents a unique mechanism. We suggest that 2-APB binds directly to Orai3, as neither coexpression of Stim1 nor siRNA interference against Stim1 affected the 2-APB-dependent Orai3 stimulation. One possibility is that 2-APB mimics the store-induced coupling of Stim1 with Orai3. Recently we have identified a putative coiled-coil motif in the C terminus of Orai1 that interacts with Stim1 (2Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R. Kahr H. Madl J. Gruber H. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 282: 8014-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A similar C-terminal coiled-coil domain is also present in Orai2 and Orai3. Yet, if 2-APB interacts with the coiled-coil domain of Orai3, one would not expect an alteration in the permeability profile and current-voltage relationship as observed here. Alternatively direct interaction of 2-APB with the Orai3 pore that affects both gating and pore architecture might be responsible for the observed stimulation and increase in pore diameter. As 2-APB is to a high extent positively charged in an aqueous environment at pH 7.4 (14Tao L. Harris A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), access to the pore might enable partial electrostatic interaction with one of the negatively charged glutamates/aspartates that contribute to the selectivity filter resulting in partial charge compensation and alteration of pore geometry. Therefore we generated single point mutations of conserved amino acids Glu-81 and Glu-165 corresponding to Glu-106 and Glu-190 in the selectivity filter of Orai1. A reasonable hypothesis would imply a reduced 2-APB response of pore mutants that mimic pore properties of 2-APB-stimulated Orai3. Indeed one of these mutations in the 3rd transmembrane domain, Orai3-E165Q, not only resulted in an altered I/V relationship following store-operated activation similar to that obtained by 2-APB stimulation of wild-type Orai3, but in addition almost completely abolished the stimulatory 2-APB effect. The potential involvement of Glu-165 in the 3rd transmembrane domain of Orai3 is consistent with a very recently published report (23Zhang S.L. Kozak J.A. Jiang W. Yeromin A.V. Chen J. Yu Y. Penna A. Shen W. Chi V. Cahalan M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17662-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showing that the structural determinants mediating 2-APB stimulation of Orai3, as judged from a series of Orai1-Orai3 chimeras, are located within the sequence ranging from the 2nd to the 3rd transmembrane domain of Orai3. Another Orai3-E81D mutant resembled the 2-APB-stimulated Orai3 only to a minor extent in that this mutation rendered the channel permeable to Cs+ upon store-depletion, however, yet retained the inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. More importantly this mutant exhibited a clear stimulatory response to 2-APB. The properties of a third Orai3-E165D pore mutant were barely different from wild-type Orai3. Furthermore, 2-APB besides affecting pore properties is able to alter gating of Orai3 channels as evident from their activation independent of store depletion. Although 2-APB stimulation of wild-type Orai3 and Orai3-E165Q currents shows functional similarities, one main difference is that this E165Q mutant still requires store depletion to get activated. It is yet unresolved if the gate and the selectivity filter of Orai3 represent overlapping or rather separated structures of the channel. However, it is conceivable that a modification of the pore by 2-APB directly leads to gating of the Orai3 channel. Based on these experiments, it is obvious that a further domain is essential for 2-APB stimulation as the glutamates at positions 81 and 165 are conserved within all three Orai3 channels. We have previously shown that an Orai1 mutation, Orai-R91W, that causes non-functional Ca2+ signaling in severe combined immune deficiency T-lymphocytes, couples normally to Stim1 and is able to homomultimerize (2Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R. Kahr H. Madl J. Gruber H. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol.

The analogue Orai3-R66W mutant failed to develop currents both upon store-depletion or 2-APB application, suggesting a more general, severe defect in gating/permeation. In summary, we have conclusively shown that the chemical compound 2-APB is able to modify Orai3 channels' selectivity by interaction with the pore domain concomitant with an increase in pore size. We thank L. Birnbaumer for providing the human Orai3 clone. We thank S. Buchegger and B. Kenda for excellent technical assistance."

The primary model for the development of direction selectivity is that patterned activity plays an instructive role. Here, we use a unique, large-scale multielectrode array to demonstrate that DSGCs are present at eye opening, in mice that have been reared in darkness and in mice that lack cholinergic retinal waves. These data suggest that direction selectivity in the retina is established largely independent of patterned activity and is therefore likely to emerge as a result of complex molecular interactions."

Here, we show that SRF mediates NGF signaling, axonal growth, branching, and target innervation by embryonic DRG sensory neurons. Conditional deletion of the murine SRF gene in DRGs results in no deficits in neuronal viability or differentiation but causes defects in extension and arborization of peripheral axonal projections in the target field in vivo, similar to the target innervation defects observed in mice lacking NGF. Moreover, SRF is both necessary and sufficient for NGF-dependent axonal outgrowth in vitro, and NGF regulates SRF-dependent gene expression and axonal outgrowth through activation of both MEK/ERK and MAL signaling pathways. These findings show that SRF is a major effector of both MEK/ERK and MAL signaling by NGF and that SRF is a key mediator of NGF-dependent target innervation by embryonic sensory neurons."

Here, we report that this precise olfactory map is maintained over several synapses that ultimately cross MOB hemispheres to link bilateral isofunctional olfactory columns. Focal injection of tracer into genetically identified glomeruli revealed an exquisite topography that involves a bilateral connection via the anterior olfactory nucleus pars externa (AONpE) that links isofunctional olfactory columns in the contralateral MOB. Physiological and behavioral assays revealed an important role for the AONpE in bilateral exchange of odorant-specific information. These results indicate that the interbulbar link through the AONpE integrates bilateral olfactory sensory maps and exchanges olfactory information, positioning it as a unique model system for studying interhemispheric connections."
https://openalex.org/W2119610790,"Functional models of the early visual system should predict responses not only to simple artificial stimuli but also to sequences of complex natural scenes. An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli."

(Paris). 1981; 77: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar), yet the cellular mechanisms by which this is accomplished remain unclear. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the intracellular concentration of calcium is a critical parameter for synaptic plasticity and the induction of mnemonic processes (Cull-Candy et al., 2006Cull-Candy S. Kelly L. Farrant M. Regulation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors: synaptic plasticity and beyond.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the action of DA on PFC function results from its ability to alter activity-dependent changes in intracellular calcium levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, D1Rs regulate high-voltage activated (HVA) calcium currents in the PFC (Yang et al., 1999Yang C.R. Seamans J.K. Gorelova N. Developing a neuronal model for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the nature of electrophysiological actions of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 21: 161-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the molecular composition of these channels and the intracellular signaling mechanisms through which DA may affect calcium influx have not been determined. D1Rs are known to couple to Gαs to activate protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances L-type calcium channel activity (Catterall, 2000Catterall W.A. Structure and regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). In contrast, little precedent exists for Gαs-linked receptor modulation of N-type (also known as Cav2.2) channels (but see Surmeier et al., 1995Surmeier D.J. Bargas J. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C.

Here, we show that D1R activation potently inhibits N-type channel activity in apical dendrites of rat PFC neurons. We functionally dissect this inhibitory effect, using HEK293T cells, to reveal that D1Rs mediate both voltage-dependent (VD) and voltage-independent (VI) channel modulation. Finally, we show that D1Rs physically associate with N-type calcium channels, thereby supporting receptor-mediated increases in channel surface expression, agonist-mediated channel internalization, and regulation of channel distribution at specific subcellular compartments in neurons. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the N-type channel is an important physiological target of D1Rs and they provide a molecular mechanism that may account for dopaminergic regulation of calcium signaling in PFC neurons. The PFC is a brain region that is critical for high-level executive functions, such as working memory, planning, and attention (Fuster, 2000Fuster J.M. Executive frontal functions.Exp. Brain Res. 2000; 133: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It is densely innervated by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) and expresses high levels of D1Rs. DA regulates the physiological functions of the PFC, perhaps by modulating calcium influx via dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels during back-propagating action potentials (Markram et al., 1995Markram H. Helm P.J. Sakmann B. Dendritic calcium transients evoked by single back-propagating action potentials in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we filled layer V/VI PFC pyramidal neurons with calcium green and used two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to measure DA receptor-induced changes in dendritic calcium influx (Figure 1A). Compared with control, application of either DA (n = 8) or the D1R agonists SKF-38393 (n = 8) and SKF-81297 (n = 6) (but not the D2 agonist quinpirole) reliably depressed spike-evoked dendritic calcium influx by 56% ± 3%, 52% ± 4%, and 53% ± 4%, respectively (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1E). Another three cells were unresponsive to DA, and two cells were unresponsive to SKF38393, consistent with the notion that not all layer V/VI pyramidal cells express D1Rs. The D1R-mediated depression was only partially recovered by washout (DA, 76% ± 6%; SKF-38393, 71% ± 8%; SKF-81297, 60% ± 4%), which is typical of the persistent DA actions on pyramidal neurons in the PFC (Gorelova and Yang, 2000Gorelova N.A.

Gorelova N. Electrophysiological and morphological properties of layers V-VI principal pyramidal cells in rat prefrontal cortex in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1904-1921PubMed Google Scholar), although in some cases, reversible actions of DA have also been reported. The characteristics of the somatic action potential did not change during agonist application or washout (Figures 1B and 1C, top right). In contrast to evoked conditions, resting dendritic calcium levels and membrane potential were unaffected by agonist application (data not shown). The D1R antagonist SCH-23390 prevented the agonist -mediated response (SCH-23390 + SKF-38393, 105% ± 5%; SCH-23390 + SKF-81207, 99.8% ± 5%) (Figures 1D and 1E), thus confirming that inhibition was indeed mediated by the D1R. To determine to what extent the inhibitory effects of D1R activation during back-propagating action potentials relied on N-type calcium channels, similar experiments were carried out in the presence of the selective N-type calcium channel blocker ω-conotoxin-GVIA. When GVIA was applied alone, the evoked calcium transient was rapidly (<5 min) reduced to 67% ± 3% of control (Figures 1F and 1G). As before, the characteristics of the somatic action potential did not change during control or experimental conditions (Figure 1F, bottom). Preapplication of GVIA resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of either DA or SKF-38393 to inhibit spike-induced calcium influx (DA, 47% ± 3%; GVIA + DA, 10% ± 4%; SKF-38393, 52% ± 4%; GVIA + SKF-38393, 19% ± 2%, p < 0.001, t test), and GDPβS blocked the effects of D1R activation (Figure 1G). Taken together, these data indicate that D1R activation in PFC dendrites robustly decreases calcium influx via a G protein-linked pathway and, in large part, via inhibition of N-type calcium channels. To elucidate the molecular mechanism that underlies D1R-mediated inhibition of N-type calcium channels, Cav2.2 subunits (+β1b and α2-δ1 subunits) and D1Rs were coexpressed in HEK293T cells, and their response to DA characterized via whole-cell patch clamp. All cells expressing exogenous D1Rs exhibited robust inhibition of Cav2.2 channel currents (Figures 2A and 2B). Following stabilization of the inhibitory response, peak current amplitudes were reduced by 51.6% ± 5.3% (Figure 2A), in a partially reversible manner (90.5% ± 1.9% upon washout). In contrast, channel activity in cells lacking exogenous D1Rs was unaffected by DA (data not shown). Activation of the D1R resulted in the hallmark characteristics of voltage-dependent Gβγ-mediated inhibition (i.e., kinetic slowing, a depolarizing shift in the position of the current voltage relation, and relief of inhibition by a strong depolarizing prepulse), as well as VI inhibition of channel activity (Figures 2B–2D). The relative contribution of voltage-dependent and voltage-independent mechanisms to overall current inhibition was approximately 50:50 (voltage-dependent, 28.1% ± 4.1%; voltage-independent, 27.6% ± 5.0%) (Figure 2D). Neither the extent of inhibition nor the relative contributions of the VD and VI pathways were significantly affected when the amount of receptor or channel cDNA used in the transfection was reduced by 75% (see Figure S1 available online). D1Rs are known to signal to their downstream effectors via the Gαs subunit, and the functional effects on channel activity should thus be insensitive to inhibitors of Gαi/o signaling. Indeed, pretreatment of D1R expressing cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not prevent DA-mediated inhibition of channel activity (Figure 2E). Interestingly, the extent of inhibition was augmented to ∼70%. This increase may be due to interference with an endogenous PTX-sensitive pathway that would normally antagonize the D1-mediated response. Moreover, pretreatment of D1-expressing cells with PTX resulted in the inability to recover current following washout, suggesting that a PTX sensitive component is involved in the recovery from D1R-mediated inhibition. We note that D2 receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type channel activity was almost completely abolished following PTX treatment (data not shown), confirming the efficacy of the toxin. Coexpression of the Gβγ-binding protein βark-ct almost completely abolished VD modulation, while sparing VI inhibition (Figure 2F). In contrast, application of the PKA inhibitor H-89 significantly reduced the extent of VI modulation, while leaving VD regulation unaffected (Figure 2F). Inclusion of GDPβS in the patch pipette virtually abolished all D1R-mediated effects on N-type current activity (Figure 2F). Overall, these data indicate that D1Rs effectively inhibit N-type calcium channels via a combination of voltage-dependent (i.e., Gβγ-mediated) and voltage-independent (partially PKA mediated) pathways. The vast majority of GPCRs that are known to inhibit N-type channels in a voltage-dependent manner are linked to the Gαi/o subunit (for review see Tedford and Zamponi, 2006Tedford H.W. Zamponi G.W. Direct G protein modulation of Cav2 calcium channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The observation that the Gαs-linked D1R produced a robust voltage-dependent modulation suggests that these receptors might be localized in close proximity to N-type channels to facilitate coupling. To examine this possibility, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments between D1Rs and N-type channels using rat PFC and striatal homogenate. D1Rs and N-type channels could be effectively coimmunoprecipitated from PFC tissue, indicating the existence of a receptor channel signaling complex (Figure 3A). Interestingly, despite repeated attempts, similar coimmunoprecipitations using rat striatal homogenate were unsuccessful. These observations suggest that tissue-specific differences govern the ability of N-type channels to associate with D1Rs. Furthermore, they are consistent with our functional data illustrating D1R-mediated modulation of N-type channel activity in PFC slices. To investigate which regions of the D1R and the Cav2.2 channel may be responsible for this association, and to determine whether it involves a direct receptor-channel interaction, we conducted in vitro binding assays involving 6xHis- and GST-fusion constructs corresponding to the intracellular regions of the channel and the receptor, respectively (Figure 3B). These experiments revealed a biochemical interaction between the D1 loop-2 and the proximal portion of the Cav2.2 C terminus, whereas other intracellular regions of the channel did not interact with the D1 loop-2 construct (Figure 3C and Figure S2). These data are consistent with the co-IP data of Figure 3A and indicate a direct D1R-Cav2.2 calcium channel interaction. As an independent verification of the data presented in Figures 3A–3C, we generated YFP-tagged peptides corresponding to the regions of interaction between the D1R and the Cav2.2 channel. Individual HEK293T cells expressing a YFP-conjugated peptide corresponding to the D1 loop-2, alone or in the presence of the Cav2.2 channel, were examined for the subcellular distribution of the D1 loop-2 construct. Conversely, individual HEK293T cells expressing a YFP-conjugated peptide corresponding to the proximal portion of the Cav2.2 channel C terminus, alone or in the presence of a 3xHA-tagged D1R, were similarly examined. Expression of the empty EYFP-N1 vector resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of the YFP signal (data not shown). Likewise, when expressed alone, peptides corresponding to the D1 loop-2 and the proximal portion of the Cav2.2 C terminus were also distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 3D). However, when coexpressed in the presence of the Cav2.2 channel or 3xHA-tagged D1R, respectively, each peptide underwent a pronounced translocation to the plasma membrane (D1 loop-2, 56%; Cav2.2-C terminus, 78%) (Figures 3D and 3E), whereas a YFP-tagged peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel did not (Figure S3). These findings are consistent with our protein biochemical data illustrating that the D1 loop-2 and the Cav2.2 C terminus directly interact in vitro. Taken together, the results of our protein biochemical and confocal analyses indicate that the D1R is capable of direct, physical interaction with the Cav2.2 channel. Moreover, our data imply that this interaction occurs in neurons in a brain region-specific manner. To determine whether D1Rs can regulate surface expression levels of Cav2.2 channels, cultured HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with an external HA-epitope-tagged Cav2.2 α1 subunit (+ β1b and α2-δ1 subunits) in the absence or the presence of the D1R. The HA-antibody reactivity in permeabilized (total protein expression) and nonpermeabilized (surface protein expression) cells in the absence and the presence of DA was read automatically by a luminescence plate reader, thus providing an unbiased means of quantifying relative surface protein levels. D1R cotransfection mediated a significant increase in Cav2.2 channel membrane expression (Cav2.2 alone, 0.38 ± 0.05; Cav2.2 + D1, 0.64 ± 0.05, p < 0.001, t test) (Figure 4A). Upon agonist application, the subcellular distribution of the Cav2.2 channel alone was unaffected by DA (Figure 4A). In contrast, agonist application in the presence of the D1R resulted in a loss of channel surface expression (Cav2.2 + D1 control, 0.64 ± 0.05; Cav2.2 + D1 + DA, 0.52 ± 0.04) (Figure 4A). Collectively, these data are suggestive of a D1R-mediated enhancement of Cav2.2 channel plasma membrane expression and receptor-mediated channel internalization in response to agonist. To further examine this phenomenon, receptor-channel colocalization was investigated using confocal microscopy. Cultured HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type Cav2.2 channel (+ β1b and α2-δ1 subunits) in the absence or the presence of a full-length, YFP-tagged D1R. The ratio of channel/receptor expression at the cell surface to total cellular expression was quantified in the absence and the presence of DA using Metamorph software. In the absence of agonist, coexpression of the D1R with the Cav2.2 channel produced a significant increase in channel surface expression (Cav2.2 alone, 0.36 ± 0.02; Cav2.2 + D1, 0.64 ± 0.01, p < 0.001, t test) (Figures 4B and 4C). In response to DA, and consistent with previous reports in HEK293T cells (So et al., 2005So C.H. Varghese G. Curley K.J. Kong M.M. Alijaniaram M. Ji X. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors form heterooligomers and cointernalize after selective activation of either receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a significant loss of surface expression of the D1R was observed (control, 0.77 ± 0.001; DA, 0.48 ± 0.02, p < 0.001, t test) (Figure 4D). The internalization of the receptor was closely paralleled by a DA-induced loss of Cav2.2 channel surface expression (Cav2.2 + D1 control, 0.64 ± 0.01; Cav2.2 + D1 + DA, 0.40 ± 0.01, p < 0.001, t test) (Figure 4C). In contrast, in the absence of exogenous receptor expression, N-type channel surface expression was unaffected by DA (Figure 4C). To confirm that cytoplasmic Cav2.2 channels were indeed internalized from the cell surface, we conducted antibody-feeding experiments involving coexpression of HA-Cav2.2 channels and D1-YFP receptors. In this instance, primary HA antibody was applied to live cells before DA application. After agonist application, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with secondary antibody, thus allowing for selective labeling of only those channels that were initially localized at the cell surface. Robust internalization of the HA-tagged channel could be observed under these conditions (HA-Cav2.2 + D1 control, 0.73 ± 0.01; HA-Cav2.2 + D1 + DA, 0.45 ± 0.03, p < 0.001, t test; Figure 4C). Similar to results obtained using the wild-type channel, the extent of the reduction in HA-tagged channel surface expression was closely paralleled by the degree of loss of D1R surface expression (D1-YFP + HA-Cav2.2 control, 0.87 ± 0.008; D1-YFP + HA-Cav2.2 + DA, 0.51 ± 0.04, p < 0.001, t test) (Figure 4D). These data indicate that the DA-induced increase in cytoplasmic Cav2.2 channels is indeed due to channel internalization rather than an effect of DA on channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Reducing the amount of cDNA used in transfection did not affect the degree of channel internalization (Figure S3). The results from the imaging experiments are consistent with our luminometry data with the exception that the DA-induced loss of Cav2.2 channel surface expression appeared more pronounced. We note that in the imaging experiments data are selectively obtained from cells that coexpress both the channel (i.e., by immunoreactivity) and the receptor (i.e., by YFP fluorescence). In contrast, in the luminometry experiments, a large and more heterogeneous population of cells is sampled, thus potentially masking receptor-induced changes in channel surface expression levels. To determine the specificity of our observations with D1Rs and N-type channels, we examined the ability of the β2 adrenergic receptor to promote internalization of N-type channels. Like the D1R, the β2-AR couples via Gαs and is known to undergo robust internalization in response to agonist treatment (Ferguson et al., 1996Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Role of beta-arrestin in mediating agonist-promoted G protein-coupled receptor internalization.Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Upon application of isoproterenol, the β2-AR could be effectively internalized, whereas the channel remained localized to the plasma membrane (Figure S4). Conversely, the D1R was incapable of internalizing coexpressed HA-tagged Cav1.2 L-type calcium channels (Figure S4). Consistent with these findings, these receptor-channel combinations could not be coimmunoprecipitated (Figure S4). Collectively, these results support the notion that D1Rs form signaling complexes with Cav2.2 channels that dynamically regulate channel cell surface expression. To determine whether the DA-induced internalization and functional inhibition of Cav2.2 channels are dependent on the formation of physical D1R-channel complexes, we competitively disrupted the channel-receptor interaction by coexpressing a cDNA construct corresponding to the D1R loop-2 region (contained in a pIRES-GFP vector). Expression of the D1 loop-2 peptide, which (as we showed in Figure 3) is effectively targeted to the plasma membrane by the channel, did not significantly affect acute (i.e., short term) agonist-induced D1R-mediated channel inhibition (Figure 5A). Note that these functional experiments were performed on a timescale where there are no contributions from receptor-mediated channel internalization. This finding indicates that the formation of the D1R-Cav2.2 channel complex is not essential for channel inhibition under circumstances where receptors and channels are expressed at artificially high levels. Furthermore, it confirms that the D1 loop-2 peptide does not affect receptor function. In contrast, the D1R-mediated internalization of Cav2.2 channels was dramatically reduced by a YFP-fused version of the D1 loop-2 peptide (control, 0.66 ± 0.02, DA, 0.38 ± 0.03; D1-loop-2-YFP + DA, 0.57 ± 0.02, p < 0.05, one-way ANOV"
https://openalex.org/W2013941137,"Human ChlR1 (hChlR1), a member of the DEAD/DEAH subfamily of helicases, was shown to interact with components of the cohesin complex and play a role in sister chromatid cohesion. In order to study the biochemical and biological properties of hChlR1, we purified the protein from 293 cells and demonstrated that hChlR1 possesses DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities. This helicase translocates on single-stranded DNA in the 5' to 3' direction in the presence of ATP and, to a lesser extent, dATP. Its unwinding activity requires a 5'-singlestranded region for helicase loading, since flush-ended duplex structures do not support unwinding. The helicase activity of hChlR1 is capable of displacing duplex regions up to 100 bp, which can be extended to 500 bp by RPA or the cohesion establishment factor, the Ctf18-RFC (replication factor C) complex. We show that hChlR1 interacts with the hCtf18-RFC complex, human proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and hFen1. The interactions between Fen1 and hChlR1 stimulate the flap endonuclease activity of Fen1. Selective depletion of either hChlR1 or Fen1 by targeted small interfering RNA treatment results in the precocious separation of sister chromatids. These findings are consistent with a role of hChlR1 in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and suggest that its action may contribute to lagging strand processing events important in cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W2051829971,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), the reaction product of the interaction between superoxide (O(2)(*-)) and nitric oxide (*NO), is a potent proinflammatory and cytotoxic nitrooxidative species. Its role as a mediator of hyperalgesia (clinically defined as an augmented sensitivity to painful stimuli) is not known. In light of the known proinflammatory properties of ONOO(-), our study addressed its potential involvement in the development of hyperalgesia associated with tissue damage and inflammation. Intraplantar injection in rats of the ONOO(-) precursor O(2)(*-) (1 microM) led to the development of thermal hyperalgesia associated with a profound localized inflammatory response. Both events were blocked by L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 3-30 mg/kg), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, or by FeTM-4-PyP(5+) [Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin, 3-30 mg/kg], an ONOO(-) decomposition catalyst. These results suggested that locally synthesized ONOO(-) produced in situ by O(2)(*-) and *NO is key in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. The direct link between ONOO(-) and hyperalgesia was further supported by demonstrating that intraplantar injection of soluble ONOO(-) itself (1 microM) similarly led to inflammatory hyperalgesia. ONOO(-) generated by the interaction between exogenous administration of O(2)(*-) and endogenous *NO, or provided by direct injection of ONOO(-), activated the transcription factor NF-kappaB in paw tissues, enhancing expression of the inducible but not the constitutive cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2 and COX-1, respectively). ONOO(-)-mediated hyperalgesia was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin (10 mg/kg), a nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, or NS398 [N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide; 10 mg/kg] a selective COX-2 inhibitor, as well as by an anti-prostaglandin (PG) E(2) antibody (200 microg). In another established model of inflammation-related hyperalgesia by intraplantar injection of carrageenan in rats, inhibition of ONOO(-) with FeTM-4-PyP(5+) (3-30 mg/kg) inhibited the development of hyperalgesia and the release of PGE(2) in paw tissue exudates. Furthermore, FeTM-4-PyP(5+) synergized with indomethacin and NS397 (1-10 mg/kg) to block both hyperalgesia and edema. Taken together, these data show for the first time that ONOO(-) is a potent mediator of inflammation-derived hyperalgesia operating via the COX-to-PGE(2) pathway. These results provide a pharmacological rationale for the development of inhibitors of peroxynitrite biosynthesis as novel nonnarcotic analgesics. The broad implications of our study are that dual inhibition of both ONOO(-) formation and COX activity may provide an alternative therapeutic approach to the management of pain: effective analgesia with reduced side-effects typically associated with the use of COX inhibitors."

To determine receptor-specific functions and possible angiotensin II effects independent of its three known receptors we generated mice deficient in either one of the angiotensin II receptors, in two, or in all three (triple knockouts). Triple knockouts were vital and fertile, but survival was impaired. Hypotension and renal histological abnormalities in triple knockouts were comparable to those in mice lacking both AT(1) subtypes. All combinations lacking AT(1a) were distinguished by reduced heart rate. AT(1a) deletion impaired the in vivo pressor response to angiotensin II bolus injection, whereas deficiency for AT(1b) and/or AT(2) had no effect. However, the additional lack of AT(1b) in AT(1a)-deficient mice further impaired the vasoconstrictive capacity of angiotensin II. Although general vasoconstrictor properties were not changed, angiotensin II failed to alter blood pressure in triple knockouts, indicating that there are no other receptors involved in direct angiotensin II pressor effects. Our data identify mice deficient in all three angiotensin II receptors as an ideal tool to better understand the structure and function of the renin-angiotensin system and to search for angiotensin II effects independent of AT(1) and AT(2)."
