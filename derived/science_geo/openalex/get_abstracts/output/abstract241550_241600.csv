https://openalex.org/W2029330897,"Using genomic and mass spectrometry–based proteomic methods, we evaluated gene expression, identified key activities, and examined partitioning of metabolic functions in a natural acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial biofilm community. We detected 2033 proteins from the five most abundant species in the biofilm, including 48% of the predicted proteins from the dominant biofilm organism, Leptospirillum group II. Proteins involved in protein refolding and response to oxidative stress appeared to be highly expressed, which suggests that damage to biomolecules is a key challenge for survival. We validated and estimated the relative abundance and cellular localization of 357 unique and 215 conserved novel proteins and determined that one abundant novel protein is a cytochrome central to iron oxidation and AMD formation."
https://openalex.org/W1996932107,"A 5-year-resolution absolute-dated oxygen isotope record from Dongge Cave, southern China, provides a continuous history of the Asian monsoon over the past 9000 years. Although the record broadly follows summer insolation, it is punctuated by eight weak monsoon events lasting approximately 1 to 5 centuries. One correlates with the ""8200-year"" event, another with the collapse of the Chinese Neolithic culture, and most with North Atlantic ice-rafting events. Cross-correlation of the decadal- to centennial-scale monsoon record with the atmospheric carbon-14 record shows that some, but not all, of the monsoon variability at these frequencies results from changes in solar output."
https://openalex.org/W2117517043,"To determine the role of reactive oxygen species in mammalian longevity, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress human catalase localized to the peroxisome, the nucleus, or mitochondria (MCAT). Median and maximum life spans were maximally increased (averages of 5 months and 5.5 months, respectively) in MCAT animals. Cardiac pathology and cataract development were delayed, oxidative damage was reduced, H 2 O 2 production and H 2 O 2 -induced aconitase inactivation were attenuated, and the development of mitochondrial deletions was reduced. These results support the free radical theory of aging and reinforce the importance of mitochondria as a source of these radicals."

 annually. In his perspective, Nel describes how the adverse effects of ultrafine air particles are
 linked to their ability to gain access to the lung and systemic

https://openalex.org/W2113788261,"Optical transitions in carbon nanotubes are of central importance for nanotube characterization. They also provide insight into the nature of excited states in these one-dimensional systems. Recent work suggests that light absorption produces strongly correlated electron-hole states in the form of excitons. However, it has been difficult to rule out a simpler model in which resonances arise from the van Hove singularities associated with the one-dimensional bond structure of the nanotubes. Here, two-photon excitation spectroscopy bolsters the exciton picture. We found binding energies of ∼400 millielectron volts for semiconducting single-walled nanotubes with 0.8-nanometer diameters. The results demonstrate the dominant role of many-body interactions in the excited-state properties of one-dimensional systems."
https://openalex.org/W2111119489,"Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2140277420,"Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a kidney disorder of unknown etiology, and up to 20% of patients on dialysis have been diagnosed with it. Here we show that a large family with hereditary FSGS carries a missense mutation in the TRPC6 gene on chromosome 11q, encoding the ion-channel protein transient receptor potential cation channel 6 (TRPC6). The proline-to-glutamine substitution at position 112, which occurs in a highly conserved region of the protein, enhances TRPC6-mediated calcium signals in response to agonists such as angiotensin II and appears to alter the intracellular distribution of TRPC6 protein. Previous work has emphasized the importance of cytoskeletal and structural proteins in proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of glomerular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2136852838,"Ancient zircons from Western Australia's Jack Hills preserve a record of conditions that prevailed on Earth not long after its formation. Widely considered to have been a uniquely violent period geodynamically, the Hadean Eon [4.5 to 4.0 billion years ago (Ga)] has recently been interpreted by some as far more benign-possibly even characterized by oceans like those of the present day. Knowledge of the crystallization temperatures of the Hadean zircons is key to this debate. A thermometer based on titanium content revealed that these zircons cluster strongly at approximately 700 degrees C, which is indistinguishable from temperatures of granitoid zircon growth today and strongly suggests a regulated mechanism producing zircon-bearing rocks during the Hadean. The temperatures substantiate the existence of wet, minimum-melting conditions within 200 million years of solar system formation. They further suggest that Earth had settled into a pattern of crust formation, erosion, and sediment recycling as early as 4.35 Ga."
https://openalex.org/W2155547196,"Memories are thought to be attractor states of neuronal representations, with the hippocampus a likely substrate for context-dependent episodic memories. However, such states have not been directly observed. For example, the hippocampal place cell representation of location was previously found to respond continuously to changes in environmental shape alone. We report that exposure to novel square and circular environments made of different materials creates attractor representations for both shapes: Place cells abruptly and simultaneously switch between representations as environmental shape changes incrementally. This enables study of attractor dynamics in a cognitive representation and may correspond to the formation of distinct contexts in context-dependent memory."
https://openalex.org/W1993456677,"Long-term variations in solar radiation at Earth's surface ( S ) can affect our climate, the hydrological cycle, plant photosynthesis, and solar power. Sustained decreases in S have been widely reported from about the year 1960 to 1990. Here we present an estimate of global temporal variations in S by using the longest available satellite record. We observed an overall increase in S from 1983 to 2001 at a rate of 0.16 watts per square meter (0.10%) per year; this change is a combination of a decrease until about 1990, followed by a sustained increase. The global-scale findings are consistent with recent independent satellite observations but differ in sign and magnitude from previously reported ground observations. Unlike ground stations, satellites can uniformly sample the entire globe."
https://openalex.org/W1985362378,"New information architectures enable new approaches to publishing and accessing valuable data and programs. So-called service-oriented architectures define standard interfaces and protocols that allow developers to encapsulate information tools as services that clients can access without knowledge of, or control over, their internal workings. Thus, tools formerly accessible only to the specialist can be made available to all; previously manual data-processing and analysis tasks can be automated by having services access services. Such service-oriented approaches to science are already being applied successfully, in some cases at substantial scales, but much more effort is required before these approaches are applied routinely across many disciplines. Grid technologies can accelerate the development and adoption of service-oriented science by enabling a separation of concerns between discipline-specific content and domain-independent software and hardware infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W1996320633,"Thermostabilizing an enzyme while maintaining its activity for industrial or biomedical applications can be difficult with traditional selection methods. We describe a rapid computational approach that identified three mutations within a model enzyme that produced a 10 degrees C increase in apparent melting temperature T(m) and a 30-fold increase in half-life at 50 degrees C, with no reduction in catalytic efficiency. The effects of the mutations were synergistic, giving an increase in excess of the sum of their individual effects. The redesigned enzyme induced an increased, temperature-dependent bacterial growth rate under conditions that required its activity, thereby coupling molecular and metabolic engineering."

https://openalex.org/W1972044649,"Mitochondrial fusion in higher eukaryotes requires at least two essential GTPases, Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). We have created an activated mutant of Mfn2, which shows increased rates of nucleotide exchange and decreased rates of hydrolysis relative to wild type Mfn2. Mitochondrial fusion is stimulated dramatically within heterokaryons expressing this mutant, demonstrating that hydrolysis is not requisite for the fusion event, and supporting a role for Mfn2 as a signaling GTPase. Although steady-state mitochondrial fusion required the conserved intermembrane space tryptophan residue, this requirement was overcome within the context of the hydrolysis-deficient mutant. Furthermore, the punctate localization of Mfn2 is lost in the dominant active mutants, indicating that these sites are functionally controlled by changes in the nucleotide state of Mfn2. Upon staurosporine-stimulated cell death, activated Bax is recruited to the Mfn2-containing puncta; however, Bax activation and cytochrome c release are inhibited in the presence of the dominant active mutants of Mfn2. The dominant active form of Mfn2 also protected the mitochondria against free radical-induced permeability transition. In contrast to staurosporine-induced outer membrane permeability transition, pore opening induced through the introduction of free radicals was dependent upon the conserved intermembrane space residue. This is the first evidence that Mfn2 is a signaling GTPase regulating mitochondrial fusion and that the nucleotide-dependent activation of Mfn2 concomitantly protects the organelle from permeability transition. The data provide new insights into the critical relationship between mitochondrial membrane dynamics and programmed cell death.

The data provide new insights into the critical relationship between mitochondrial membrane dynamics and programmed cell death. The mitochondria sit at the crossroad of hundreds of chemical reactions that are essential for the life and death of a cell. The dynamic behavior of these organelles has only just begun to be examined, and the implications of steady-state fission, fusion, motility, and cristae remodeling events in the control of the mitochondrial activity are not yet known. Studies in different model organisms are addressing this question by investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern mitochondrial dynamics to gain insights into the physiological triggers and consequences of these events.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). These proteins span the outer membrane twice, and in addition to their amino-terminal GTPase domain, they have two conserved hydrophobic heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, which are exposed to the cytosol (2Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The second HR2 domain of Mfn1 has been shown to facilitate mitochondrial tethering, and the crystal structure of the purified HR2 domain demonstrates that it can form a 100 Å antiparallel structure that could bind in trans to bridge mitochondria (7Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Another important region of Mfns is their short, 2-3-amino acid intermembrane space loop, which contains a highly conserved tryptophan residue. In yeast, this region of the protein is required for mitochondrial fusion and has been shown to anchor Fzo1p to sites of membrane contact between the inner and outer membrane (8Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although Mfn1 and Mfn2 are 60% identical, recent evidence with both in vitro mitochondrial docking assays and in rescue experiments of Mfn1 knock-out cells has shown that Mfn1 appears to play a more direct role in mitochondrial docking (7Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 9Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and that it functions in cooperation with the intermembrane space dynamin like GTPase Opa1 (autosomal dominant optical atrophy 1) (10Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The role of Mfn2 in mitochondrial fusion has remained elusive, although it is clearly required for fusion and can be found in heterodimeric complexes with Mfn1. Recent studies have shown that the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of the two Mfn proteins are distinct (9Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that the two GTPases regulate different steps along the fusion pathway (5Eura Y. Ishihara N. Yokota S. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These steps may include the processes that drive mitochondrial motility, tethering, assembly of a fusion pore to facilitate lipid bilayer mixing and eventually leading to inner mitochondrial membrane fusion. Given the complexity of these molecular requirements, the Mfn proteins do not act alone, and studies in yeast have identified a number of additional proteins required for mitochondrial fusion, including the outer membrane protein, Ugo1p (11Sesaki H.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), along with other candidates like Mdm35p, Mdm34p, and Mdm39p (18Dimmer K.S. Fritz S. Fuchs F. Messerschmitt M. Weinbach N. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). One of the outstanding questions in the field of mitochondrial dynamics remains the physiological importance of mitochondrial fission and fusion under steady-state conditions. Knock-outs of either Mfn1 or Mfn2 are embryonic lethal (6Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar), demonstrating an essential role of mitochondrial fusion for viability. In addition, mutations within the Mfn2 gene have been found in patients suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A, and six of seven of these mutations were found within the conserved GTPase region (19Kijima K. Numakura C. Izumino H. Umetsu K. Nezu A. Shiiki T. Ogawa M. Ishizaki Y. Kitamura T. Shozawa Y. Hayasaka K. Hum. Genet. 2005; 116: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Zuchner S.

Interestingly, evidence that Mfn2 may exhibit intracellular signaling activity has come from one study that identified the rat Mfn2 (called hyperplasia suppressor gene HSG) as an important antiproliferative protein, which interferes with the Ras pathway and blocks signaling from growth factor receptors at the plasma membrane (21Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for this inhibition is unknown, these findings suggest that Mfn2 and/or the morphological state of the mitochondria is highly integrated into cellular signaling cascades. Another example of how the mitochondrial morphology is integrated into cellular signaling events is the growing evidence for a role of mitochondrial dynamics in the progression of apoptosis. For example, two of the proteins required for mitochondrial fission, Fis1p and DRP1, are also essential for programmed cell death (22Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Fis1p knock-down by small interfering RNA blocks recruitment and activation of Bax at the surface of mitochondria after a death stimulus, indicating an essential role for this small integral membrane protein in apoptosis (25Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Similarly, although loss of DRP1 does not dramatically interfere with Bax activation, cytochrome c release is partially inhibited, and mitochondrial fission is blocked in these cells (25Lee Y.J.

In addition, small interfering RNA knock-down of Opa1, a protein required for mitochondrial fusion, results in fragmented mitochondria, which are highly sensitized to the loss of electrochemical potential and cytochrome c release (25Lee Y.J.

In contrast, overexpression of the two mitofusin proteins together provides some protection against different apoptotic stimuli (28Sugioka R. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52726-52734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These recent data highlight the dual roles of mitochondrial GTPases in the regulation of both mitochondrial dynamics and the mitochondrial contribution to programmed cell death. Given the increasing evidence that Mfn1 plays a direct role in mitochondrial tethering (5Eura Y. Ishihara N. Yokota S. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), we have specifically investigated the function of Mfn2 in the process of mitochondrial fusion and examined further how the GTPase activity of Mfn2 might contribute to the regulation of programmed cell death. Construct Preparation and Reagents—The cDNA encoding human Mfn2 (KIAA0214) was graciously provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. Mfn2 cDNA was PCR amplified using standard protocols, for insertion into pECFP-C1 (Clontech) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Mfn2RasG12V-CFP was prepared with QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pECFP-C1-Mfn2 as the template and a set of oligonucleotides designed to replace amino acids GRTSNGKS with GAVGVGKS. The restriction site NarI was introduced into the primers for screening purposes. The pcDNA3-GST, Mfn2-His6, and Mfn2RasG12V-His6 construct vectors for protein purification from transfected cell lysates were also prepared using subcloning techniques, and all sequences used in this work were confirmed. Mfn2W631P-CFP was prepared with QuikChange mutagenesis using pECFP-C1-Mfn2 as the template and a set of oligonucleotides designed to replace the tryptophan amino acid at position 631 with a proline. The ApaI restriction site was introduced into the primers for screening purposes. Mfn2RVWP-CFP was prepared by isolating the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-431 of Mfn2RasG12V-CFP by digestion with HindIII and SalI and subcloning this fragment containing the RasG12V mutation into the Mfn2W631P-CFP construct cut with the same enzymes, thereby replacing the wild type GTPase domain of Mfn2W631P-CFP with the Mfn2RasG12V mutation. The cDNA encoding DsRed2 was amplified from pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech) using primers designed for digestion with BamHI and XbaI and ligation into the pcDNA3-pOCT vector (29Harder Z. Zunino R. McBride H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tom7-GFP was obtained from Mike Ryan, La Trobe University, Melbourne Australia. Mfn2 mouse polyclonal antiserum was generated against a mixture containing both recombinantly expressed Mfn2(710-757)-GST and a synthetic Mfn2 NH2-terminal peptide CNSIVTVKKNKRIIM-OH (Dalton Chemical Laboratories, Toronto, Canada), conjugated to 5 mg of maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antiserum was generated following a 56-day standard immunization protocol. Polyclonal antibodies against fluorescent proteins (anti-FP) used for immunoelectron microscopy were purchased from Clontech. Dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was utilized to determine steady-state radical levels in transfected cells. Monoclonal 7H8.2C12 anti-cytochrome c antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences, and rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology cell signaling solutions. Alexa Fluor 350 and 594 goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes were used for staurosporine (STS) experiments. Z-VAD was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Aurora, Canada), and STS was obtained from Sigma. Transfection and Imaging of COS-7 Cells—Transfection and imaging methods were exactly as described in Ref. 29Harder Z. Zunino R. McBride H. Curr.

For electrochemical potential determination, cells were incubated with 50 nm MitoFluor Red 589 (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min. Whole cell images were acquired for untransfected and transfected cells by exciting at 589 nm with the CFP/YFP/DsRed triple pass filter (Chroma, Brattleboro, VT). The presence of transfected CFP-tagged protein was confirmed by exciting at 434 nm using the same filter set. Areas of interest were selected for each cell, and total fluorescence arbitrary units were summed for each cell. The total fluorescence intensity/cell was quantified as the sum of the values of each pixel within the area of interest minus the average background signal obtained/pixel. The number of cells within each fluorescence distribution range was scored and tabulated as a percentage. For MitoFluor Red 589 (Molecular Probes) flickering experiments, 50 nm dye was added to the chamber medium and incubated with the cells at 37 °C for 20 min. After equilibration of the dye, 400 images were collected by exciting at 589 nm with the CFP/YFP/DsRed triple pass filter (Chroma) for 1 s followed by a 2.5-s delay. The presence of transfected CFP-tagged protein was confirmed as indicated above. The time series were analyzed, and each frame where all mitochondrial dye was released from the whole cell was plotted. To determine steady-state radical loads, cells were incubated with 5 μm dihydroethidium at 37 °C for 20 min. Dihydroethidium oxidation by superoxide to ethidium was visualized by excitation at 547 nm. Whole cell imaging and fluorescence quantification for untransfected and transfected cells were performed as indicated above. Mant GMP-PNP Binding Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with pOCT-CFP, Mfn2-CFP, Mfn2RasG12V-CFP, and Rab5-CFP fusion constructs. The day after transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsin treatment, washed with PBS and with nucleotide binding buffer (220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were then broken in a cell cracker, and the whole lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to concentrate heavy membrane fractions. Pellets were resuspended in binding buffer, and 50-μl aliquots were mixed with Mant GMP-PNP (1 μm final concentration, Molecular Probes) and incubated at 37 °C for different times. After incubation the aliquots were scanned for emission fluorescence of Mant nucleotides in a QuantaMaster 6000SE (Photon Technology International, London, Canada) (excitation at 360 nm). The peak emission at 448 nm was recorded, and the background fluorescence of the nucleotide alone was subtracted. Each value was also normalized for total protein concentration in the sample (determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad)) and for the level of recombinant protein expression by measuring the CFP signal obtained in the fluorometer upon excitation at 434 nm, emission at 477 nm. For the purification of GST, Mfn2-GST, and Mfn2RasG12V-GST from transfected cell lysates, 10-cm dishes of COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and after 12 h they were treated with trypsin, washed, and lysed with TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm, EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 μg/ml chymotrypsin, 1 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μm 4-aminidophenylmethane-sulphonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A), containing 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were adjusted to 40% sucrose and centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted to 10% sucrose with TNE + Triton X-100 buffer and were incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and GST fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione in TNE buffer + 10% sucrose. Eluted aliquots (50-μl elutions) were incubated in duplicate with 0.2 μm Mant GMP-PNP for 15 min. at 37 °C and assayed for fluorescence (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 448 nm). Normalization was done by assaying the enzymatic activity of GST within each aliquot, with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Sigma) and glutathione as substrates, with formation of a product with absorbance at 340 nm (Amersham Biosciences), being the product formation rate proportional to the amount of GST in the aliquots. Known concentrations of bacterially purified GST were used as a standard in this assay. Bacterially expressed Rab5-GST was purified as described previously (30Christoforidis S. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GTP Hydrolysis Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with Mfn2-His6, Mfn2RasG12V-His6, or LacZ-His6, and the following day cells were washed with PBS, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in a small volume of TNX solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 1 h at 4 C. Lysates were then cleared at 70,000 × g in a TLA 110 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were then centrifuged and washed twice with TNX buffer containing 200 μm ATP (to remove chaperones and other nonspecific proteins of the lysate) followed by two more washes with TNX buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with series of 100 and 200 mm imidazole in TNX buffer, and concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad method. 10 μg of the different eluted proteins were preloaded with 1 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (2,000 Ci/mmol) in exchange buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) by incubating for 30 s at 37 °C in a 140-μl volume. The reaction was then diluted 10 times to trap the nucleotide in place and begin [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis. From this mix, aliquots were taken, in triplicate, at different time points (0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min), applied to nitrocellulose filters in a vacuum manifold, and flushed immediately with 1 ml of PBS (to remove unbound nucleotide and hydrolyzed 32P). Filters were then placed in vials and assayed for 32P scintillation counting. Electron Microscopy—COS-7 cells were transfected with the appropriate cDNA in 10-cm dishes with Lipofectamine 2000 for 16 h. Following this, fluorescence was first examined using the light microscope to ensure that transfection was at least 70% prior to trypsin treatment and washing of the cells in PBS. The washed cells were then pelleted and fixed in 1.6% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer prior to osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate staining, spur resin embedding, and final thin sectioning of the blocks, and the grids were stained with lead citrate. For immunoelectron microscopy, the same transfection procedure was followed. Cells were treated with trypsin, washed in PBS, fixed in 1.6% glutaraldehyde, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min. Cell pellets were embedded in LR white (Marivac, PQ, Canada), thin sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut E ultramicrotome, immunolabeled with polyclonal anti-FP antibodies and 10 nm gold-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Cells were then counterstained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Digital images were taken using a JEOL 1230 TEM at 60 kV adapted with a 2,000 by 2,000 pixel bottom mount CCD digital camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and AMT software. PEG Fusion Assay—The whole cell fusion assay was performed as described previously (4Legros F. Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Given that the broad excitation spectra of DsRed overlaps with the GFP excitation wavelength, special precautions were taken to ensure that the images of fused mitochondria did not include any bleed-through between the channels. For this, live cells were imaged on the Olympus IX70 microscope with a 100 × objective U Plan Apochromat, NA 1.35-0.50 objective, exited at 488 nm (GFP) and 560 nm (DsRed) with the Polychrome IV monochrometer (TillPhotonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) through a fluorescein isothiocyanate/Cy3/Cy5 triple pass filter (Chroma). The emitted light was filtered through an additional dual view beam splitter (Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM) equipped with two filters HQ520/20 and D600/40 to separate the GFP and DsRed emission signals, and images were captured as described above. The transfected CFP-tagged protein was imaged using the CFP/YFP dual pass filter (TillPhotonics) along with the beam splitter equipped with D465/30 and HQ535/30 filters (data not shown). The acquired images were saved as .tiff images and overlaid in Adobe Photoshop for image assembly. Creation of a Hydrolysis-deficient Mutant of Mfn2—To determine whether nucleotide hydrolysis of Mfn2 was essential for mitochondrial fusion, we constructed a RasG12V mutant. Our purpose in designing the mutant was to maintain nucleotide binding and exchange properties of Mfn2 and yet reduce the intrinsic rate of nucleotide hydrolysis. Therefore we replaced the residues within the P-loop with those from the activated RasG12V (31Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 32Franken S.M. Scheidig A.J. Krengel U. Rensland H. Lautwein A. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Goody R.S. Kalbitzer H.R. Pai E.F.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar)). We first compared the nucleotide exchange properties of this mutation (Mfn2RasG12V) with wild type Mfn2 and controls by using crude extracts from cells transfected with CFP fusion proteins. COS-7 cells were transfected with matrix-targeted CFP (negative control), wild type Mfn2-CFP, Mfn2RasG12V-CFP, or Rab5-CFP as a positive control. Rab5 is the best characterized of the Rab GTPases and is known to regulate early endosome fusion (35Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Regulatory GTPases of the Ras family are all characterized by their low intrinsic rates of hydrolysis and high nucleotide affinities, which results in stable nucleotide states that require accessory proteins for their activity. Given the evidence that Mfn2 exhibits low rates of nucleotide hydrolysis and high affinity (9Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), it is relevant to use Rab5 as a positive control in these assays. After transfection with CFP-tagged constructs, the cells were harvested, broken, and the mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fractions were incubated with the environment-sensitive nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Mant GMP-PNP (36Scheidig A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2125732396,"We tested the hypothesis that 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important role in regulating the acute, exercise-induced activation of metabolic genes in skeletal muscle, which were dissected from whole-body alpha2- and alpha1-AMPK knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice at rest, after treadmill running (90 min), and in recovery. Running increased alpha1-AMPK kinase activity, phosphorylation (P) of AMPK, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)beta in alpha2-WT and alpha2-KO muscles and increased alpha2-AMPK kinase activity in alpha2-WT. In alpha2-KO muscles, AMPK-P and ACCbeta-P were markedly lower compared with alpha2-WT. However, in alpha1-WT and alpha1-KO muscles, AMPK-P and ACCbeta-P levels were identical at rest and increased similarly during exercise in the two genotypes. The alpha2-KO decreased peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha, uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), and hexokinase II (HKII) transcription at rest but did not affect exercise-induced transcription. Exercise increased the mRNA content of PGC-1alpha, Forkhead box class O (FOXO)1, HKII, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) similarly in alpha2-WT and alpha2-KO mice, whereas glucose transporter GLUT 4, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPTI), lipoprotein lipase, and UCP3 mRNA were unchanged by exercise in both genotypes. CPTI mRNA was lower in alpha2-KO muscles than in alpha2-WT muscles at all time-points. In alpha1-WT and alpha1-KO muscles, running increased the mRNA content of PGC-1alpha and FOXO1 similarly. The alpha2-KO was associated with lower muscle adenosine 5'-triphosphate content, and the inosine monophosphate content increased substantially at the end of exercise only in alpha2-KO muscles. In addition, subcutaneous injection of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) increased the mRNA content of PGC-1alpha, HKII, FOXO1, PDK4, and UCP3, and alpha2-KO abolished the AICAR-induced increases in PGC-1alpha and HKII mRNA. In conclusion, KO of the alpha2- but not the alpha1-AMPK isoform markedly diminished AMPK activation during running. Nevertheless, exercise-induced activation of the investigated genes in mouse skeletal muscle was not impaired in alpha1- or alpha2-AMPK KO muscles. Although it cannot be ruled out that activation of the remaining alpha-isoform is sufficient to increase gene activation during exercise, the present data do not support an essential role of AMPK in regulating exercise-induced gene activation in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2156297841,"Zooplankton reside in a constantly flowing environment. However, information about their response to ambient flow has remained elusive, because of the difficulties of following the individual motions of these minute, nearly transparent animals in the ocean. Using a three-dimensional acoustic imaging system, we tracked >375,000 zooplankters at two coastal sites in the Red Sea. Resolution of their motion from that of the water showed that the animals effectively maintained their depth by swimming against upwelling and downwelling currents moving at rates of up to tens of body lengths per second, causing their accumulation at frontal zones. This mechanism explains how oceanic fronts become major feeding grounds for predators and targets for fishermen."
https://openalex.org/W2005517764,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, have been shown to positively impact vascular function independent of their plasma lipid-lowering action. Several of these beneficial effects involve modulation of gene expression. Here we explored whether the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a biomechanically activated gene we recently identified as part of the endothelial “atheroprotective phenotype,” is regulated by statins and whether this mechanism is important for the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects mediated by these drugs in endothelium. The mRNA levels of KLF2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells increased in the presence of various statins. KLF2 induction was observed within 8 h after drug treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 h. This statin effect on KLF2 expression was reversed by addition of mevalonate and its downstream metabolite geranygeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation with GGTI-298 significantly induced KLF2 levels, whereas inhibition of farnesylation did not. Statin-mediated KLF2 expression was followed by the up-regulation of several of its downstream transcriptional targets. Using small interfering RNA to block KLF2 expression, we demonstrated that this transcription factor is necessary for the statin-mediated regulation of several pathophysiologically relevant genes. These results strongly implicate KLF2 as a transcriptional regulator of the statin-mediated effects in vascular endothelium and provide a novel mechanism for the well established non-lipid lowering beneficial cardiovascular effects of statins. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, have been shown to positively impact vascular function independent of their plasma lipid-lowering action.

Statins act to reduce plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; LDL, low density lipoprotein; EC, endothelial cells; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; KLF, Kruppel-like factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; GGPP, geranygeranyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ASS, argininosuccinate synthetase; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; PTGDS, prostaglandin D2 synthase; eNOS, endothelial nitricoxide synthase. reductase and currently constitute the most widely prescribed class of drugs for the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, many of the clinical benefits afforded by these drugs appear to be mechanistically unrelated to their lipid-lowering effects (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Circulation. 2004; 109: II18-III26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). These non-lipid-lowering beneficial effects include improvement in the production of endothelial derived relaxing factor as well as other aspects of endothelial dysfunction (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 3Davignon J. Circulation. 2004; 109: III39-III43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, short term statin treatment improves NO-mediated vasodilation and myocardial perfusion before changes in LDL-cholesterol can be detected (4Laufs U. Wassmann S. Hilgers S. Ribaudo N. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 1306-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 5O'Driscoll G. Green D. Taylor R.R. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Because the clinical benefits in patients on statins occur early in the course of therapy, are seen in patients with LDL-cholesterol levels that are within the normal range, and often appear not to be correlated directly with the degree of LDL-cholesterol reduction, it has been suggested that these benefits may be a result of yet-to-be-defined direct vascular actions, in particular in the endothelium (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Circulation. 2004; 109: II18-III26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ridker P.M. Cannon C.P. Morrow D. Rifai N. Rose L.M. McCabe C.H. Pfeffer M.A. Braunwald E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, statins have been shown to transcriptionally up-regulate eNOS gene expression, stabilize eNOS mRNA, as well as directly influence the activity of the enzyme in endothelium (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). In addition, statins also suppress the expression of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (EDN-1) in endothelial cells (EC) (8Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. Navarro-Antolin J. Sanchez-Pascuala R. Hernandez G. Diaz C. Lamas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs on various cell types implicated in atherosclerosis, including endothelial cells (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Circulation. 2004; 109: II18-III26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects include endothelial suppression of adhesion molecule (VCAM-1, E-selectin) and cytokine/chemokine (MCP-1, IL-8, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)) expression both in vitro and in vivo; additionally, these effects are correlated with reduced macrophage infiltration in early atheroma (9Aikawa M.

Statins also have been shown to reduce endothelial thrombogenicity, in part via induction of thrombomodulin expression. Thrombomodulin is an endothelial-specific cell surface molecule that generates activated protein C, a potent inhibitor of the coagulation cascade as well as an anti-inflammatory substance (11Masamura K. Oida K. Kanehara H. Suzuki J. Horie S. Ishii H. Miyamori I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The net beneficial pathophysiological influence of these various non-lipid lowering transcriptional effects of statins on endothelial cells strongly suggests these changes may be a major component of their clinical efficacy. KLF2 is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor implicated in blood vessel development and T lymphocyte activation (12Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovasc.

Expression of KLF2 in cultured EC is increased by steady laminar shear stress, a biomechanical stimulus (15Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H.

Moreover, we have demonstrated induction of KLF2 in cultured human EC in response to the complex hemodynamic environment found in regions of the carotid bifurcation that are resistant to the development of atherosclerosis, thus suggesting that this transcription factor may exert an “atheroprotective” function (15Dekker R.J. van Soest S.

Interestingly, using in situ hybridization, Dekker et al. (15Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J.

Recent work in our laboratory indicates this transcription factor regulates multiple endothelial functions by acting as an integrator of hemodynamic and humoral stimuli. 2K. Parmar, Y. Zhang, G.

Because the KLF2-dependent transcriptional and functional effects observed in endothelial cells exposed to atheroprotective flow were reminiscent of the previously reported statin-mediated changes in endothelial gene expression, we directly examined whether KLF2 and its transcriptional targets are regulated directly by statins. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were plated at densities of 60,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates (Costar) in medium 199 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Research), 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin-G + 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker), 2 mm l-Gln (Invitrogen), and 20% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). Cells were allowed to grow to confluence for 24 h while incubated under 37 °C and 5% CO2 conditions. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time Taqman PCR—RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and real-time Taqman PCR were performed essentially as described previously (17Dai G. Kaazempur-Mofrad M.R. Natarajan S. Zhang Y. Vaughn S. Blackman B.R. Kamm R.D. Garcia-Cardena G. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was ethanol-precipitated from the TRIzol lysates, and integrity was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano-Assay using a microfluidics system, 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Expression of β-2-microglobulin was used as an endogenous control in all experiments. Statin Dose and Time Response—After initial culturing as described above, 2 ml of fresh media were added with different statins at concentrations of either 100 nm or 1 μm. Cerivastatin was a kind gift from K. Shimizu and R. Mitchell. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin were obtained from Calbiochem, Inc. and solubilized in ethanol. Control medium (0 nm statin) was also assessed, as was medium treated solely with 20 μl of ethanol to serve as a vehicle control for the lovastatin and simvastatin solutions. Cells were again incubated for 24 h under 37 °C and 5% CO2 conditions, rinsed with DPBS, and harvested in 500 μl of TRIzol (Invitrogen). For the cerivastatin dose response, cells were cultured in fresh media with either 0 (control), 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, or 10 μm cerivastatin, and cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed with DPBS and harvested in 500 μl of TRIzol. For the cerivastatin time course response, HUVECs were plated as usual before addition of either 0 (control) or 100 nm concentration of cerivastatin in fresh medium. Cells were then incubated for 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. At the corresponding time intervals, cells were rinsed with DPBS and harvested in 500 μl of TRIzol. Mevalonate, Isoprenoid, and Inhibitor Experiments—HUVEC were cultured in the presence of 100 nm cerivastatin with or without varying concentrations of mevalonate, geranygeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), or farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (Sigma) for 24 h (mevalonate) or 8 h (GGPP, FPP) before RNA isolation and quantitation. Purity of GGPP and FPP was reported by the manufacturer to be 100% by TLC for the batches used in these experiments. Methanol was used as carrier control. GGTI-298 and FTI-277 (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO, and the carrier control also used the same dilution of Me2SO in media. Cells were cultured with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 8 h before TRIzol lysates were obtained. siRNA Experiments—HUVEC were transfected with two KLF2 siRNAs synthesized by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The sense and antisense strands of human KLF2 siRNA were: (a) 5′-CCAAGAGUUCGCATCUGAATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUCAGAUGCGAACUCUUGGTG-3′ (antisense) and (b) 5′-GCGGCAAGACCUACACCAATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUGGUGUAGGUCUUGCCGCAG-3′ (antisense). Negative control siRNA were 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′ (antisense). HUVEC were plated 16 h prior to transfection at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2 in HUVEC growth medium without antibiotics. At the time of transfection with siRNA, the cells were 85–95% confluent. Individual siRNAs (KLF2 siRNA a and b, 0.6 nmol each, or negative control siRNA, 1.2 nmol) were mixed with Oligofectamine (8 μl) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 200 μl and incubated at room temperature for 15 min for the lipid-siRNA complex to form. Cells were washed once, and 800 μl of Opti-MEM was added. 200 μl of the Oligofectamine-siRNA complex solution was then added to the cells. The cells were then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. HUVEC growth medium was then added, and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. Statins were added as described above, and total RNA was isolated 24 h later. To investigate whether KLF2 may play a role in controlling the transcriptional expression of multiple endothelial genes modulated by statins, we asked whether statins regulate the expression levels of KLF2. Incubation of cultured HUVEC with two doses (100 nm and 1 μm) of four different statins for 12 h revealed a significant up-regulation of KLF2 for three of them, with cerivastatin mediating the strongest increase of about 8-fold (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, pravastatin had no effect on KLF2 expression at either of the concentrations tested, which is consistent with other studies examining transcriptional changes in response to this relatively hydrophilic statin (11Masamura K. Oida K. Kanehara H. Suzuki J. Horie S. Ishii H. Miyamori I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of KLF2 in HUVEC appears to be a general class effect of statins. The time course of KLF2 induction by cerivastatin was assessed by measuring KLF2 levels in HUVEC at different time points following incubation with the drug at a dose of 100 nm (Fig. 1B). The first detectable increase of KLF2 was observed at 4 h, and it peaked at 8 h. While KLF2 levels remained elevated past 8 h compared with control, the cerivastatin-mediated induction was slightly less at the later time points. These data indicate that KLF2 levels peak at 8 h in response to cerivastatin treatment and remain elevated up to at least 24 h, suggesting the change in KLF2 expression is not a rapid transient response. By inhibiting the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, statins deplete cells of this immediate metabolite of the enzyme, mevalonate, and its downstream products (Fig. 2A). To test whether the cerivastatin-mediated KLF2 up-regulation is dependent on inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, we tested whether adding back mevalonate to the cells would reverse the effect of cerivastatin. Cells were incubated with or without cerivastatin, and with a range of concentrations of mevalonate, for 24 h. Mevalonate, or the ethanol vehicle alone, had no effect on KLF2 expression if cerivastatin was not present (Fig. 2B). Cerivastatin increased KLF2 levels as shown previously, and this induction was progressively lost with increasing concentrations of mevalonate in the media. Mevalonate thus reverses the effects of cerivastatin on KLF2 expression in a dose-related manner, indicating these changes are dependent on inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate yields the downstream products FPP and GGPP. These isoprenoids serve to tether important signaling proteins (e.g. Ras, Rho, Rac) to cell membranes and thereby regulate their activity (Fig. 2A). To determine whether one of these arms of the mevalonate pathway was particularly important for the observed statin-mediated effects on KLF2 expression, FPP or GGPP was added to the medium of HUVEC treated with cerivastatin for 8 h. Incubation of HUVEC with FPP or GGPP alone had no effect on basal KLF2 expression (Fig. 2C). Addition of FPP (10 μm) modestly yet significantly reduced KLF2 up-regulation in the presence of cerivastatin. However, treatment with GGPP (10 μm) was able to completely reverse the cerivastatin-mediated KLF2 induction. This suggests that statins up-regulate KLF2 levels in HUVEC primarily by depleting GGPP from endothelial cells. To further confirm the role of cellular GGPP in KLF2 regulation by statins, we made use of an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase or farnesyl transferase, the enzymes that covalently attach GGPP or FPP to proteins, respectively. Incubation of HUVEC with the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, GGTI-298, resulted in a dose-related up-regulation of KLF2 (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of farnesyl transferase with FTI-277 was not able to reproduce this effect at similar concentrations. The maximal induction by GGTI-298 of KLF2 expression (15-fold) was comparable with that attained with cerivastatin, indicating that GGTI-298 could mimic the statin-mediated effect on KLF2 expression. Utilizing a novel in vitro model that accurately simulates shear stress waveforms present in vivo in atherosclerosis-susceptible and atherosclerosis-resistant regions of the human carotid artery, we demonstrated that EC exposed to these two types of biomechanical stimuli display distinct patterns of gene expression and functional phenotypes (17Dai G. Kaazempur-Mofrad M.R. Natarajan S. Zhang Y. Vaughn S. Blackman B.R. Kamm R.D. Garcia-Cardena G. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). For example, EC exposed to the wall shear stress waveforms present in atherosclerosis-resistant arterial geometries expressed genes characteristic of anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic endothelial phenotypes. We have also recently demonstrated that the expression of the transcription factor KLF2 and several of its transcriptional targets are uniquely induced by the atheroprotective waveform and that the flow-mediated KLF2 expression confers an atheroprotective endothelial phenotype.2 If statins also modulate their major transcriptional targets by up-regulating KLF2 expression, we would predict that KLF2 induction by statins would precede the statin-mediated regulation of its downstream transcriptional targets. Because we found KLF2 up-regulation to first appear at 4 h and peak by 8 h, we tested the expression of important established and novel KLF2 targets after 8 and 24 h of incubation with 100 nm cerivastatin (Fig. 3A). Three of the most highly regulated transcriptional targets of KLF2 are argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS). ASS is a limiting factor for eNOS substrate bioavailability, while CNP is an endothelial secreted peptide that also functions in vasodilation. PTGDS produces as one of its products the most potent known endogenous ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, 15d-PGJ2, which has well characterized anti-inflammatory activity (19Pasceri V. Wu H.D. Willerson J.T. Yeh E.T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed, for the targets tested, a significant up-regulation of CNP by the cerivastatin treatment at the 8 and 24 h time points and only at the 24 h time point for the rest of the targets (Fig. 3A). Because KLF2 induction is detectable at 4 h, it is clear that these targets are regulated at a later time point, consistent with a primary regulatory role of KLF2 in their transcriptional response to cerivastatin. To test the role of KLF2 up-regulation in statin-mediated effects in endothelial cells, we prevented the cerivastatin-mediated induction of KLF2 using siRNA. Cerivastatin treatment of endothelial cells preincubated with KLF2 siRNA resulted in KLF2 levels similar to control conditions (Fig. 3B). To assess the functional consequences under these conditions, we analyzed the expression of various transcriptional targets previously identified as being responsive to statins (20Morikawa S. Takabe W. Mataki C. Wada Y. Izumi A. Saito Y. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2004; 11: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Of the genes known to be regulated by statins, we found that the up-regulation of thrombomodulin, eNOS, and integrin β4 by cerivastatin (100 nm) was completely lost when up-regulation of KLF2 was inhibited (Fig. 3B). Down-regulation of MCP-1, which has been proposed as an important anti-inflammatory effect of the statins, also was lost if KLF2 up-regulation was blocked. We also asked whether the novel transcriptional targets we have identified as KLF2-regulated were responsive to cerivastatin. All three of these targets (ASS, CNP, PTGDS) were potently regulated by cerivastatin, but abrogation of KLF2 up-regulation abolished their induction by the drug. Up-regulation of KLF2 thus appears to be required for multiple pathophysiologically relevant changes in endothelial gene expression induced by cerivastatin. There is growing evidence that the clinical benefits from the use of statins may derive from their effects on processes and cell types beyond those involved in systemic reduction of plasma cholesterol levels (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Circulation. 2004; 109: II18-III26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One aspect of great interest is the direct vascular effects of statins, particularly on the endothelium (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). While some biologically important direct effects of these drugs on the vascular endothelium are clearly rapid, and therefore probably not a result of transcriptional regulation (e.g. phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt) (21Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 22Harris M.B. Blackstone M.A. Sood S.G. Li C. Goolsby J.M. Venema V.J. Kemp B.E. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H560-H566Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), many studies indicate that important transcriptional changes do occur in endothelial cells exposed to statins, changes that would act to confer a “vasoprotective” or atheroprotective effect (11Masamura K. Oida K. Kanehara H. Suzuki J. Horie S. Ishii H. Miyamori I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Dichtl W. Dulak J. Frick M. Alber H.F.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Here we identify KLF2 as a transcriptional target of statins and demonstrate its requirement in statin-dependent endothelial transcriptional changes. Of four statins tested, three (simvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin) were shown to induce endothelial KLF2 expression at pharmacological concentrations achieved in patients (25Garcia M.J. Reinoso R.F. Sanchez Navarro A. Prous J.R. Methods Find Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2003; 25: 457-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Stein E. Isaacsohn J. Stoltz R. Mazzu A. Liu M.C. Lane C. Heller A.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 1433-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pravastatin had no effect at the concentrations tested, possibly due to its relative hydrophilicity, which would predictably limit its entry into endothelial cells by passive diffusion (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Our finding that pravastatin had the least efficacy in inducing KLF2 also parallels findings regarding this drug in other studies using several cultured cell types, including endothelial cells (11Masamura K. Oida K. Kanehara H. Suzuki J. Horie S. Ishii H. Miyamori I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The time course of KLF2 up-regulation is rapid and precedes the regulation of all the other statin targets ass, consistent with an upstream role of KLF2 on these transcriptional targets. Importantly, these statin-mediated effects are reversed by addition of mevalonate, indicating that the effect is dependent on inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The downstream products of mevalonate include isoprenoids that are critical for post-translational modification of major signaling molecules such as Ras, Rho, and Rac, allowing for membrane localization and signaling (27Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We found that exogenous addition of GGPP, but not FPP, could completely reverse the effects of statins on KLF2 expression, implying the observed changes are mediated by depleting cells of GGPP-dependent biochemical processes. Because FPP is metabolized to form squalene and ultimately cholesterol, this result also suggests that deprivation of these molecules cannot explain our observed induction of KLF2. Nevertheless, the modest yet significant contribution we observed for FPP in the statin-dependent up-regulation of KLF2 may suggest a minor contribution of the sterol pathway. Importantly, we observed that the cerivastatin-dependent induction of KLF2 was reproduced with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor in a dose-related fashion but not with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Taken together, our data thus point to statins up-regulating endothelial KLF2 via depletion of GGPP-dependent signaling pathways in these cells. GGPP, but not FPP, is critical for the activity of Rho superfamily proteins (e.g. Rho, Rac) among many others. Determining which of the geranylgeranylated signaling molecules responsible for the change in KLF2 expression could possibly reveal a pathway that mediates tonic suppression of KLF2 under control (no drug) conditions, possibly at the transcriptional level or via epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. chromatin modifications). Addition of statins or GGTIs in this model would limit the activity of this suppressive pathway, thus allowing KLF2 to be expressed highly. It will thus be of great interest to test the in vivo effects on atherosclerosis by GGTIs, which would have no predicted effect on the lipid profile while potently inducing KLF2 in endothelial cells and possibly other cell types. When statins are administered to patients, these drugs most likely affect other cell types involved in inflammation in addition to endothelial cells, including lymphocytes. Importantly, KLF2 expression has been demonstrated in lymphocytes, and its absence leads to a constitutively activated phenotype in T cells (13Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Given the importance of KLF2 for endothelial gene expression in response to statins, and the demonstrated inhibitory effects of statins on lymphocyte function, it will be critical to assess whether there exists an analogous role for KLF2 in lymphocytes to further explain the currently growing immunomodulatory view of statins in the context of atherogenesis (28Blanco-Colio L.M. Munoz-Garcia B. Martin-Ventura J.L. Lorz C. Diaz C. Hernandez G. Egido J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have identified CNP, an endothelial secreted vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory peptide that acts on adjacent smooth muscle cells (29Chauhan S.D. Nilsson H. Ahluwalia A. Hobbs A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Qian J.Y. Haruno A. Asada Y. Nishida T. Saito Y. Matsuda T. Ueno H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as a potently induced target of KLF2 and statins in endothelial cells. To date, biomarkers for pathobiological changes in the cardiovascular system largely detect later stage processes in which various cell types (e.g. platelets, inflammatory cells) and molecules (e.g. tPA, PAI-1) are involved (31Ridker P.M. Brown N.J. Vaughan D.E. Harrison D.G. Mehta J.L. Circulation. 2004; 109: IV6-IV19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, attention has been focused on serum markers that serve as an overall index of “systemic inflammation” (e.g. C-reactive protein, CRP) and show a strong correlation with the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (32Ridker P.M. Rifai N. Rose L. Buring J.E. Cook N.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 33Ridker P.M. Hennekens C.H. Buring J.E. Rifai N. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (5069) Google Scholar, 34Albert M.A. Glynn R.J. Ridker P.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, it would be very desirable to identify circulating biomarkers that can act as more direct indicators of endothelial dysfunction, because current clinical evidence suggests that the earliest pathophysiologic predictors of atherosclerosis and its comorbidities (e.g. metabolic syndrome X) may be subtle deficiencies in proper endothelial functioning (35McVeigh G.E. Cohn J.N. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2003; 3: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Davignon J. Ganz P. Circulation. 2004; 109: III27-III32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial dysfunction has classically been characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, largely attributed to endothelial-derived NO (37Russo G. Leopold J.A. Loscalzo J. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Ludmer P.L. Selwyn A.P. Shook T.L. Wayne R.R. Mudge G.H. Alexander R.W. Ganz P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Circulating biomarkers of “healthy” endothelial function would be useful to detect the earliest deficiencies in endothelial function and the effects of statins on this important parameter. Intriguingly, CNP is an endothelial paracrine factor that has been implicated in endothelial-dependent vasodilation in certain vascular beds, in addition to having suppressive effects on neointimal hyperplasia (29Chauhan S.D. Nilsson H. Ahluwalia A. Hobbs A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 39Ohno N. Itoh H. Ikeda T. Ueyama K. Yamahara K. Doi K. Yamashita J. Inoue M. Masatsugu K. Sawada N. Fukunaga Y. Sakaguchi S. Sone M. Yurugi T. Kook H. Komeda M. Nakao K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1623-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CNP acts mainly in a paracrine fashion on adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells by impinging on the cGMP pathway that is also responsive to NO (40Scotland R.S. Ahluwalia A. Hobbs A.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 105: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that CNP is dramatically induced by statins in a KLF2-dependent manner introduces this molecule as a possible circulating biomarker of endothelial function and a potentially useful index of the vascular effects of statin treatment. The expression of KLF2 was originally shown to be up-regulated in cultured endothelial cells by steady laminar shear stress and documented histochemically to be expressed relatively specifically in atherosclerosis-resistant geometries of human arteries (15Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we demonstrated that KLF2 expression is higher in cultured endothelial cells exposed to an atheroprotective shear stress waveform, as compared with the “atheroprone” waveform, or to static (no flow) conditions (17Dai G. Kaazempur-Mofrad M.R. Natarajan S. Zhang Y. Vaughn S. Blackman B.R. Kamm R.D. Garcia-Cardena G. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Recent work in our laboratory utilizing genome-wide microarray analysis has revealed KLF2 as a key regulator of multiple endothelial functions including but not limited to blood vessel formation, control of vascular tone, inflammation, and coagulation.2 Moreover, RNAi induced “silencing” of KLF2 expression in endothelial cells exposed to atheroprotective shear stress stimulation leads to the marked suppression of atheroprotective gene expression and the flow-mediated atheroprotective phenotype.2 In addition, overexpression experiments have demonstrated a role for KLF2 in the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic endothelial phenotype (16SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp.

Jain M.K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: e48-e57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of KLF2 as a major target of statins, one of the most widely used class of drugs for cardiovascular disease, raises the possibility that statins could promote a global atheroprotective endothelial phenotype that is largely dependent on KLF2 up-regulation. Indeed, experiments recently performed in our laboratory have shown that statins are able to shift the flow-mediated atheroprone phenotype observed in endothelial cells exposed to a waveform characteristic of atherosclerosis-susceptible regions of the human carotid toward the flow-mediated atheroprotective phenotype, as assessed by genome-wide analysis of transcriptional regulation. 3H. B. Larman and G. García-Cardeña, unpublished observations. Importantly, here we demonstrated that KLF2 is both necessary and sufficient to modulate many of the known endothelial atheroprotective transcriptional responses characterized to date for statins. Given the pleiotropy of KLF2 in endothelial function, and its intimate relationship to the beneficial effects of statins on the vascular endothelium, designing drugs specifically to modulate endothelial KLF2 expression, or its downstream effectors, could result in novel therapies promoting vascular health in various diseases in which endothelial dysfunction plays a pathogenic role.

Although peptide analogs can activate PAR-1, we show that the functional responses mediated via PAR-1 differ between the agonists. Thrombin caused endothelial monolayer permeability and mobilized intracellular calcium with EC50 values of 0.1 and 1.7 nm, respectively. The opposite order of activation was observed for agonist peptide (SFLLRN-CONH2 or TFLLRNKPDK) activation. The addition of inactivated thrombin did not affect agonist peptide signaling, suggesting that the differences in activation mechanisms are intramolecular in origin. Although activation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 by agonist peptides induced calcium mobilization, only PAR-1 activation affected barrier function. Induced barrier permeability is likely to be Gα12/13-mediated as chelation of Gαq-mediated intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM, pertussis toxin inhibition of Gαi/o, or GM6001 inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase had no effect, whereas Y-27632 inhibition of the Gα12/13-mediated Rho kinase abrogated the response. Similarly, calcium mobilization is Gαq-mediated and independent of Gαi/o and Gα12/13 because pertussis toxin Y-27632 and had no effect, whereas U-73122 inhibition of phospholipase C-β blocked the response. It is therefore likely that changes in permeability reflect Gα12/13 activation, and changes in calcium reflect Gαq activation, implying that the pharmacological differences between agonists are likely caused by the ability of the receptor to activate Gα12/13 or Gαq. This functional selectivity was characterized quantitatively by a mathematical model describing each step leading to Rho activation and/or calcium mobilization.

We show here that two different protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) agonist peptides, SFLLRN-CONH2 and the PAR-1-specific TFLLRNKPDK, activate PAR-1 in a fashion different from that of thrombin-mediated cleavage of the amino terminus of the receptor. This was accomplished by investigating two functionally different endothelial responses: 1) induced endothelial barrier permeability and 2) induced intracellular calcium mobilization. When compared, the ability of thrombin or agonist peptide to elicit these responses was significantly different. The vascular endothelium serves as a regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the interstitial tissues. Thrombin is a major inflammatory factor that mediates the contraction of endothelial cells leading to increased permeability of the barrier and vascular edema. Although antagonists have recently been developed to target PAR-1 (10Andrade-Gordon P. Derian C.K. Maryanoff B.E. Zhang H.C. Addo M.F. Cheung W. Damiano B.P. D'Andrea M.R. Darrow A.L. de Garavilla L. Eckardt A.J. Giardino E.C. Haertlein B.J. McComsey D.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 34-42PubMed Google Scholar) and PAR-4 (11Hollenberg M.D. Saifeddine M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 439-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), currently there is no way to inhibit the effects of thrombin on vascular edema selectively except by inhibiting thrombin, which also inhibits clotting and leads to increased risks of bleeding disorders. Inhibition of PAR signaling in the endothelium without disabling the role of thrombin in hemostasis would be more therapeutically beneficial. The four isoforms of PAR-1 form a unique class of GPCRs. Activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular amino terminus, the newly exposed terminus serves as a tethered ligand, folding back onto the receptor, thereby activating it. Unlike the other PARs, which are cleaved by the protease thrombin, PAR-2 is trypsin- and not thrombin-sensitive (12Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, PAR-1 and PAR-2 are thought to mediate signaling in the endothelium, whereas PAR-1 and PAR-4 are thought to mediate signaling in platelets (13Hirano K. Kanaide H. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2003; 10: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the signaling properties of PAR-3 are still unclear. To date there is no clear evidence that PAR-3 can participate in intracellular signaling (14Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R.

Activated by thrombin, PAR-1 exerts its effects on the endothelium by concomitant activation of the Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12/13 families of G proteins (18Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

However, it is also well established that in primary endothelial cells, thrombin-induced barrier permeability is dependent not only upon Rho activation but also calcium mobilization (27Wojciak-Stothard B. Ridley A.J. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 28Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vasc.

To the contrary, we show here that in the transformed cell line human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), thrombin-induced barrier permeability is dependent solely upon a Rho kinase-mediated pathway initiated by Gα12/13 activation and not Gαq or Gαi/o. We also show that thrombin-induced calcium mobilization is mediated by Gαq and not by Gα12/13 or Gαi/o. In addition to activation by proteolytic cleavage, PARs have been shown to be fully responsive to synthetic peptides that mimic the amino acid sequence of the tethered ligand portion of the receptor (32Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Garcia J.G. Patterson C. Bahler C. Aschner J. Hart C.M. English D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 541-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the direct tethered ligand sequence, SFLLRN, which has been shown to activate both PAR-1 and PAR-2 receptors, substitution of the Ser to Thr creates a new peptide with increased specificity for PAR-1 activation (34Blackhart B. Emilsson K. Nguyen D. Teng W. Martelli A. Nystedt S. Sundelin J. Scarborough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16466-16471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although these agonist peptides appear to elicit full responses, there is an emerging body of evidence which suggests that agonist peptides do not activate PAR-1 in the same manner as does thrombin (35Vouret-Craviari V.

Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of PAR-1 by other proteases has shown differential signaling (40Riewald M. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March, 10.1074/jbc.M500747200)PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the rank order of potency for induced endothelial monolayer permeability and calcium mobilization differs between agonist peptide and thrombin activation of PAR-1. To address the underlying mechanism, we have constructed a mathematical model containing 60 ordinary differential equations, which describes each known step leading to Rho activation as well as calcium mobilization. Our experimental observations in conjunction with our mathematical simulations have led us to hypothesize that the ability of PAR-1 to activate Gαi/o, Gαq, or Gα12/13 is different with different agonists. Our data suggest that PAR-1 shows ligand-induced functional selectivity, with agonist peptides activating PAR-1 in such a way as to enhance Gαq and/or decrease Gα12/13 signaling pathways compared with activation by thrombin. Reagents—All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. α-Thrombin (specific activity 3181 NIH units/mg protein), the thrombin inhibitor Z-d-Phe-Pro-methoxypropylboroglycinepinanediol ester, U-73122, GM6001, pertussis toxin, and Y-27632 were purchased from Calbiochem. The agonist peptides TFLLRNKPDK (TK), SFLLRN-CONH2 (SN), SLIGKV (SV), AYPGKF-CONH2 (AF), and YFLLRNP (YP) were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. BAPTA-AM and Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rho-A antibody anti-rabbit protein A/G was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Rho activation kits were purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). Endothelial Cell Culture—In the present studies a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line that was transformed using SV-40 was used (HMEC-1; obtained from Dr. E. Ades, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA). The cells were maintained in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (5,000 units/ml; 5,000 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (500 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (0.01 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and subcultured after detachment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA. All studies utilized cell passages 15-20. Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER)—In vitro barrier permeability was monitored by electric cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) (41Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gold electrodes were purchased from Applied BioPhysics (Troy, NY). Wells were coated in 0.1% gelatin prior to being wetted by culture media. After treatment, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well and allowed to recover for 24 h. The small and larger counter electrodes were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was applied by a 1-V, 4,000-Hz AC signal connected serially to a 1-megohm resistor between the small and large counter electrodes. The voltage between the small electrode and the large counter electrode was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer. The same computer controlled the output of the amplifier and switched the measurement to different electrodes in the course of the experiment. Prior to the experiments, the monolayers were serum starved for 18 h. Calcium Mobilization—Cells were grown to confluence in black/clear bottom 96-well assay plates. Prior to the experiments, cells were serum starved for 18 h. All assays utilized the FLIPR Calcium Plus kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's protocols. The addition of agonists was robotically controlled, and samples were read by the FlexStation (Molecular Devices). Cells were excited at 485 nm and monitored at 515 nm. BAPTA-AM Treatment—Cells were split, cultured, and serum starved as described according to the type of experiment being performed. Cells were then treated with 3 μm BAPTA-AM and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h prior to stimulation. [32P]ADP-ribosylation—Complete ribosylation of Gαi/o by pertussis toxin was determined as described previously (42McCarthy S.A. Bicknell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21617-21622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kim J.A. Kang Y.S. Lee S.H. Lee E.H. Lee Y.S. J. Cell.

Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes and treated with 0.1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 18 h. Plasma membranes were isolated and subjected to a second round of ADP-ribosylation in vitro in the presence of nicotinamide adenine ([32P]NAD; Amersham Biosciences) to determine the amount of toxin substrate remaining. Membranes were harvested after two rinses with PBS in ice-cold TE buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysate was homogenized by titration seven times through a 25-gauge needle. Cellular debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min). Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and members were precipitated by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 60 min). Membranes were resuspended in 120 μl of TE buffer and total protein determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. PTX was activated by incubation in 25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. 40 μg of purified membranes was incubated with 5 μg/ml PTX in reaction buffer (2.5 μm NAD, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 10 mm thymidine, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 25 μCi/ml [32P]NAD) in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 20 μl of ice-cold 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Membranes were precipitated by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 min) and resuspended in 15 μl of 4 × Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) Inhibition—HMEC-1 were cultured to be used in calcium mobilization or induced monolayer permeability assays as described above. 30 min prior to stimulation with agonist, cells were treated with a final concentration of 25 μm GM6001 to inhibit MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, and -9 or an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide as a vehicle control. Cells were then stimulated with subsaturating concentrations of either thrombin or TK, 2.0 nm or 1.0 μm, respectively, for calcium mobilization or 0.2 nm thrombin or 2.0 μm TK for induced permeability. Assays were then performed as described above. To ensure inhibition of MMPs by GM6001, HMEC-1 were split in to 6-well plates, allowed to recover for 48 h, and serum starved 24 h. Then they were pretreated with 25 μm GM6001 or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control for 30 min and stimulated with 10 nm thrombin or serum-free medium as a base-line control. The culture medium was then harvested, and MMP activity was determined fluorescently using a gelatinase activity assay as described previously (45Harrell P.C. McCawley L.J. Fingleton B. McIntyre J.O.

Measurement of Rho Activity—Rho activity was measured using glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-Rho-binding domain (GST-RBD) that specifically pulls down activated Rho (30van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 were serum-deprived for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with various concentrations of thrombin for several time points, washed quickly with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 μg/ml tosyl arginine methyl ester, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were immediately centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and equal volumes of lysates were incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl), and bound Rho was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from the beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-Rho-A antibody. Actin Stress Fibers—Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 10 nm α-thrombin, 10 μm SN, 10 μm TK, or 100 μm SV, rinsed quickly with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by incubation for 20 min with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin to label stress fibers. After incubation, cells were rinsed six times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and mounted on slides using Prolong antifade mounting kit. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope using CY3 filter. Mathematical Modeling—The biochemical pathways initiated by either agonist peptide or thrombin activation of PAR-1 resulting in Rho activation and/or intracellular calcium mobilization (see Fig. 5) were translated into a system of ordinary differential equations (Table I). These reactions were then solved using MatLab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) on a Linux-based operating system with the initial conditions listed in Table II.Table IReactions used to describe thrombin and TK activation of intracellular calcium mobilization and Rho activation in HMEC-1k1 or Kmk−1 or kcatReactionReferenceReactions governing PAR-1 activation6.0E+041.0E-03AP + R [rlhar2] R*(104)2.0E-01AP → null1.3E-061.07E+02T + R [rlhar2] TR → T + R*(105)1.5E-01T → null(106)2.0E+01R* → nullReactions governing IP3 generation1.0E+081.0E+00R* + GqGDP·βγ [rlhar2] R*·GqGDP·βγ(72)5.0E+001.0E+06R*·GqGDP·βγ [rlhar2] R*·Gq·βγ + GDP(72)1.0E+061.0E-01R*·Gq·βγ + GTP [rlhar2] R*·GqGTP·βγ(72)2.0E+001.0E+07R*·GqGTP·βγ [rlhar2] R* + GqGTP + βγ(72)2.0E-02GqGTP → GqGDP(107-109)5.0E+085.0E+00PLC-β + GqGTP [rlhar2] PLC-β·GqGTP(109,110)1.5E+01PLC-β·GqGTP → PLC-β·GqGDP(108,109)1.0E+051.0E+02PLC-β·GqGDP [rlhar2] PLC-β + GqGDP(75)1.0E+091.0E+00PLC-β·GqGTP + PIP2 [rlhar2] PLC-β·GqGTP·PIP2aPIP2, phosphoinositide bisphosphate.(75)1.0E+02PLC-β·GqGTP·PIP2 → PLC-β·GqGTP + IP3(75)2.4E-02IP3 → nullReactions governing Ca2+ mobilizationReactions and constants for [Ca2+]i as described previously(74)Reactions governing Rho activation1.0E+081.0E+00R* + G13GDP·βγ [rlhar2] R*·G13GDP·βγ(72)6.0E+001.0E+06R*·G13GDP·βγ [rlhar2] R*·G13βγ + GDP(72)1.0E+061.0E-01R*·G13βγ + GTP [rlhar2] R*·G13GTP·βγ(72)2.0E+001.0E+07R*·G13GTP·βγ [rlhar2] R* + G13 GTP + βγ(72)4.0E-03G13GTP → G13GDP(23,111)1.0E+093.0E+00GEF + G13GTP [rlhar2] GEF·G13GTP(109)1.0E-02GEF·G13GTP → GEF·G13GDP(23)1.0E+063.0E+00GEF·G13GDP [rlhar2] GEF + G13GDP7.7E+097.7E+02GEF·G13GTP + RhoGDP [rlhar2] GEF·G13GTP·RhoGDP1.03E+04GEF·G13GTP·RhoGDP → GEF·G13GTP + RhoGTP6.0E-02RhoGTP → RhoGDP(112)a PIP2, phosphoinositide bisphosphate.

Open table in a new tab Differences between Thrombin and Agonist Peptide Activation—The effects of agonist peptides were compared with those of thrombin stimulation using two functionally different assays of PAR-1 activation: 1) induced endothelial barrier permeability and 2) induced intracellular calcium mobilization. The following agonist peptides were utilized in these studies: the exact PAR-1 tethered ligand SFLLRN-CONH2 (SN), which activates both PAR-1 and PAR-2; the PAR-1-specific agonist peptide TFLLRNKPDK (TK); the PAR-2-specific agonist peptide SLIGKV (SV) (48Bohm S.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PAR-1-induced endothelial barrier permeability was monitored by ECIS. HMEC-1 were grown on gold electrodes, and the TER was measured in response to agonist. Fig. 1A shows the changes in TER in response to saturating amounts of thrombin (10 nm), SN (10 μm), TK (10 μm), SV (100 μm), or AF (300 μm). Only those agonists that can activate PAR-1, i.e. thrombin, SN, and TK, induced barrier permeability to approximately the same extent (25-30%) and fully recovered by 90 min. Neither the PAR-2-specific nor the PAR-4-specific agonist peptide had any effect. Even though the absolute resistances before stimulation in all experiments were comparable, TK appeared to rebound, creating a tighter barrier. These data indicate both thrombin and PAR-1 but not PAR-2 agonist peptides induce barrier permeability. To determine whether thrombin and agonist peptides mobilize intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) differently, calcium transients were measured real time using the FlexStation. Fig. 1B is a comparison of the resulting traces. Saturating amounts of each agonist induced a ∼2-fold increase in [Ca2+]i. The data indicate that thrombin and both PAR-1 and PAR-2 agonist peptides induce similar [Ca2+]i mobilization. The PAR-4-specific agonist peptide failed to elicit a calcium response. The viability of the PAR-4 agonist peptide was confirmed in platelets which have been shown to express the receptor, mobilizing [Ca2+]i comparable with thrombin at < 300 μm AF (data not shown). Endothelial cells have been shown to express PAR-1, -2, and -3 but not PAR-4 (51Cupit L.D. Schmidt V.A. Bahou W.F. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 42-48"
https://openalex.org/W1578225997,"About 10,000 years ago, when the million-year-long Pleistocene epoch gave way to the ongoing Holocene epoch, much of the world's ecosystems changed. In what is now northern Siberia, vast numbers of large animals, among them mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, and yaks, both thrived on and nurtured the steppes that, compared to other northern regions of the world, remained relatively unscathed from the repeated advances and retreats of ice sheets. Even so, the steppes there gave way to silt, dust, and ice-based tundra landscapes dominated in some places by forests and in others by mosses. The large animals disappeared. [Sergey Zimov][1], director of the Northeast Science Station in Cherskii in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), argues that climate change may not have been the primary reason behind the demise of this Pleistocene ecosystem. Instead, he says changing hunting practices wiped out the large animals whose absence led to the ecosystem shifts. He and his colleagues now are reintroducing bison, Yakutian horses, and other animals, eventually even tigers, in an attempt to reconstitute the Pleistocene ecosystem. The experiment will test the hypothesis that humans, rather than climate change, caused the ecosystem shift at the beginning of the Holocene. The stabilization of the northern tundra soils that this reconstitution could bring also could prevent the release of vast amount of carbon now sequestered in the Siberian soils but in danger of being released in the warmer times projected for the future.

https://openalex.org/W2076173602,"We describe a process in meiotic cells of budding yeast in which chromosomes become joined together in pairs at their centromeres independent of chromosomal homology. These centromeric interactions depend on the synaptonemal complex component Zip1. During meiosis in wild-type diploids, centromere couples are initially nonhomologous and then undergo switching until all couples involve homologs. This transition to homologous coupling depends on Spo11, a protein required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Regions of synaptonemal complex assembled early in meiosis are often centromere-associated. We propose that centromere coupling facilitates homolog pairing and promotes synapsis initiation."

An understanding of viralRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) fidelity has become a topic ofconsiderable interest as a result of recent experiments that show that a2-fold increase in fidelity attenuates viral pathogenesis and a 2-folddecrease in fidelity reduces viral fitness. Here we show that a conformationalchange step preceding phosphoryl transfer is a key fidelity checkpoint for thepoliovirus RdRp (3Dpol). We provide evidence that thisconformational change step is orientation of the triphosphate into aconformation suitable for catalysis, suggesting a kinetic and structural modelfor RdRp fidelity that can be extrapolated to other classes of nucleic acidpolymerases. Finally, we show that a site remote from the catalytic center cancontrol this checkpoint, which occurs at the active site. Importantly, similarconnections between a remote site and the active site exist in a wide varietyof viral RdRps. The capacity for sites remote from the catalytic center toalter fidelity suggests new possibilities for targeting the viral RdRp forantiviral drug development.

During each cycle of nucleotide incorporation, nucleic acid polymerases arepresented with the challenge of having to select a nucleotide with the correctsugar configuration and the correct base. Fidelity of nucleotide selection isessential for maintenance of the information content and accurate expressionof the genome. Importantly, some level of incorrect incorporation must existto provide a mechanism for all organisms to survive challenges imposed bynature. Elucidation of the mechanisms employed by polymerases to maintain theappropriate balance between correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation hasbeen a primary goal of polymerase enzymology and structural biology. The single nucleotide-addition cycle of polymerases is likely conserved,consisting of at least five kinetically observable steps: 1) nucleotidebinding; 2) a conformational change; 3) phosphodiester bond formation; 4) asecond conformational change, perhaps translocation; and 5) pyrophosphaterelease(1Kuchta R.D.

Studies of viral DNA-dependent DNA and RNA polymerases have been essentialto developing the current state-of-the-art for polymerase structure, function,and mechanism. However, until recently, very little structural and mechanisticinformation existed for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; PV,poliovirus; WT, wild-type; RTP, ribavirin triphosphate; T7 Rp, bacteriophageT7 RNA polymerase; NV, Norwalk virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; nt,nucleotide(s); AMPαS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiomonophosphate);RMP, ribavirin monophosphate.1The abbreviations used are: RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; PV,poliovirus; WT, wild-type; RTP, ribavirin triphosphate; T7 Rp, bacteriophageT7 RNA polymerase; NV, Norwalk virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; nt,nucleotide(s); AMPαS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiomonophosphate);RMP, ribavirin monophosphate.(7Arnold J.J.

Even more intriguing, however, are the recent realizationsthat very subtle increases in RdRp fidelity can attenuate viralpathogenesis 2M. Vignuzzi, J. K. Stone, J. J. Arnold, C. E. Cameron, and R. Andino,submitted for publication.2M. Vignuzzi, J. K. Stone, J. J. Arnold, C. E. Cameron, and R.

Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat.Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The RdRp from poliovirus (PV), 3Dpol, has emerged as animportant model system for understanding the structure, function, andmechanism of this class of polymerases(7Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E.

However, given thestructural and mechanistic similarities of 3Dpol to DNApolymerases, RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases(7Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,21Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3462-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), it is likely that thestructural and mechanistic basis for 3Dpol fidelity will berelevant to all classes of nucleic acid polymerases. Although it is oftensuggested that the RdRp has a high error rate, the RdRp error rate is actuallyequivalent to replicative DNA polymerases in the absence of the proofreadingexonuclease (7Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a PV mutant (G64S PV) that is less sensitive toan antiviral nucleoside yet more sensitive to other classes of antiviralcompounds due to a mutation in 3Dpol-coding sequence that restrictsgenomic diversity. We show that this polymerase derivative, G64S3Dpol, has a higher fidelity than the wild-type enzyme owing to achange in the equilibrium constant for the conformational change steppreceding the chemical step. Although position 64 is remote from the activesite, the backbone of this residue is connected via hydrogen bonding to theconserved structural motif A that functions, in part, to hold the triphosphateof the incoming nucleotide in a conformation appropriate for catalysis.Importantly, similar connections between remote sites and motif A exist inpolymerases from a wide variety of RNA viruses. Together, these data providegenetic evidence for a role of the first conformational change step inpolymerase fidelity, provide a link between the conformational change and theorientation of the triphosphate of the incoming nucleotide, and define sitesremote from the polymerase active site as targets for development of antiviralagents capable of functioning by modulating nucleotide incorporation fidelity.The conclusions of this study regarding fidelity mechanisms employed by theRdRp are germane to all classes of nucleic acid polymerases. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP (>7000 Ci/mmol) wasfrom ICN; [α-32P]UTP was from New England Nuclear; nucleoside5′-triphosphates (all nucleotides were ultrapure solutions) andadenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) were from AmershamBiosciences; dT15 was from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.;poly(rA) was from Sigma; RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research,Inc. (Boulder, CO); T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs,Inc.; All other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma orFisher. Cells, Viruses, and Plasmids—HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2)were grown in tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle'smedium-nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's, 1:1, CellGro), supplemented with 2mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100units of penicillin and streptomycin per milliliter, and 10% newborn calfserum (Invitrogen). Wild-type (WT) poliovirus type 1 Mahoney was usedthroughout this study. Plasmid prib(+)XpA (hereupon referred to as pXpA)contains the cDNA of poliovirus preceded by the hammerhead ribozyme and the T7RNA polymerase promoter permitting the generation of infectious syntheticRNAs. Construction of Recombinant G64S PV Clone—The codon encodingGly-64 of the poliovirus RdRp was changed to Ser in the cDNA of WT poliovirustype 1 Mahoney in the plasmid pXpA. Specifically, nucleotides 6746–6748(GGT) were mutagenized to TCA using appropriate primers (available uponrequest) and the QuikChange Mutagenesis XLII kit (Stratagene). Positive cloneswere identified and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmid pG64Spermits the transcription of infectious full-length genomes, expressing themutant G64S polymerase. In Vitro Transcription and RNA Transfection—Poliovirustranscripts corresponding to full-length genomic RNA (pXpA or pG64S) wereobtained using a T7 Megascript transcription kit (Ambion) after linearizationof cDNA plasmids. The integrity of the resulting RNAs was confirmed by gelelectrophoresis. Transfection of HeLa S3 cells with these synthetic RNAs wasperformed with an Electro Cell Manipulator600 (BTX) following themanufacturer's directions. Effect of Ribavirin on Virus Titer—HeLa S3 cells wereinfected at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with either passage 3 WTpoliovirus (P3) or passage 3 G64S virus in the presence of 0–1000μm ribavirin. Upon total cell lysis (cytopathic effect), viruswas recovered and titered by plaque assay. WIN Compound Escape Mutants Assay—WIN 51711 (disoxaril)compound and the assay protocol were obtained as a kind gift from Dan Pevear,ViroPharma, Inc. Survival curves were established by plating serial 10-folddilutions of 106 plaque-forming units/ml virus stocks on duplicateHeLa S3 cell monolayers in 6-well plates. After a 1-h adsorption period theinoculum was removed and 3 ml of overlay medium was added containing 1.0%agarose and different concentrations of disoxaril (10 μm, 1μm, 0.1 μm, 0.01 μm, or no drug).Percent inhibition was plotted as a function of virus titer obtained at eachconcentration of WIN compound over control titer obtained with mocktreatment. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Sequencing—Eighteen viralisolates belonging to each of the WT and G64S populations were obtained byplaque isolation. The viral isolates were then replicated on fresh HeLa cellmonolayers (in 24-well plates) for 6 h, and viral RNA was extracted andpurified by TRIzol extraction. RT-PCR was performed on the RNA using theThermoscript kit (Invitrogen) and Pfu ultrafidelity polymerase(Stratagene). The RT reaction was performed using the oligo-dT primer. Two PCRproducts were obtained for each viral isolate, a product spanning the5′-untranslated region and capsid coding region (nt 300–3300) anda product spanning 3CD and the 3′-untranslated region (nt5800–7441). Primers for the 5′-product were5′-CAGAGTGTAGCTTAGGC-3′ (forward) and5′-GGTGGACGCGGGCACC-3′ (reverse). Primers for the 3′-productwere 5′-CAGGGATATCTAAATCTC-3′ (forward) and5′-CTCCGAATTAAAGAAAAATTTACCC-3′ (reverse). The 36 PCR fragmentsfrom each population, representing 18 different viral clones of either WT orG64S, were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit and sequenced. Virus Competition Experiment—HeLa cells were plated in10-cm2 dishes and infected at an multiplicity of infection of 10with a virus mixture composed of passage 0 WT and G64S viruses at a ratio of1:10. After adsorption, input virus was removed, and infection was allowed toproceed to cell lysis. Virus from the supernatants of infected cells washarvested by three freeze-thaw cycles and used to re-infect fresh HeLamonolayers (passages 1–3). At each passage, viral RNA was extracted bytreatment with TRIzol-HCl for reverse transcription-PCR. Reversetranscription-PCR was performed as above, using the same primers thatamplified the 3′-product. Direct sequencing of the PCR product wasperformed to determine the proportion of progeny virus belonging to the WT orG64S populations. Construction of G64S Expression Vector—The G64S expressionvector was constructed by introducing the G64S-encoding mutation into the WT3Dpol coding sequence by using overlap extension PCR with theappropriate primers (available upon request) and subcloning into thepET26-Ub-3D expression plasmid essentially as described previously(26Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. ProteinExpr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmedby DNA sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Pennsylvania State University). Expression and Purification of 3Dpol—Expressionand purification of 3Dpol WT and G64S were performed as describedpreviously (26Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. ProteinExpr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purification, 5′-32P Labeling, and Annealingof sym/sub—RNA oligonucleotides were purified, labeled, andannealed as described previously(18Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Poly(rU) Polymerase Specific Activity Assay—Reactionscontained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol,5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 μm 3Dpol, 500μm UTP, 0.2 μCi/μl [α-32P]UTP, 1.88μm dT15, and poly(rA) (93.4 μm AMP).Reactions were initiated by 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 5min at which time the reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a finalconcentration of 50 mm. Products were analyzed by DE81 filterbinding as previously described(27Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). sym/sub Assays—Reactions contained 50 mm HEPES,pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2or 5 mm MnCl2, 500 μm NTP, sym/sub, and3Dpol. Reactions were either quenched by addition of EDTA to afinal concentration of 0.3 m or by addition of HCl to a finalconcentration of 1 m. Immediately after addition of HCl, thesolution was neutralized by addition 1 m KOH and 300 mmTris (final concentration). Specific concentrations of primer/template and3Dpol, along with any deviations from the above, are indicated inthe appropriate figure legend. 3Dpol was diluted immediately priorto use in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol,and 20% glycerol. The volume of enzyme added to any reaction was always lessthan or equal to one-tenth the total volume. All reactions were performed at30 °C. Rapid Chemical Quenched Flow Experiments—Rapidmixing/quenching experiments were performed by using a Model RQF-3chemical-quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Experiments wereperformed at 30 °C by using a circulating water bath.3Dpol-sym/sub complexes were assembled by mixing 3Dpoland sym/sub for 3 min at room temperature and then rapidly mixed with thenucleotide substrate. After mixing, reactant concentrations were reduced by50%. Reactions were either quenched by addition of EDTA to a finalconcentration of 0.3 m or by addition of HCl to a finalconcentration of 1 m followed by immediate neutralization. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters (kpol andKd,app) for 3Dpol-catalyzed NucleotideIncorporation—3Dpol (2 μm) was incubatedwith sym/sub (1 μm duplex) and rapidly mixed with varyingconcentrations of nucleotide substrate (1/5 ×Kd,app to 5 ×Kd,app). At various times after mixing,reactions were either quenched by addition of EDTA or HCl. Time courses atfixed nucleotide concentration were fit toEquation 1,[Product]=A∗e−kobs∗t+C(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the burst, kobs isthe observed first-order rate constant describing the burst, t is thetime, and C is a constant. The observed rate constants were plottedas a function of nucleotide concentration, and the data were fit toEquation 2,kobs=kpol∗[NTP]Kd,app+[NTP](Eq. 2) where kpol is the maximal observed rate constant fornucleotide incorporation and Kd,app is theapparent dissociation constant. Data were fit by non-linear regression usingthe program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Kinetic Simulation—Kinetic simulations were performed byusing KinTekSim Version 2.03 (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Schemes employed areprovided as figures. All rate constants were determined experimentally, exceptwhere noted. The agreement between the experimental data and kineticsimulations was determined by visual inspection. G64S PV Population Has Reduced Genomic Diversity—The genomicdiversity of RNA virus populations permits rapid adaptation of the populationto environmental stresses. Maximal adaptability requires maximal genomicdiversity. However, the consequence of maximal genomic diversity issusceptibility to extinction under conditions in which a subtle increase inmutation frequency occurs. This mutation-induced extinction has been termedlethal mutagenesis, a promising broad spectrum antiviral strategy(28Crotty S. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virus Res. 2005; 107: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Studies with PV have shown that the mechanism of action of ribavirin, aclinically useful antiviral nucleoside, is lethal mutagenesis(24Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat.Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The PV RdRp canincorporate ribavirin triphosphate ambiguously into the genome, forcing thevirus population into error catastrophe(24Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat.Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). One mechanism ofresistance to nucleoside-based mutagens is enhanced RdRp fidelity. Isolationof such a mutant would provide significant insight not only into theimportance of genomic diversity for viral infectivity and pathogenesis butalso into mechanisms of fidelity employed by polymerases. Serial passage of PV in the presence of ribavirin yields a mutant withreduced sensitivity to ribavirin(34Pfeiffer J.K. Kirkegaard K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).2 This mutantcontains a single nucleotide substitution in 3Dpol-coding sequencethat converts Gly-64 to Ser. A recombinant G64S PV was constructed to precludegenetic reversion. As shown in Fig.1A, in the absence of ribavirin, this virus grows totiters equivalent to WT PV, suggesting that this mutation does not alter thefitness of the virus in tissue culture. As the concentration of ribavirin isincreased, G64S PV exhibits reduced sensitivity to the drug(Fig. 1A). PV and other entero- and rhinoviruses in the Picornavirus family aresensitive to a class of inhibitors, commonly called WIN compounds, thatinhibit virus uncoating by binding to the mature virus capsid and preventingconformational changes required for uncoating(9Showalter A.K.

Virol. 1994; 68: 8193-8201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance to some ofthese compounds, for example WIN 51711 (disoxaril), rapidly emerges owing tothe existence of drug-resistant variants in the virus population(9Showalter A.K. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,36Mosser A.G. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT PV resists challengeby WIN 51711 over a wide concentration range(Fig. 1B), likelyreflecting drug-resistant mutants in the population. If G64S PV encodes apolymerase with enhanced fidelity, then fewer drug-resistant variants shouldbe present in this population, conferring enhanced sensitivity of G64S PV toWIN 51711. As shown in Fig.1B, G64S PV is more sensitive to WIN 51711. To confirmthat the diversity of the G64S PV population was reduced relative to WT PV, wesequenced 36,000 nt of capsid-coding sequence. The G64S PV population contains4-fold fewer mutations per genome than the WT PV population(Fig. 1C). Theseresults are consistent with enhanced fidelity of G64S 3Dpolmediating the reduced sensitivity of G64S PV to ribavirin. Biochemical Defects Associated with G64S 3Dpol—Weexpressed and purified G64S 3Dpol and compared its basicbiochemical properties to WT 3Dpol(26Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. ProteinExpr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At temperatures greaterthan 4 °C, WT 3Dpol has a finite lifetime in solution in theabsence of nucleotide and nucleic acid(Fig. 2A)(18Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The observed rateconstant for inactivation of G64S 3Dpol at 30 °C in thepresence of 500 μm ATP is 9-fold faster than WT 3Dpol(Fig. 2A). The fasterrate of inactivation of G64S 3Dpol leads to a 15-fold reduction inthe specific activity of this derivative relative to WT enzyme as determinedby using a poly(rU) polymerase activity assay(Fig. 2B). Productformed by using this assay reflects template-switching activity of the fewcomplexes that assemble productively on this primer-template substrate(27Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An increase in the rateconstant for inactivation will cause a proportional reduction in complexescompetent for primer extension on these large primer-template substrates(18Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have developed a synthetic primer-template substrate for evaluation ofthe kinetics and mechanism of 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotideincorporation (18Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thissubstrate, referred to as sym/sub-U (Fig.2C), is a 10-nt self-complimentary RNA that forms a 6-bpduplex and two 4-nt 5′-overhangs capable of templating correctincorporation of each of the four ribonucleotides. The “U”designation identifies the first templating base of the substrate. Productscan be resolved from substrate by electrophoresis through denaturingpolyacrylamide gels, detected by phosphorimaging, and quantitated(Fig. 2C). Assembly of3Dpol onto sym/sub-U is slow, and the yield of assembled complex ismodulated by thermal inactivation(18Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The rate constant forassembly of G64S 3Dpol onto sym/sub-U is 3-fold faster than WT3Dpol; however, the yield of assembled complexes is 2.5-fold lowerthan WT 3Dpol (Fig.2D). These biochemical defects were not predicted by thebiological data, which showed that G64S PV was capable of growing to titersequivalent to WT PV (Fig.1A). G64S PV Exhibits Reduced Fitness Relative to WT PV—Theobservation that G64S 3Dpol was not as robust as WT3Dpol in vitro suggested the possibility that fitnessdefects associated with G64S PV had been overlooked by evaluating this virusin isolation. Therefore, we created a mixed viral population consisting of WTPV and G64S PV"

Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), 1The abbreviations used are: XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; XO, xanthine oxidase; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; FDNB; fluorodinitrobenzene; 4,4′-DTPY, 4,4′-dithiodipyridine; MB, methylene blue; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide. xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH, EC 1.1.1.204), or xanthine oxidase (XO, EC 1.2.3.2) is a complex metalloflavoenzyme that catalyzes oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid with concomitant reduction of NAD+ or molecular oxygen. The enzyme is a homodimeric protein of Mr 300,000 and is composed of independent subunits; each subunit contains one molybdopterin, two non-identical iron sulfur centers ([2Fe-2S] clusters), and one FAD (1Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. XII. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar, 2Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). The oxidative hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid takes place at the molybdenum center, and reducing equivalents thus introduced are transferred rapidly via two iron sulfur centers to FAD, where physiological oxidation occurs (4Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian enzymes exist in the NAD+-dependent form (xanthine dehydrogenase, XDH) in freshly prepared samples from organs under normal conditions, i.e. they exhibit low xanthine/O2 reductase activity but high xanthine/NAD+ reductase activity, even in the presence of O2 (5Della Corte E. Stripe F. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Stripe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XDH can be converted reversibly to xanthine oxidase (XO) by oxidation of cysteine residues or irreversibly by limited proteolysis (5Della Corte E. Stripe F. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29859-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). XO has high reactivity toward O2 but negligible reactivity toward NAD+. As XO can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (1Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. XII. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar), XO is thought to be one of the key enzymes producing reactive oxygen species (14McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of bovine milk XDH and proteolytically produced XO have been solved and showed large conformational differences around the FAD (15Enroth T. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; : 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Although the transition seems to occur in a similar way, whether caused by cysteine modification or proteolysis, the identification of the responsible cysteine residues is still a matter of controversy. It is not easy to identify the responsible residues, because the enzyme contains as many as 36 cysteine residues/monomer of rat XOR (12Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and many residues are modified by common cysteine-modifying reagents, such as 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) or iodoacetamide (16Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar). It was, however, reported that only four cysteine residues were modified during the conversion from rat liver XDH to XO by titration with 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (4,4′-DTPY) (16Saito T. Yokohama Med. Bull. 1987; 38: 151-168Google Scholar). During the titration, two disulfide bonds were suggested to be formed by modification with 4,4′-DTPY, because the addition of 2 mol of 4,4′-DTPY stoichiometrically provides 4 mol of 4-thiopyridone. A similar observation was made by Hunt and Massey (11Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21476-21485Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with the bovine milk enzyme. Although only four cysteine residues were modified during conversion from XDH to XO by this reagent, it was still difficult to identify the residues, because the modifier was released from the residues involved as part of the reaction. We then reported that relatively few cysteine residues were modified upon chemical reaction with FDNB (13Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29859-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During the initial 10 min of reaction with FDNB, two specific cysteine residues, Cys535 and Cys992, were labeled, and these residues were suggested to be involved in the rapid conversion from XDH to XO. Recently, Rasmussen et al. (17Rasmussen J.T. Rasmussenn M.S. Petersen T.E. J. Dairy Sci. 2000; 83: 499-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported the sulfhydryl group modification of bovine milk XOR using radioactive iodoacetic acid, and their results are consistent with our assignment. On the other hand, this interpretation has subsequently been challenged in a report describing gel analyses of the proteolytically cleaved disulfide form of XO (18McManaman J.L. Bain D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21261-21268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of bovine XOR shows that Cys992 is situated on the surface of the molecule, but Cys535 seems to be located in the long linker peptide between the FAD and the molybdopterin domains, although the residue is not visible in the crystal structure most probably due to its flexibility. The proteolytic cleavage site is also on the linker peptide. Based on detailed analyses of crystal structures of reversible XDH and proteolytic XO, as well as site-directed mutagenesis, Kuwabara et al. (19Kuwabara Y. Nishino T. Okamoto K. Matsumura T. Eger B.T. Pai E.F. Nishino T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8170-8175Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) concluded that the unique amino acid cluster of Phe549, Arg335 (corresponding to rat 334), Trp336 (rat 335), and Arg427 (rat 426) in the bovine enzyme sits at the center of a relay system that transmits modifications of the linker peptide caused by cysteine oxidation or proteolytic cleavage to the active site loop (Gln423–Lys433). The movement of the active site loop is considered to be the direct cause of the change in chemical behavior between XDH and XO (15Enroth T. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; : 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe two cysteine couples, one of which is responsible for rapid and the other for slow conversion from XDH to XO. We also present, at 2.6-Å resolution, the crystal structure of a non-convertible rat mutant XOR in the demolybdo-inactive form and show that its polypeptide chain adopts the XDH conformation. Materials—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and wild-type circular Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) DNA for wild-type XOR were obtained from Invitrogen (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Triple cut virus DNA for mutant cotransfection was obtained from Novagen (BacVector™ 2000). The transfer vector pJVP10Z was kindly provided by Dr. Palmer Taylor (University of California, San Diego). The restriction and modification enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) or New England Biolabs, Inc. The culture media IPL41 or Sf-900II, fetal calf serum, and Grace medium were purchased from Invitrogen. The polyclonal antibody used in these experiments was raised in our laboratory against purified rat liver XOR, as described previously (12Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DE52 was purchased from Whatman Ltd., hydroxylapatite resin BIO-GEL HTP was from Bio-Rad, and NAD+ was from Sigma (grade V-C). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. DNA Manipulations and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A baculovirusinsect cell system (21, Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555, College Station, TexasGoogle Scholar) was employed for the expression of the wild-type and mutant XOR enzymes. The site-directed mutagenesis was done using a Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) and a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the altered DNA sequences were analyzed using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemical). Escherichia coli strain CJ236 (Bio-Rad) was transformed with pUC118EP2 carrying the cDNA of rat liver XOR, and this transformant was infected in the mid-log phase with helper phage M13KO7 (Bio-Rad) in the presence of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin to prepare single-stranded DNA. The phage particles were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation, and single-stranded DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The following 5′-phosphorylated DNA oligomer was utilized to construct the XOR variant: 5′-GGG GTC CAG TTT GCC GGC CAT ATC CTC-3′ for C535A (Cys535 codon substituted by Ala codon) and 5′-CCC TCT CTT TTT CCA TCG ATT TTC CCT GTT GAA TTT C-3′ for C992R (Cys992 codon substituted by Arg codon). Each oligonucleotide was hybridized to single-stranded pUC118MXL and introduced into E. coli strain HB101 (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). The resultant double-stranded vectors were isolated and digested with SmaI and SpeI for the C535A mutant and SmaI and PmaCI for the C992R mutant. Each obtained fragment was ligated with pRXD203 that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The double mutant C535A/C992R was constructed by insertion of the DNA fragment containing C535A at the restriction sites SmaI and SpeI into pRXD203C992R at the same sites. As regards the triple mutants C535A/C992R/C1324S and C535A/C992R/C1316S, the former mutant was constructed by using the plasmid containing full-length XOR DNA/C535A/C992R and the same plasmid containing XOR cDNA/C1324S, which was reported previously (13Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29859-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), by digestion and ligation at the SpeI and EcoRV restriction sites. The latter mutant was constructed with the 5′-phosphorylated DNA oligomer 5′-C CAG TTC ACC ACC CTG TCT GTC ACT GGA GTA CCA G-3′ for C1316S (Cys1316 codon substituted by Ser codon) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and plasmid containing full-length cDNA of XOR/C535A/C992R. The DNA fragment encoding each mutant enzyme was excised with NheI and ligated into baculovirus transfer vector pJVP10Z. The direction of the cDNA was identified by DNA sequencing. The transfer vector pJVP10Z contains the β-galactosidase gene, and color selection can be done using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate (20Nishino T. Amaya Y.

Lamuriere M. Vernet T. Briedis D. Alkhatib G. Henning D. Levin D. Richardson C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 37-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Viral Variant Types—The wild-type recombinant virus was prepared as described previously (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with AcNPV DNA and constructed transfer vectors was conducted using a BacVector™ 2000 (Novagen), and screening of the recombinant virus was carried out by plaque assay according to the manufacturer's manual (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21, Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555, College Station, TexasGoogle Scholar). To identify recombination, direct Western blots were performed with infected cell extracts of the second virus amplification, and positive clones were selected. We usually prepared a virus stock with a titer of 1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. Overexpression of Rat XOR and Its Variants Using the Baculovirus-Insect Cell System—The maintenance of Sf9 cell lines and expression procedures were the same as described previously (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purification Procedures of Recombinant Enzymes—Purification procedures were performed as described previously (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); the recombinant active XORs and demolybdo-dimeric XORs were separated by affinity column chromatography (23Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Ikegami T. Nishino T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The enzymes were concentrated and incubated with 5 or 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 25 °C to generate xanthine dehydrogenase forms of XOR, followed by gel filtration to remove excess DTT, as necessary. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gel. Protein markers purchased from Bio-Rad consisted of a mixture of recombinant proteins (10–250 kDa). Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.4 mm EDTA in a final volume of 3.0 ml. Xanthine oxidoreductase activities with various electron acceptors were determined by monitoring the absorbance changes as follows: O2 (air-saturated buffer; 295 nm) and NAD+ (500 μm; 340 or 295 nm). NADH-methylene blue (MB) activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance change at 340 nm with 50 μm NADH in the presence of 50 μm methylene blue. XOR concentration was determined from the absorbance at 450 nm using an extinction coefficient of 35.8 mm-1 cm-1 (26Jonson J.L. Waud W.R. Cohen H.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5056-5061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the native enzyme. XO was converted to XDH by incubation with 5 or 10 mm DTT at 25 °C for 1 h. The dehydrogenase to oxidase ratio (the D/O ratio) as defined by Waud and Rajagopalan (8Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was determined as the ratio of the absorbance change at 295 nm under aerobic conditions in the presence of NAD+ to that in the absence of NAD+. Activity to flavin ratio (1Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. XII. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-419Google Scholar) was obtained by dividing the change in absorbance/min at 295 nm in the presence of NAD+ under aerobic conditions by the absorbance at 450 nm of the enzyme used in the assay at 25 °C. Photometric experiments were performed with a Hitachi U-3210 photometer. Crystallization and Data Collection of the C535A/C992R/C1324S Mutant of XOR—The enzyme used for crystallization was further purified on a gel filtration column of TSKSW3000XL (Tosoh Co.) just before crystallization to remove aggregated enzyme after folate affinity chromatography. As described previously, the recombinant XOR was expressed in multiple forms (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the enzyme used for crystallization was the demolybdo-dimeric form. The enzyme was concentrated to 8 mg/ml in buffer A (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and incubated with 5 mm DTT for 60 min at 25 °C. Crystals of the mutant XDH were grown by vapor diffusion, equilibrating a mixture of 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 9–11% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.6 m Li2SO4, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium salicylate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, and 40 mm HEPES (pH 6.20), against 1.5 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals of the enzyme were flash-frozen with their mother liquor as a cryoprotectant and mounted in cryoloops. Diffraction data were collected at beamline BL38B1, SPring8, Harima Garden City, Japan, at a temperature of 100 K. Radiation of 1.0 Å wavelength and a Q4 area detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation) were used. Expression and Purification of Three Mutants of Rat Liver Recombinant XOR—We reported previously that two cysteine residues, Cys535 and Cys992, were involved in the conversion from XDH to XO, based on the results of chemical modification with FDNB. To confirm the role of these residues, we constructed three mutants of rat XOR, C535A, C992R, and C535A/C992R. In the chicken enzyme, which cannot be converted to XO by any treatment, the residue Cys992 is replaced by an arginine, whereas the residue Cys535 is conserved (27Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The soluble form of recombinant rat liver XOR was expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As described previously, the expressed enzyme consisted of multiple forms; it contained inactive demolybdo-monomeric, inactive demolybdo-dimeric, and active molybdo forms (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the active enzyme fraction eluted from the first folate affinity chromatography, which removes the demolybdo form, for functional analyses of both wild and mutant enzymes, except in NADH reduction experiments, where the demolybdo form does not influence the results (20Nishino T. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Kashima Y. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After purification, the activity to flavin ratio value of active XDH at 25 °C was ∼130, which is comparable with that of native XOR purified from rat liver without the second affinity chromatography step (23Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All of the enzymes were expressed in their XDH form and could be identified as such in crude extracts. Although the wild-type XOR retained negligible XDH activity only for 1 day after the start of purification, the mutant enzymes retained significant XDH activity even seven days after purification; they exhibited 25–50% XDH activity. All of the enzymes, including wild type, could be reconverted to XDH. Each of these purified recombinant XDHs showed mostly a single band of molecular mass at 150 kDa on SDS-PAGE, although there was a minor amount of proteolytic nicking in the C535A mutant (Fig. 1b). The values of the activity to flavin ratio of these purified enzymes were between 117 and 160, corresponding to a 59–80% active form (the activity to flavin ratio for fully active enzyme is 200 (24Ikegami T. Nishino T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), presumably because of the presence of desulfoenzyme, as in the case of the natural enzyme (10Saito T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10015-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NADH-MB activities of these various DTT-treated XDHs were almost the same, at 732–742 mol/min/mol FAD (data not shown), suggesting that the FAD binding site is intact. Thus, the purified wild type and mutants were extremely similar in various aspects, other than conversion property. Treatment of Wild-type and C535A/C992R, C535A, and C992R Mutant XORs with 4,4′-DTPY—The purified recombinant wild-type and mutant XOR enzymes were treated with 5 mm DTT to convert them to the XDH type, followed by gel filtration to remove DTT, and the obtained XDHs were treated with 4,4′-DTPY. A typical example is shown in Fig. 1a comparing the recombinant wild-type XOR and C535A/C992R double mutant XOR. The single mutant C535A and C992R XORs also showed similar profiles. Fig. 1a, A, shows the auto-oxidation process of cysteine residues during purification. Both enzymes were converted readily to XDH by 5 mm DTT during 60 min of incubation (Fig. 1a, B). In the case of recombinant wild-type XDH, the XO activity was increased from 20 to 100% within 15 min by treatment with 0.1 mm 4,4′-DTPY, as shown in Fig. 1a, C. The urate formation activity determined in the presence of NAD+ remained at almost the initial level during the reaction. On the other hand, the conversion process from XDH to XO of the mutant was significantly slower than that of wild-type with 4,4′-DTPY, although even the double mutant was still converted slowly to the oxidase form (Fig. 1a, C) during prolonged incubation; the oxidase activity of C535A/C992R increased from 14 to 52% after 60 min at 25 °C. Resistance to conversion from XDH to XO was also observed in the single mutants C535A and C992R, although the double mutant C535A/C992R was the most resistant (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that, although Cys535 and Cys992 are involved in rapid conversion by treatment with 4,4′-DTPY, the conversion from XDH to XO involves not only Cys535 and Cys992, but also other residues. It should be noted that the oxidase activities after reaction with 4,4′-DTPY were reconverted to the XDH type by incubation with 10 mm DTT, indicating that the conversion is due to modification of sulfhydryl residues (Fig. 1a, D). Reduction of C535A/C992R Mutants Having Various Levels of Oxidase Activity with NADH and Protection of Slower Conversion by the Presence of NADH—The NADH-methylene blue activity decreased concomitantly with increase of XO activity in a similar way to the xanthine-NAD+ activity, suggesting that the conversion is related to pyridine nucleotide binding (Fig. 2a). To assess the binding ability of the C535A/C992R mutants with NADH, double-mutated enzymes with three different activities of NADH-MB were prepared, and reduction experiments were performed by mixing them with NADH under anaerobic conditions. As shown in Fig. 2a, the level of absorbance bleaching by NADH was approximately parallel to NADH-MB activity, suggesting that other cysteine residues may exist near the NAD+ binding site. To confirm this, XDH-type or DTT-treated C535A/C992R mutant was incubated with 100 μm 4,4′-DTPY in the presence of NADH. As shown in Fig. 1d, the conversion from XDH to XO was completely blocked, and the mutant retained XDH-form activity even after 80 min (Fig. 1d). This suggests strongly that the other cysteine couple exists near the NAD+ binding site and can be protected from modification by the binding of pyridine nucleotide. In the crystal structure of bovine XDH (but not XO (15Enroth T. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; : 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)), the C-terminal peptide is inserted into the neighboring molecule pointing toward the NAD+ binding pocket. Two cysteine residues that could form a disulfide bond are located near the C terminus. To test the potential involvement of these residues, we constructed two further mutants, C535A/C992R/C1316S and C535A/C992R/C1324S. In the chicken enzyme, the residue Cys1324 is replaced by phenylalanine, whereas the residue Cys1316 is conserved (27Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). C535A/C992R/C1316S and C535A/C992R/C1324S XOR Mutants—As described above, the double mutant C535A/C992R XOR was expressed in its XDH form, but it gradually converted to the level of 50–60% XO activity during the 7–10-day purification period. On the other hand, triple mutants C535A/C992R/C1316S and C535A/C992R/C1324S were also expressed as XDH enzymes, but their XDH/XO activity ratio was not changed over a period of 10 days. When exposed to air, they were not converted to XO enzymes even after a month. Fig. 2b shows the spectra of purified C535A/C992R/C1316S and C535A/C992R/C1324S XORs without DTT treatment before and immediately after reduction with NADH under anaerobic conditions. The reduction level after 20 min (not shown) was the same as in the case of DTT-treated native rat liver XDH. Although we performed the same experiments with DTT-treated C535A/C992R/C1316S or C535A/C992R/C1324S XOR, the spectra were indistinguishable from each other, e.g. they showed the same levels of absorbance bleaching and semiquinone formation at ∼600 nm that are typical of the XDH form. Fig. 1e displays the reaction time courses of the mutants C535A/C992R/C1316S and C535A/C992R/C1324S with 4,4′-DTPY. Both mutants showed no activity change at all from XDH to XO; they retained the initial dehydrogenase activity during the whole 1 h reaction period. These results are consistent with the fact that these triple mutants are not converted to XO by sulfhydryl oxidation and support the view that Cys1316 and Cys1324 are involved in the slower conversion from XDH to XO by sulfhydryl oxidation. Crystal Structure of the C535A/C992R/C1324S Mutant of Rat Liver XOR—The C535A/C992R/C1324S mutant of rat liver XOR in the demolybdo form was successfully crystallized, and diffraction data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement techniques and r"

Twenty-four genes of the Nudix hydrolase homologues (AtNUDTs) with predicted localizations in the cytosol, chloroplasts, and mitochondria exist in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we demonstrated the comprehensive analysis of nine types of cytosolic AtNUDT proteins (AtNUDT1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, -10, and -11). The recombinant proteins of AtNUDT2, -6, -7, and -10 showed both ADP-ribose and NADH pyrophosphatase activities with significantly high affinities compared with those of animal and yeast enzymes. The expression of each AtNUDT is individually regulated in different tissues. These findings suggest that most cytosolic AtNUDTs may substantially function in the sanitization of potentially hazardous ADP-ribose and the regulation of the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio in plant cells. On the other hand, the AtNUDT1 protein had the ability to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP with a Km value of 6.8 μm and completely suppress the increased frequency of spontaneous mutations in the Escherichia coli mutT- strain, indicating that AtNUDT1 is a functional homologue of E. coli MutT in A. thaliana and is involved in the prevention of spontaneous mutation.

Nudix 1The abbreviations used are: Nudix, nucleoside diphosphates linked to some moiety X; hMTH1, human MutT. (nucleoside diphosphates linked to some moiety X) hydrolases, which are characterized by a conserved Nudix motif, GX5EX7REVXEEXGU, where U is usually Ile, Leu, or Val (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), are widely distributed in over 120 species, ranging from viruses to humans (2Xu W. Shen J. Dunn C.A. Desai S. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Nudix hydrolases may be divided into subfamilies based on their major substrates: dinucleoside polyphosphates, ADP-ribose, NADH, nucleotide sugars, or ribo- and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (3Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the accumulations of their substrates are often toxic to the cell, their intracellular levels need to be precisely regulated by these enzymes (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Among the Nudix hydrolases, Escherichia coli MutT protein hydrolyzes all canonical nucleoside triphosphates with a preference for 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the oxidized form of the free guanine nucleotide, by attacking an active oxygen species, such as a superoxide radical ( O2−˙), H2O2, or a hydroxyl radical (·OH), to the monophosphate form. Because 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine can be incorporated into the nascent strand opposite the adenine and cytosine in the template with almost equal efficiency, resulting in an A:T to C:G transversion mutation (4Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), MutT functions in the prevention of the misincorporation of such mutagenic nucleotides into DNA or mRNA during DNA replication or transcription (5Maki H.

Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In human cells, the accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine may be responsible for a significant portion of spontaneous mutations that lead to the induction of cancer, as well as age-related disorders (7Ames B. Shigenaga M. Hagen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar).

In contrast to human and E. coli, little is known about the functions of Nudix hydrolases and defense systems toward oxidative damage of nucleotides by MutT proteins in higher plants (12Hays J.B. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 579-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There are important differences between the life strategies of plants and most eukaryotes. Especially, even under optimal conditions, the photosynthetic electron transport in chloroplasts is inevitably accompanied by the reduction of O2 to O2−˙, which is followed by the production of other active oxygen species such as H2O2 and ·OH, on the reducing side of Photo-system I, although light, as the energy source for photosynthesis, is essential for plant life (13Asada K.

Descourvières P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a wide range of environmental stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and low temperature, result in the enhanced production of active oxygen species (14Foyer C.H. Descourvières P.

Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of the DNA data base, it is likely that 24 open reading frames encoding potential homologues of Nudix hydrolases exist in Arabidopsis thaliana. Among them, AtNUDT1 (At1g68760) was initially characterized as a NADH pyrophosphatase (20Dobrzanska M. Szurmak B. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Kraszewska E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50482-50486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, Klaus et al. (21Klaus S.M. Wegkamp A. Sybesma W. Hugenholtz J. Gregory 3rd., J.F. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

However, little attention has been given to the effects of MutT-type proteins, including AtNUDT1, on the sanitization system of oxidized nucleotides. Furthermore, several members of the Nudix hydrolase family have recently been described as having either a high specificity for ADP-ribose or including ADP-ribose within their substrate specificity range (3Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although it is yet to be proven, it is assumed that these enzymes play an important role in maintaining the concentration of intracellular ADP-ribose at a sub-toxic level, because the accumulation of ADP-ribose can be potentially cytotoxic due to its ability to modify protein and to bind to ATP-activated K+ channels (22Kwak Y-G.

It has been demonstrated that the gene products from Methanococcus jannaschii MJ1149, E. coli orf186, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae YSA1, and the human and mouse Ysa1p homologues, NUDT5 and Nudt5, respectively, have activities toward ADP-ribose (3Dunn C.A.

In this work, we characterized the molecular properties of cytosolic Nudix hydrolases in A. thaliana, because the cytosol is the main pool of their substrates. For the first time, we demonstrated that AtNUDT1 functions in the defense system of spontaneous mutagenesis via the sanitization of oxidized nucleotides. Furthermore, enzymatic characterizations of a large number of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases in A. thaliana clearly suggest that these isoenzymes play roles in regulating the intracellular concentration of ADP-ribose in plant cells. Materials and Plant Growth Conditions—A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown on basic Murashige and Skoog medium in Petri dishes containing 3% (w/v) sucrose at 25 °C under long day conditions (16-h light at 100 μE m-2 s-1/8-h dark period). The E. coli strain, CC101, and the mutT-deficient strain, CC101T, were kind gifts from Prof. Maki (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). The pTrc100 plasmid for the complementary assay was obtained from Prof. Nakabeppu (Kyushu University). The 8-oxo-dGTP was purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa (Kyoto, Japan). All other materials and enzymes were of analytical grade and were obtained from commercial sources. Construction of Expression Plasmids of Recombinant AtNUDT—Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of 4-week-old wild-type plants (1.0-g fresh weight), as previously described (26Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace (reverse transcriptase, Toyobo) with an oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The open reading frames of AtNUDT1-11 were amplified from the first strand cDNAs, using the primer sets shown as follows; AtNUDT1-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGTCGACAGGAGAAGC-3′), AtNUDT1-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGTTAACTCTTACATC-3′), AtNUDT2-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGTCTGCTTCTAGTTC-3′), AtNUDT2-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGGAAAGCTCTGTTTG-3′), AtNUDT4-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGACAGGGTTCTCTGT-3′), AtNUDT4-BamHI-R (5′-GGATCCAGTGCTACTAATTC-3′), AtNUDT5-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGACGGTGAAGCTTT-3′), AtNUDT5-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGAGCAGAAACACTTT-3′), AtNUDT6-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGACAATGAAGATCA-3′), AtNUDT6-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGCACGTTCTGAAGAA-3′), AtNUDT7-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGGTACTAGAGCTCA-3′), AtNUDT7-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGTCGGAATAATATAG-3′), AtNUDT8-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGATTCTGTTTCTCT-3′), AtNUDT8-NdeI-R (5′-CATATGGAAGAGAGAGTATC-3′), AtNUDT9-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGGCGAAACTAGCAGAAGAGAT-3′), AtNUDT9-BamHI-R (5′-GGATCCCAATAATTCACAACTAGGTG-3′), AtNUDT10-NdeI-F (5′-CATATGTCAGACCAAGAGGCTCCTCT-3′), AtNUDT10-BamHI-R (5′-GGATCCAATGACGATGTTCTTGGAAG-3′), AtNUDT11-XhoI-F (5′-CTCGAGATGTCTTCAACAACAACAGA-3′), and AtNUDT11-XhoI-R (5′-CTCGAGCTCAATCAGATCAAGTCAAG-3′). The sequences were homologous to the cDNAs of AtNUDT1-11 except for the replacement of the original nucleotides that introduced the desired restriction sites (bold sequences). The amplified DNA fragments were ligated into pSTBlue T-vectors (Novagen). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain terminator method with an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM™ 310, Applied Biosystems). The resulting constructs were digested with NdeI/NdeI for AtNUDT1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -8, NdeI/BamHI for AtNUDT9 and -10, and XhoI/XhoI for AtNUDT11, and were ligated into the expression vectors, pET16b (Novegen) or pCold II (TaKaRa), to produce histidine-tagged proteins. The resulting plasmids, pET16b/AtNUDT1, -2, -5, -6, -7, and -8, and pCold II/AtNUDT4, -8, -9, -10, and -11 were introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AtNUDT Proteins—E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with pET16b/AtNUDT1, -2, -5, -6, -7, or -8, or pCold II/AtNUDT4, -8, -9, -10, or -11 was grown in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μgml-1 of ampicillin and 34 μgml-1 of chloramphenicol. After an overnight culture at 37 °C, the cultures were transferred to 500 ml of LB medium (with the antibiotics) and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were incubated for 16 h at 16 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and were sonicated (10 kHz) using 20-s strokes with 30-s intervals and were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The hexahistidine-tagged recombinant AtNUDT proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein contents were determined following the method of Bradford (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay and High-performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis—The hydrolytic activities of AtNUDT proteins toward to 8-oxo-dGTP, ADP-ribose, and NADH were assayed according to the method described in Tassotto and Mathews (28Tassotto M.L.

Sixty microliters of the reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 25 μm substrate, and 0.2-1.0 μg of recombinant proteins, was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The mixture was then analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography using a Cosmosil C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min-1 for the mobile phase buffer, which contained 73 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and 20% methanol. The substrates and their reaction products were detected according to their UV absorbance, as follows; 8-oxo-dGTP (293 nm), dGTP (252 nm), dCTP (271 nm), dTTP (264 nm), ADP-ribose, NADH, FAD, CoA, ApnA, UDP-glucose, and UDP-galactose (260 nm). Complementation Assay of the E. coli mutT Mutation—AtNUDT cDNAs were amplified with the reverse transcription-PCR using the specific primer sets as shown; AtNUDT1-NcoI-F (5′-CCATGGCGACAGGAGAAGCG-3′), AtNUDT1-KpnI-R (5′-GGATCCTTAACTCTTACATC-3′), AtNUDT2-SacI-F (5′-GAGCTCTCTGCTTCTAGTTC-3′), AtNUDT2-XbaI-R (5′-TCTAGAGAAAGCTCTGTTTG-3′), AtNUDT7-EcoRI-F (5′-GAATTCGGTACTAGAGCTCA-3′), and AtNUDT7-BamHI-R (5′-GGATCCTCGGAATAATATAG-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with NcoI/KpnI (AtNUDT1), SacI/XbaI (AtNUDT2), and EcoRI/BamHI (AtNUDT7), respectively, and were ligated into pTrc100 vectors. The complementation assay was carried out according to the method described in Sakumi et al. (8Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains CC101 (wild type) or CC101T (mutT-) were transformed with empty plasmids, or the plasmids containing AtNUDT cDNAs. A single transformant was grown in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The culture solutions were diluted 1 × 106-fold, and 100 μl of each culture was grown in 6 ml of LB medium containing 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 14-16 h. Mutation frequencies toward streptomycin resistance were measured by plating aliquots of these cultures on LB medium with or without the antibiotic (100 μg ml-1). Analysis of AtNUDT Expression—Total RNAs were isolated from several tissues (roots, stems, and leaves) of 2-week-old wild-type A. thaliana plants (1.0 g of fresh weight). The cDNAs encoding AtNUDT proteins were amplified with the reverse transcription-PCR (20-28 cycles) using the following primer sets; AtNUDT1-F (5′-ATAATGTCGACAGGAGAAGC-3′), AtNUDT1-R (5′-CATCTATTAACTCTTACATC-3′), AtNUDT2-F (5′-TTCACAGTTGCTCCACCACG-3′), AtNUDT2-R (5′-AGAATCTGTGAGGAAAGCTC-3′), AtNUDT3-F (5′-CATATGGCGGAGGAGCACTT-3′), AtNUDT3-R (5′-GGATCCGCTGAAACTGAAAC-3′), AtNUDT4-F (5′-CATATGACAGGGTTCTCTGT-3′), AtNUDT4-R (5′-GGATCCAGTGCTACTAATTC-3′), AtNUDT5-F (5′-TGTAGCATGGACGGTGAAGC-3′), AtNUDT5-R (5′-CTAGTCAGAGAGAGAGGTGG-3′), AtNUDT6-F (5′-TGGACAATGAAGATCAGGAG-3′), AtNUDT-6-R (5′-CAACCAGAGGTGGAGGCTAG-3′), AtNUDT7-F (5′-TGAGATGGGTACTAGAGCTC-3′), AtNUDT7-R (5′-CAGAGAGAAGCAGAGGCTTG-3′), AtNUDT8-F (5′-CCACATAGATCTTCTTGATC-3′), AtNUDT8-R (5′-GAGGATGAAGAGAGAGTATC-3′), AtNUDT9-F (5′-CATATGGCGAAACTAGCAGAAGAGAT-3′), AtNUDT9-R (5′-GGATCCCAATAATTCACAACTAGGTG-3′), AtNUDT10-F (5′-CATATGTCAGACCAAGAGGCTCCTCT-3′), AtNUDT10-R (5′-GGATCCAATGACGATGTTCTTGGAAG-3′), AtNUDT11-F (5′-CTCGAGATGTCTTCAACAACAACAGA-3′), AtNUDT11-R (5′-CTCGAGCTCAATCAGATCAAGTCAAG-3′), Actin8-F (5′-GAGATCCACATCTGCTGG-3′), and Actin8-R (5′-GCTGAGAGATTCAGGTGCCC-3′). The actin transcript was used as a constitutive control. PCR amplification was performed with 20-26 cycles of 95 °C for 60s, 55 °C for 60s, and 72 °C for 60s, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Equal loading of each amplified gene sequence was determined with the control Actin8 PCR product. Nudix Hydrolase Genes in A. thaliana—A search for the Nudix hydrolase genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Data Base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) showed that 24 genes (AtNUDT1-24) encoding the Nudix domain existed in A. thaliana. The portions of the open reading frames of 24 genes are characterized by a signature sequence of highly conserved amino acids spanning a region of 23 amino acids called the Nudix box, which acts as the catalytic and nucleotide binding sites (Fig. 1). Among them, only AtNUDT1 has been characterized as an NADH, dihydroneopterin triphosphate, and (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatases (20Dobrzanska M. Szurmak B. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A.

The deduced amino acid sequences of AtNUDTs showed low homology (11.6-25.9%) with those of E. coli MutT and human MTH1, and their sizes ranged from 16.4 kDa (147 amino acids) to 86.9 kDa (772 amino acids). Furthermore, it was predicted that these AtNUDTs were classified into three types by their subcellular localization in the TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) as follows: cytosol (AtNUDT1-11), mitochondrion (AtNUDT12-18), and chloroplast (AtNUDT19-24). Among them, the product of AtNUDT3 is not likely a typical Nudix hydrolase enzyme, because its predicted sequence shows an extremely low homology to those of other AtNUDTs, and its molecular mass (86.9 kDa) is much higher than those of the enzymes in other organisms, such as E. coli and human. In eukaryotic cells, pools of their substrates are present mainly in the cytosol (29Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.M. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human MTH1 is mostly localized in the cytosolic fraction (30Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on cytosolic types of AtNUDTs (AtNUDT1, -2, and -4 through -11) and studied their molecular properties. Expression and Purification of the His-tagged Recombinant AtNUDT Proteins—The cDNAs encoding cytosolic AtNUDTs were obtained from total RNA prepared from Rosetta leaves of A. thaliana. The entire open reading frame regions of AtNUDT1, -2, and -4 through -11 were cloned into pET16b or pCold II for production of their recombinant proteins fused with a hexahistidine tag in E. coli. The recombinant proteins of AtNUDT1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, -10, and -11 were produced with high efficiency in the soluble fraction. The molecular masses of each recombinant AtNUDT proteins agreed with their predicted molecular masses. Therefore, these recombinant proteins were purified using a HiTrap chelating HP column to apparent homogeneity, as judged with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The production of recombinant proteins of AtNUDT8 was detected only in the insoluble fraction because of the formation of inclusion bodies. Substrate Specificities of Recombinant AtNUDT Proteins—To analyze the properties of cytosolic AtNUDTs as Nudix hydrolases, we measured the hydrolytic activities of these enzymes in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and various types of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives with high-performance liquid chromatography. The results are summarized in Table I. The recombinant proteins of AtNUDT2, -6, -7, and -10 hydrolyzed both ADP-ribose and NADH to AMP. These proteins showed a high affinity for ADP-ribose compared with the other ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases, hNUDT5 (25Yang H. Slupska M.M. Wei Y.F. Tai J.H. Luther W.M. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Chiang J.H.

Overall, it appears that two nuclearreceptors that regulate TG metabolism, PPARα and farnesoid X-activatedreceptor, modulate expression of the APOAV gene.Although knowledge of apoA-V gene expression is becoming better understood,key questions remain about the mechanism whereby the apoA-V protein influencesplasma TG levels. In the present study we evaluated the hypothesis that apoA-Vmodulates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and demonstrated that apoA-V is aheparin-binding protein. The potential effects of this interaction onmetabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins by LPL and lipoprotein receptors arediscussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESApolipoproteins and Lipoproteins—Recombinant human apoA-Vwas prepared as described by Beckstead et al.(7Beckstead J.A.

Normal human lipoproteinfractions were obtained by sequential centrifugation of human EDTA plasma.ApoC-II-deficient chylomicrons were a generous gift from Prof. UlrikeBeisiegel and Dr. Joerg Heeren, (University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg,Germany). ApoC-II and apoC-III1 were isolated from human plasma asdescribed previously (8Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Theapolipoproteins were dissolved in 5 m urea, 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.5, and protein concentrations in the stock solutions weredetermined by the BCA kit (Pierce).Other Reagents and Analyses—Heparin was obtained from NovoNordisk. Biotinylated heparin was prepared by incubation of heparin (5 mg/ml)with a 10-fold molar excess of biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.6. Non-reacted biotinN-hydroxysuccinimide ester was removed by dialysis. Pre- andpost-heparin human plasma was taken before and 10 min after injection of 100units of heparin/kg of body weight to healthy individuals. Blood was collectedin heparinized tubes and plasma isolated by centrifugation. Lipids (TG,cholesterol, and phospholipids) were analyzed by enzyme-based colorimetricassay (Wako).Lipoprotein Lipase Assays—LPL was isolated from bovine milkaccording to the procedure of Bengtsson-Olivecrona and Olivecrona(8Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and stored frozen at aconcentration of 0.5–1 mg/ml in 10 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH6.5, 1 m NaCl. Prior to use, the enzyme preparation was diluted in5 mm Na-deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing0.1 mm SDS, a buffer in which LPL activity is well preserved. Threedistinct assay systems were employed to analyze the effect of apoA-V on LPLactivity. The first employed human VLDL as the substrate at a TG concentrationof 1 mg/ml in a total volume of 1 ml in 0.14 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 4.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Fraction V) and 0.4 unitsof heparin/ml (Leo Pharma AB, Malmö, Sweden). ApoA-V, or dilutionsthereof, was added in 50 μl of buffer containing 5 m urea. Thesamples were preincubated for 15–30 min before the addition of LPL, andincubations were carried out for 30 min at 25 °C. Fatty acids releasedwere extracted and determined by manual titration using NaOH(9Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Converse C. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analyses. A Practical Approach. IRLPress, Oxford1992: 169-185Google Scholar). The second assay methodemployed an egg yolk phosphatidylcholine-stabilized emulsion of soybean TGcorresponding to Intralipid 10%® (Fresienius-KABI, Uppsala, Sweden) towhich a trace amount of [3H]oleic acid-labeled triolein had beenincorporated during preparation by the manufacturer. This substrate was usedwith and without the addition of purified apoC-II or apoC-III1. Thesystem contained 2 mg of TG/ml, 0.15 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.1m NaCl, 6% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg of heparin/ml in a totalvolume of 0.2 ml (10Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Rifai N. Warnick G.R. Domonoczak M.H. Handbook of Lipoprotein Testing. AACCPress, Washington, D. C.2000: 479-498Google Scholar). Apo A-Vwas added in 10 μl of buffer containing 5 m urea, and apoC-II orapoC-III1 were added in a total of 2 μl of buffer with 5m urea. Substrates were preincubated 15–30 min prior to theaddition of LPL followed by a 15-min incubation at 25 °C. In the absenceof apoC-II, 5-fold more LPL was added to achieve an equivalent lipolysis rate.Radiolabeled fatty acids were extracted and counted as described(10Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Rifai N. Warnick G.R. Domonoczak M.H. Handbook of Lipoprotein Testing. AACCPress, Washington, D. C.2000: 479-498Google Scholar). The third systememployed liposomes prepared from DMPC but without the addition of radiolabeledDMPC (11Rojas C. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The liposomesubstrate was preincubated for 1 h at 25°Cata concentration of 1.5 mg ofphosphatidylcholine/ml (total volume 1 ml). The phospholipolysis assays wereinitiated as described above for the TG emulsion substrate, and the releasedfatty acids were determined by titration(9Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Converse C. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analyses. A Practical Approach. IRLPress, Oxford1992: 169-185Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Samples were electrophoresed on a 4–20%acrylamide gradient, Tris-glycine SDS gel. Separated proteins were transferredto a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at a 150-mAmp constantcurrent for 3 h. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with0.1% TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH7.2) overnight at room temperature while rotating. Biotinylated anti-apoA-VIgG was used at a 1:10,000 dilution in 0.1% TTBS. The blot was then washed0.1% TTBS (4 × 10 min) and incubated with secondary antibody(NeutraAvidin, Pierce) at a dilution of 1:100,000 in TTBS. After washing, theblot was incubated with West Femto Chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) for 4min and exposed to x-ray film for 2 min and developed using a M35A X-OMATprocessor (Kodak).Heparin Binding Studies—ApoA-V-DMPC disc particles(7Beckstead J.A. Oda M.N. Martin D.D.O. Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Luty R. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9416-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or apoE3-NT in buffer (20mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) were applied to a 1-ml HiTrap HeparinHP affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). After loading, the column waswashed with buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient ofNaCl from 0 to 1.0 m.Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)binding studies were performed on a BIAcore 2000 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)using CM5 sensor chips (12Lookene A. Cheuvreuil O. Ostergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,13Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Streptavidin wascovalently attached to the carboxymethylated surface of the sensor chipactivated by N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide. Thenbiotinylated heparin was bound to the immobilized streptavidin. Bindingexperiments were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 50 mm guanidinehydrochloride. A stock solution of apoA-V (1.6 mg/ml) was prepared in 6m guanidine hydrochloride, and dilutions into the running bufferwere made just before injection. A solution of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4,1 m NaCl was used for regeneration of the surface of thesensorchips.Sensorgrams were analyzed with the aid of the BIAevaluation softwareVersion 3 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). To obtain curves of specific binding,background sensorgrams characterizing nonspecific interactions were subtractedfrom experimental sensorgrams.RESULTSEffect of ApoA-V and ApoC-III on LPL Activity—To determinewhether the inverse correlation between apoA-V and plasma TG levels arisesfrom direct stimulation of lipolysis, LPL activity was measured invitro using three unique substrate lipid particles. When either VLDL orDMPC liposomes were employed as the substrate, no activation of LPL wasobserved by apoA-V. ApoC-III in high concentrations caused some inhibition ofLPL activity on VLDL (Fig. 1).With the TG emulsion as the substrate there was a slight apparent stimulationof LPL activity at the lowest concentrations of apoA-V, but inhibition wasthen seen at higher concentrations (>3 μm). The inhibitionwas not as strong as that with apoC-III, which was compared in the sameexperiment. In the absence of apoC-II inhibition of baseline LPL activity wasobserved with apoA-V. ApoC-III was less inhibitory than apoA-V in incubationswithout apoC-II. Thus, using different substrate lipid particles, where fullactivation depends on the presence of apoC-II, little or no effect of apoA-Vwas observed. On the basis of these data we concluded that apoA-V does notserve as a direct activator of LPL activity.Heparin-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography—An examination ofthe amino acid sequence of mature human apoA-V revealed a stretch of 42residues that lacks amino acids with negatively charged side chains (residues186–227). On the other hand, this segment contains 5 Arg and 3 Lys (plus3 His) residues. Given the strong positive charge density in this region ofthe protein, we postulated that apoA-V may interact with heparan sulfateproteoglycans. To examine this, apoA-V-DMPC lipid particles were subjected toheparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography(Fig. 2). The results obtainedindicated that apoA-V-DMPC lipid particles bind heparin-Sepharose and elutedupon application of a NaCl gradient. ApoA-V-DMPC complexes eluted at 0.36m NaCl, whereas apoE3-NT, a known heparin-binding protein used as apositive control, eluted at 0.41 m NaCl (not shown).Fig. 2Heparin-Sepharose chromatography of apoA-V-DMPC disc particles.ApoA-V-DMPC disc particles, in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, wereapplied to a Hi-Trap heparin affinity column.

The interaction was characterized by an associationrate constant ka = 4.3 × 104m–1 s–1 and a dissociation rateconstant kd = 0.009 s–1.Fig. 3Surface plasmon resonance analysis of apoA-V heparin binding.

In theabsence of exogenous apoA-V a small amount of binding was noted. By contrast,prior incubation of the heparin chip with apoA-V caused a significantenhancement in chylomicron binding. Similar results were obtained with VLDL(Fig. 4B), where aneven greater enhancement in binding was observed in the presence of apoA-V. Onthe other hand, apoA-V had little effect on the interaction of HDL withheparin-coated SPR chips (Fig.4C).Fig. 4Effect of apoA-V on lipoprotein interaction with heparin-coatedchips.

Moreover, when apoA-V-enrichedchylomicrons were introduced, a further increase in chylomicron binding to theLPL-heparin-coated chip was observed.Fig. 5Effect of apoA-V on chylomicron binding to LPL on heparin-coatedchips.

The elegant studies ofPennacchio et al. (1Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar)illustrate the power of comparative sequence analysis in identifyingfunctionally important regions of the genome. The unexpected discovery of anew member of the apolipoprotein family that influences plasma TG levels hasimportant implications in terms of susceptibility to hypertriglyceridemia, aknown risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although there is strongcorrelative evidence regarding apoA-V, the molecular mechanism underlying itseffects has yet to be elucidated. Understanding details of how apoA-V affectsplasma TG levels is a key step toward application of knowledge of thisintriguing apolipoprotein to the diagnosis and/or treatment ofhypertriglyceridemia. Three major hypotheses currently exist to explain themechanism of apoA-V action, including 1) a direct modulatory effect onlipolytic enzyme activity, 2) an intracellular effect on hepatic lipoproteinbiogenesis and/or secretion, and 3) an indirect effect within the plasmacompartment to facilitate TG-rich lipoprotein metabolism or clearance from theplasma compartment.Mechanism 1, Direct Modulation of LPL Activity—Amonghypotheses currently under consideration to explain apoA-V effects on plasmaTG levels, a prominent one is a direct activation by apoA-V of LPL activity,thereby facilitating hydrolysis and removal of TG from VLDL and chylomicrons.Such a mechanism would be consistent with apoA-V transgenic and genedisruption experiments in mice. The low abundance of apoA-V in plasma (∼1μg/ml) suggests it is not merely a structural protein. Schaap etal. (14Schaap F.G. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Vrins C. van derVliet H.N. Chamuleau R.A. Havekes L.M. Groen A.K. van Dijk K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27941-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) used adenoviraltransfection to increase the levels of apoA-V in mice. These authors found anapoA-V dose-dependent reduction in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia followingintragastric fat load and concluded that apoA-V stimulates LPL-dependentclearance of TG-rich lipoproteins. Complementary in vitro experimentswith recombinant apoA-V revealed a >2-fold stimulation of LPL activity. Inother studies, Fruchart-Najib et al.(15Fruchart-Najib J. Bauge E. Niculescu L.S. Pham T. Thomas B. Rommens C. Majd Z. Brewer B. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported that apoA-Vshifts from HDL to VLDL following a fat load in mice expressing human apoA-V.These authors also report that enrichment of human VLDL with recombinantapoA-V induces a 50% increase in LPL activity, leading to the proposal thatapoA-V manifests its biological effects on plasma TG levels by activating LPL.In the present studies, however, we found no evidence that apoA-V serves as adirect modulator of LPL activity in vitro. By contrast, apoC-II had amajor stimulatory effect on LPL activity. Importantly, in support of ourfindings, Merkel et al.(16Merkel M. Loeffler B. Kluger M. Fabig N. Geppert G. Pennacchio L.A. Laetsch A. Heeren J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21553-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) recently reported thatapoA-V did not affect LPL hydrolysis rates in the absence of proteoglycans.Thus, although a clear explanation for the different results is not availableat present, it is conceivable that, under certain incubation conditions,apoA-V may alter the substrate emulsion, thereby increasing TG accessibilityand LPL activity. Further experiments will be required to determine the basisfor the discrepancy between results.Mechanism 2, Intracellular Mode of Action—Based on theunique interfacial properties of apoA-V(17Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D.O. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), an intracellular mode ofaction has been postulated. In studies with transfected COS-1 cells, controlproteins including human serum albumin and apoB-6.6(17Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D.O. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J.

By contrast, the majority ofapoA-V was retained in the cell lysate, with only small amounts recovered inthe medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that albumin andapoB-6.6 displayed diffuse endoplasmic reticulum and prominent heminuclearGolgi staining, whereas apoA-V displayed only perinuclear and diffusecytoplasmic staining, consistent with localization primarily to theendoplasmic reticulum (17Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D.O. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Thus, it is conceivable that apoA-V does not traffic efficiently from theendoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, resulting in low secretion efficiency.Additional evidence for an intracellular mode of action has been presented bySchaap et al. (14Schaap F.G. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Vrins C. van derVliet H.N. Chamuleau R.A. Havekes L.M. Groen A.K. van Dijk K.W. J. Biol.

When considered in light of the unique interfacialproperties of apoA-V (17Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D.O. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) theconcept that it interferes with nascent lipoprotein secretion efficiencyremains viable. This concept is also in keeping with the findings of van derVliet (18Van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C.J. Levels J.H.M. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamulau R.A.F.M. J. Biol.

In this case, itis conceivable that apoA-V-mediated inhibition of TG secretion preserves thispool of lipid for cellular needs associated with regeneration.Mechanism 3, Indirect Effect of ApoA-V on Plasma LipoproteinMetabolism—Possible mechanisms include serving as a ligan"

Procopio A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The biological effects ofVEGF are mediated via two distinct cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors, Fltand Flk. Upon VEGF binding, the receptors dimerize, and several intracellularsignaling routes that induce proliferation are activated, including themitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway(5Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar,7Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). FGF belongs to a family of23 members, of which FGF-1 and FGF-2 have been proposed to play a role in MMcell (patho)physiology (9Strizzi L. Vianale G. Catalano A. Muraro R. Mutti L. Procopio A. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 1: 1093-1098Google Scholar).Signaling mechanisms induced by FGFs are mediated by four high affinitytyrosine kinase receptors known as FGF receptors (FGFR), which aretransmembrane proteins that, once bound to cognate FGFs, dimerize and signalvia intracellular pathways, such as the MAP kinase route, that induce cellproliferation and migration(5Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). FGF receptors (FGFR)1–3 are alternatively spliced into two specific exons denoted IIIb andIIIc. The expression of FGFR 1–3 isoforms is highly controlled andessential for initiating specific cellular responses(5Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). TGF-β is a potentgrowth regulatory cytokine that exerts a diverse range of effects on manytypes of cells. TGF-β has potent mitogenic effects on several types of MMcells, which produce it at relatively high levels(6Kumar-Singh S. Weyler J. Martin M.J. Vermeulen P.B. Van Marck E. J.

All of these cytokinesmay control proliferation of MM cells via autocrine signaling(11Bermudez E. Everitt J. Walker C. Exp.

Conceivably, an idealanti-cancer agent preventing progression of the metastatic disease wouldselectively down-regulate the expression of those cytokines that positivelycontrol tumor growth, while being nontoxic toward normal cells.Recent data showed that analogs of vitamin E have potent anti-proliferativeand pro-apoptotic effects on multiple cancer cell lines and inhibit cancer inpre-clinical models (15Neuzil J. Br. J.Cancer. 2003; 89: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).These compounds are epitomized by α-tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS),a redox-silent compound that has been reported to suppress several types ofneoplasia(16Malafa M.P.

It has also been reportedthat α-TOS can modulate cytokine gene expression in cancer cells(26Turley J.M. Funakoshi S. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 655-663PubMed Google Scholar,27Malafa M.P. Neitzel L.T. J.Surg. Res. 2000; 93: 163-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, α-TOSdown-regulates FGFR-1 in MM cells, although the precise mechanism has not beenresolved (28Stapelberg M. Tomasetti M. Gellert N. Procopio A. Neuzil J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.Commun. 2004; 318: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Because α-TOS is a potent inducer of apoptosis in the generallyresistant MM cells (29Tomasetti M. Rippo M.R. Alleva R. Moretti S. Andera L. Neuzil J. Procopio A. Br. J.Cancer. 2004; 90: 1644-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) andinhibits MM in vivo(30Tomasetti M. Gellert N. Procopio A. Neuzil J. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 641-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we investigated theeffects of the vitamin E analog on expression of cytokines involved in controlof cancer development and progression. We show here that α-TOS disruptsthe FGF autocrine loop through suppression of egr-1 transcriptional activityin MM cells but not in their nonmalignant counterparts, further highlightingthe potential of α-TOS as a therapeutic agent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human MM cell lines, MM-B1 (biphasic), Meso-2(sarcomatose), Ist-Mes and Ist-Mes2 (both epithelioid)(31Pass H.I. Stevens E.J. Oie H. Tsokos M.G. Abati A.D. Fetsch P.A. Mew D.J. Pogrebniak H.W. Matthews W.J. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1995; 59: 835-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and a nonmalignantmesothelial cell line, Met-5A (ATCC), were used in our studies. The cells werecultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both from JRHBiosciences), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. All assays were performed when the cells reached 60–70%confluency.Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was determinedby assessing DNA synthesis. An end point enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) colorimetric kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to determine cellsin the S phase of the mitotic cycle, based on incorporation of5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into their DNA. Briefly, MM cells were seededat 104 cells per well into a 96-well plate, treated as specified,and incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2 h at 37 °C. The cellswere then fixed and denatured by a 30-min incubation with Fixdenat (RocheApplied Science), incubated for 90 min with an anti-BrdUrd antibody, washed,and incubated further with a substrate solution (tetramethylbenzidine). After30 min, 1 m H2SO4 was added to each well tostop the reaction, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using a plate reader.In some cases, cells were assessed for the expression of aproliferation-specific gene, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen by Westernblotting, using an anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen IgG (Santa CruzBiotechnology). Where indicated, cells were exogenously supplemented withhuman recombinant (hr) FGF-1 or hrFGF-2 (both from Sigma), at 10 ng/ml 24 hprior to treatment.Cell Cycle Assay—MM and Met-5A cells were plated at105 cells per well in 24-well plates. The cells were allowed toattach overnight and were then incubated for up to 3 days with α-TOS.The floating and attached cells were collected, washed with PBS, resuspendedin buffer containing sodium citrate (1%), Triton X-100 (0.1%), RNase A (0.05μg/ml), and propidium iodide (PI) at 5 μg/ml, and incubated in the darkfor 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear suspension was filtered through a 60-μmmesh and analyzed by flow cytometry.Apoptosis Assessment—Apoptosis was quantified by the annexinV-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) method, which detects phosphatidylserineexternalized in the early phases of apoptosis(20Neuzil J. Weber T. Schroder A. Lu M. Ostermann G. Gellert N. Mayne G.C. Olejnicka B. Negre-Salvayre A. Sticha M. Coffey R.J. Weber C. FASEBJ. 2001; 15: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells wereseeded at the density of 105 cells per well in 24-well plates andtreated with α-TOS after overnight recuperation. Floating and attachedcells were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in 0.1 ml of binding buffer(10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4), incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2μl of annexin V-FITC supplemented with 10 μl of PI (10 μg/ml), andanalyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) using channel 1 forannexin V-FITC binding and channel 2 for PI staining.Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Cellular ROS weredetected indirectly by flow cytometry and directly by EPR spectroscopy,following treatment of cells with α-TOS as indicated in the figurelegends. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for 1 h with 2μm mitochondrially targeted coenzyme Q (mito-Q)(32Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A.

Forindirect evaluation, cells were treated with α-TOS and reacted withdihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes) for 30 min, andscored by flow cytometry for cells with high fluorescence, which was evaluatedon the basis of an increase in mean fluorescence intensity. EPR spectroscopyanalysis of ROS generation was based on the use of the radical trap5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO; Sigma). In brief, cells wereplated in T25 flasks and allowed to reach 60–70% confluency (∼5× 106 cells per flask). Cells were washed, overlaid with thePSS medium (33Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and incubatedwith 50 μm α-TOS 5 min after addition of 10 mmDMPO. Analyses of DMPO adducts were performed with samples taken from the cellsuspension as well as the cell-conditioned medium transferred into a quartzflat cell (Wilmad). The quartz cell was then placed into the cavity of theBruker EMX bench-top spectrometer set at 293 K with the following spectrometerparameters: field sweep 10 millitesla, microwave power 20 milliwatts,microwave frequency 100 kHz, modulation amplitude, 0.1 millitesla, sweep time83.9 s. The detection limit of the stable nitroxide (TEMPO) under identicalconditions was ∼50 nm.Real Time mRNA Analysis—Relative quantification of mRNAexpression was achieved using quantitative real time-PCR (Q-PCR). Briefly,this technique is based on the detection of a fluorescent signal produced bythe incorporation of the fluorescent dye SYBR-green during PCR amplification(Prism 7700 sequence detection system; Applied Biosystems). The expression ofall genes of interest was related to that of the 18 S RNA control. Total RNAwas extracted from MM cell cultures using Trizol (Invitrogen). To minimizepotential genomic contamination, RNA samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-freeDNase (Promega) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Each assaywas performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA wassynthesized using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen)according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR primers were specificallydesigned for real time PCR. Particular attention was given to maintaining aconstant 60 °C annealing temperature of primer pairs, which is common forQ-PCR. Each set of primers was also designed across intron/exon boundaries todetect genomic DNA contamination.The primers used were as follows: FGF-1, 5′-GGG CTT TTA TACGGC TCA CA-3′, and 5′-GGC CAA CAA ACC AAT TCT TC-3′;FGF-2, 5′-GAC CCT CAC ATC AAG CTA CAA CT-3′, and5′-AAA GAA ACA CTC ATC CGT AAC ACA-3′; VEGF,5′-AGGCCA GCA CAT AGG AGA GA-3′, and 5′-TTT CTT GCG CTT TCG TTTTT-3′; TGF-β,5′-GAG CCT GAG GCC GAC TAC TA-3′,and 5′-TCG GAG CTC TGA TGT GTT GA-3′.RNA Interference (RNAi)—For RNAi, cells were seeded at afinal density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 12-well plates,cultured until ∼50% confluency, and then treated with egr-1, FGF-1, orFGF-2 siRNA (all designed and synthesized by Proligo) as follows: siRNA (0.5μg/ml) was combined with 100 μl of serum-free DMEM supplemented with 20μlof Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and left for 15 min at room temperature.The transfection mixture was added to cells, which were then left in theincubator for 24 h, after which they were overlaid with complete DMEM.24–48 h later, the cells were used in experiments. Typically,90–95% of treated cells showed significant down-regulation of thetargeted genes as estimated by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown).Nonsilencing RNA was used as a negative control and FITC-tagged nonspecificRNA as a control for transfection efficacy (both Qiagen).Analysis of FGF-1 and FGF-2 Protein—The FGF-1 and FGF-2protein levels were assessed using an ELISA kit (R & D Systems) accordingto the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were seeded in 24-wellplates and allowed to reach 60–70% confluency. Following treatment, 100μl of cell-conditioned medium was transferred to the ELISA 96-well plate,mixed with 100 μl of the assay diluent, and incubated for 2 h at roomtemperature. After washing, each well was supplemented with 200 μl of FGFconjugate, which was followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature and a30-min incubation with 200 μl of the substrate solution. Absorbance at 450nm was assessed using an ELISA plate reader. The system was calibrated usinghrFGF-1 or hrFGF-2.Immunofluorescence Analysis of Protein Expression—MM andMet-5A cells were grown on coverslips and treated with α-TOS at 10 and20 μm for 24 and 48 h. The cells were then fixed in 3.6%formalin in PBS and reacted on ice for 2 h with anti-egr-1, anti-FGF-1, oranti FGF-2 IgG (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in PBScontaining 2% fetal calf serum, followed by incubation with a secondary,FITC-, or Texas Red-conjugated IgG. Background fluorescence was accounted forin samples where primary antibody was omitted. The cells were then mounted in4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vectashield and assessed forfluorescence, reflecting protein expression, using the Leica DMI ER2fluorescence microscope. Images were taken, and the level of staining wasestimated using the Leica image analysis/deconvolution software.Assessment of egr-1 Transcription Activity—To assess whetherα-TOS affects egr-1-dependent trans-activation, cells were transientlytransfected with a plasmid comprising the egr-1-response element in thepromoter followed by the lux gene (Stratagene) and treated asdescribed in the figure legends. Luciferase activity was assessed using theLuciferase Reporter Gene Detection Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer'sprotocol, and the extent of luciferase activity was related to the activity inthe untreated controls.Animal Experiments—Immunocompromised (athymic) mice wereinjected subcutaneously with Ist-Met2 (2 × 106 cells peranimal). After 15 days when tumors were established, the mice were injectedinto the peritoneum with 100 μl of 200 mm α-TOS (dilutedper animal) per animal every 3 days or with the vehicle alone. Tumor volumewas estimated with calipers, and the volume was calculated by using theequation height × length × width × 0.524 as describedpreviously (34Kogure K. Manabe S. Hama S. Tokumura A. Fukuzawa K. Cancer Lett. 2003; 192: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The growth oftumors was expressed as an increase in their volume relative to the tumorvolume at the onset of treatment.Assessment of Intracellular Levels of α-TOS andα-TOH—To assess the levels of the two vitamin E analogs,a high pressure liquid chromatography method was applied as describedelsewhere (35Fariss M.W.

Here we studied the effect ofα-TOS on several MM cell lines of different phenotypic origin and ontheir nonmalignant counterparts. α-TOS consistently induced apoptosis inall MM cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, and the extent ofapoptosis was comparable irrespective of the cell phenotype(Fig. 1). In all cases, dosesof >30 μm were required for apoptosis induction, and suchdoses are achievable in vivo(17Weber T. Lu M. Andera L. Lahm H. Gellert N. Fariss M.W. Korinek V. Sattler W. Ucker D.S. Terman A. Schroder A. Erl W. Brunk U.T. Coffey R.J. Weber C. Neuzil J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 863-869PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, andimportant to the therapeutic potential of α-TOS, the vitamin E analogwas nontoxic to Met-5A cells (Fig.1).We next tested the effect of α-TOS on cell proliferation. The cellswere treated with the agent at 10–50 μm for up to 72 h. Asshown in Fig. 2, significantinhibition of cell proliferation was observed in MM cells treated for morethan 24 h with α-TOS at concentrations between 10 and 50μm. It is noteworthy that the vitamin E analog inhibitedproliferation at levels where it did not induce apoptosis, pointing to effectsthat are apoptosis-independent. Suppression of cellular proliferation by thevitamin E analog suggests that it may inhibit cell cycle progression(Fig. 3). Indeed, treatment ofMeso-2 MM cells with a subapoptotic concentration of α-TOS resulted inaccumulation of cells in G2 phase at the expense of cells in theS-phase and, to a lesser extent, cells in G1 phase(Fig. 3B). Cell cyclearrest was comparable in the other MM cell lines tested (data not shown). Cellcycle analysis also revealed a low number of cells accumulating insub-G0 (data not shown), supporting the idea that α-TOSexhibits anti-proliferative activity in addition to induction of apoptosis.Again, little effect was observed in Met-5A cells(Fig. 3A).Fig. 2α-TOS inhibits proliferation in MM cells but not in nonmalignantmesothelial cells. Met-5A (A), MM-B1 (B), Meso-2(C), and Ist-Mes2 cells (D) were seeded in 24-well platesand left overnight to recuperate. The cells were then at ∼50% confluencyand incubated with α-TOS at concentrations shown for 24, 48, or 72 h,and the level of proliferation was estimated by the BrdUrd assay. Cellproliferation is expressed relative to proliferation of control cells at theonset of the experiment.

Therefore, we treated the cells withα-TOS at sub-apoptotic levels and assessed for the expression of severalgenes that have an important role in tumor growth, namely FGF-1 (acidic FGF),FGF-2 (basic FGF), TGF-β, and VEGF. Overall, the MM and nonmalignantmesothelial cells express the individual mRNAs, with the exception ofIst-Mes2, where no VEGF mRNA was detected(Fig. 4). Although the relativelevels of mRNA for TGF-β and VEGF did not differ substantially,significant differences in the expression of FGFs were observed. FGF-2 mRNAwas expressed ∼2–3-times more than FGF-1 mRNA in all cell lines.Notably, Meso-2 cells expressed the highest levels of FGF-2 mRNA, whereasthese cells expressed less FGF-1 mRNA. This pattern was similar for other MMcell lines. The nonmalignant Met-5A cells expressed relatively low levels ofFGF-2 mRNA. When cha"

However, the molecular nature of the translocation contact sites is poorly understood. We have identified a novel component of the TIM23 translocase, Tim21, which is involved in their formation. Tim21 is anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane by a single transmembrane domain and exposes its C-terminal domain into the intermembrane space. The purified C-terminal domain of Tim21 appears not to bind to any of the TIM23 components but rather specifically interacts with the TOM complex.

https://openalex.org/W2077256608,"In vitro studies suggest that the mitochondrialglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (mtGPAT1) isoform catalyzes the initialand rate-controlling step in glycerolipid synthesis and aids in partitioningacyl-CoAs toward triacylglycerol synthesis and away from degradative pathways.To determine whether the absence of mtGPAT1 would increase oxidation ofacyl-CoAs and restrict the development of hepatic steatosis, we fed wild typeand mtGPAT1–/– mice a diet high in fat and sucrose (HH)for 4 months to induce the development of obesity and a fatty liver. Controlmice were fed a diet low in fat and sucrose (LL). With the HH diet, absence ofmtGPAT1 resulted in increased partitioning of acyl-CoAs toward oxidativepathways, demonstrated by 60% lower hepatic triacylglycerol content and 2-foldincreases in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines, and hepatic mRNAexpression of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase. Despite the increase in fattyacid oxidation, liver acyl-CoA levels were 3-fold higher in themtGPAT1–/– mice fed both diets. A lack of difference inCPT1 and FAS mRNA expression between genotypes suggested that the increasedacyl-CoA content was not because of increased de novo synthesis, butinstead, to an impaired ability to use long-chain acyl-CoAs derived from thediet, even when the dietary fat content was low. Hyperinsulinemia and reducedglucose tolerance on the HH diet was greater in themtGPAT1–/– mice, which did not suppress the expressionof the gluconeogenic genes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxykinase. This study demonstrates that mtGPAT1 is essential for normalacyl-CoA metabolism, and that the absence of hepatic mtGPAT1 results in thepartitioning of fatty acids away from triacylglycerol synthesis and towardoxidation and ketogenesis. In vitro studies suggest that the mitochondrialglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (mtGPAT1) isoform catalyzes the initialand rate-controlling step in glycerolipid synthesis and aids in partitioningacyl-CoAs toward triacylglycerol synthesis and away from degradative pathways.To determine whether the absence of mtGPAT1 would increase oxidation ofacyl-CoAs and restrict the development of hepatic steatosis, we fed wild typeand mtGPAT1–/– mice a diet high in fat and sucrose (HH)for 4 months to induce the development of obesity and a fatty liver. Controlmice were fed a diet low in fat and sucrose (LL). With the HH diet, absence ofmtGPAT1 resulted in increased partitioning of acyl-CoAs toward oxidativepathways, demonstrated by 60% lower hepatic triacylglycerol content and 2-foldincreases in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines, and hepatic mRNAexpression of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase. Despite the increase in fattyacid oxidation, liver acyl-CoA levels were 3-fold higher in themtGPAT1–/– mice fed both diets. A lack of difference inCPT1 and FAS mRNA expression between genotypes suggested that the increasedacyl-CoA content was not because of increased de novo synthesis, butinstead, to an impaired ability to use long-chain acyl-CoAs derived from thediet, even when the dietary fat content was low. Hyperinsulinemia and reducedglucose tolerance on the HH diet was greater in themtGPAT1–/– mice, which did not suppress the expressionof the gluconeogenic genes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxykinase. This study demonstrates that mtGPAT1 is essential for normalacyl-CoA metabolism, and that the absence of hepatic mtGPAT1 results in thepartitioning of fatty acids away from triacylglycerol synthesis and towardoxidation and ketogenesis. Hepatic steatosis, a feature of the metabolic syndrome, is a precursor forhepatosteatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure(1Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar).

Three GPAT activities havebeen identified in mammalian tissues, one in the endoplasmic reticulum(microsomal GPAT), and two in the mitochondria, mtGPAT1 and mtGPAT2(2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D.

Although the independentroles of the three GPAT isoforms have not been established, the mtGPAT1appears to be an important contributor to triacylglycerol synthesis. Forexample, mtGPAT1 activity and mRNA expression are up-regulated nutritionallyand hormonally when excess calories are available from either dietary fat orcarbohydrate(4Shin D-H. Paulauskis J.D.

Directing acyl-CoAs toward either oxidative or synthetic pathways is key inthe regulation of cellular energy metabolism and triacylglycerol accumulation.Both mtGPAT1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, the rate-limiting step forβ-oxidation, are intrinsic enzymes of the outer mitochondrial membranewhere their reciprocal regulation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) wouldallow them to play coordinated roles in directing the fate of acyl-CoAs.In vitro studies show that AMPK phosphorylates acetyl-CoAcarboxylase, thereby decreasing the product of acetyl-CoA carboxylase,malonyl-CoA, the allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1(8Hardie D.G.

Overexpression ofmtGPAT1 in rat hepatocytes increases both triacylglycerol mass and theincorporation of [14C]oleate into triacylglycerol, while decreasing[14C]oleate incorporation into oxidation products(13Lindén D.

Thus, because themitochondrial isoform of GPAT comprises 30–50% of total hepatic GPATactivity, we reasoned that the absence of mtGPAT1 would divert excess hepaticacyl-CoAs toward β-oxidation, even when mice are fed a diet designed topromote obesity and hepatic steatosis. Animals and Diets—Animal protocols were approved by theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee. Generation of mtGPAT1–/– mice was previouslydescribed (7Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Posey-Marcos E. Hiller S. Kluckman K. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell.

Heterozygotes were thenintercrossed to obtain mtGPAT1 wild type, heterozygous, and homozygousknock-out mtGPAT1 mice. Because the male and femalemtGPAT1–/– mice had similar phenotypes, unlessotherwise noted, only data from males are shown. Mice were housed in apathogen-free barrier facility on a 12-h light/dark cycle and had free accessto water and food. Weaned mice were fed Prolab RMH 3000 SP76 chow (26.0% kcalprotein, 14% kcal fat, and 60% kcal carbohydrate). From ages 2 to 6 monthsthey were fed either a high fat/high sucrose (HH) diet that results in markedlipogenesis, triacylglycerol synthesis, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and insulinresistance (12Surwit R.S.

The high sucrose contentof the diet promotes hepatic lipogenesis by increasing insulin secretion andactivation of SREBP1c and by by-passing the rate-limiting step of glycolysis,phosphofructokinase, thereby increasing the production of glycerol 3-phosphate(18Zammit V.A.

Blood Chemistries and Lipids—Mice were fasted for 4–6h before blood collection. Plasma triacylglycerol (triglyceride, Stanbio,Boerne, TX), total cholesterol (cholesterol CII, Wako Diagnostics, Richmond,VA), free fatty acids (NEFA, Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA), glucose (glucoseCII, Wako Diagnostics), and β-hydroxybutyrate (Wako Diagnostics) weredetermined by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Insulin (ultrasensitive ratinsulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Crystal Chemical, Chicago, IL) andleptin (mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Crystal Chemical) weredetermined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For the glucose tolerancetest, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of glucose/g body weight.Plasma was collected at time 0, and at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after theglucose injection. To calculate the insulin resistance index, the areas underthe glucose and insulin curves in the glucose tolerance test were calculatedby multiplying the cumulative mean height of the glucose values (1 mg/ml = 1cm) and the insulin values (1 ng/ml = 1 cm) by time (60 min = 1 cm)(19Yamauchi T.

Liver Triacylglycerol and Lysophosphatidic Content—Liver washomogenized in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Lipids were extractedfrom the homogenate with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v)(20Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For triacylglycerolmeasurements, total lipid extracts were dried under N2 gas,resuspended in isopropyl alcohol, 1% Triton X-100 and analyzedcolorimetrically as described above. To measure lysophosphatidic acid content,∼100 mg of liver was homogenized in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) with 1nm C17-lysophosphatidic acid internal standard. After phaseseparation with distilled H2O, samples were homogenized andcentrifuged, and the methanol/water phase was collected. The supernatant wasapplied to conditioned Waters Oasis MAX extraction cartridges (Waters Corp.,Milford, MA) and after a washing step, lysophosphatidic acid was eluted usingmethanol. Individual lysophosphatidic acid derivatives were measured usingLC/MS/MS analysis. Total lysophosphatidic acid content was expressed as thesum of individual species. Liver Fatty Acyl-CoA Content—For solid-phase extraction ofmedium, long-chain, and very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs(21Deutsch J. Grange E. Rapoport S.I. Purdon A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), ∼100 mg of livertogether with a C17:0 acyl-CoA-ester internal standard was homogenized on icein 50 mm KH2PO4, 50% 2-propanol. An equalvolume of acetonitrile and 1/32 of the final volume of(NH4)2SO4 was added, the emulsion wasvortexed, and the supernatant was separated by centrifugation. The supernatantwas diluted with 100 mm KH2PO4 and purifiedusing Oligonucleotide Purification Cartridges (Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, CA). Following a drying step, fatty acyl-CoA fractions were dissolved inmethanol/H2O (1:1, v/v) and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. A turboion spray source was interfaced with an API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in conjunction with two PerkinElmer 200Series micro pumps and a 200 Series autosampler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).The transition pairs [M-2H]2–:[M-H-80]– (Q1and Q3) were monitored in –MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode foreach fatty acyl-CoA metabolite. Total fatty acyl-CoA content is expressed asthe sum of individual species. Liver Acylcarnitine Content—Liver specimens (∼75 mg)were homogenized in 9 volumes of de-ionized water using a Potter-EverhelmTeflon-glass homogenizer. The mixture was then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the supernatant wassupplemented with 2.5 μl of a mixture of internal standards containing 0.1nmol/μl of d3-acetylcarnitine + 0.02 nmol/μl ofd3-propionylcarnitine + 0.02 nmol/μl ofd3-butyrylcarnitine + 0.02 nmol/μl ofd3-octanoylcarnitine + 0.04 nmol/μl ofd3-palmitoylcarnitine.

Histology—Mouse tissues were fixed in 4% phosphate-bufferedparaformaldehyde (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm), andstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR-based Gene ExpressionAnalysis—RNA was isolated from frozen liver samples using acommercially available kit (Qiagen RNeasy kit, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) incombination with DNase digest treatment. Then 1.5 μg of total RNA wasreverse transcribed (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with random oligo primers. PCRwas performed with a DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (MJ Research, Boston, MA)using the SYBR Green QPCR dye kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Long-chainacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, FAS, SREBP1c, PPARγ, PPARα,glucose-6-phosphatase, and 18 S rRNA were amplified using this system. Productspecificity was verified by running products on an agarose gel. Reactions wereperformed in duplicate and messenger RNA levels (ΔCTvalues) normalized to 18 S rRNA were expressed using the comparative method.18 S rRNA levels showed no statistical difference between groups. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR for peroxisome proliferatoractivatedreceptor-γ coactivator-1α, mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase, CPT1,PEPCK, mtGPAT1, ACO, and SCD1 was performed using an ABI PRISM 7000 SequenceDetection System instrument and TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix usedaccording to the manufacturer's specifications (Applied Biosystems, Inc.,Foster City, CA). Reactions were performed in triplicate and contained 20 ngof cDNA as template, 900 nm forward and reverse primers, and 200nm probe. Target gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNAlevels, which were assayed by multiplexing with the manufacturer's 5′VIC-labeled, primer-limited 18 S endogenous control premix. Primers and5′ FAM-labeled TaqMan probes were purchased as pre-validated assays(ABI) or designed using Primer Express® software and sequences availablein GenBank™. Relative quantification of target genes was calculatedusing the 2–ΔΔCT method(24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Body weights increased 80% on the HH diet and 30% on the LLdiet, as did all measured fat pad weights(Fig. 1). When expressed as apercent of total body weight, isolated gonadal and retroperitoneal fat padswere 2.5-fold greater, and brown adipose tissue was 1.4-fold greater in micefed the HH diet. Adipose tissue histology revealed larger adipocytes fromgonadal tissue in mice fed the HH diet than in mice fed the LL diet(Fig. 2, C andD). Correlating with the development of obesity in micefed the HH diet, the plasma leptin concentrations were 5-fold higher, and,similar to changes previously reported on this diet(12Surwit R.S.

The lack ofdifference between genotypes in percent of lean and fat body mass wasconfirmed by densitometry (PIXImus, Faxitron X-ray Corporation) (data notshown).

Although plasmatriacylglycerol values did not differ between genotypes fed the HH diet,cholesterol concentrations were 20% lower in themtGPAT1–/– mice(Table I). Hepatocytes from mtGPAT1–/– mice fed the HH dietcontained smaller lipid vacuoles than the corresponding wild type controls,and triacylglycerol content in mtGPAT1–/– liver was 60%lower on the HH diet and 40% lower on the LL diet(Fig. 3). As expected,lysophosphatidic acid, the product of mtGPAT1, was 50% lower inmtGPAT1–/– mice(Fig. 4), and the C16:0, C16:1,and C18:1-lysophosphatidic acid species were decreased most strongly inmtGPAT1–/– mice compared with wild type controls onboth diets (data not shown). Thus, in liver frommtGPAT1–/– mice, less acyl-CoA is channeled towardtriacylglycerol synthesis.Fig. 4Liver lysophosphatidic acid is low in mtGPAT1–/–mice.

With the LL diet, no difference in plasmaβ-hydroxybutyrate values was observed between wild type andmtGPAT1–/– mice. With the HH diet, however,β-hydroxybutyrate increased in both genotypes, and was 2-fold higher inthe mtGPAT1–/– mice than in the wild type controls(Table I).

Expression ofPPARα, and its mitochondrial targets CPT1 and long-chain acyl-CoAdehydrogenase did not differ between genotypes on either diet, although therewas a diet-induced increase in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase.

Hepatic Acyl-CoA Content Is Increased inmtGPAT1–/– Mice—If theabsence of mtGPAT1 allows more acyl-CoA to enter the pathways ofβ-oxidation and ketogenesis, one might expect to find lower plasma-freefatty acid and hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations relative to wild type controls.As predicted, plasma-free fatty acid in mtGPAT1–/– micefed the HH diet was about 10% lower (TableI). Unexpectedly, however, the liver content of acyl-CoA inmtGPAT1–/– mice fed either diet was 3-fold higher thanin wild type controls (Fig.5A), and the most prevalent liver acyl-CoA species, 16:0,16:1, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2, were 2.5–6-fold more abundant in themtGPAT1–/– mice(Fig. 5, B andC). This distribution of acyl-CoAs differed from thefatty acid composition of both diets (Fig.4, D and E), but the predominant acyl-CoAspecies were similar to the long-chain fatty acid composition of the diet. Toascertain whether the long-chain acyl-CoAs might originate in the diet or fromnewly synthesized fatty acid, we examined the expression of SREBP-1c and itstarget gene, fatty acid synthase; neither differed between genotypes(Table II). The lack ofincrease in FAS mRNA expression in the mtGPAT1–/– micesuggests that the pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis was notup-regulated. Because medium-chain fatty acids are preferentially oxidized,the accumulation of long-chain acyl-CoAs in mtGPAT1–/–mouse liver reflects the inability of the mitochondria to handle excess fattyacids when mtGPAT1 is not available to divert them toward glycerolipidsynthesis. Interestingly, although 18:1-CoA was the most abundant acyl-CoAidentified on both the HH and LL diets, the expression of stearoyl-CoAdesaturase (SCD), the enzyme that forms oleoyl-CoA, was decreased 50% in theHH fed mtGPAT1–/– mice(Table II), suggesting that anelevation in oleoyl-CoA might down-re"

There is no extracellular matrix in plants, however, that is similar to the collagenous extracellular matrix of mammals. This datum alone is enough to suggest that the protease plays a role in certain functionally relevant intracellular events in addition to its role in pericellular proteolysis. MT1-MMP is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels both as a protease (through activation and inhibition) and as a membrane protein (via trafficking, internalization, and recycling) (13Hernandez-Barrantes S.

These new data, combined together, provided a compelling argument to investigate the trafficking and the intracellular compartmentalization of MT1-MMP in greater detail. These data also argue that there is a role for the protease in intracellular events in addition to its role in pericellular proteolysis. Here, we have discovered compelling evidence that MT1-MMP is trafficked along the tubulin cytoskeleton. A fraction of cellular MT1-MMP accumulates in the centrosomal compartment. In the pericentrosomal compartment, active, functionally potent MT1-MMP degrades an integral centrosomal protein, pericentrin. Pericentrin is essential to the normal functioning of centrosomes in the mitotic spindle formation. MT1-MMP proteolysis of pericentrin causes chromosome instability, which is an early predictor of carcinogenesis. Overall, our results suggest an intracellular function for the membrane-tethered protease and an important role of MT1-MMP in the transition of cells from normalcy to malignancy. Antibodies and Cells—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the catalytic domain and against the hinge region of MT1-MMP were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), Sigma, and Triple Point Biologics (Portland, OR). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies 4b and M8 to the C-terminal and N-terminal parts of pericentrin, respectively, were characterized earlier (24Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 25Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A murine monoclonal antibody against γ-tubulin was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin, RAB-4 and RAB-11, were from BD Biosciences. Human U251 glioma, human MCF7 breast carcinoma, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For MT1-MMP overexpression, MDCK cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-zeo vector (mock cells) and with the plasmid bearing human MT1-MMP to overexpress the protease. Control and MT1-MMP-expressing breast carcinoma MCF7 and glioma U251 cells were obtained earlier (18Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko N.D. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Deryugina E.I. Soroceanu L. Strongin A.Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 580-588PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, U251 cells were also transfected with α1-antitrypsin Portland (PDX). MCF7 cells were also transfected with the catalytically inert MT1-MMP-E240A construct and the internalization-deficient, tailless MT1-MMP-ΔCT construct. MCF7 cells were also transfected with MT1-MMP tagged with a FLAG tag. To avoid interference with the trafficking of MT1-MMP, the FLAG tag was inserted into the hinge region of the protease. Peptide cleavage and the mass spectrometry analysis of the digest were performed as described earlier (27Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All of the buffer solutions used for the preparation of cell lysates and for the isolation of centrosomes were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, aprotinin, E-64) and additionally with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA (1 mm each). MT1-MMP Small Interfering (si)RNA Constructs—The MT1-MMP siRNA target sequence was designed by using the siRNA Designer software (Promega). From six tested sequences, the sequence 5′-GAAGCCUGGCUACAGCAAUAU-3′ repressed the expression of MT1-MMP most efficiently. The 5′-GGUCCAUGCUGCAGAAAAACU-3′ scrambled RNA sequence was used as a control in our studies. Both sequences were cloned into the psiLentGene vector (Promega) and used to transfect U251 cells. Transfected cells were selected and cloned in the medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The level of expression of MT1-MMP in the clones was determined by Western blotting. Isolation of Centrosomes—Centrosomes were isolated from nocodazole-synchronized metaphase U251 cells (25Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Mitotic cells were harvested by mitotic shake off and lysed in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Igepal. Cell lysates were spun at 1500 × g to separate the nuclei and cell fragments. The supernatant fractions were filtered through a nylon mesh (70-μm pore size) and centrifuged on a 20% w/w Ficoll-400 cushion at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The crude centrosomal fraction localized at the Ficoll-water interface was collected and further purified by a 40-80% sucrose gradient centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 2 h. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1:400) for 4 h and then with secondary antibodies (1:200) for 2 h. DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were acquired at a 600× original magnification on a Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a real time, cooled CCD camera SP402-115 (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). MMP-2 Activation Assays—The ability of cellular MT1-MMP to activate proMMP-2 was demonstrated by gelatin zymography. For the analysis of centrosomal MT1-MMP, the isolated centrosomes were diluted 1:100 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Diluted aliquots were co-incubated for 14 h at 37 °C with the purified proMMP-2 (10 ng). The samples were further analyzed by gelatin zymography. Fluorescence-acitvated Cell Sorter Analysis—Cells were detached in trypsin-EDTA, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. The DNA content of cells was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. Metaphase Spreads and Chromosome Count—Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.005% ethidium bromide and then with colcemid (50 μg/ml) for 2.5 h. Cells were next treated with 0.56% KCl for 15 min and then fixed with Carnoy's fixative. The fixed cells were mounted on glass slides. After 72 h, chromosomes were stained with Giemsa stain and examined on a microscope. Digital images of chromosome spreads were analyzed, and chromosomes were counted in >100 spreads of each cell line. The Design of the MT1-MMP Chimeras—Using a QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene), the Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp sequence was inserted immediately prior to the Asp307-Lys308 sequence of MT1-MMP. As a result, the final construct exhibited the Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys sequence of the FLAG tag in the hinge region of MT1-MMP. To construct MT1-MMP-GFP, the Thr300-Ser301 sequence of the hinge domain of MT1-MMP was modified to insert PacI and BlpI restriction sites. The enhanced GFP sequence (Clontech) flanked at both ends with (Gly)5 was then inserted into the PacI/BlpI sites of MT1-MMP to generate the MT1-MMP-GFP chimera. MCF7 and U251 cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1-zeo plasmids bearing MT1-MMP-FLAG and MT1-MMP-GFP, respectively. To avoid the aberrant trafficking of the recombinant constructs, the clones expressing low levels of the chimeras were specifically selected and analyzed further. The Analysis of Tumor Biopsies—Frozen samples of colon adenocarcinomas and invasive mammary grade II-III carcinomas and the matched normal tissues were obtained from the NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network. The homogenized samples were extracted on ice with a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing the protease inhibitors. The extract aliquots (60 μg of each) were analyzed by immunoblotting with the MT1-MMP Ab815 and pericentrin 4b antibodies. Centrosomal MT1-MMP—We examined the subcellular localization of endogenously expressed MT1-MMP in breast carcinoma MCF7 and glioma U251 cells, both of which synthesize MT1-MMP naturally. The level of MT1-MMP in MCF7 cells was, however, very low. U251 cells (Fig. 1a) and MCF7 cells (not shown) demonstrated specific centrosomal MT1-MMP immunoreactivity. The centrosomal association of MT1-MMP was confirmed by using γ- and α-tubulin as centrosomal and mitotic spindle markers, respectively. Excess antigen blocked the centrosomal MT1-MMP immunoreactivity (Fig. 1d). Several individual antibodies to MT1-MMP, which were raised against the hinge region and against the catalytic domain, generated similar MT1-MMP immunostaining. The staining of cells with the isotype control was negative. The centrosomal MT1-MMP immunoreactivity was strongly enhanced in the dividing metaphase cells. Overall, only a fraction of MT1-MMP accumulates in centrosomes, whereas the bulk of cellular MT1-MMP is associated with the plasma membrane and the multiple intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1b). Nocodazole abrogated the association of MT1-MMP with centrosomes in the interphase cells. Nocodazole had no effect on the association of MT1-MMP with centrosomes in the metaphase cells (Fig. 1a). To corroborate further the presence of endogenous MT1-MMP in centrosomes, U251 cells were stably transfected with the siRNA construct (GAAGCCUGGCUACAGCAAUAU). MT1-MMP silencing by siRNA repressed both the expression of cellular MT1-MMP and its centrosomal immunoreactivity (Figs. 1a and 2c). To demonstrate the existence of centrosomal MT1-MMP in transfected cells, we used MT1-MMP chimeras. The use of chimeras allowed us to avoid using MT1-MMP antibodies to confirm the centrosomal localization of the protease. The MT1-MMP-GFP construct was detected via the GFP moiety fluorescence without using antibody staining. The FLAG and the GFP protein sequences were both inserted into the hinge region of MT1-MMP. Following transfection of the cells with the chimeric constructs, MT1-MMP-FLAG and MT1-MMP-GFP were each detected in the centrosomes and co-localized with γ-tubulin in breast carcinoma MCF7 and glioma U251 cells, respectively (Fig. 1c). The accumulation of the MT1-MMP chimeras in the pericentrosomal space and the partial co-localization with the centrosomes is a result of MT1-MMP overexpression. Evidently, excess MT1-MMP is incapable of fitting into the tight centrosomal compartment. To further corroborate the presence of MT1-MMP in the centrosomes, we isolated centrosomes from the synchronized metaphase U251 cells and determined that MT1-MMP co-fractionates with γ-tubulin (Fig. 2a). The concentration of MT1-MMP in the cytoplasm fraction was significantly lower than that in the centrosomes and that is why the cytoplasm fractions did not demonstrate observable amounts of the protease. In contrast, the centrosome samples were free of MMP-2 (a soluble proteinase and a target of MT1-MMP activation) (Fig. 2b) and a plasma membrane marker CD44 (not shown) suggesting the lack of contamination by plasma membrane or transport vesicles. To demonstrate the functional activity of centrosomal MT1-MMP, purified proMMP-2 was co-incubated with the centrosomal samples. Centrosomal MT1-MMP activated proMMP-2 and converted the latent zymogen proenzyme into the active MMP-2 enzyme (Fig. 2b, bottom panel). Hydroxamate inhibitors GM6001 and AG3340, which are potent against MT1-MMP (Ki ≈ 0.5 nm for both inhibitors), blocked MMP-2 activation (not shown). Consistent with the ability of centrosomal MT1-MMP to activate MMP-2, immunoblotting of the purified centrosomes using an MT1-MMP antibody confirmed that centrosomal MT1-MMP is represented by the active enzyme species (Fig. 2b, upper panel). It is not surprising that MT1-MMP traverses and partially accumulates in the pericentrosomal area, because the microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for the nocodazole-sensitive trafficking of MT1-MMP (28Deryugina E.I.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Centrosomes are the microtubule-organizing centers, which play a key role in rapid protein trafficking. Proteins, e.g. caveolin, have been shown to travel from the perinuclear space to the plasma membrane and back using the tubulin cytoskeleton as “railroad tracks” (29Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our experiments have led us to the discovery that the microtubulin cytoskeleton and the centrosomes (the microtubulin cytoskeleton-organizing centers) are essential for the trafficking and the internalization of MT1-MMP and that MT1-MMP is trafficked to the pericentrosomal space most probably in the endosome-like vehicles. An analysis of the cells showed the existence of MT1-MMP-positive vesicles localized alongside the tubulin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2d). RAB-4 and RAB-11 (the markers of late/recycling endosomes and pericentrosomal/recycling endosomes, respectively) (31Peden A.A. Schonteich E. Chun J. Junutula J.R. Scheller R.H. Prekeris R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3530-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) co-localize with MT1-MMP, suggesting its endosomal nature (29Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, e and f). To examine the intracellular trafficking of MT1-MMP, we used a newly developed non-covalent protein delivery Chariot reagent (33Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This non-covalent reagent allows the delivery of proteins, including antibodies, to the inside of the cell compartment. Following the penetration through the cell membrane, the delivered Chariot-antibody complex dissociated inside the cell compartment and liberated the antibody. The liberated, functional antibody then diffused throughout the cell and interacted with the target protein and, thus, allowed the identification of the subcellular compartment that harbors the target protein. The transduction of cells with the antibodies to MT1-MMP, by using a Chariot reagent, as well as the uptake of the MT1-MMP antibody by cells (29Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) also confirmed the microtubular transport of vesicular MT1-MMP to the centrosomes (not shown). The most recent publication (34Schnaeker E.M. Ossig R. Ludwig T. Dreier R. Oberleithner H. Wilhelmi M. Schneider S.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8924-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) confirms the endosomal nature and the microtubular intracellular trafficking of metalloproteinases such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. These results provide indirect support for the data presented in our manuscript. Taken together, our data suggest that the tubulin cytoskeleton is involved in the rapid, vesicular MT1-MMP trafficking. MT1-MMP Targets the Centrosome Proteome—Centrosomes play a central role in the organization of the tubulin cytoskeleton and microtubule nucleation by the γ-tubulin ring complex (24Dictenberg J.B.

Science. 2002; 297: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Centrosomal MT1-MMP is proteolytically potent, and therefore, it may attack the centrosomal targets. Knowing the identity of these targets is of great importance to a more complete understanding of the tumorigenic function of MT1-MMP. In our earlier work, we identified the cleavage preferences of MT1-MMP through the proteolysis of protein substrates and the substrate phage libraries (27Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We determined that the Pro-X-X-↓-XHydrophobic collagen-like cleavage motif is not ideally selective for MT1-MMP because this motif is recognized by several other individual MMPs. Highly selective MT1-MMP substrates lack the characteristic Pro at the P3 position; they contain, instead, an Arg at the P4 position (27Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This P4 Arg is essential for efficient hydrolysis and for selectivity for MT1-MMP (38Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8257-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP appears to recognize cleavage substrates in two distinct modes, using contacts at the P3 and the P1′ to recognize less selective substrates and using contacts at the P4 and the P1′ to recognize highly selective substrates (27Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We used these data to construct a probabilistic cleavage profile of MT1-MMP using a system for the prediction of protease specificity (PoPS) (39, Boyd, S. E., Garcia de la Banda, M., Pike, R. N., Whisstock, G. B., and Rudy, G. B. (2004) Computational Systems Bioinformatics Conference, 2004, Stanford, August 16-19, 2004, pp. 372-381, IEEE, Stanford, CAGoogle Scholar). Using a conventional set of parameters such as charge, polarity, and size, the phage library data for the P4-P1′ positions were used to produce a position specific scoring matrix on a scale of -5.0 to +5.0, as required by PoPS. The matrix contained a strong preference for Arg at P4 and excluded non-hydrophobic residues from the P1′ position. The matrix was also biased against collagen-like cleavage sites by excluding Pro from the P4 position. Lastly, the matrix was weighted in favor of the P4 and P1′ positions. To filter these predictions further, the programs PSIPRED (40Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4411) Google Scholar) and NCOILS (41Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3457) Google Scholar) (integrated in the PoPS system) were used to predict secondary structure and to search for sites that were located in regions of low structure. PoPS was then used to search for the presence of this profile in the human proteome (>25,000 proteins) and in the centrosomal proteome consisting of 114 proteins (42Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). This analysis returned a score for each identified site, based on the weighted matrix. The analysis revealed 111 top scoring hits in the human proteome.

The first step in the conversion from Pr to Pfr is a Z to E isomerization around the C15=C16 double bond of the bilin chromophore. We prepared four synthetic biliverdin (BV) derivatives in which rings C and D are sterically locked by cyclizing with an additional carbon chain. In these chromophores, which are termed 15Za, 15Zs, 15Ea, and 15Es, the C15=C16 double bond is in either the Z or E configuration and the C14–C15 single bond in either the syn or anti conformation. The chromophores were assembled with Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1, which incorporates BV as natural chromophore. All locked BV derivatives bound covalently to the protein and formed adducts with characteristic spectral properties. The 15Za adduct was spectrally similar to the Pr form and the 15Ea adduct similar to the Pfr form of the BV adduct. Thus, the chromophore of Agp1 adopts a C15=C16 Z configuration and a C14–C15 anti conformation in the Pr form and a C15=C16 E configuration and a C14–C15 anti conformation in the Pfr form. Both the 15Zs and the 15Es adducts absorbed only in the blue region of the visible spectra. All chromophore adducts were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and histidine kinase activity to probe for protein conformation. In either case, the 15Za adduct behaved like the Pr and the 15Ea adduct like the Pfr form of Agp1. Replacing the natural chromophore by a locked 15Ea derivative can thus bring phytochrome holoprotein in the Pfr form in darkness. In this way, physiological action of Pfr can be studied in vivo and separated from Pr/Pfr cycling and other light effects.

Phytochromes are photoreceptors of plants, bacteria, and fungi with a bilin chromophore that absorb light in the red and far-red region (1Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The natural chromophore differs between species: land plants use phytochromobilin (2Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-69Crossref Google Scholar) and cyanobacteria use phycocyanobilin (3Hübschmann T. Börner T. Hartmann E. Lamparter T. Eur. J.

The natural chromophore attaches covalently to a cysteine residue by an autocatalytical process, although in vitro adducts with non-covalently bound chromophores may also be spectrally active (5Lamparter T.

Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1, which is used in the present study, belongs to the BV binding phytochromes and attaches its chromophore to Cys-20 (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B.

Upon assembly, the red absorption maximum (λmax) of the chromophore shifts toward a longer wavelength, accompanied by an absorbance increase, to form the red-absorbing Pr. Light absorption of Pr initiates photoconversion into the Pfr form, which results in a further ∼50–70-nm red shift of λmax. Light absorption of Pfr initiates the reverse photoconversion into Pr. For plant phytochromes it has been shown that the first step of the Pr to Pfr photoconversion is a Z to E isomerization of the chromophore around the C15=C16 double bond (9Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which occurs in the picosecond time scale (10Heyne K. Herbst J. Stehlik D. Esteban B.

Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 59-68Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Isomerization is followed by spectral changes in the microsecond and millisecond time scale (12Zhang C.F. Farrens D.L. Bjorling S.C. Song P.S. Kliger D.S. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4569-4580Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During photoconversion, the chromophore also undergoes movements around the exocyclic single bonds. In principle, each single bond can adopt either the syn or anti conformation (13Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer Verlag Wien, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Vibrational spectroscopy gained indirect insight into the conformation of the phytochrome chromophore in the Pr, Pfr, and intermediate states, but the data were not unambiguous and have been interpreted in different ways (14Andel F.I.

Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, it has been proposed that the formation of Pfr is accompanied by a syn/anti rotation around the C14–C15 single bond (14Andel F.I. Murphy J.T. Haas J.A. McDowell M.T. van der Hoef I. Lugtenburg J. Lagarias J.C. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 14: 2667-2676Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More recently, interpretation of Resonance Raman spectra by density functional theory calculations proposed that the C14–C15 single bond is in the anti conformation throughout the entire photocycle and that the C5–C6 single bond rotates from anti to syn upon conversion from Pr to Pfr (17Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Pr/Pfr photocycle is associated with conformational changes of the protein that have been measured by size exclusion chromatography, CD spectroscopy, or limited proteolysis (18Lagarias J.C. Mercurio F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2415-2423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen E. Lapko V.N. Song P.S. Kliger D.S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most bacterial phytochromes are histidine kinases in which kinase activity is modulated by light-induced conformational changes of the protein. Kinase activity is generally stronger in the Pr and weaker in the Pfr form, although other phosphorylation patterns have also been found (4Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D.

Conformational changes of the protein also trigger different specific phosphorylation events of plant phytochromes (23Yeh K.C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To understand better how the structure of the chromophore is linked with the conformation of the protein, we assembled Agrobacterium Agp1 with different synthetic sterically locked chromophores. Synthetic bilin derivatives have been used to test for the role of side chains and to study photoconversion and physiological action of plant phytochromes (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O.

The chromophores used in the present work include four BV derivatives in which the rings C and D are fixed by an additional carbon chain in either the Z-anti, Z-syn, E-anti, or E-syn configuration/conformation. The adducts were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy and protein assays that allow testing for the conformational difference between Pr and Pfr proteins. Synthesis of Bilin Derivatives—Biliverdin was purchased from Frontier Scientific (Carnforth, UK). Synthesis of 18EtBV was performed according to the protocols published for phytochromobilin, phycocyanobilin, and phycocyanobilin derivatives (29Kakiuchi T. Kato H. Jayasundera K.P. Higashi T.

Syntheses of 15Zs and 15Es will be published elsewhere. Bilin stock solutions of ∼1 mm were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Agrobacterium Phytochrome Agp1— An Escherichia coli expression vector termed pAG1 was used for full-length Agp1. pAG1 encodes for the Agp1 protein with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag for Ni2+ affinity purification (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Another vector, pAG1-M15, which encodes for the N-terminal 504 amino acids of Agp1 followed by 6 C-terminal histidine residues, was constructed. This vector was produced by PCR amplification using pAG1 as template followed by ligation. Correct cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expressed protein is termed Agp1-M15. For expression and purification of Agp1 and Agp1-M15 apoproteins, we followed the same procedure as described earlier (35Lamparter T. Esteban B. Hughes J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4720-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown in rich broth medium. Specific protein expression was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell. Soluble proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and by preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The SEC was performed in “basic buffer” (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). After SEC, the apoprotein concentration was ∼15 mg/ml. At this stage, the protein was stored at –80 °C. Assembly and UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded as before (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33786-33792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) at 18 °C. For assembly studies, the apoprotein was diluted with basic buffer to a final concentration of 10 μm, as judged from absorbance at 280 nm, and pipetted into a measuring cuvette. After addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol or 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride as Cys reducing agent, chromophore was added from the Me2SO stock solution to a final concentration of ∼5 μm; the sample was mixed rapidly for 30 s. Immediately after mixing, a spectrum was recorded from 900 to 250 nm; the duration of the scan was ∼1 min. The first spectrum was labeled “1 min.” Further spectra were recorded at least until no spectral changes were obvious. To analyze whether chromophores are covalently bound to the protein, apoprotein and chromophore were mixed as above and incubated overnight in darkness at 18 °C. Thereafter, SDS was added to a final concentration of 1% and the sample was incubated again for 10 min. The mixture was passed over a desalting column as described earlier (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol.

From a comparison of absorption spectra before and after column separation, the amount of covalently bound chromophore can be estimated. In some cases, covalent binding was also tested 5 min after mixing. To analyze non-covalent binding, the apoprotein was incubated with 2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) for 30 min, which blocks the covalent binding site (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because DTNB also reacts with the reducing agent that was present in the apoprotein solution, rather high concentrations of the yellow 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) product, which has a λmax of 412 nm, were formed. Blocked apoprotein was therefore passed over a desalting column to reduce the concentration of this compound. Thereafter, chromophore was added to the protein and a part of the sample was passed again over a desalting column as above. Before recording of UV-visible spectra of the samples, 1% SDS was added to reduce the impact of the protein on the chromophore spectrum. Residual 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) product, which was still present in the sample before the final desalting column separation, slightly increased the absorbance in the blue region. For photoconversion, the samples were irradiated for 5 min with either red light from a 655-nm light emitting diode (50 μmol m–2 s–1) or white light from a light bulb (100 μmol m–2 s–1). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—The Agp1-M15 apoprotein (10 μm) was mixed with excess molar amounts of chromophore (∼15 μm) and incubated for ∼3 h. The BV and 18EtBV adducts were used either unirradiated (Pr) or after saturating red irradiation (Pfr). SEC was carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column run at 500 μl/min with 50 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. The system was calibrated with marker proteins, cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), α-amylase (299 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa) (Sigma). The elution was monitored at 280 nm. Autophosphorylation—The same irradiation and concentration conditions were chosen for autophosphorylation assays. Phosphorylation was performed as described previously (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The incubation time was 5 min. Chromophore Assembly—Six different chromophores were used for assembly with Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1: biliverdin (BV), 18,18′-dihydrobiliverdin (18EtBV), 15Z-anti-18EtBV (15Za), 15Z-syn-18EtBV (15Zs), 15E-anti-18EtBV (15Ea), and 15E-syn-18EtBV (15Es). In the latter four chromophores, the rings C and D are sterically locked by an additional carbon chain in one of four possible stereoisomers: the C15=C16 double bond is in either the Z or E configuration and the single bond in either the syn or anti conformation (see Fig. 1). Biliverdin, the natural chromophore of Agp1 (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and 18EtBV served as controls. Both chromophores form a covalent bond with the apoprotein and produce adducts that show typical red/far-red reversible photoconversion (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33786-33792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phytochrome chromophore assembly can be followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Phytochrome chromophores have two absorption peaks in the blue and red region. Upon incorporation into the chromophore pocket, the red peak shifts to longer wavelengths and the absorbance increases above the level of the blue absorption band. The non-covalent BV adduct of Agp1 has the same λmax as the covalent adduct, but the extinction coefficient of the former is lower (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33786-33792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transition from the non-covalent to the covalent state during BV-Agp1 assembly is characterized by an absorbance increase. In our present study, the absorbance increase was completed between t = 1 min and t = 5 min after mixing chromophore and protein (Fig. 2a). The Pr λmax in the red spectral region was at 701 nm (Table I). Assembly with 18EtBV was also completed between 1 and 5 min, and the Pr adduct had a red λmax at 691 nm (Fig. 2b, Table I). The absorption maximum is blueshifted compared with that of BV-Agp1, because the conjugation system of 18EtBV is shorter than that of BV by the lack of a vinyl group at the C18 position (Fig. 1). With 15Za, a qualitatively similar assembly pattern was observed as with BV and 18EtBV (Fig. 2c). The spectrum of the adduct has a Pr-like form with two major absorption maxima in the red and the blue, and a red λmax appeared at 714 nm (Table I). The absorption bands of this adduct are sharper compared with the Pr form of the BV and 18EtBV adducts. Besides the two major absorption bands in the red and the blue regions, phytochromes have the third absorption band in the red spectral region, which lies at shorter wavelengths than the red absorption maximum and appears as a shoulder in the spectra of the BV and 18EtBV adducts (Fig. 2, a and b). In the 15Za adduct, this band appears as the third peak with a λmax at 649 nm (Table I). Another spectral difference between the three adducts is the absorbance ratio between the major red and blue absorption bands, which increases from BV over 18EtBV to 15Za (Table I).Fig. 2Spectra of free BV (a), 18EtBV (b), 15Za (c), 15Zs (d), 15Ea (e), 15Es (f) in “basic buffer” and chromophore assembly with Agp1. Apoprotein and chromophore were mixed and spectra recorded immediately (t = 1 min) and after incubation times given in the panels. The concentration of apoprotein was ∼10 μm except in the case of 18EtBV (b), where the apoprotein concentration was 6 μm. The chromophore concentration was 8 μm in the case of BV (a), 4 μm in the case of 18EtBV (b), and ∼5 μm in all other cases. Holoprotein spectra were normalized to A280 of 1. The spectra of free chromophores were adjusted accordingly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICharacteristic spectral parameters of Agp1 chromophore adductsChromophore; Pr or Pfrλmax in blue spectral regionλmax of side shoulder/side peak in red spectral regionλmax in red spectral regionAbsorption ratio red maximum/blue maximumnmnmnmBV; Pr3936517012.3BV; Pfr4137027471.418EtBV; Pr3826396913.118EtBV; Pfr406686aThis shoulder is only weakly pronounced; the position could not be determined precisely.7402.015Za38564971410.415Zs43015Ea3966837391.815Es433a This shoulder is only weakly pronounced; the position could not be determined precisely. Open table in a new tab Both 15Zs and 15Es chromophores gave spectrally unusual adducts. Immediately after mixing chromophore and protein, the red absorption band was lost (Fig. 2, d and f). These data imply that the interaction between chromophore and protein is rapid and completed within 1 min. The adducts have only a blue absorption band with a λmax at 430 nm for 15Zs and 433 nm for 15Es. Immediately after mixing protein and 15Ea (Fig. 2e), an absorption band arose with a λmax at 727 nm. This band increased steadily and shifted to 739 nm during prolonged incubation up to ∼140 min. Thereafter, no spectral changes were observed. Because the first spectrum after mixing differs from the spectrum of the free chromophore, the chromophore-protein interaction is also rapid. The slow spectral changes indicate an enduring second reaction, most likely the formation of the covalent bond. The spectrum of the final adduct is similar to the calculated Pfr spectra of the BV and, more particularly, the 18EtBV adducts (Fig. 3, a and b), which have a λmax at 747 and 740 nm, respectively (Table I). The positions of the major red and blue absorption maxima of 18EtBV-Pfr and 15Ea adducts are 1 and 10 nm separate, respectively. The position of the side shoulder is also comparable (3 nm separate), and the red/blue absorbance ratios are similar (Table I). Photoconversion—It has been shown that the first step in the Pr to Pfr photoconversion of plant phytochromes is a Z to E isomerization around the C15=C16 double bond (9Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the spectral similarities, this mechanism is most likely universal for all phytochromes, although direct experimental evidence is lacking. If Agp1 follows the same mechanism, all adducts with locked chromophores should remain stable in the light. Indeed, we did not observe any spectral changes upon irradiation with either red or white light (Fig. 3, c–f) under conditions that induced saturating conversions of the BV and 18EtBV adducts (Fig. 3, a and b). Covalent Attachment and Strength of Chromophore-Protein Interaction—In the next step, we tested whether the chromophores are covalently bound to the protein. After mixing chromophore and protein and overnight incubation, SDS was added to dissociate non-covalent interactions, and the solutions were subjected to desalting columns. In this way, the protein is separated from non-bound chromophore. By comparing normalized UV-visible spectra before and after this separation, the fraction of covalently bound chromophore can be estimated (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33786-33792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It turned out that all chromophores bound quantitatively in a covalent manner to the Agp1 protein (Fig. 4). Additional experiments were performed with BV and 15Ea in which the incubation time (before SDS addition) was only 5 min. Although under these conditions BV was still quantitatively bound (data not shown), the fraction of bound 15Ea was rather low (Fig. 4e, inset). This is in line with the above assumption that the spectral changes observed during 15Ea assembly reflect the formation of the covalent bond. We performed a similar desalting column test after blocking the chromophore binding site by DTNB. In this case, column separation was performed in the native state without SDS. (SDS was added before measuring UV-visible spectra both before and after column separation.) In this way, the strength of the chromophore-protein interaction was tested without the bias of the covalent bond. In all six cases the chromophores remained bound to the protein during the separation (Fig. 5). Thus, all chromophores interact strongly with the protein. Protein Conformation, Size Exclusion Chromatography— The mobility of proteins subjected to SEC is dependent on the shape and quaternary structure of the molecules. In previous analyses with cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1, we found SEC mobility differences between Pr, Pfr, and the apoprotein (35Lamparter T. Esteban B. Hughes J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4720-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pr/Pfr differences were more pronounced for N-terminal fragments of Cph1 that lack the C-terminal histidine kinase domain (20Esteban B. Carrascal M. Abian J. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Otto H. Lamparter T. Borucki B. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We subjected full-length Agp1 apoprotein as well as Pr and Pfr of the BV adduct to SEC but found no significant mobility differences between these samples. We also cloned and purified the N-terminal chromophore module, termed Agp1-M15, which ranges from amino acid 1 to 504 and lacks the C-terminal histidine kinase module. The mobility of apoprotein and the Pr and Pfr forms of the BV adduct of Agp1-M15 on SEC were different, these values corresponding to apparent molecular sizes of 120, 110, and 145 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6a). The results with Pr and Pfr of the 18EtBV adduct were comparable with those of the corresponding BV adduct (Fig. 6b). The 15Za adduct eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa (Fig. 6c), in between the Pr forms of BV-Agp1-M15/18EtBV-Agp1-M15 and the Agp1-M15 apoprotein. The mobilities of the 15Zs and 15Es adducts were identical to that of the apoprotein (Fig. 6, d and f), whereas the mobility of the 15Ea adduct was comparable with that of the Pfr form of the BV and 18EtBV adducts (Fig. 6e). Because the molecular mass of the Agp1-M15 monomer is 55,830 Da, we assume that in all cases the Agp1-M15 protein formed homodimers and that the differences in retention time result from changes of the shape of the molecule. Histidine Kinase—The histidine kinase autophosphorylation activity of Agp1 is light regulated: upon photoconversion from Pr to Pfr, the activity of Agp1 becomes reduced. We measured autophosphorylation of our different Agp1 adducts to test for the impact of the locked chromophores on kinase activity (Fig. 7). In these assays, the activity of BV-Agp1-Pr was set to 100%. The mean activity of the apoprotein was 130%. The slightly stronger activity of the apoprotein as compared with the Pr form of the adduct is in line with previous studies (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although in our present studies the difference was not significant because of variations among different sets of experiments. Upon conversion into Pfr, the mean activity was diminished to 19%, again in accordance with previous studies (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The data of the 18EtBV adduct were comparable with those of the BV adduct: the mean activity of Pr was 110% and that of Pfr 18%. The mean activity of the 15Za adduct was 130% and thus comparable with that of the apoprotein, but differences between 15Za and the Pr forms of the BV and 18EtBV adducts were not significant. The mean activity of the 15Ea adduct was only 20% and thus comparable with the activity of Pfr of BV and 18EtBV adducts of Agp1. It should be mentioned that after 15Ea assembly all holoprotein molecules adopt the Pfr-like state, whereas in the case of the red irradiated BV and 18EtBV adducts, only ∼90% Pfr were obtained. The phosphorylation data of the 15Ea adduct imply that Pfr has indeed a residual phosphorylation activity. Such a conclusion could hardly be drawn from Pfr/Pr mixtures as obtained after red irradiation of natural chromophore adducts. The 15Zs and 15Es adducts revealed extraordinarily high activities, namely 380 and 300%, respectively. These data show that the syn chromophores impose a conformation on the protein that is different from the apoprotein, the Pr, and the Pfr form. In the present study, four different synthetic BV chromophores in which rings C and D are stereochemically locked were tested for their assembly with Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1. Assays using desalting columns combined with UV-visible spectral measurements showed that all chromophores interact strongly with the Agp1 protein and form covalent adducts. A comparison of the absorption spectra (Figs. 2 and 3) gives detailed information about the conformation and configuration of the natural chromophore within the Agp1 chromophore pocket. The 15Za adduct is spectrally most similar to the Pr form of BV-Agp1 or 18EtBV-Agp1 and shows that in Pr the chromophore adopts a C15=C16 Z configuration and C14–C15 anti conformation. In plant phytochromes, the configuration of the double bond, which is stable during protein degradation, is known from NMR studies (9Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An anti conformation of the single bond (as the E configuration of the double bond) has been proposed from vibrational spectroscopy (16Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 16: 15185-15192Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but a C14–C15 syn conformation has also been discussed (37Tokutomi S. Sugimoto T. Mimuro M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 545-552Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The locked chromophore that forms an adduct most similar to Pfr is 15Ea. Therefore, in the Pfr form the chromophore has a C15=C16 E configuration and a C14–C15 anti conformation. The C15=C16 E configuration of plant phytochrome Pfr has also been shown by NMR (9Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on vibrational spectroscopy, a C14–C15 syn conformation has often been proposed for the Pfr form (16Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 16: 15185-15192Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent density functional theory calculations predicted however that the Pfr chromophore is in the C14–C15 anti conformation (17Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), in accordance with our present findings. The assembly process of 15Ea is different from the other chromophores because it takes much longer until the absorbance changes are completed. The early adduct, which is formed just after mixing, has a rather low far-red absorbance and a λmax at 727 nm. The late adduct has a rather high absorbance and a λmax at 739 nm. The Pfr form of non-covalent Cph1-phycocyanobilin and Agp1-BV adducts (blocked or mutated covalent binding site) have a rather low absorbance and a blueshifted λmax as compared with the Pfr form of the covalent adducts (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We thus proposed that the transition from the early to the late Agp1–15Ea adduct reflects the formation of the covalent bond. This was indeed confirmed by the desalting column assay. These results are in line with a previous study in which Agp1 was assembled with (unlocked) 15E BV (38Lamparter T. Michael N. Biochemistry,. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). In this study, a Pfr-like species with rather low absorbance and a blueshifted λmax was obtained after mixing. The 15E chromophore was not covalently bound to the protein; covalent bond formation was induced by dark reversion into 15Z-configured BV. Why is the covalent bond with 15Ea formed rather slowly as compared with the other chromophores? It could be that after the rapid incorporation of 15Ea into the Agp1 chromophore pocket, the distance between the Cys-20 sulfhydryl group and the ring A vinyl side chain of 15Ea is rather large and that the likelihood for covalent bond formation is thereby decreased. In this model, thermal conformational motions of the protein and/or the chromophore would be required for covalent bond formation. For the chromophore, an anti/syn rotation around the C5–C6 single bond is the most likely option. Although in vitro non-covalent phytochrome adducts can undergo photoconversion (5Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), all known phytochrome proteins have a covalently bound chromophore in vivo. The present results show again that covalent bond formation is required for Pfr with optimized spectral properties. What is the structural impact of the locked chromophores on the conformation of the Agp1 protein? To address this question, we have performed autophosphorylation and SEC measurements (Figs. 6 and 7). The phosphorylation activity of Pfr is lower than that of Pr. For SEC experiments, the truncated N-terminal chromophore module Agp1-M15 was used; the mobility of Agp1-M15 adducts is higher in the Pfr than in the Pr form. The apoprotein was also included in both assays, but differences between Pr and the apoprotein were rather small and the assays did not always allow us to distinguish between them. The 15Za adducts behave like Pr of the BV and 18EtBV adducts and the apoprotein. In limited proteolysis studies, which revealed differences between apo-Agp1 and the Pr form, the cleavage pattern of the 15Za adduct was indistinguishable from that of the Pr form (data not shown). For this reason, we assume that the protein conformation of the 15Za adduct is similar to or identical with the Pr form of Agp1. The 15Ea adducts are very similar to the Pfr forms of the BV and 18EtBV adducts in SEC and autophosphorylation experiments. These data show that a Pfr-like form of phytochrome can be produced in darkness. Once the E isomer is present, the protein adopts its conformation in a proper manner. These findings open new ways for molecular phytochrome research. Locked 15Ea chromophores can be offered to plants that are defective in the synthesis of the phytochrome chromophore. The chromophores will most likely be taken up by the plants, as shown for other natural and synthetic chromophores (26Hanzawa H. Shinomura T. Inomata K. Kakiuchi T. Kinoshita H. Wada K. Furuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4725-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Parks B.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lamparter T. Esch H. Cove D. Hughes J. Hartmann E. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 560-568Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If the plant phytochrome assembles with the locked 15Ea chromophore, a Pfr-like form will be produced irrespective of the light conditions. In this way, Pfr effects can be clearly distinguished from other light effects and can be well separated from effects of Pr/Pfr cycling. The results with the 15Zs and 15Es chromophores show that the Agp1 protein is rather tolerant for bilins that have the “wrong” conformation. The absorption spectra of both adducts are more similar to those of heme adducts such as cytochromes than to phytochromes or other biliproteins. A comparable absorption spectrum with a blue absorption band at 421 nm was obtained with the C-terminal bilin binding fragment of cyanobacterial Cph2 (41Wu S.H. Lagarias J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13487-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both locked syn bilins might adopt a helical conformation within the Agp1 chromophore pocket as compared with the stretched conformation of other bilins. Another possibility could be that the conjugation system of tetrapyrrole chromophore is broken by a nucleophilic attack of an amino acid side chain to the C10 position. However, the addition reaction must be reversible, because the red absorption band appeared again upon SDS treatment of the holoprotein, as found during our tests for covalent binding. Both Agp1–15Zs and -15Es adducts behaved like the apoprotein (or Pr) on SEC but revealed an extraordinarily high autophosphorylation activity. Therefore, the protein can adopt at least four different distinguishable forms with respect to its kinase activity, the form of the apoprotein, Pr, Pfr, and that of the 15Zs or 15Es adduct. It is unclear how the C-terminal kinase of bacterial phytochromes is modulated by the N-terminal chromophore module. According to a recent model (20Esteban B. Carrascal M. Abian J. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the N and C termini of the dimeric phytochrome protein might be regarded as ends of a clothes peg (or a modified pair of scissors). In this model, Pr to Pfr photoconversion increases the distance between both C-terminal kinase subunits, because the interaction between both N-terminal chromophore modules is increased upon Pr/Pfr photoconversion. Incorporation of locked syn chromophores into Agp1 might result in an increase of the distance between both chromophore modules and in this way have a positive impact on kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022703549,"The post-translational modification of histones and the incorporation of core histone variants play key roles in governing gene expression. Many eukaryotic genes regulate their expression by limiting the escape of RNA polymerase from promoter-proximal pause sites. Here we report that elongating RNA polymerase II complexes encounter distinct chromatin landscapes that are marked by methylation of lysine residues Lys<sup>4</sup>, Lys<sup>79</sup>, and Lys<sup>36</sup> of histone H3. However, neither histone methylation nor acetylation directly regulates the release of elongation complexes stalled at promoter-proximal pause sites of the c-<i>myc</i> gene. In contrast, transcriptional activation is associated with local displacement of the histone variant H2A.Z within the transcribed region and incorporation of the major histone variant H2A. This result indicates that transcribing RNA polymerase II remodels chromatin in part through coincident displacement of H2A.Z-H2B dimers and incorporation of H2A-H2B dimers. In combination, these results suggest a new model in which the incorporation of H2A.Z into nucleosomes down-regulates transcription; at the same time it may act as a cellular memory for transcriptionally poised gene domains."
https://openalex.org/W2138468556,"Human C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classical, acute phase serum protein synthesized by the liver in response to infection, inflammation, or trauma.

The goal of this study was to elucidate amino acid residues important for the interaction of CRP with human FcγRI (CD64) and FcγRIIa (CD32). Several mutations of the CRP structure were studied based on the published crystal structure of CRP.

This study newly identifies residues Thr173 and Asn186 as important for the binding of CRP to FcγRIIa and FcγRI. Lys114, like Leu176, was implicated in binding to FcγRI, but not FcγRIIa. Single mutations at amino acid positions Lys114, Asp169, Thr173, Tyr175, and Leu176 affected C1q binding to CRP.

This study newly identifies residues Thr173 and Asn186 as important for the binding of CRP to FcγRIIa and FcγRI. Lys114, like Leu176, was implicated in binding to FcγRI, but not FcγRIIa. Single mutations at amino acid positions Lys114, Asp169, Thr173, Tyr175, and Leu176 affected C1q binding to CRP. These results further identify amino acids involved in the binding sites on CRP for FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and C1q and indicate that these sites are overlapping. C-reactive protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, C-reactive protein; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FcγR, Fcγ receptors; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAM, goat anti-mouse IgG; PC, phosphocholine; WT, wild type; PnC, Streptococcus pneumoniae C-polysaccharide; SAP, serum amyloid P component; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. is a member of the ancient pentraxin protein family (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Classical pentraxins share several features including a cyclic arrangement of five (or in a few cases six) identical noncovalently bound subunits, calcium-dependent ligand binding sites in each subunit, and high sequence similarity (2Gewurz H. Zhang X-H. Lint T.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although there is little overall structural resemblance between CRP and immunoglobulin, CRP exhibits multiple functional similarities to antibodies (reviewed in Ref. 3Du Clos T.W. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). These include recognition of ligands, activation of complement via the classical pathway, binding to receptors on phagocytic cells, induction of cytokine synthesis, and enhancement of phagocytosis. These functional similarities are explained by the shared ability of CRP and IgG to interact with complement component C1q and with Fcγ receptors (FcγR) I and II. Conservation of its cyclic pentameric structure, calcium-dependent binding, and phosphocholine (PC) binding capability throughout evolution (4Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) suggest an important biological role for CRP. In vivo experiments have implicated CRP in protection against infection, regulation of systemic and local inflammatory reactions, clearance of autoantigens, and prevention of systemic autoimmune disease (reviewed in Refs. 3Du Clos T.W. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar and 5Volanakis J.E. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). FcγR are well characterized as important to antibody-mediated immunity and when cross-linked by bound IgG antibodies, trigger cellular responses. It has been previously demonstrated that CRP binds to human FcγRI on U-937 cells and transfected COS-7 cells (6Crowell R.E. Du Clos T.W. Montoya G. Heaphy E. Mold C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3445-3451PubMed Google Scholar, 7Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2185-2193PubMed Google Scholar). This finding has recently been confirmed by surface plasmon resonance studies, which established a high affinity interaction between FcγRI and CRP (KD = 0.81 × 10-9 m) (8Bodman-Smith K.B. Melendez A.J. Cambell I. Harrison P.T. Allen J.M. Raynes J.G. Immunology. 2002; 107: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently shown that FcγRII is the second receptor for CRP on human leukocytes and myeloid cells (9Bharadwaj D. Stein M.P. Volzer M. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 10Stein M.P. Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. Mangan E.K. Bharadwaj D. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The binding of CRP to FcγRIIa was recently confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (11Manolov D.E. Rocker C. Hombach V. Nienhaus G.U. Torzewski J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1-6Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the rosetting of CRP opsonized erythrocytes by FcγRIIa-transfected COS-7 cells (12Bodman-Smith K.B. Gregory R.E. Harrison P.T. Raynes J.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interactions between IgG of different subclasses and FcγR have been extensively characterized by using chimeric antibodies, site-directed mutagenesis, and most recently co-crystallization of the human IgG1 Fc fragment with soluble FcγRIII (13Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 14Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Rae J. Briggs J. Xie D. Lai J. Stadlen A. Li B. Fox J.A. Presta L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6591-6604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 15Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 16Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W-H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The selection of the sites to be mutated on CRP was based on the current knowledge regarding the sites in IgG that interact with FcγR, the assumption of functional homology of the similar amino acid motifs in IgG and CRP and the published crystal structure of CRP (17Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because aggregated IgG completely inhibits CRP binding to FcγR on cells, and human IgG1 completely inhibits CRP binding to FcγRI in surface plasmon resonance (8Bodman-Smith K.B. Melendez A.J. Cambell I. Harrison P.T. Allen J.M. Raynes J.G. Immunology. 2002; 107: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is likely that the sites on FcγR that bind IgG and CRP are similar. Based on sequence homology with IgG (18Duncan A.R. Woof J.M. Partridge L.J. Burton D.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we previously identified a specific amino acid position, Leu176, that is important for CRP binding to FcγRI. Mutation of Leu176 to Glu eliminates CRP binding to FcγRI while preserving binding to FcγRIIa. Another group has identified several amino acid residues in CRP important in binding to C1q (19Agrawal A. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5404-5410PubMed Google Scholar, 20Agrawal A. Shrive A.K. Greenhough T.J. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CRP is an important molecule involved in multiple aspects of the response to infection and other inflammatory stimuli. Increasing our understanding of the basic biology of the interaction of CRP with receptors on inflammatory cells will increase our understanding of the inflammatory process and may lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory molecules, warranting investigation of the interaction of CRP at the molecular level. The homogeneity of human CRP in the human population dictates that any investigation into the structure-function relationships of CRP requires alternate methods than studying naturally occurring polymorphisms. This study uses oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to characterize the interaction of CRP with FcγRI and FcγRIIa, and with C1q. The mutant and wild-type (wt) recombinant proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system (21Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 4: 439-446Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and were purified and tested for binding to FcγR and C1q. This strategy enabled us to identify important residues in FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding. The results indicate that the residues, Lys114, Thr173, Leu176, and Asn186 in CRP are important for binding to FcγRI. Thr173 and Asn186 are important for binding to FcγRIIa and mutation of Lys114, Leu176, or Thr173 affected C1q binding as well. Additional amino acid positions Asp169 and Tyr175 were also demonstrated to be important to CRP binding of C1q. Thus, it is evident that the binding sites on CRP for FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and C1q are discrete but must overlap. Mutagenesis—Mutant CRP DNAs were generated with the PCR-mediated QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 1.01-kb BamHI-BglII fragment was subcloned from λHLCRP23 (a generous gift from J. E. Volanakis, University of Alabama at Birmingham), into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4 (pBB4, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and maintained in DH5-α Escherichia coli (Promega, Madison, WI). This construct was used as the CRP template for all PCR, except L176A, which was subcloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Primer sequences were designed based on the published genomic DNA sequence for CRP (22Woo P. Korenberg J.R. Whitehead A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13384-13388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer pairs were designed with single, double, or triple base changes to produce single amino acid changes upon translation. The primers were synthesized either on an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) or by the Center for Genetics in Medicine at the University of New Mexico (Albuquerque, NM). Mutant CRP plasmid DNA was produced by PCR with the CRP containing plasmid as template. To remove the template DNA (which consists of wild-type sequence), PCR products were then subjected to DpnI digestion at 37 °C for 3 h to preferentially eliminate bacterial DNA, i.e. methylated and hemimethylated DNA. Mutant CRP DNAs were used to transform DH5-α E. coli (Promega) for clonal expansion according to the manufacturer's directions. The identities of mutant DNAs were confirmed via direct sequencing (Sequenase V. 2.0, Amersham Biosciences) or by cycle sequencing at the Center for Genetics in Medicine at the University of New Mexico (Albuquerque, NM). Large-scale DNA plasmid preparations were then performed by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recombinant Protein Expression—Mutant CRP DNAs in the baculovirus transfer vector were co-transfected with baculovirus DNA (Bac-N-Blue, Invitrogen) into Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) using the MaxBac Transfection Kit (Invitrogen), except for L176A, which was constructed with the BactoBac Expression System (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells were maintained in supplemented Grace's media (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and additionally supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Ogden, UT). Transfection stocks were plaque purified according to the directions for the Transfection Kit as described (23Summers M.D. Smith G.A. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). Recombinant plaques were selected based on phenotype and β-galactosidase reporter gene expression. Individual recombinant plaques were picked and used to infect additional Sf9 cells plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates. Viral DNA was isolated from the culture supernatants according to the manufacturer's directions and verified by PCR. Viral stocks were re-purified by plaque assay if they contained non-recombinant as well as recombinant virus. Viral stocks comprised of pure, recombinant virus were used to inoculate successively larger cultures of Sf9 cells to create high-titer stocks of recombinant virus. The titers of the viral stocks were determined by plaque assay on Sf9 cells. The high-titer viral stocks were then used to inject Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera) larvae (Entopath, Easton, PA) for large scale mutant protein expression as previously described (7Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2185-2193PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 4: 439-446Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that the proteins were not metabolically labeled. Larvae were processed for CRP recovery as previously described (21Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 4: 439-446Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude larval lysate containing protease inhibitors was applied to a PC-Sepharose affinity chromatography column in the presence of 2 mm calcium. The bound CRP was eluted from the column with a pH 7.4, 10 mm Tris, 75 mm citrate buffer and dialyzed into pH 7.4, 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 (TNC). The purity of the CRP was evaluated with 5-20% polyacrylamide gradient SDS-gel electrophoresis. Reagents and Antibodies—Human CRP was prepared from human pleural fluids as previously described (24Du Clos T.W. Zlock L. Marnell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2167-2171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC-conjugated BSA (15:1 molar ratio) (PC-BSA) and C-polysaccharide (PnC) were prepared in our laboratory as described (25Gearhart P.J. Sigal N.H. Klinman N.R. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 141: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Nakayama S. Mold C. Gewurz H. Du Clos T.W. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2435-2438PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-CRP monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C10 was graciously provided by Dr. Larry Potempa (ImmTech, Evanston, IL) and used as a hybridoma tissue culture supernatant. 8C10 and 9H8 are anti-CRP mAb that recognize denatured or “neo” determinants on CRP (27Ying S-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar) and were kindly provided in purified form by Dr. Henry Gewurz (Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL). C1q was purchased from Sigma. The following antibodies were purchased: HRP-sheep anti-human CRP from The Binding Site (San Diego, CA); sheep anti-human CRP, HRP-goat anti-human C3, and HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG from ICN (Irvine, CA); FITC-goat anti-mouse (GAM) IgG F(ab′)2, affinity purified PE-GAM IgG F(ab′)2, PE-C1KM5 (anti-CD32 mAb), and PE-10.1 (anti-CD64 mAb) from Caltag (Burlingame, CA); mouse mAb to human C1q from Quidel (San Diego, CA); AT10 (an anti-CD32 mAb) and FITC-AT10 from Serotec (Raleigh, NC); FITC-FLI8.26 (an anti-CD32 mAb) from BD Pharmingen (San Diego); anti-CD64 mAb 197 and anti-CD32 mAbs IV.3 and 32.2 from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). FITC-FLI8.26 was pre-absorbed against mock-transfected COS-7 cells for 30 min on ice prior to use, to reduce nonspecific binding. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA)—Immulon 2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandra, VA) were used throughout. The blocking buffer was 0.5% BSA in TNC, the dilution buffer was 0.1% BSA in TNC, and the washing buffer was 0.05% Tween 20 in TNC. The plates were developed with ABTS substrate (1 mg/ml 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and 0.005% H2O2 in McIl-vaine's citric acid-phosphate buffer (pH 4.6) and absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Isolated CRP was quantitated by sandwich ELISA using a human CRP standard curve as described (21Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 4: 439-446Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as well as by BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). WT and mutant CRP were tested for native structure by ELISA as previously described (21Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 4: 439-446Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with 5 μg/ml PC-BSA, blocked, and incubated with 5 μg/ml CRP. The mAb 2C10, which recognizes native determinants, was used to determine PC-BSA binding ability. The mAb 8C10 and 9H8 were used to determine the exposure of denatured determinants, which are not detectable on ligand-bound human CRP (27Ying S-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). All mAb were detected using HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG and ABTS substrate. Human, WT, and mutant CRP were compared for ligand binding using an inhibition assay. ELISA plates were coated with 10 μg/ml PC-BSA or PnC and blocked. CRP (20 ng/ml) was mixed with free PC (10 to 100 μm) and applied to the wells. CRP binding was detected using HRP anti-CRP and ABTS substrate. WT and mutant CRP were compared for C1q binding and complement activation on PC-BSA-coated ELISA wells. Plates were coated with PC-BSA at 5 μg/ml in TNC. The plates were blocked and incubated with CRP samples, diluted from 0.10 to 3.0 μg/ml. The plates were washed and incubated with C1q at 5 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Binding was detected using anti-C1q mAb at 5 μg/ml, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ABTS as substrates. For the complement activation assay normal human serum diluted 1/20 was added in place of C1q, and plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Plates were developed with HRP-rabbit anti-human C3 and substrate. Heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) normal human serum was used as a control. Cell Culture—The COS-7 cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) was used to express either FcγRI or FcγRIIa. The cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). K-562 cells were also obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Receptor Expression—For the cell transfections, the cDNA clone for the R131 allele of human FcγRIIa in the pcDSRα296 transient transfection vector (28Stuart S.G. Trounstine M.L. Vaughn D.J.T. Koch T. Martins C.L. Mellman I. Moore K.W. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1668-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Kevin Moore (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). The plasmid DNA pRc/CMV-FcγRIaI (the IgG high-affinity receptor) was a gift from Dr. Robert P. Kimberly (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). Cells were transfected with the GenePORTER transfection reagent from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (San Diego, CA) as described (9Bharadwaj D. Stein M.P. Volzer M. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) or with the Gene Juice transfection reagent from Novagen (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control cells received transfection reagent only. Flow cytometric assays were performed 66-78 h after transfection. The percentage of transfected cells was determined using either FITC-FLI8.26 or PE-C1KM5 for FcγRII and PE-10.1 or mAb32.2 and PE-GAM IgG F(ab′)2 for FcγRI. CRP Receptor Binding Assay—The CRP receptor binding assay has been described previously (9Bharadwaj D. Stein M.P. Volzer M. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cells in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% azide and 0.1% globulin-free BSA (PAB) were incubated with CRP diluted in PAB for 1 h on ice, then washed twice and incubated with mAb2C10 culture supernatant for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with PAB, and incubated with PE-GAM IgG F(ab′)2 (1 μg/106 cells) or FITC-GAM IgG F(ab′)2 for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed and resuspended in PAB for analysis by flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). The samples were analyzed by forward and side scatter to exclude dead cells, and a minimum of 20,000 cells were collected. The mutants were tested for binding to both FcγRI and FcγRII with transfected COS-7 cells expressing FcγRI or FcγRIIa and K562 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line that expresses FcγRIIa as its only FcγR. K562 cells were used for initial screening of mutants for FcγRIIa binding. Those mutant proteins showing a change from wild type for receptor binding were verified by binding assay to transfected COS-7 cells. Several recombinants showing no change from the wild type were, however, initially tested in both the cell culture and transfection systems, to ensure a predictive value of the cell culture system before transfections with FcγRIIa were performed. Data for receptor binding were collected on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software. Analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). For all measurements of CRP binding, the binding of 2C10 and the anti-mouse secondary antibody were subtracted. Results are presented as the change in geometric mean channel fluorescence (ΔGMCF) relative to secondary antibody controls. Molecular Models—Models shown in Figs. 1 and 7 were produced with the program WebLab ViewerLite (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) using the crystal structure of CRP complexed with PC (Protein Data Bank code 1B09) (15Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and human IgG1 Fc region obtained from co-crystallization with FcγRIII (PDB 1E4K) (15Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V.

The CRP pentamer is shown with residues 175-185 in yellow on one subunit. The residues investigated are indicated in red on a second subunit. On a third subunit the residues directly implicated by mutagenesis experiments to be involved in binding to FcγR are shown in cyan. The proposed C1q binding site is shown on a fourth subunit in green, based on data presented by Agrawal et al. (19Agrawal A. Volanakis J.E. J.

The particular sites to be mutated were chosen on the basis of sequence similarity between CRP and the regions of IgG shown to be important for FcγR binding (30Lund J. Winter G. Jones P.T. Pound J.D.

In IgG two regions were identified as important for IgG binding to FcγRI by comparison between IgG from different species and subclasses (31Woof J.M. Partridge L.J. Jefferis R. Burton D.R. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The first region defined was 234LLGGPS239 for human IgG1 and FLGGPS for IgG4. The importance of this region in binding to FcγRI and FcγRII was confirmed by mutagenesis experiments (13Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv.

Sequence homologies between CRP and serum amyloid P component (SAP) and both of these regions of IgG have been identified (Table I). For the human pentraxins, there is a greater resemblance between CRP and the 234-237-region of IgG, whereas SAP shows greater sequence homology with the 328-333-region of IgG. Interestingly, these regions that are separated by a large stretch of amino acids in IgG are contiguous in CRP and SAP. The location of this proposed binding region on the A face of the CRP pentamer is shown on the bottom of Fig. 1 and a comparison of this region with the homologous regions on human IgG1 is shown on the top of Fig. 1. Both regions show an exposed proline (colored brown). In IgG this proline is proposed to interact with FcγRIII in a proline sandwich with tryptophans 87 and 110 (15Sondermann P. Huber R.

These data suggest thatp115/Uso1p functions to tether vesicles, although the molecular mechanism isstill unclear.Our working model for the mechanism by which p115 tethers COPI vesicles toGolgi membranes has been that it forms a “bridge,” simultaneouslybinding and linking Giantin in COPI vesicle membranes to GM130 on the Golgi(25Sönnichsen B.

This model for acis-golgin tethering complex arose from two important ideas: 1) GM130acts as the Golgi membrane anchor for p115; 2) p115 (anchored by GM130)tethers by simultaneously binding to Giantin in vesicle membranes.The first idea originated from studies into the mitotic disassembly ofmammalian Golgi stacks. GM130 is a mitotically regulated, p115-binding proteinpresent in highly purified Golgi membranes(26Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and this correlates withthe inhibition of p115 binding to Golgi membranes in vivo(33Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and in vitro(34Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Kieckbusch R.H. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17304-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p115localization to the Golgi region of cells is disrupted either bymicroinjection of a GM130 N-terminal peptide (N73), which inhibits p115binding to GM130, or by overexpression of a truncated GM130 that lacks thep115-binding domain (35Seemann J. Jokitalo E.J. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The second idea, that p115 links GM130 to Giantin, arose from theobservation that GM130 and Giantin are asymmetrically distributed betweenGolgi membranes and vesicles. Giantin (but not GM130) is incorporated intoCOPI vesicles, during in vitro budding reactions. p115 stimulatesbinding of these vesicles to Golgi membranes(25Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. CellBiol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Giantin, like GM130, isa major p115-binding protein in Golgi extracts(25Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. CellBiol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, whereasanti-GM130 antibodies (or the peptide N73) prevent p115 binding to Golgimembranes, antibodies against Giantin do not(25Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. CellBiol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In contrast,anti-Giantin antibodies do prevent p115 binding to COPI vesicles, butanti-GM130 antibodies do not. Inhibition of p115 binding to either GM130 onGolgi membranes or Giantin in vesicles is sufficient to abolish the p115effect on tethering (25Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. CellBiol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,36Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). p115 is also necessary tolink Giantin and GM130 during co-immunoprecipitation experiments from Golgiextracts (32Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Shorter J. Waters M.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The functionalimportance of these interactions is apparent because agents that inhibit p115binding to Giantin or to GM130 block tethering and fusion during an invitro assay for Golgi reassembly after mitosis(36Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GM130 andGiantin function in vivo, because microinjected antibodies againstthese proteins inhibit exocytic transport(24Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Hauri H.P. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The most parsimoniousexplanation for these results is that p115 tethers by linking GM130 on onemembrane to Giantin in the other.However, several lines of evidence are inconsistent with theseinterpretations. First, antibodies against p115, GM130, and Giantin causedifferent phenotypes when microinjected. Although antibodies to GM130 orGiantin inhibit transport, they do so at a later stage than antibodies againstp115 (24Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Hauri H.P. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2693-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In otherexperiments, microinjection of anti-Giantin antibodies led to degradation, butthis did not inhibit progression through mitosis or Golgi reassembly in thedaughter cells, at least as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Both ofthese processes are believed to depend on tethering and fusion. Similarly,microinjected anti-GM130 antibodies did not affect mitosis or Golgireassembly. In contrast, microinjected anti-p115 antibodies led to p115degradation and collapse of the Golgi structure(37Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results suggest afunction for p115 that is independent of its interactions with GM130 andGiantin and were presented as arguing against the working model for tetheringby p115.Second, a prediction of the tethering model is that p115 constructs withoutthe GM130 and Giantin-binding sites should neither localize to the Golgiapparatus nor function to tether membranes. Indeed, inhibition of GM130binding to p115 (by microinjection of the N73 peptide or by truncation ofGM130) does block p115 localization to the Golgi apparatus(35Seemann J. Jokitalo E.J. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Confusingly, however, aninitial study showed that p115 truncations lacking the GM130 andGiantin-binding domain do localize to the Golgi region of transfected cells(38Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. CellBiol. 1998; 143: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This finding hasrecently been confirmed and extended by a gene replacement approach showingthat truncated p115, without the binding domain for GM130 or Giantin, issufficient to rescue Golgi morphology and transport in cells where endogenousp115 has been knocked down by RNA interference(23Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It seems, therefore,that experiments in which p115 can no longer bind to GM130 (and Giantin)contradict those in which GM130 can no longer bind to p115. Furthermore, theacidic C-terminal domain of p115 is absent in Drosophila p115 and ismuch shorter in C. elegans(39Kondylis V. Rabouille C. J.Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aconditional lethal CHO cell line that contains no detectable GM130immunoreactivity has been described that has no apparent defect in Golgistructure or transport when grown at the permissive temperature(40Vasile E. Perez T. Nakamura N. Krieger M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 254-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Together these data aredifficult to reconcile with the model that p115 tethers by directly linkingGM130 to Giantin.A resolution for these discrepancies might be related to the function ofRab1, which also acts during ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi transport and bindsdirectly to p115 and golgin tethering proteins(41Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 42Moyer B.D. Allan B.B. Balch W.E.

The yeast homologue,Ypt1p, recruits Uso1p (p115) to membranes and acts in tethering during ER toGolgi and intra-Golgi transport(21Barlowe C. J.

Further experiments showed that the p115 C-terminal domainbound to and competed for the Rab1-binding site on p115. The inhibition ofRab1 binding was relieved by either GM130 or Giantin, both of which binddirectly to p115 and to Rab1. This raises the possibility that binding ofthese golgins serves a regulatory role instead of, or in addition to, astructural role in tethering.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—For anti-Giantin, antibodies (against 1–448and 1125–1695) were raised in rabbits, against hexahistidineHis6-tagged immunogens.

GM130-his was further purified by ion-exchangechromatography (Hi-Trap SP column (pH 7.4)) (Amersham Biosciences) and gelfiltration (Hi-Prep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 column) (Amersham Biosciences). TheGST moiety was removed from GST-p115 using PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences).Rabs were loaded as described previously(52Christoforidis S. Zerial M. Methods. 2000; 20: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rab was washedwith exchange buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl,10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μmDTT, 1 μm guanosine nucleotide) and then incubated (three times,30 min, room temperature) in exchange incubation buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 μm DTT, 1 mm guanosinenucleotide). After washing in stabilization buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1μm DTT, 1 μm guanosine nucleotide) the Rab wasthen incubated (30 min, room temperature) in stabilization incubation buffer(20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 μm DTT, 1 mm guanosinenucleotide).Superose 6 Chromatography—Recombinant p115, his-TA, or his-Twere filtered (0.45 μm) to remove any particulate matter and thengel-filtrated on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences),equilibrated in column buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 200mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), at 0.2 ml/min. Half-mlfractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE withCoomassie staining. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa, Stokes radius 85.0 Å),ferritin (440 kDa, Stokes radius 61.0 Å), catalase (232 kDa, Stokesradius 52.2 Å), and aldolase (158 kDa, Stokes radius 48.1 Å) wererun as standards.Velocity Sedementation—Recombinant p115, his-TA, or his-Twere layered onto a linear glycerol gradient (10–30% (w/v)) in gradientbuffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mm KCl, 1mm DTT). Thyroglobulin (20.0 S), catalase (11.4 S), and bovineserum albumin (4.6 S) were run as standards. The gradients were centrifugedfor 5 h in an SW55 rotor (Beckman Coulter), at 4 °C and then fractionatedfrom the top into ∼0.4-ml fractions. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGEwith Coomassie staining.Golgi Membrane Extracts—Rat liver Golgi was purified fromrat liver as described (53Hui N. Nakamura N. Slusarewicz P. Warren G. Celis J. Cell Biology: A LaboratoryHandbook. Academic Press, New York1998: 46-55Google Scholar)and then extracted at 0.5 mg/ml with extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES(pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% TritonX-100, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μm DTT, EDTA freeprotease inhibitor (PI) mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min on ice andclarified by centrifugation (20 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C). Forcarbonate stripping, rat liver Golgi (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated in carbonatebuffer (0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) and PI) for 1 h on ice.Stripped rat liver Golgi was concentrated (30 min, 11,700 × g,4 °C, on a swing out microcentrifuge) onto a 2 μl sucrose cushion (2m), resuspended (0.2 mg/ml) in sucrose buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200mm sucrose, 1 μm DTT, PI), reconcentrated, and thenextracted as above.In Vitro Transcription/Translation—Twenty-five μlreactions were performed using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system(Promega) using 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μl of[35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml) per reaction. Two μl of eachreaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The remainder was frozen in liquid nitrogenand stored at -80 °C until use.Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase(GST)-Rab1, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, was incubated withputative binding proteins in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4),100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml soybeantrypsin inhibitor, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm DTT, PI supplementedwith guanosine nucleotide (1 mm)) for 1 h, rotating at 4 °C.Beads were washed twice in the same buffer and then once in nucleotide-freebinding buffer. Proteins were eluted (three incubations, 10 min, rotating,room temperature) in elution buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100mm KCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmDTT, 5 mm GDP), pooled, concentrated by trichloroacetic acidprecipitation, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.GST-p115CT binding assays were performed as for Rab1 except: 10 μg ofGST-p115CT (p115 886–961) was used. Beads were washed three times in thesame buffer then resuspended in 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris(pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 5% DTT, 0.01% bromphenol blue)Quantification—Blots were quantified by scanning (EpsonExpression 1680 scanner) or by directly measuring the ECL signal (Kodak ImageStation 440CF). Signal intensity was compared with at least three standardsamples of the same protein, loaded as a series of 2-fold dilutions, anddetected on the same immunoblot. Signals were only quantified if theirmeasured intensity lay within a range encompassed by the standards and overwhich there was a linear relationship between the amount of material loadedand signal intensity.RESULTSRab1 Binds to the Coiled-coil Tail Region of p115—TheRab1-binding site on p115 had not previously been mapped. A set of truncationscorresponding to structural and functional domains in p115 was thereforeconstructed and tested for binding to GST-Rab1(Fig. 1A). p115 isthought to be a parallel homodimer of two polypeptide chains. Each is composedof an N-terminal globular head (H); a rod-like tail (T)containing four regions of predicted coiled-coil structure (CC1, CC2, CC3,CC4), and a short (28 amino acid), C-terminal acidic domain (A)(Fig. 1A)(17Sapperstein S.K.

The IL-21 gene is adjacent to the IL-2 gene, and like IL-2, IL-21 is strongly induced at the transcriptional level after T cell activation. Interestingly, however, in contrast to the IL-2 gene, a calcium ionophore alone was sufficient to induce IL-21 gene expression in preactivated T cells. Two DNase I hypersensitivity sites were found in the IL-21 gene, corresponding to nucleotide sequences that are conserved in humans and mice. One site is located at the IL-21 promoter region and conferred T cell receptor-mediated IL-21 gene transcription. TCR-induced IL-21 gene expression was inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506. Correspondingly, the IL-21 5′-regulatory region contains three NFAT binding sites, and induction of IL-21 promoter activity was impaired when these sites were mutated or following treatment with cyclosporin A. Thus, our studies reveal that in contrast to IL-2, a calcium signal alone is sufficient to mediate induction of the IL-21 in preactivated T lymphocytes and that this induction appears to result from specific NFAT binding.

To better understand the basis for regulation of this critical cytokine, we now have studied the regulatory elements controlling expression of this gene. Mice and Cell Culture—C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. NFATc2 knock-out mice were a gift from L.H. Glimcher (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA). Mice used in these experiments were 8-10 weeks of age. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health Animal Use and Care Committee and followed the NIH guidelines “Using Animals in Intramural Research.” Single-cell suspensions from the spleen were prepared and cultured at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the spleens by positive selection with MACS purification (Miltenyi Biotech). These isolated CD4+ T cells were activated by incubating in the presence of 2 μg/ml of anti-CD3 and 2 μg/ml of anti-CD28 mAbs (Pharmingen) for 2 days and expanded in the presence of 100 units/ml of IL-2 for another day. 5′-RACE—5′-RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Total cellular RNA isolated from activated CD4+ T cells was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and the 5′-“cap” of mRNA was removed using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. An RNA oligonucleotide was then ligated to the full-length, decapped mRNAs, and reverse transcription was performed using oligo(dT) as a primer. The resultant cDNAs were PCR-amplified using the GeneRacer 5′-primer and a primer specific for the IL-21 gene (5′-TTCAGCTGTTCAACAATGTC-3′). The GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and the same IL-21 primer were then used in a second, nested PCR. Quantitative Real Time PCR—CD4+ splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 2 days, and these activated cells were washed and then cultured in the presence of IL-2 for 1 day. Total RNA was isolated from these preactivated CD4 T cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were made using the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a 7900H sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers and TaqMan probes were as follows: murine IL-21, 5′-AAGATTCCTGAGGATCCGAGAAG-3′, 5′-GCATTCGTGAGCGTCTATAGTGTC-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-TTCCCGAGGACTGAGGAGACGCC-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′; murine IL-2, 5′-CCTGAGCAGGATGGAGAATTACA-3′, 5′-TCCAGAACATGCCGCAGAG-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-CCCAAGCAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAG-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′; murine IL-4, 5′-ACAGGAGAAGGGACGCCAT-3′,5′-GAAGCCCTACAGACGAGCTCA-3′, 5′-(6-FAM)-TCCTCACAGCAACGAAGAACACCACA-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′; murine 18 S rRNA, 5′-CCTTTAACGAGGATCCATTGGA-3′,5′-ACGAGCTTTTTAACTGCAGCAA-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-CGCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATAGCGTATATT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′. DNase I Hypersensitivity Assay—DNase I hypersensitivity assays were performed using isolated nuclei from preactivated T cells as previously described (12Kim H.P. Kelly J. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with NsiI (-6538 and +7125) and analyzed on Southern blots (Nytran Plus, Schleicher & Schuell) using random primer-labeled probes (from +6526 to +7130) and Quickhyb solution (Stratagene). Plasmid Constructs—To generate the wild type (WT) mouse IL-21 promoter luciferase reporter construct, we subcloned the Il21 gene -1605 to +75 region 5′ to the luciferase gene between the BgiII and MluI sites in the polylinker of the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of the Il21 NFAT sites in this plasmid was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Three mutagenic primers, 5′-CCATGTGTCTCTTTTTAAGGTCTAAGATGCAGATG-3′, 5′-CGTACACCTAGCCAACTTAAAAGAAAAACGAGTTAC-3′, and 5′-CACTATACAAAGATTTAAGGGCTGCAATGGGAGGG-3′ were used to introduce the indicated underlined 3-bp changes into the NFAT sites at -203, -121, and -76, respectively. Fragments spanning HS2 (+1139 to +1683) were generated by PCR and cloned in both orientations 5′ and 3′ to the SV40 promoter in pGL3-Promoter. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transient transfections of normal mouse T cells were performed by electroporation, as described previously (13Kim H.P. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—CD4+ splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 2 days, and these activated cells were washed and then cultured in the presence of IL-2 for 1 day. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (14Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) from these untreated preactivated CD4+ cells or cells that had been treated with anti-CD3 mAb for 1 h at 37 °C. EMSAs were performed as described previously (13Kim H.P. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using 5% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing glycerol and 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For supershifting assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min with NFATc1 or NFATc2 mouse mAbs (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO). Oligonucleotide sequences from the IL-21 promoter and IL-2 distal NFAT binding sites used as probes are shown in Fig. 5A. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described (12Kim H.P. Kelly J. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Kim H.P. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CD4+ splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 2 days, and these activated cells were washed and then cultured in the presence of IL-2 for 1 day. These preactivated CD4+ cells were either left unstimulated or restimulated with 2 μg/ml of anti-CD3 mAb for 1 h, followed by cross-linking with formaldehyde. Formaldehyde-treated nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for NFATc2. After treatment with proteinase K to remove the protein and reversal of cross-links, the amounts of selected DNA sequences were assessed by real time PCR. The sequences of the primers and TaqMan probe for IL-21 promoter were as follows: 5′-GGCACATTTTGTGGACTCTATCC-3′,5′-CCATTGCAGCCTGGAAATCT-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-AGCCAATGGAAAAGAAAAACGAGTTACTCACACT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′. The sequences of the primers and TaqMan probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were as follows: 5′-TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′, 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-TGCATCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′. To investigate the regulation of IL-21 expression, we first analyzed IL-21 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells. CD4+ splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 2 days, washed, and then cultured in the presence of IL-2 for 1 day. These preactivated CD4+ cells were then either left unstimulated or restimulated with various stimuli. IL-21 mRNA was increased ∼10-fold by anti-CD3 but not by anti-CD28 (Fig. 1A). Co-stimulation with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 showed similar effects to those seen with anti-CD3 alone (Fig. 1A). The induction of IL-21 mRNA was primarily at the level of transcription because the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, markedly diminished the inducibility (Fig. 1A). This induction did not require de novo protein synthesis, because the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, did not diminish and in fact increased IL-21 mRNA levels in response to anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. 1A). Cycloheximide is a protein synthesis inhibitor that superinduces the expression of many genes by preventing the degradation of otherwise labile mRNAs (15Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3321-3330PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-21 mRNA levels were increased by ionomycin alone, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had little effect by itself and did not augment the effect of ionomycin (Fig. 1A). This is in marked contrast to the regulation of the IL-2 gene in which both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin are required for its expression (16June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the importance of a calcium signal, rapamycin had no effect, but cyclosporin A and FK506 markedly inhibited induction of IL-21 mRNA in response to ionomycin or anti-CD3+anti-CD28 (Fig. 1A); this indicates a role for the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in IL-21 mRNA transcription. To identify the regions of the IL-21 gene that mediate its induction, we performed DNase I hypersensitivity assays with preactivated CD4+ T cells that were either unstimulated or restimulated for 1 h with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28. Nuclei were then isolated and subjected to DNase I hypersensitivity assays. DNA was extracted, digested with NsiI, which cleaves the 6.5-kb 5′ and 7.1-kb 3′ to the transcription start site, and Southern blotted with the indicated probe. Two principal hypersensitive sites, HS1 (upstream of the previously reported 5′-end of the IL-21 cDNA) and HS2 (in intron 2), were identified (Fig. 2). Both HS1 and HS2 were detected in the unstimulated cells, and the intensities of these sites were modestly increased in restimulated cells. The nucleotide sequences of both the HS1 (Fig. 3A) and HS2 (Fig. 3B) regions are well conserved in humans and mice, consistent with the presence of important regulatory regions in these areas.Fig. 3Sequence of human and murine HS1 and HS2. Sequence comparison of the HS1 (A) and HS2 (B) regions of human and murine IL-21 genes. Boxed are potential binding sites for NFAT proteins in the HS1 region, and for AP1 and IRF1 proteins in the HS2 region. In A, the transcription start site of the murine IL-21 gene is underlined and indicated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcriptional start site in the IL-21 gene was identified using 5′-RACE and mRNA from activated CD4+ T cells (data not shown). Using an IL-21-specific primer (see “Materials and Methods”), we identified a single product containing 69 bases of 5′-untranslated mRNA; the 5′-nucleotide was assigned position +1 as indicated in Fig. 3A. The full-length mRNA is thus 16 nucleotides longer than an mRNA previously reported (NCBI accession number NM_021782). These data confirm that there is not a cryptic upstream exon and that HS1 is located in the proximal 5′-regulatory region. To test whether HS1 and HS2 correspond to TCR response elements, each HS region was separately subcloned into a luciferase reporter construct. When the HS1 region was used, potent inducibility was observed in response to ionomycin as well as anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. 4A), and this inducibility was abrogated when the transfected cells were treated with cyclosporin A 30 min before stimulation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when the construct containing the HS2 region was cloned in either orientation and either 5′ or 3′ to the IL-21 or SV40 promoters, only minimal TCR inducibility was found in transfection experiments in normal mouse splenocytes (Fig. 4B). Thus, HS1 appeared to be more important for IL-21 gene regulation, and we have focused on HS1 in this study. Analysis of HS1 revealed several potential consensus sequences for factor binding, including three consensus NFAT binding sites that are conserved in humans and mice (Fig. 3A). We investigated factor binding to 32P-labeled probes spanning these sites using EMSAs and nuclear extracts from unstimulated or anti-CD3-stimulated mouse T cells. When probes spanning the NFAT sites at either -203 or -76 (Fig. 5A) were assayed, only very faint complexes were detected with extracts from either unstimulated or stimulated cells (Fig. 5B). However, the probe spanning the site at -121 (Fig. 5A) generated a complex with extracts from unstimulated cells (Fig. 5, B, lane 3 and C, lane 1), which was modestly increased when cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (Fig. 5, B, lane 4 and C, lane 2). An antibody to NFATc2 (also known as NFAT1 and NFATp) supershifted the complex to generate a slower mobility complex, with this effect being more evident in activated cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, an antibody to NFATc1 (also known as NFAT2 and NFATc) had no effect (lanes 5 and 6). The mutation of the NFAT site eliminated the formation of complexes from resting (lane 7) and stimulated (lane 8) cells. As a control, we also investigated factor binding to a probe spanning the distal NFAT binding sites in the IL-2 gene. When the IL-2 NFAT probe was used, the formation of complexes was weaker than with the IL-21 probe. Some binding activity was detected in unstimulated cells (lane 9), which increased following stimulation with anti-CD3 (lane 10). The complex formed with the IL-2 NFAT probe was evaluated for the presence of NFATc1 and NFATc2 using antibodies to each protein. An antibody to NFATc2 supershifted the complex to generate a slower mobility complex (lanes 11 and 12), whereas the anti-NFATc1 antibody almost completely blocked the formation of complexes (lanes 13 and 14). Thus, both NFATc2 and NFATc1 proteins can bind to the IL-2 NFAT probe. In contrast, the IL-21 NFAT probe appeared to preferentially bind NFATc2. The fact that much of the complex formed with the IL-21 probe was not supershifted suggested that additional protein(s) contribute to the binding activity seen in unstimulated cells. We next sought to confirm NFATc2 binding to the IL-21 promoter in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Despite in vitro binding activity in both resting and stimulated cells, we found a marked increase in NFATc2 binding in vivo after cellular stimulation with anti-CD3 (Fig. 5D). No binding of NFATc2 was observed to a control exon region of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, indicating the specificity of the binding to IL-21 promoter. Thus, NFATc2 binding in vivo corresponded to the induction of Il21 gene expression. To determine whether NFATc2 was uniquely essential for IL-21 induction, we next evaluated the ability of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to induce IL-21 mRNA expression in NFATc2-deficient mice. Interestingly, IL-21 mRNA induction was not diminished in these mice (Fig. 6). This is analogous to the normal induction of IL-2 mRNA and increased induction of IL-4 mRNA in these animals as well (Fig. 6) (17Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. Charles de la Brousse F. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The normal induction despite the absence of NFATc2 suggests the compensation by and action of other NFAT family proteins in vivo, as has been suggested for the IL-2 and IL-4 genes as well (17Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. Charles de la Brousse F. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Despite the normal induction of IL-21 mRNA in NFATc2 knock-out mice, our data overall suggested that the NFAT binding sites were critical. Specifically, the inhibition by cyclosporin A of the induction of IL-21 mRNA (Fig. 1) and promoter activity (Fig. 4) by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 was consistent with a critical role for the NFAT sites in the HS1 region. To further define their role, we mutated each NFAT site individually and in combination and assayed the TCR responsiveness of each mutant construct in normal mouse T lymphocytes. Whereas the wild type construct showed ∼15-fold TCR inducibility, selective mutation of the NFAT sites at -203 (mutant m1) and -76 (mutant m3) markedly decreased TCR inducibility (Fig. 7), even though these sites individually show little binding by EMSA (Fig. 5B). Selective mutation of the site at -121 most potently bound factors in vitro (mutant m2) or double mutation of any two of the sites (mutants m4, m5, and m6) even more potently decreased TCR inducibility, whereas simultaneous mutation of all three NFAT sites (mutant m7) abrogated TCR inducibility (Fig. 7). These results suggest that all of the NFAT sites are required for maximal TCR inducibility and are consistent with at least some factor binding to all three sites in vivo; this binding may be cooperative. By itself, the -121 NFAT site nevertheless appears to be the most important. IL-21 is a type I cytokine that is made by activated T cells and exerts actions on B cells, T cells, and NK cells. Its receptor is most like the IL-2 receptor β chain and the gene encoding IL-21 is adjacent to the Il2 gene. Similar induction patterns might have suggested similar regulation for these two genes, and our mutagenesis data indicate that the Il21 gene, analogous to the Il2 gene, is dependent on NFAT binding sites. NFAT proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and play a pivotal role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes critical for the immune response (18Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N.

NFAT was first identified in T cells as a rapidly inducible nuclear factor binding to the distal antigen receptor response element of the human IL-2 promoter (21Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Subsequently, studies from several laboratories indicated that the promoter/enhancer regions of different activation genes possessed binding sites for NFAT family proteins, including the cytokines IL-2 (22Shaw J.

Listman J. et al.J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4154-4159PubMed Google Scholar). Based on comparison of these sequences, the NFAT binding site consensus is (A/T)GGAAA(A/N)(A/T/C)N (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, a primary target for inhibition by cyclosporin A and FK506 (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Calcineurin controls the translocation of NFAT proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of activated cells by interacting with an N-terminal regulatory domain conserved in the NFAT family. In this study, we have described a TCR response element in the 5′-regulatory region of the Il21 gene. Several results support the hypothesis that NFAT is required for TCR-mediated transactivation of the Il21 gene. First, the critical IL-21 promoter region contains three NFAT binding sites, the nucleotide sequence of the IL-21 promoter is evolutionarily conserved, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the in vivo binding activity of NFATc2 to this region. Second, site-specific mutagenesis of these NFAT sites significantly diminished IL-21 promoter activity. Third, CsA, an inhibitor of calcineurin that potently inhibits nuclear translocation of NFAT and NFAT-dependent transcription (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 40Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 41Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), markedly decreased TCR-mediated transactivation of IL-21 promoter and IL-21 gene expression, implying that calcineurin regulates IL-21 gene transcription. Transient transfection experiments using luciferase reporter constructs showed that CsA could almost completely block anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-mediated IL-21 promoter activity, and this specific role of the NFAT binding sites was confirmed using a construct in which all three NFAT sites were mutated. The fact that NFATc2-/- mice had normal IL-21 gene induction is consistent with the potential utilization of more than one NFAT-binding protein in vivo. Recently, Mehta et al. (42Mehta D.S. Wurster A.L. Weinmann A.S. Grusby M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2016-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that NFATc2 and T-bet contribute to Th2-specific regulation of IL-21 expression. They studied IL-21 expression in EL4 and D10 cells, and like us, they found that three NFAT binding sites were important for TCR-stimulated IL-21 promoter activity. We demonstrate in primary T cells the importance of this region and moreover that the chromatin structure in the promoter region has an open conformation. However, our data differ from those of Mehta et al. (42Mehta D.S. Wurster A.L. Weinmann A.S. Grusby M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2016-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in that we find that IL-21 expression remains strong in NFATc2 knock-out T cells. The basis for this dissimilarity is unclear. Despite the evidence in support of NFAT recruitment to the Il2 and Il4 genes (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 43Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as well as the Il21 gene, the transcription of the Il21 gene in preactivated T cells is strikingly different from the genes encoding IL-2 and IL-4 in that it can be mediated by calcium ionophore alone without requiring protein synthesis or protein kinase C activation. Thus, our studies demonstrate that IL-21 induction by antigen in primary T cells is primarily dependent on a calcium signal and contrasts in this regard to these other activation-dependent cytokines that require both calcium and protein kinase C signals (e.g. IL-2 and IL-4) or to another activation-dependent protein whose expression only requires a protein kinase C signal (e.g. IL-2 receptor α chain). The lack of a requirement for a protein kinase C signal for IL-21 expression suggests that AP1 family proteins are not important or are much less important for Il21 gene induction than for induction of the Il2 gene. It is interesting to speculate that the constitutive DNA binding activity seen even with untreated preactivated cell extracts (Fig. 5B) could contribute to the ability of ionomycin alone to activate the gene. In other words, the constitutive DNA binding activity in vitro may correspond to a factor that can cooperate with NFAT proteins in vivo, suggesting that the Il21 gene is poised to receive and respond to a calcium signal as a major component of its regulation. The characterization of such a factor is an interesting area for future investigation. In summary, we have demonstrated properties of regulation of the Il21 gene and have characterized a critical region containing NFAT binding sites that corresponds to a hypersensitive site, clarifying the molecular basis for the rapid induction of Il21 gene expression in T cells. We thank Drs. Keji Zhao, Rosanne Spolski, Zheng Wu, and Jian-Xin Lin for valuable discussions and/or critical comments."

ONOO– treatment (2 mm) ofcells containing no PUFA (defined medium with 18:0/stearic acid) produced 6.5M1dG/107 deoxynucleotides and no detectable lipidperoxidation products, including MDA, as compared with 3.8M1dG/107 deoxynucleotides and 0.07 μg/ml lipidperoxidation products with control cells grown in a mixture of fatty acids(0.5% PUFA) mimicking Luria-Bertani medium. In cells grown with linoleic acid(18:2), the level of PUFA rose to 54% and the level of MDA rose to 0.14μg/ml, whereas M1dG fell to 1.4/107 deoxynucleotides.Parallel studies with γ-radiation revealed levels of MDA similar tothose produced by ONOO– but no detectable M1dG.These results are consistent with base propenals as the major source ofM1dG in this model cell system. There is now substantial evidence linking reactive oxygen and nitrogenspecies to aging and chronic diseases(1Klaunig J.E. Kamendulis L.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) as illustrated by theepidemiological evidence associating chronic inflammation with increasedcancer risk(2Ohshima H.

Theoxidants also react with lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins to generateelectrophilic species capable of reacting with DNA bases to form adducts. Thisis illustrated by the reaction of a metabolite of hydroxynonenal, a product ofpolyunsaturated fatty acid(PUFA) 1The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; GC, gaschromatography; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; MDA,malondialdehyde; M1dG,pyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10-(3H)-one-2′-deoxyribose; MS, massspectrometry; nt, deoxynucleotide; ONOO–, peroxynitrite; TBA,thiobarbituric acid; Gy, gray; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; GC, gaschromatography; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; MDA,malondialdehyde; M1dG,pyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10-(3H)-one-2′-deoxyribose; MS, massspectrometry; nt, deoxynucleotide; ONOO–, peroxynitrite; TBA,thiobarbituric acid; Gy, gray; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. peroxidation,with dG, dA, and dC to form etheno adducts(6Chung F-L.

A similar argument hasbeen made for the PUFA peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), whichreacts in vitro with dG to form M1dG, the exocyclicpyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10-(3H)-one adduct(Fig. 1). M1dG ispresent in normal human tissues at levels of 10–100adducts/108 deoxynucleotides (nt)(7Kadlubar F.F. Anderson K.E. Haussermann S. Lang N.P. Barone G.W. Thompson P.A. MacLeod S.L. Chou M.W.

Recent studies suggest that deoxyribose oxidation may be an alternative tolipid peroxidation as a source of DNA-reactive electrophiles. Oxidation ofdeoxyribose in DNA produces a variety of oxidized abasic sites and strandbreaks with different sugar residues, many of which are electrophilic and thuscapable of reacting with local nucleophiles to form adducts. For example, theβ-elimination product of the 5′-(2-phosphoryl-1,4-dioxobutane)residue arising from 5′-oxidation of deoxyribose(trans-1,4-dioxo-2-butene) reacts with dG, dA, and dC to form stablebicyclic adducts (11Gingipalli L. Dedon P.C. J.Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2664-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,12Byrns M.C. Predecki D.P. Peterson L.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, wedemonstrated that the base propenal products of deoxyribose4′-oxidation, structural analogs of the enol tautomer of MDA(Fig. 1), also react with DNAto form M1dG (13Dedon P.C. Plastaras J.P. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11113-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar),although with significantly greater efficiency than MDA(13Dedon P.C. Plastaras J.P. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This may explain the30–60-fold greater mutagenicity of base propenals than MDA(14Plastaras J.P. Riggins J.N. Otteneder M. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We now report the results of studies aimed at defining the source ofM1dG under biologically relevant conditions. We first performedstudies with purified DNA and oxidants known to cause 4′-oxidation ofdeoxyribose to define the relationship between generation of base propenalsand M1dG formation. These observations were then assessed inEscherichia coli cells in which the membrane content of PUFA wasvaried by growth in defined media. This model system provided an opportunityto compare MDA and M1dG formation caused by exposure of the cellsto different oxidants. Materials—Adenine propenal was purchased from SalfordUltrafine Chemicals (Manchester, UK). Thymine propenal and cytosine propenalwere synthesized according to a published method(15Johnson F. Pillai K.M. Grollman A.P. Tseng L. Takeshita M. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Bleomycin and calfthymus DNA were purchased from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membrane was obtainedfrom Schleicher and Schuell. M1dG monoclonal antibody and a lipidperoxidation kit were purchased from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI).Peroxynitrite (ONOO–) was synthesized by ozonolysis of sodiumazide as described by Pryor et al.(47Pryor W.A. Stanley J.P. Blair E. Lipids. 1976; 11: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Instrumental Analyses—All HPLC analyses were performed on aHewlett-Packard model 1100 HPLC system equipped with a Vydac C18 reversedphase column (250 × 4.6 mm) and a 1040A diode array detector. Sampleswere resolved with the following gradient of acetonitrile in 10 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 6.9): 0–18 min, 1–30%; 18–22 min,30–50%; 22–30 min, 50–100%; 30–40 min, 100%. Gaschromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of fatty acid methylesters were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II Plus gaschromatograph equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 5872 mass selective detector.The operating parameters were as follows: 250 °C inlet (splitless mode);ionizing voltage, 70 eV; HP-5MS (cross-linked 5% phenylmethyl silicone)capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm film thickness);oven temperature ramp of 10 °C/min from 100 to 310 °C. Reaction of DNA with Oxidizing Agents—Calf thymus DNA wasdissolved in Chelex-treated 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4; see Ref. 16Collins C. Awada M.M. Zhou X. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), andaliquots were stored at –80 °C. For γ-irradiation, DNA wasexposed to 0–200 Gy in a 60Co source at 2 Gy/min. ForFe2+/EDTA treatment, a freshly prepared FeSO4/EDTAsolution (20 mm) was diluted with water, and 4-μl aliquots wereadded to the DNA solution (196 μl) to yield a final Fe2+-EDTAconcentration of 0–300 μm. For bleomycin treatment,2-μl aliquots of an aqueous bleomycin solution (0–5 mm)were added to the DNA solution (196 μl) followed by addition of 2-μlaliquots of freshly preparedFe(NH4)2(SO4)2 solution (0–5mm) to initiate the DNA damage reaction. ONOO–damage reactions (0–300 μm) were carried out by adding4-μl aliquots of the oxidant in 0.1 m NaOH to DNA dissolved in100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6; higher bufferconcentration and lower pH to compensate for the addition of 0.1 nNaOH). All DNA damage reactions were conducted at ambient temperature for 0.5h followed by ultrafiltration using Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filters toseparate MDA and base propenals from the DNA fragments. Quantification of MDA and Base Propenals—The ultrafiltrateprepared from the in vitro reactions above or from cell suspensionsexposed to ONOO– (see below) were resolved by HPLC and MDA,and base propenals were isolated by collection of fractions bracketing theirretention times: MDA, 6.4 min; C-propenal, 9.3 min; T-propenal, 13.0 min;A-propenal, 20.0 min. Following combination of the base propenal fractions,1/25 volume of a thiobarbituric acid (TBA) suspension (10 mg/ml in 0.2m HCl) was added to each MDA and base propenal solution followed byheating to 90 °C for 30 min. The quantities of the identical MDA and basepropenal derivatives of TBA were then determined by absorbance at 532 nm(ϵ = 1.53 × 105 m–1cm–1); if necessary, the TBA reaction solutions wereconcentrated under vacuum to increase the final concentration of the 532-nmabsorbing species. As an alternative to the HPLC/TBA method for the cell studies (see below),MDA (free and bound to proteins or other biological molecules) and otheranalogous lipid peroxidation products were quantified using a lipidperoxidation kit from Oxford Biomedical Research. Cells were washed twice(2050 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) with phosphate-buffered saline(PBS; 10 mm potassium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4)and resuspended in 200 μl of water followed by sequential addition of 50μl of butylated hydroxytoluene (40 mm in ethanol), 600 μl ofdiluted R1 reagent (3:1 N-methyl-2-phenylindole inacetonitrile:ferrous iron in methanol), and 150 μlof12 n HCl.The mixture was mixed by vortexing and was incubated at 60 °C for 1 hfollowed by centrifugation (16,100 × g, 20 min) and removal ofthe supernatant for measurement of absorbance at 586 nm. A standard curve wasprepared with solutions of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (MDA precursor) in 200μl of water. The presence of MDA and base propenals was also established qualitativelyby thin-layer chromatography(17Yermilov V. Yoshie Y. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An aliquot of theultrafiltrate prepared from the in vitro reactions above (5 μl)was loaded onto a silica gel IB-F TLC plate, resolved with ethylacetate:isopropyl alcohol:water (74:17:9) and developed by spraying with 0.6%TBA and heating (20 min, 100 °C). RF values wereestablished using synthetic standards. Quantification of M1dG—The M1dGcontent of all DNA samples was measured by an immunoblot assay(14Plastaras J.P. Riggins J.N. Otteneder M. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To construct standardcurves, MDA-modified DNA (calibrated against a standard provided by Prof.Lawrence Marnett, Vanderbilt University) was diluted with calf thymus DNA togive 6.6 μg of DNA in 150 μl of PBS followed by sonication for 15 min at4 °C, heating at 100 °C for 15 min, and cooling in ice water for 10min. The solution was then immediately diluted by addition of 150 μl of 2m cold ammonium acetate, and 90-μl aliquots (2 μg of DNA)were blotted in triplicate onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-RadBioDot microfiltration system. The wells were washed twice with ammoniumacetate (200 μl, 1 m), and the membrane was baked (80 °C, 90min) and then blocked at ambient temperature for 1.5 h with PBS containing0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was washed twice for 5 minin blocking solution and then incubated with a 1:30,000 dilution ofanti-M1dG monoclonal antibody (0.3 mg/ml stock) in blockingsolution containing 0.5% milk. Following agitation for 30 min at ambienttemperature and overnight at 4 °C, the membrane was washed with blockingsolution (four times, 5 min) and incubated at ambient temperature for 2 h witha 1:3,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate inblocking solution containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was againwashed (four times, 5 min) with blocking solution followed by incubation in 10ml of Super Signal West Dura substrate (Pierce) for 5 min. Thechemiluminescence signal on the membrane was quantified using an AlphaInnotech Fluorochem charge-coupled device camera system (San Leandro, CA). Themembrane was then washed in PBS overnight and stained with 5 μg/mlpropidium iodide in PBS (3 h, ambient temperature, dark) followed by washingin PBS and quantification of the fluorescence using the Alpha InnotechFluorochem charge-coupled device camera system. Standard curves were preparedby plotting the adduct level against the enhanced chemiluminescence signalfollowing normalization of the latter to the propidium iodide stainingintensity. The M1dG levels of unknown samples were based onstandard curves analyzed in parallel on the same blot. Modulation of the PUFA Content of E. coli—E. coli strainDH5α was grown at 37 °C in medium E(18Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J.Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5%glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 0.0015% thiamine and fatty acids to a final,total concentration of 0.05 g/liter. Fatty acids were added from stocksolutions (100 ml, ethanol) with the following compositions: solution A, 0.1 geach of lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0),stearic acid (18:0), and oleic acid (18:1); solution B, 0.5 g of stearic acid(18:0); solution C, 0.5 g of linoleic acid (18:2). Cells cultured in mediawith the three different fatty acid compositions grew at the same rate (datanot shown; A600 doubling time ∼1.8 h), and oxidanttreatments were performed at a cell density of ∼5 × 108cells/ml (A600 = 0.6). Determination of E. coli Fatty Acid Composition—The fattyacid composition of E. coli membranes was quantified by amodification of the method of Harley et al.(19Harley J.B. Santangelo G.M. Rasmussen H. Goldfine H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 808-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following three washesin PBS (5000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the cells were resuspendedin 1 n KOH in 90% ethanol and heated for 1 h at 75 °C. Thesolution was filtered, and 6 n HCl was added to the filtratefollowed by two extractions with chloroform. The organic layers were combinedand dried under a stream of N2. To the white residue was addedmethanol and 12 n HCl (2:1, v/v), and the solution was refluxed at75 °C for 1 h. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with petroleumether, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentratedunder vacuum, and the fatty acid methyl ester composition was analyzed byGC/MS following injection of 1-μl samples. Fatty acids were identified byretention time and mass using standards and by matching data against astandard electron impact ionization spectral library. GC retention times were:14:0, 11.3 min; 16:1, 13.5 min; 16:0, 13.8 min; Cy17:0, 14.3 min; 18:2, 15.0min; 18:1, 15.1 min; 18:0, 15.3 min. γ-Radiation and ONOO– Treatment of E.coli—Cells grown to a density of ∼5 × 108/mlwere washed three times in PBS and then resuspended (A600= 3) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Forγ-radiation, the cell suspension (5 ml) was irradiated (0–300 Gy)in a 60Co source at 2 Gy/min at ambient temperature. ForONOO–, 4.5 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 170μlof0.2 m HCl (to neutralize the 0.1 m NaOH addedwith the ONOO–). This was followed quickly by addition of0.33 ml of ONOO– solution (0–30 mm in 0.1m NaOH; final ONOO– 0–2.2 mm)that was carefully transferred to the side wall of a 15-ml conical tube walland rapidly mixed with cell suspension by vortexing. The mixture was incubatedat ambient temperature for 1 h. The treated E. coli suspensions werethen washed once with PBS (2050 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and DNAwas purified using a Qiagen cell culture DNA Midi kit (Valencia, CA),precipitated with isopropanol, and washed with 70% cold ethanol. The DNApellet was air-dried, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and stored at –80°C until used for the M1dG immunoblot assay. For severalsamples of ONOO–-treated E. coli, the exposed cellswere pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant subjected to YM-10ultrafiltration, as described above, followed by quantification of MDA in theultrafiltrate. Correlation of M1dG Formation with Oxidant-inducedGeneration of MDA or Base Propenals in DNA—We first undertookexperiments to define the deoxyribose 4′-oxidation chemistry for severaloxidizing agents in purified DNA and to correlate these products with theformation of M1dG. These studies are based on disparate reportsthat: 1) γ-radiation produces MDA rather than base propenals as theproduct of 4′-oxidation of deoxyribose that accompanies the3′-phosphoglycolate residue(20Rashid R. Langfinger D. Wagner R. Schuchmann H-P. vonSonntag C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); 2) γ-radiationdoes not cause formation of M1dG in DNA(13Dedon P.C. Plastaras J.P. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11113-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); 3) Fe2+-EDTAcauses lower levels of M1dG to form in DNA than doesFe2+/H2O2(21Frelon S. Douki T. Favier A. Cadet J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2002; 1: 2866-2870Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and 4)ONOO– causes formation of base propenals(17Yermilov V. Yoshie Y. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The goal was to definethe relationship between M1dG formation and the generation of MDAor base propenals by deoxyribose 4′-oxidants. As shown in Fig. 2, HPLCresolution provided a means to separate MDA and the base propenals forsubsequent quantification by TBA derivatization. This method was used toquantify these species in the various DNA oxidation reactions as shown inFig. 3. Although G-propenal wasnot quantified in these studies because of the lack of a synthetic standard,quantification of the other three base propenals represents a rigorous metricbecause γ-radiation, Fe2+-EDTA, and ONOO–are sequence non-selective deoxyribose oxidants(22Tullius T.D. Trends Biochem.Sci. 1987; 12: 297-300Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar,23Burney S. Niles J.C. Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and bleomycin causesformation mainly of C- and T-propenals and some A-propenal(20Rashid R. Langfinger D. Wagner R. Schuchmann H-P. vonSonntag C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The graphs inFig. 3 reveal that the variousoxidizing agents produced either MDA or base propenals but did notsimultaneously produce detectable levels of both products. It is also apparentthat agents producing base propenals also caused M1dG formation andthose agents that produced MDA did not.Fig. 3Correlation between M1dG (▴) and the generation ofeither MDA (○) or base propenals (BP) (•) in purified DNAtreated with different oxidants.

Reactions were performed as describedunder “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent mean ± S.D.for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For unknown reasons, we were unable to detect base propenals in theONOO– reactions with DNA using the HPLC/TBA method. However,the presence of adenine and thymine propenals was established (and the absenceof MDA confirmed) by TLC (data not shown). Although the detection of the basepropenals by TLC is qualitative, the results confirm published studies ofthymine propenal formation in the reaction of 2′-deoxythymidine withONOO– (17Yermilov V. Yoshie Y. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).One possible explanation for the lack of detection of the base propenals byHPLC with TBA reaction is their oxidation by excess ONOO–,which is consistent with the non-linear dose-response curve inFig. 3D. Control of the Fatty Acid Composition of E. coliMembranes—As a model system to define the role of PUFA-derived MDAin M1dG formation, E. coli DH5α cells were culturedin defined media containing different fatty acids. As shown inTable I, GC/MS analysis ofE. coli extracts revealed a PUFA content consistent with the growthconditions. Although cells grown in the 18:0-enriched medium did not containdetectable PUFA, the level of PUFA increased to 53.9% of fatty acid contentfor cells grown in the 18:2-medium (TableI). This level of linoleic acid incorporation is similar to thatreported by Harley et al. (45%) in experiments performed with anunsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of E. coli(19Harley J.B. Santangelo G.M. Rasmussen H. Goldfine H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 808-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, anintermediate level of PUFA was present in the medium containing a mixture offatty acids.Table IFatty acid composition (mol %) of E. coli cells grown in definedmediaComponentFatty acidsupplementaSole fatty acid source in defined culture media (see “ExperimentalProcedures”).Mixture18:018:214:04.13.01.516:1139.13.316:0522824Cy17:03.93.35.718:20.5n.d.5418:1203.49.518:06.2531.6Total % UFA331267% PUFA0.5n.d.54a Sole fatty acid source in defined culture media (see “ExperimentalProcedures”). Open table in a new tab Attempts to grow E. coli DH5α in minimal media containinglinolenate (18:3) or arachidonate (20:4) were unsuccessful in that themembrane levels of each fell below the detection limit of the GC/MS assay atnon-toxic concentrations of the fatty acids. One possible explanation for thisresult is that, unlike the unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs used in thestudies of Harley et al.(19Harley J.B. Santangelo G.M. Rasmussen H. Goldfine H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 808-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E. coliDH5α is able to metabolize PUFA and thus possibly maintain low levels of18:3 and 20:4. Correlation of M1dG Formation with Oxidant-induced LipidPeroxidation in E. coli—To assess the role of MDA in the formationof M1dG in living cells, E. coli grown in the threedefined media were treated with γ-radiation or ONOO–,and the level of M1dG was quantified by an immunoblot assay. Asshown in Fig. 4,ONOO– treatment of E. coli grown in the absence ofPUFA led to a dose-dependent increase in M1dG, which is consistentwith the results obtained with purified DNA(Fig. 3D). It is alsoapparent that there is an inverse correlation between PUFA content andM1dG formation (Fig.4D), whereas there is a direct correlation between PUFAcontent and MDA formation as expected (Fig.4C). Exposure to γ-radiation did not induce detectable levels ofM1dG in E. coli grown with any of the fatty acids(Fig. 4B), which isagain consistent with the in vitro results(Fig. 3). However,γ-radiation did produce MDA as a result of lipid peroxidation in amountsdirectly proportional to the PUFA content of the cells(Fig. 4A). Similarresults were obtained by treating the three cell types with hydrogen peroxidewith or without added Fe2+ (data not shown). There is strong evidence for the existence of a host of endogenous DNAadducts (reviewed in Ref. 25De Bont R. van Larebeke N. Mutagenesis. 2004; 19: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar),yet the mechanisms of their formation have not been rigorously defined. Thegoal of the present studies was to address this problem for M1dG.The chemical species known to form M1dG in vitro, namelyMDA and base propenals, arise from different sources. Lipids represent a majortarget for free radicals (26Dix T.A. Aikens J. Chem.Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar),and peroxidation of PUFA generates a host of reactive electrophiles, many ofwhich have been implicated in the formation of DNA adducts, such as the ethenoadducts of dG, dA, and dC(27Marnett L.J. Burcham P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, MDAis ubiquitously present in cells and tissues and has been demonstrated toreact with dG to form M1dG in vitro(28Basu A.K. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2848-2854PubMed Google Scholar, 29Basu A.K. O'Hara S.M. Valladier P. Stone K. Mols O. Marnett L.J. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2051252921,"Major disparities in reported levels of basal human nitric oxide metabolites have resulted in a recent literature focusing almost exclusively on methods. We chose to analyze triiodide chemiluminescence, drawn by the prospect of identifying why the most commonly employed assay in nitric oxide biology typically yielded lower metabolite values, compared with several other techniques. We found that the sensitivity of triiodide was greatly affected by the auto-capture of nitric oxide by deoxygenated cell-free heme in the reaction chamber. Potential contaminants and signal losses were also associated with standard sample purification procedures and the chemistry involved in nitrite removal. To inhibit heme nitric oxide auto-capture, we added potassium ferricyanide to the triiodide reagent, reasoning this would provide a more complete detection of any liberated nitric oxide. From human venous blood samples, we established nitric oxide levels ranging from 0.000178 to 0.00024 mol nitric oxide/mol hemoglobin. We went on to find significantly elevated nitric oxide levels in venous blood taken from diabetic patients in comparison to healthy controls (p < 0.0001). We concluded that the lack of signals reported of late by several groups using triiodide chemiluminescence for the detection of hemoglobin-bound nitric oxide may not represent levels on the border of assay sensitivity but rather underestimated values because of methodological limitations. We therefore stress the need for assay systems to be developed that differentiate between individual nitric oxide metabolite species and overcome the limitations we outline, allowing accurate conclusions to be drawn regarding physiological nitric oxide metabolite levels.

Traditionally, endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; Hb, hemoglobin; HbNO, nitrosylhemoglobin; SNO-Hb, S-nitrosohemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; RSNO, S-nitrosothiol. 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; Hb, hemoglobin; HbNO, nitrosylhemoglobin; SNO-Hb, S-nitrosohemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; RSNO, S-nitrosothiol.has been viewed solely as a paracrine effector (1Schechter A.N.

However, more recent evidence has revealed an endocrine role for NO via the formation of metabolites that preserve bioactivity and contribute to blood flow regulation and oxygen delivery (3Jia L.

Studies into the mechanisms for this effect have led to two alternative models that emphasize the significance of different metabolites, the ability of S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) within red blood cells to provide bio-available NO (3Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 5McMahon T.J. Moon R.E. Luschinger B.P. Carraway M.S. Stone A.E. Stolp B.W. Gow A.J.

Sorokina E.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 874-884PubMed Google Scholar). Although NO2− reduction by deoxyhemoglobin has been shown to represent a potential source of NO (in conjunction with methemoglobin) (9Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has yet to be convincingly demonstrated that this NO could remain free to play a physiological role in vasodilation (10Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat.

This would necessitate NO escaping the red blood cell and avoiding uptake/binding to ferrous heme, which is highly improbable considering the low oxygen conditions under which deoxyhemoglobin acts as a NO2− reductase (12Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 99-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Robinson J.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further detracting from a direct role for NO2− in hypoxic vasodilation is the fact that nitric-oxide synthase inhibition, which acutely reduces endogenous NO2− levels (14Lauer T. Preik M. Rassaf T. Strauer B.E. Deussen A. Feelisch M. Kelm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12814-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), does not block exercise-induced hypoxic vasodilation (10Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have highlighted the formation of SNO-Hb following the oxygenation of nitrosylhemoglobin (HbNO) formed from the reaction of deoxyhemoglobin with NO2− ( NO2− reductase activity) (15Luchsinger B.P. Rich E.N. Gow A.J. Williams E.M. Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this links NO2− reduction, which would occur under low oxygen conditions, to the formation of SNO-Hb via oxygenation of HbNO in the lungs, creating red blood cells able to exhibit potent vasodilatory activity at low partial pressures of oxygen in the peripheral circulation (16Luchsinger B.P. Rich E.N. Yan Y. Williams E.M. Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The measurement of NO metabolites in biological matrices is notoriously difficult and technically demanding due to dilute concentrations of NO and its complex interactions with various biological constituents (17Giustarini D. Milzani A. Colombo R. Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Reiter C.D. Gladwin M.T. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the wide ranging reports of basal levels of human red blood cell Hb-bound NO. These discrepancies have fueled arguments over the existence of arterial/venous metabolite gradients and a fierce body of literature critically scrutinizing the methodology of measurements (12Singel D.J.

Rassaf T. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although it is generally agreed that wide ranging metabolite values have resulted from the use of different analytical approaches with no rigorous standards to ensure specific, accurate, and reproducible measurements (12Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 99-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 17Giustarini D. Milzani A. Colombo R. Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Trends Pharmacol.

Res. 2002; 90: E39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these inconsistent findings have still diverted attention away from the potential physiological significance of a “reserve” pool of NO in the microcirculation and have even cast doubt on its whole relevance.One technique reported suitable in terms of detection limit for the measurement of basal NO metabolites is ozone-based chemiluminescence (25Stamler J.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Rassaf T. Feelisch M. Kelm M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Several chemical reductive assays have been developed for the detection of various NO species in conjunction with this technique. The most commonly reported of these has been the triiodide assay (28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 29Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Moore K.P. Mani A.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This assay is proposed to stoichiometrically measure NO gas from S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) and NO2− (18Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Reiter C.D. Gladwin M.T. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and also measure N-nitroso compounds (RNNO) and nitrosylheme complexes (NO-heme/HbNO) (28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Reported NO yields are ∼100% for low molecular weight RSNOs, ∼78% for SNO-albumin, ∼81% for HbNO, and ∼67–105% for N-nitroso compounds (28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanisms for triiodide cleavage of RSNO have previously been outlined (29Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but the underlying reactions involved in the denitrosation of RNNOs and nitrosylheme species still remain to be elucidated (28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). No explanation is given as to why the NO yield from SNO-albumin is so low in comparison to that from low molecular weight RSNOs. However, others have stated that the standard sample pretreatment associated with the triiodide assay destroys some SNOs, thus affecting the NO yield (25Stamler J.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Foster M.W. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).For the reason that the triiodide assay converts most NO-related species back to NO gas (strong reducing agents in strong acid at high temperature), it is necessary to use sample separation procedures to obtain the species of interest (11Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This not only increases the chance of contamination but also susceptibility to losses of unstable NO species (25Stamler J.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). According to Nagababu et al. (11Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the standard purification procedure used in conjunction with the triiodide assay by Gladwin and co-workers (18Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Reiter C.D. Gladwin M.T. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 38Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) results in the oxygenation of samples and the subsequent loss of HbFe3+NO, which they suggest accounts for the majority of HbNO in human blood. It is tempting to speculate that this is one reason why recent papers from groups using the triiodide assay have failed to detect basal Hb-bound NO in human blood (23Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Maloney R.E. Specian V. Kelm M. Kalyanaraman B. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In line with these reports, we also fail to detect signals from human red blood cell samples using the very same methods. However, higher levels of Hb- and plasma-bound NO from human samples have been reported from groups using a variety of different assays and techniques including photolytic cleavage of NO linked to ozone-based chemiluminescence (5McMahon T.J. Moon R.E. Luschinger B.P. Carraway M.S. Stone A.E. Stolp B.W. Gow A.J. Pawloski J.R. Watke P. Singel D.J. Piantadosi C.A. Stamler J.S. Nat.

Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), spectrophotometric detection (32Funai E.F. Davidson A. Seligman S.P. Finlay T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), electrochemical detection (33Datta B. Tufnell-Barrett T. Bleasdale R.A. Jones C.J. Beeton I.

Appl. 1999; 726: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these findings have, themselves, been ascribed to artifact resulting from the generation of NO from NO2− and NO3− (11Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Maloney R.E. Specian V. Kelm M. Kalyanaraman B. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat.

This lack of continuity is exemplified by measurements 1) with different concentrations of potassium iodide and K3Fe+(CN)6; 2) with and without potassium cyanide, Nonidet P-40, N-ethylmaleimide, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, mercury chloride (HgCl2), acidified sulfanilamide; 3) with markedly different incubation times; and 4) with different red blood cell, whole blood, and plasma preparations (10Cosby K.

Further inconsistencies only serve to confuse the issue; for example, a method was used to measure HbNO (10Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat.

Res. 2003; 37: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Another chemical-reductive assay used in conjunction with ozone-based chemiluminescence is the cysteine/cuprous chloride assay, developed to specifically measure RSNOs (42Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. MacDonald T. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This assay exploits trans-nitrosation reactions between biological SNOs and the liberation of NO from RSNOs in the presence of Cu+ (43Dicks A.P. Swift H.R. Williams D.L.H. Butler A.R. Al-Sa'doni H.H.

The neutral pH of the cysteine/cuprous chloride reagent ensures that (NO2−,NO3−), and 3-nitrotyrosine are not detected, thus maintaining specificity for RSNO. This means that sample pretreatment is not necessary, reducing the likelihood of contamination and potential losses of unstable NO species. NO yields from this assay are reportedly stoichiometric for low mass SNOs; however, the yield from SNO-albumin is ∼33.9% (42Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. MacDonald T. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The low returns from this specific plasma protein are thought to result from sheltering of the SNO bond inhibiting trans-nitrosation to cysteine (42Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. MacDonald T. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This low yield from SNO-albumin may also reflect the unphysiological nature of SNO standards used (for example, in terms of fatty acid and copper content).Drawn by the prospect of identifying why the chemical-reductive assays have typically yielded lower levels of Hb-bound NO than other methods, we chose to examine two of these assays and set out to establish 1) the effect of Hb in the reaction chamber on NO detection, 2) the effect of inhibiting NO Hb interaction in the reaction chamber, and 3) the consequence of sample pretreatment on the recovery of NO from human red blood cells. Initially, we looked at NO recovery from sodium nitrite ( NaNO2−) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in the presence/absence of different concentrations of Hb in the reaction chamber. We then explored the potential of K3FeIII(CN)6 to inhibit heme NO interaction and examined its influence on the recovery of NO from NaNO2− and GSNO in the presence/absence of Hb in the reaction chamber. Finally, we used our modified reagent to analyze basal venous blood samples taken from healthy individuals and diabetic patients.We describe here several key findings implying that the current triiodide and cysteine/cuprous chloride assays both under-measure Hb-bound NO present in human red blood cell samples due to the auto-capture of NO by deoxygenated Hb/cell-free heme in the reaction chamber. Furthermore, the current triiodide assay is also affected by signal losses and potential artifacts associated with sample pretreatment. By inhibiting heme NO auto-capture and avoiding harsh chemical pretreatment of samples, we highlight that the level of basal red blood cell-bound NO detected from human samples is significantly higher than recently reported (10Cosby K.

Standards of NaNO2− and GSNO were prepared in high pressure liquid chromatography-grade NO2−-free water.Biological Samples—Blood was drawn from the femoral or antecubital vein of healthy and diabetic individuals. Samples were injected into 4-ml EDTA collection tubes, which were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Both the red cell fraction and plasma were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis. Upon analysis, both frozen red blood cell and plasma samples were thawed in a water bath at 37 °C for 3 min. The effects of freezing and thawing have not been specifically addressed; however, all samples were treated the same. Red blood cell samples were subsequently lysed 1:4 in EDTA (0.5 mm; pH corrected to 7.0) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Purified Hb was acquired by passing 500 μl of the red blood cell lysate through a prewashed (with high pressure liquid chromatography NO2−-free water) Sephadex G25 column, which takes ∼3 min at room temperature (20–22 °C). Consequently, the preparation of red blood cell lysate, from the freezer to the time of injection, took ∼8–9 min, whereas the preparation of purified Hb took ∼11–12 min. Preparative losses of NO species over these time periods have not been addressed, but they were the same for all samples studied.Ozone-based Chemiluminescence Setup—Assay reagents (5 ml) were placed in a glass purge vessel with a rubber septum-covered injection inlet. Oxygen-free nitrogen gas was bubbled through the reagent mix, which was heated to 50 °C (±1 °C) in a water bath on a thermostatically controlled hotplate. The reaction vessel, linked to a trap containing 40 ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide, was further connected to the NO analyzer (Sievers NOA 280i, Analytix, UK).Cysteine/Cuprous Chloride Assay—A stock solution of reagent (1 mm cysteine, 100 μm cuprous chloride in 400 ml of distilled water) was prepared fresh each day and pH corrected to 7.0 by the addition of sodium hydroxide. Only one Hb sample was injected into each assay mix before being replaced to prevent saturation of Hb and exhaustion of the denitrosating reagent.Original Triiodide Assay—A stock solution of triiodide reagent (70 ml) was prepared fresh each day as previously outlined (18Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Reiter C.D. Gladwin M.T. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Only one red blood cell or Hb sample was injected into each assay mix before being replaced to prevent saturation of Hb and exhaustion of the denitrosating reagent. Reactions of the triiodide reagent with other redoxactive agents could not be controlled; however, the effect of endogenous redox-active agents on triiodide have previously been investigated and found not to interfere with the denitrosation process (28Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).Modified Triiodide Assay—The original triiodide assay was modified by adding K3FeIII(CN)6 (25 mm final) to limit Hb/cell-free heme (Fe(II)) auto-capture of NO. Fresh K3FeIII(CN)6 was added to the triiodide reagent just prior to its use, rather than to the master mix. The assay mix was replaced after every blood injection to prevent saturation by Hb and exhaustion of the denitrosating reagent. Direct injection of red blood cell lysate or purified Hb (200 μl) into the modified mix was taken to reflect total red blood cell-bound NO (i.e. SNO-Hb, HbNO, and any NO2− bound to Hb).NO Scavenging Experiments—One hundred μl of either NaNO2− (250 or 500 nm) or GSNO (500 nm or 1 μm) was injected into the reaction chamber, followed by different volumes of plasma (25 μl –1 ml) or different concentrations of Hb; lysed red blood cells or purified Hb (1.25–160 μm Hb final, i.e. 5–660 μm heme final). Finally, a repeat 100-μl injection of the same NaNO2− or GSNO standard was made. Experiments were performed in the original triiodide and cysteine/cuprous chloride reagents to identify the scavenging potential of cell-free heme/plasma and in the modified triiodide reagent to illustrate the inhibition of NO scavenging.Human Red Blood Cell-bound NO Measurement (Original versus Modified Triiodide Reagents)—Blood taken from the antecubital vein of healthy individuals was treated as outlined above (see “Biological Samples”). Red blood cell lysate from the same blood sample was injected into the original triiodide reagent and then into"
https://openalex.org/W2047104027,"Whether translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the mRNA cap binding and rate-limiting factor required for translation, is a target for cytotoxicity and cell death induced by cadmium, a human carcinogen, was investigated. Exposure of human cell lines, HCT15, PLC/PR/5, HeLa, and Chang, to cadmium chloride resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death, and this was associated with a significant decrease in eIF4E protein levels. Similarly, specific silencing of the expression of the eIF4E gene, caused by a small interfering RNA, resulted in significant cytotoxicity and cell death. On the other hand, overexpression of the eIF4E gene was protective against the cadmium-induced cytotoxicity and cell death. Further studies revealed the absence of alterations in the eIF4E mRNA level in the cadmium-treated cells despite their decreased eIF4E protein level. In addition, exposure of cells to cadmium resulted in enhanced ubiquitination of eIF4E protein while inhibitors of proteasome activity reversed the cadmium-induced decrease of eIF4E protein. Exposure of cells to cadmium, as well as the specific silencing of eIF4E gene, also resulted in decreased cellular levels of cyclin D1, a critical cell cycle and growth regulating gene, suggesting that the observed inhibition of cyclin D1 gene expression in the cadmium-treated cells is most likely due to decreased cellular level of eIF4E. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the exposure of cells to cadmium chloride resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death due to enhanced ubiquitination and consequent proteolysis of eIF4E protein, which in turn diminished cellular levels of critical genes such as cyclin D1.

Cadmium, a highly toxic chemical and one of the members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's “Priority List of Chemicals,” has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a human carcinogen. Cadmium is found in abundance in the environment, at specific work places, and in food and water. Therefore, human exposure to cadmium is essentially unavoidable. Higher levels of cadmium have been detected in the urine and in various organs of exposed individuals (1Aylett B.J. The Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology of Cadmium. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1979Google Scholar, 2Yassin A.S. Martonik J.F. J. Occup. Environ. Hyg. 2004; 1: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the toxicological responses of cadmium exposure include kidney damage, respiratory diseases, and neurological disorders (3Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Exposure to cadmium has been implicated in cancers of the lungs, prostate, pancreas, and kidney (4Stayner L. Smith R. Thun M. Schnorr T. Lemen R. Ann. Epidemiol. 1992; 2: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5International Agency for Research on Cancer Beryllium, Cadmium, Mercury and Exposures in the Glass Industry. 58.

Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology; Toxicology of Metals, Biochemical Effects, Springer-Verlag, New York1994Google Scholar). The mortality risk among people exposed to cadmium shows a strong correlation with the exposure level (7Matsuda K. Kobayashi E. Okubo Y. Suwazono Y. Kido T. Nishijo M. Nakagawa H. Nogawa K. Arch. Environ. Health. 2003; 58: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to cadmium leads to a complex series of events, including deregulation of gene expression resulting in changes in the cellular pathways and corresponding networks that play a critical role in the response of cells to the toxicity of the chemical (8Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the past, multiple genes, including those involved in several critical cellular functions, have been identified as potential targets for cadmium-induced cytotoxicity and cell death (reviewed in Ref. 9Waisberg M. Joseph P. Hale B. Beyersmann D. Toxicology. 2003; 192: 95-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar); however, the one or more precise mechanisms that lead to their deregulation of expression in response to cadmium exposure as well as the functional significance of such alterations with respect to cadmium toxicity are not well studied. Despite identifying several genes that may potentially function as targets for cadmium-induced cytotoxicity and cell death, the underlying mechanisms responsible for such alterations and the mechanisms that lead to cytotoxicity and cell death are not understood. Alterations in the expression of cellular genes in response to their exposure to toxic chemicals may be due to the chemical-induced changes in cellular transcription and/or translation machinery. Although the cellular effects of chemicals, including those of cadmium, are relatively better understood with respect to transcription, there are not many studies that address how chemical exposures influence gene expression at the translation level. In eukaryotes, translation of mRNAs to synthesize the encoded proteins is a complex process carried out by several genes collectively referred to as translation factors. Three distinct phases of translation have been identified and characterized: viz. initiation, elongation, and termination (10Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Of the more than two dozen translation initiation factors that have been cloned and characterized to date, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; HO-1, hemeoxygenase-1; MT-2, metallothionein-2; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interference RNA; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-nor-leucinal; MG-132, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; HO-1, hemeoxygenase-1; MT-2, metallothionein-2; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interference RNA; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-nor-leucinal; MG-132, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal. assumes paramount importance. eIF4E functions in the rate-limiting step of translation initiation where it binds with the 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNA and recruits the given transcript to the translational machinery. The function of eIF4E is conserved from yeast to humans (11Altmann M. Muller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the antisense oligonucleotides to eIF4E is lethal in HeLa cells (12De Benedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggesting that the eIF4E gene is essential for survival of cells. The eIF4E gene is a critical regulator of cellular growth (13Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and its overexpression results in oncogenic transformation of immortalized cell lines (14Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 15Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Increased levels of eIF4E are correlated with a poor clinical outcome in a variety of human cancers, including breast cancer (17Nathan C.A. Carter P. Liu L. Li B.D. Abreo F. Tudor A. Zimmer S.G. De Benedetti A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and several non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas (18Wang S. Rosenwald I.B. Hutzler M.J. Pihan G.A. Savas L. Chen J.J. Woda B.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 247-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is attributed to its ability to inappropriately translate growth-promoting transcripts (13Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, whether eIF4E is a cellular target for chemical-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis remains to be studied. Recently, we have reported that deregulation of translation, as evidenced from overexpression of translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and translation elongation factor-1δ (eEF-1δ) in cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells, is a major mechanism responsible for cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by cadmium (19Joseph P. Lei Y-X. Wong W.-Z. Ong T.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6131-6136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Joseph P. Lei Y-X. Wong W.-Z. Ong T.-M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 703-707PubMed Google Scholar, 21Joseph P. Lei Y-X. Ong T.-M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 255: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Presently, we have investigated the effect of cadmium exposure on the cellular expression level of eIF4E, the rate-limiting translation initiation factor involved in eukaryotic protein synthesis. In addition, we have found that eIF4E is a novel cellular target for cadmium toxicity and the resulting cell death. The underlying mechanisms responsible for cadmium-induced deregulation of eIF4E leading to cytotoxicity and cell death are presented. Human cell lines, viz. HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma, catalogue number CCL-2), HCT15 (colon adenocarcinoma, catalogue number CCL-225), PLC/PR/5 (hepatocellular carcinoma, catalogue number CRL-8024), and Chang (likely derived from HeLa cells, catalogue number CCL-13), were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in the medium containing fetal bovine serum and all required supplements as recommended by the supplier. Exponentially growing cells were used to determine the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) for CdCl2. One hundred thousand cells each were plated in the individual wells of a 96-well cell culture plate. The cells were allowed to attach and grow overnight. Cadmium chloride (Sigma) was dissolved in sterile water to prepare a stock solution and was diluted with fresh, serum-free cell culture medium to get final concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μm. The cells were allowed to grow in the control as well as in the medium containing increasing concentrations of CdCl2 for 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined by quantitating the number of surviving cells as evidenced from the metabolic reduction of a tetrazolium salt (MTT assay, ATCC, Manassas, VA). The LC50 for CdCl2 was determined for each of the cell lines based on their response to increasing concentrations of the chemical that resulted in 0-100% cell death. The effect of CdCl2 on the expression level of the eIF4E gene was determined by Western blot analysis. The cells were treated for 24 h with CdCl2 at the respective LC50 values obtained for each of the cell lines as determined by an independent cytotoxicity experiment. The chemically-treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell lysates were prepared from the control and the cadmium-treated cells using the mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminomethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in the cold, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined spectrophotometrically using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (30 μg each) from the control and the CdCl2-treated cells were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-containing denaturing gel and were transferred onto a polyvinylidene membrane for Western blot analysis. The eIF4E protein reacting with a mouse anti-human eIF4E antibody (BD Biosciences) was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the blots were stripped of the eIF4E antibody, and the presence of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was detected by Western blot analysis. Intensity of the eIF4E, eIF4G, and GAPDH protein bands reacting with the corresponding antibodies was determined by scanning the Western blot images using a densitometer equipped with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The expression profile of the target genes, eIF4E, metallothionein-2 (MT-2), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the housekeeping gene GAPDH, was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA from the control and the CdCl2-treated cells was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The purity and integrity of the RNA samples were determined by UV-spectrophotometry and by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis, respectively. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (BD Biosciences). Nucleotide sequences of the primers used to amplify the various genes were: eIF4E, 5′-CTA CTA AGA GCG GCT CCA CCA C-3′ (forward (F)) and 5′-TCG ATT GCT TGA CGC AGT CTC C-3′ (reverse (R)); MT-2, 5′-CGG CTC CTG CAA ATG CAA AGA G-3′ (F) and 5′-AGA TGC AGC CCT GGG CAC AC-3′ (R); HO-1, 5′-CAT TGC CAG TGC CAC CAA GTT C-3′ (F) and 5′-GGA ACG CAG TCT TGG CCT CTT C-3′ (R); and GAPDH, 5′-GCC TTC TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC-3′ (F) and 5′-GGC AGT GAT GGC GTG GAC TAT G-3′ (R). The PCR amplification, detection of the amplified gene products, and their quantitation were performed with the SYBR green PCR kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI-PRISM 5700 sequence detection system following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The PCR-amplified gene products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that only the intended product was amplified in each case. The expression levels of the individual genes, calculated using the formula, 2^(-(Ct_target - Ct_GAPDH)), were normalized to the expression level of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH. Transgenic Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells permanently overexpressing the eIF4E gene were generated as follows: The open reading frame of the human eIF4E cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_10029) was subcloned in-frame with the V5 epitope and the His6 tag of the expression vector, pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Plasmid DNA prepared using the Qiagen maxi preparation kit (Qiagen) was used to transfect CHO-K1 cells by the calcium phosphate procedure (BD Biosciences). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the transfected cells in medium containing G418 at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and cell lines were developed individually from surviving colonies. Overexpression of the cDNA-encoded protein was determined by Western blot analysis using antibody for the V5 epitope of the fusion protein as well as the eIF4E antibody (BD Biosciences). Cytotoxicity of CdCl2 in the control (transfected with the empty vector) and the eIF4E-overexpressing transgenic CHO-K1 cell lines was determined by treating the cells for 24 h with increasing concentrations of the chemical and determining the number of surviving cells using the MTT assay as described above. The endogenous eIF4E expression in HeLa and HCT15 cells was silenced by employing the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. Potential siRNA target sites present in the eIF4E mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_10029) were identified following the recommendations of Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX) for siRNA design. Several potential siRNA target sites were identified and screened against the GenBank™ data base by the BLAST program to ensure that the selected target sequences did not exhibit similarity to other known gene sequences available in the data base. This step was done to prevent potential nonspecific silencing of gene expression. The potential siRNA target sequences thus selected were used to generate Silencer™ Expression Cassettes using the Silencer™ Express siRNA Expression Cassettes Kit (Ambion Inc.) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The Silencer™ Expression Cassette consisted of the H1 RNA polymerase promoter adjacent to a hairpin siRNA template and an RNA polymerase terminator. Three Silencer™ Expression Cassettes potentially capable of silencing the expression of the eIF4E gene were tested in HeLa and HCT15 cells. The cells were transfected with the individual Silencer™ Expression Cassettes using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours following the transfection, cell lysates were prepared and tested for silencing of the expression of the eIF4E gene by Western blot analysis using human eIF4E antibody. For cytotoxicity determination, exponentially growing HeLa cells were plated in individual wells of a 96-well cell culture plate and transfected with eIF4E siRNA ranging in concentrations from 0 to 2.5 nmol. Forty-eight hours following the transfection, cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT assay. Whether silencing the expression of eIF4E will modify the response of cells to cadmium toxicity was also studied. HeLa cells plated on a 96-well cell culture plate were transfected with 0, 0.5, and 1.0 nmol each eIF4E-siRNA. Twenty-four hours following the transfection, the cells were treated with CdCl2 at final concentrations of 0, 16, and 32 μm for 24 h. At the end of the chemical exposure period, cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. Induction of Ubiquitin by Cadmium Chloride—Exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with CdCl2 at a final concentration of 32 μm (LC50). At the end of the treatment period, cell lysates were prepared from the control and chemically treated cells. The cellular levels of ubiquitin, Nrf2, and eIF4E proteins were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies for human ubiquitin, Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and eIF4E (BD Biosciences), respectively, as described above. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to determine whether the eIF4E protein underwent ubiquitination in the cadmium-treated cells. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with 32 μm CdCl2 for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were prepared. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) following procedures as described elsewhere (22Li W. Belsham G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29111-29115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins conjugated to the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then boiled with denaturing SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatant collected was used for Western blot analysis using human eIF4E antibody as described above. Proteasome Inhibitor Studies—Using inhibitors for proteasome activity, the involvement of proteasome-mediated proteolysis of eIF4E protein in response to cadmium exposure was investigated. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitors, ALLN (25 μm), MG-132 (10 μm), and lactacystin (10 μm), for 24 h. All three proteasome inhibitors used were purchased from Calbiochem. Three hours following the initiation of incubation of cells with the proteasome inhibitors, the cells were treated with CdCl2 at a final concentration of 32 μm for 21 h. The cell lysates prepared from the control and the CdCl2-treated cells at the end of the incubation period were analyzed for the expression of eIF4E protein by Western blot analysis using the human eIF4E antibody. The data were analyzed using SAS/STAT software, version 8.2, of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Experiments were performed using a randomized complete block design structure and analyzed using mixed model analyses of variance. Post hoc comparisons were made using Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test, and all differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Western blot and PCR data were normalized to the level of the housekeeping gene GAPDH, whereas cell survival assays were analyzed using the percentage of the control group as the dependent variable. The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between eIF4E expression and the percentage of surviving cells based on the MTT assay were calculated in cultures treated under identical experimental conditions. Briefly, simulated data sets were generated using bootstrap sampling and matching values obtained from cultures treated under identical conditions. For each simulation, a correlation coefficient was calculated. The simulation was repeated 500 times, and the average correlation coefficient is reported. Exposure of Cells to CdCl2 Resulted in Cytotoxicity, Cell Death, and Inhibition of eIF4E Protein Expression—Exposure of all four human cell lines, viz. HeLa, HCT15, PLC/PR/5, and Chang, to increasing concentrations of CdCl2 resulted in concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and cell death as evidenced from results of the MTT assay. The LC50 values for CdCl2, calculated from the dose-response curves of the individual cell lines were as follows: HCT15, 29.66 ± 0.41 μm; HeLa, 32.33 ± 3.26 μm; PLC/PR/5, 19.30 ± 2.04 μm; and Chang cells, 28.00 ± 1.22 μm. Results of the experiment designed to determine the effect of exposure of cells to CdCl2 on eIF4E expression revealed significant inhibition of eIF4E protein in all four cell lines tested. The cell lines treated with CdCl2 at the respective LC50 levels demonstrated significant inhibition of eIF4E at time intervals of 16 and 24 h, and the inhibition was more significant at the 24-h exposure period compared with that at the 16-h period (Western blot analysis results following the 24 h of exposure to CdCl2 are presented in Fig. 1A). The highest inhibition was noticed in the case of HeLa cells (75%), whereas the lowest inhibition (40%) was noticed in the case of HCT15 cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the inhibitory effect of CdCl2 on eIF4E is demonstrated by the lack of inhibition of eIF4G, the second member of the eIF4 family of translation factors (Fig. 1A). Whether the cadmium-induced inhibition of eIF4E is due to the suppression of transcription of the eIF4E gene was tested by analyzing the eIF4E transcript level in the control and the CdCl2-treated cells by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. As presented in Table I, excepting for slight, but not statistically significant reductions as noticed in the HeLa and PLC/PR/5 cells, all four human cell lines treated with CdCl2 exhibited eIF4E transcript level comparable to those of their corresponding control cell lines. In contrast, the expression levels of MT-2 and HO-1 genes in the CdCl2-treated cells were significantly higher compared with the control cells.Table IExpression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and metallothionein-2 (MT-2) mRNAs in cadmium chloride-treated cellsCell lineCdCl2Gene expressioneIF4EHO-1MT-2LC50arbitrary unitsHCT-15(−)0.064 ± 0.0060.025 ± 0.0030.034 ± 0.006(+)0.074 ± 0.0110.364 ± 0.048aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).4.966 ± 0.188aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).HeLa(−)0.060 ± 0.0220.039 ± 0.0240.176 ± 0.029(+)0.024 ± 0.0031.015 ± 0.286aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).3.008 ± 0.299aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).PLC/PR/5(−)0.066 ± 0.0240.047 ± 0.0140.018 ± 0.009(+)0.036 ± 0.0101.609 ± 0.191aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).2.215 ± 0.372aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).Chang(−)0.019 ± 0.0070.015 ± 0.0030.459 ± 0.051(+)0.023 ± 0.0040.837 ± 0.141aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).2.166 ± 0.076aStatistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001).a Statistically significant compared with the corresponding controls (p < 0.001). Open table in a new tab Silencing the Expression of eIF4E Gene by Transfecting the Cells with eIF4E siRNA Resulted in Cytotoxicity and Cell Death—Transfecting the human cell lines with eIF4E siRNA resulted in a significant inhibition of eIF4E mRNA (data not presented) and eIF4E protein (Fig. 2A), and the inhibitory effect was dependent on the concentration of eIF4E siRNA that was employed in the transfection (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression of GAPDH, the housekeeping gene employed in the experiment, was not influenced by eIF4E siRNA transfection. The specific nature of inhibition of eIF4E protein with the eIF4E siRNA was further evidenced from the lack of inhibition of another translation factor, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1), in the transfected cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 2A). Significant cytotoxicity and cell death were noticed among the cells transfected with the eIF4E siRNA as evidenced from results of MTT assay (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and cell death among the eIF4E siRNA-transfected cells exhibited a strong correlation (correlation co-efficient, r = 0.70) with the concentration of eIF4E siRNA that was used in the transfection (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar to the results obtained with the eIF4E protein, inhibition of eIF4E mRNA was also noticed in the cells transfected with the eIF4E siRNA (data not presented). As presented in Fig. 2D, the siRNA-mediated silencing of eIF4E gene expression resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity when the cells were exposed to CdCl2. Overexpression of the eIF4E Gene in CHO-K1 Transgenic Cell Lines Was Protective against CdCl2-induced Cytotoxicity and Cell Death—Transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the recombinant pcDNA3.1D/v5-His TOPO DNA containing the eIF4E cDNA resulted in a significant overexpression of the V5-eIF4E fusion protein as evidenced from the results of Western blot analysis. Furthermore, transfection of the cells with the plasmid DNA provided resistance to G418, and this facilitated the selection of stable transfectants overexpressing the eIF4E protein (Fig. 3A). The transgenic CHO-K1 cells exhibited significant resistance to the cytotoxicity and cell death induced by CdCl2, demonstrating the protective effect of eIF4E overexpression against cadmium-induced cytotoxicity and cell death. Furthermore, the protective effect seen correlated well with the expression level of eIF4E in the transgenic cell lines, and the CHO-K1-14 cell line overexpressing relatively higher levels of eIF4E transgene exhibited a significantly higher protective effect against the CdCl2-induced cytotoxicity and cell death compared with the CHO-K1-16 cell line (Fig. 3B). Enhanced Ubiquitination and Proteolysis of eIF4E Protein in the Cadmium-exposed Cells—Results of the studies investigating the potential role of ubiquitination in the inhibition of eIF4E in cells treated with CdCl2 demonstrated a definite role for the ubiquitination pathway in the CdCl2-induced decrease in the cellular level of eIF4E protein. Exposure of cells to CdCl2 for 24 h resulted in a significant induction of ubiquitin protein as well as increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins as evidenced from results of Western blot analysis of the CdCl2-treated cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4A). Exposure of cells to CdCl2 for 24 h also resulted in the ubiquitination of eIF4E protein (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W2103888776,"Sp1 activates the transcription of many cellular and viral genes with the GC-box in either the proximal promoter or the enhancer. Sp1 is composed of several functional domains, such as the inhibitory domain (ID), two serine/threonine-rich domains, two glutamine-rich domains, three C2H2-type zinc finger DNA binding domains (ZFDBD), and a C-terminal D domain. The ZDDBD is the most highly conserved domain among the Sp-family transcription factors and plays a critical role in GC-box recognition. In this study, we investigated the protein-protein interactions occurring at the Sp1ZFDBD and the Sp1ID, and the molecular mechanisms controlling the interaction. Our results found that Sp1ZFDBD and Sp1ID repressed transcription once they were targeted to the proximal promoter of the pGal4 UAS reporter fusion gene system, suggesting molecular interaction with the repressor molecules. Indeed, mammalian two-hybrid assays, GST fusion protein pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Sp1ZFDBD and Sp1ID are able to interact with corepressor proteins such as SMRT, NcoR, and BCoR. The molecular interactions appear to be regulated by MAP kinase/Erk kinase kinase (MEK). The molecular interactions between Sp1ID and the corepressor might explain the role of Sp1 as a repressor under certain circumstances. The siRNA-induced degradation of the corepressors resulted in an up-regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription. The cellular context of the corepressors and the regulation of molecular interaction between corepressors and Sp1ZFDBD or Sp1ID might be important in controlling Sp1 activity.

Sp1 and its family of proteins have been implicated in a host of essential biological processes, and have been proven important in apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, differentiation, and carcinogenesis (Refs. 3Kaczynski J.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238 (review): 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar and references therein). Sp1 is a member of the Sp-multigene family, which also includes Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, Sp5, Sp6, Sp7, and Sp8 (3Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R.

The Sp-family proteins exhibit similar domain structures and are evolutionarily closely related. All of these proteins possess highly conserved C2H2-type zinc finger DNA binding domains at their C termini, and all belong to the Krüppel-like zinc finger superfamily (3Kaczynski J. Cook T.

In addition, the Sp-family proteins have been demonstrated to undergo post-translational modifications as the result of diverse mechanisms. For example, Sp1 is glycosylated and phosphorylated by Erk2, protein kinase Cζ, casein kinase II, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Sp3 is acetylated and SUMOylated by the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS1, Ref. 3Kaczynski J.

These domains include the N-terminal inhibitory domain (amino acids 1-82, ID), serine/threonine-rich domains (amino acids 87-143; amino acids 243-350, Ser/Thr-rich region), glutamine-rich domains (amino acids 138-232; amino acids 351-500, Gln-rich region), the zinc finger DNA binding domain (amino acids 622-720, ZFDBD), and the C-terminal D domain (amino acids 721-788) (3Kaczynski J.

The Ser/Thr-rich region is regulated by phosphorylation and is crucial in the regulation of Sp1. The Gln-rich region, which has the essential characteristics of an acid-blob, has been implicated in transcriptional activation. The ZFDBD of Sp1 is the most highly conserved region among the Sp-family proteins. The D domain also plays an important role in the synergistic activation of Sp1 (11Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Sp1 binds to the GC boxes located in the proximal promoters or enhancers found in almost all genes (3Kaczynski J. Cook T.

In general, it acts as a transcriptional activator (and as a repressor in some cases), and the cellular context of the Sp-family is important with regard to the regulation of transcription (12Hagen G.

For example, Sp1 activates many different types of genes, including simian virus 40 (SV40), thymidine kinase (TK), and many mammalian housekeeping and tissue-specific genes (3Kaczynski J. Cook T.

To activate transcription, Sp1 also interacts with nuclear proteins such as the TATA-box-binding protein TBP, and the TBP-associated factors dTAFII130, hTAFII130, hTAFII55, and CRSP (a cofactor required for Sp1 activation). Sp1 also interacts with a variety of other transcription factors, such as the retinoblastoma-related proteins p107, YY1, E2F, HDAC1, p300, and FBI-1 (9Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M.

Currently, available data suggest that Sp1 acts mainly as a transcription activator, but also, in some cases, as a transcription repressor (Refs. 1Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R.

Indeed, many reports have implied that Sp1 and the Sp1-like transcription factors exhibit a bipolar character; i.e. they function as either transcription activators or repressors, depending on the promoter to which they bind and the coregulators with which they interact (1Briggs M.R.

Accordingly, it would appear that a certain mechanism exists for the regulation of Sp-family activities, functioning via these highly conserved domains, regardless of their properties as either transcription activators or repressors. Particular attention has been currently focused on the most highly conserved domain, the ZFDBD. It has been hypothesized that there is a reason, other than target recognition, for the high degree of conservation seen in the amino acid sequences of the ZFDBDs in the Sp-family transcription factors. It may interact with other regulatory proteins, and the protein involved in the interaction might function as a negative or positive regulator by controlling the GC-box target recognition of the Sp-family ZFDBDs. The molecular mechanism underlying the repressor functions of Sp1 in the expression of some genes remains uncertain. The molecular role of the N-terminal ID (inhibitory domain) present in full-length Sp1 cDNA has not yet been characterized, due both to the lack of full-length Sp1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_138473 XM_028606) and to the widely circulating truncated version of Sp1 originally cloned by the Tjian group (2Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 151: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA, containing the N-terminal ID, has been cloned only very recently (28; GenBank™ accession number NM_138473 XM_028606), and its ID may well play a role in the Sp1-mediated repression of transcription. In this study, we discovered that the ZFDBD and ID domains of Sp1 are involved in protein-protein interactions with the other transcription regulatory molecules: the corepressors SMRT, NCoR, and BCoR (29Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 31Zamir I.

We also determined that these interactions are important in the transcriptional regulation of Sp1. Our results indicate that these interactions could be regulated by MEK, a component of the MAP kinase/Erk kinase signaling pathway. Plasmid Construction—The mammalian expression plasmids for the Gal4-zinc finger domain (amino acids 622-720) fusion proteins or the inhibitory domain (amino acids 1-82) fusion proteins of Sp1 were constructed by subcloning the ZFDBD or ID cDNA into a pCMX-Gal4 fusion expression plasmid. The expression plasmids for the VP16-corepressors, the NCoR (amino acids 1709-2215), SMRT (amino acids 194-657), and BCoR (amino acids 112-753) fusion proteins (pKH73/110EF-NCoR, pKH135EF-BCoR), were kindly provided by Drs. Ronald Evans (The Salk Institute), Vivian Bardwell (University of Minnesota), and Dominique Leprince (Institut Pasteur de Lille) (29Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J.

To generate the GST fusion protein expression plasmids, the ZFDBD and the ID domains of Sp1 were subcloned into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). The mammalian expression plasmids were prepared by subcloning the cDNA fragments encoding for SMRT (amino acids 194-657), NCoR (amino acids 1709-2215), and BCoR (amino acids 112-753) into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) (29Huynh K.D.

Interactions between the Sp-family and its corepressors and reporter assays were assessed via the cloning of five tandem Sp1 binding sites (sense: 5′-CTAGCTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCG-3′; antisense: 5′-CTAGCGCTCGCCCCGCCCCGGATCGAG-3′) upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter in the vector, pG5-Luc (Promega), to generate pG5-5x(GC)-Luc. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The plasmids of the MAP kinase/Erk kinase signaling pathway were kindly provided by Dr. K.-Y. Choi of Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea). Cell Culture and Mammalian Two-hybrid Reporter Assays—African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin (Invitrogen). The cells were inoculated on 6-well tissue culture plates, at a density of 1× 105 cells/well in 2 ml of DMEM. After the cells had grown for 24 h, they were transiently transfected with the Gal4 fusion bait expression plasmid, the VP16 fusion effector plasmid, and the reporter plasmid, using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 3 h, the cells were supplied with fresh, complete DMEM, and allowed to grow for 48 additional hours. The cells were then harvested and lysed in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), vortexed for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The luciferase reporter assays were performed with 5 μl of cell extracts, using 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) on a luminometer (Microplate Luminometer LB 96V, EG&G Berthold). Luciferase activities were normalized to either the protein concentration or to β-galactosidase activity. The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined by the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sp1 Zinc Finger DNA Binding Domain Expression—A recombinant Sp1 zinc finger DNA binding domain expression vector was constructed by cloning the cDNA fragment encoding from amino acids 624 to 718 of Sp1 into pTrcHisB/Bam H1 (Invitrogen) to generate pTrcHisB-Sp1ZF. pTrcHisB-Sp1ZF was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by transformation and cultured at 18 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. E. coli were harvested and then lysed by sonication. Recombinant Sp1ZFWt polypeptide was purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic (NTA) acid bead column affinity chromatography. Site-directed Mutagenesis of pTrcHisB-Sp1ZF and pGal4-Sp1ZF—To investigate the role of each zinc finger of Sp1, mutations were introduced into the Sp1 zinc finger sequence of pTrcHisB-Sp1ZF or pGal4-Sp1ZF using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To introduce a mutation at the zinc fingers, the following oligonucleotides were used (only top strands are shown): zinc finger 1, amino acids 628 cysteine to serine, 5′-TTCGGTACCAAACAGCATATTAGCCACATCCAAGGCTG-3′; zinc finger 2, amino acids 658 cysteine to serine, 5′-GCGAGAGGCCATTTATGAGTACCTGGTCATACTG-3′; zinc finger 3, amino acids 688 cysteine to serine, GGTGAGAAGAAATTTGCCAGCCCTGAGTGTCCTAAG. Recombinant Sp1ZF mutant polypeptides were purified by Ni-NTA bead column affinity chromatography after overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were carried out as described previously (14Kwon H.-S. Kim M.-S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The sequences of Sp1 binding GC-box oligonucleotides are as follows: top strand, 5′-GATCATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; bottom strand, 5′-GATCGCTCGCCCCGCCCCGATCGAAT-3′. Each binding reaction was carried out in 20 μl and contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 7% glycerol, and recombinant Sp1 zinc finger wild-type or mutant proteins (0.1 μg). Where indicated, an antibody against Express epitope peptide (Invitrogen) was added to the EMSA binding mixture. GST Fusion Protein Purification, in Vitro Transcription and Translation of Corepressors—GST and GST fusion protein expression were induced in E. coli ER2566 via the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and with 5 h of incubation. The cells were lysed and purified with glutathione-agarose 4 bead affinity chromatography (Peptron, Daejeon, Korea). The purified proteins were then resolved with 10% SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro translated corepressor polypeptides were prepared by incubating the pcDNA3.0 corepressor expression plasmids (1 μg) with TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Extract (Promega), containing 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix, 4 μl of [35S]methionine (1175.0 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.), and 4 μl of amino acid mixture minus the methionine, at 30 °C for 90 min. Polypeptide expression levels were then analyzed by running 2 μl of the total mixture with 10% SDS-PAGE. GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assays—The purified GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with GSH-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h in HEMG buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol; and protease inhibitor mixture, 1 tablet/50 ml of a protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After the agarose-GST protein complexes had been washed three times with 1 ml of cold HEMG buffer, 20 μl of the [35S]methionine-labeled corepressors were incubated for 4 h in HEMG buffer at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed and washed five times with cold HEMG buffer. The bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the SDS-PAGE gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film using image-intensifying screens (Kodak). Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Full-length Sp1 Protein with Corepressors—HA and FLAG epitope-tagged full-length Sp1 expressed from Drosophila SL2 cells was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The [35S]methionine-labeled corepressors were prepared using the TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System. Sp1 (10 ng) and [35S]methionine-labeled corepressor proteins (10 μl each) were mixed together and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rotating rocker. The protein mixtures were incubated further with M2-anti-FLAG antibody-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. Protein-antibody-agarose complexes were precipitated, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled luciferase was used as a control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—We investigated whether in vivo molecular interaction between Sp1ID and corepressors on the UAS element on the pG5-Luc promoter could affect the histone acetylation status using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (33Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 34Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Subconfluent CV-1 cells on a 10-mm dish were transfected with pG5-UAS-Luc (2 μg) and pGal4, pGal4Sp1ZF, or pGal4-Sp1ID (3 μg) using Lipofectamine Plus and grown another 48 h. CV-1 cells were treated with formaldehyde (final 1%) to cross-link Gal4 or Gal4 fusion protein to the UAS of pG5-UAS-Luc DNA. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to a length between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with antibodies against acetylated histone (Upstate Biotechnology) or pre-immune serum overnight at 4 °C with rotation. To collect DNA-histone-antibody complex, a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation and pelleted in a DNA/protein A-agarose complex by brief centrifugation (700-1000 rpm) at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the pellet with various washing buffers recommended by the manufacturer, the pellet was dissolved with 250 μl of elution buffer and spun to remove agarose. Supernatant was treated with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and heated to 65 °C for 4 h to reverse Gal4 or Gal4 fusion polypeptide-DNA cross-link. After treatment with EDTA and proteinase K, the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to recover DNA. PCR reactions of immunoprecipitated DNA were carried out using the forward primer, 5′-GGATCCGAGTTTCTAGACGGAG-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-TTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′. Regulation of Molecular Interaction between the Sp1ZFDBD or Sp1ID and Corepressors—We examined whether the molecular interactions between the Sp1ZFDBD or Sp1ID and corepressors could be modulated by members of the MAP kinase/Erk kinase signaling pathways using the mammalian two-hybrid assays. The CV-1 cells were cotransfected with pG5-Luc (0.3 μg), the expression plasmids for pGal4-Sp1ZFDBD (0.25 μg), the VP16-corepressor (0.25 μg), β-galactosidase (0.1 μg), and various components of the MAP kinase/Erk kinase signaling pathway including MEK (0.3 μg). After 48 h of transfection with Lipofectamine Plus, the CV-1 cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was then normalized with β-galactosidase activity. We also tested whether MEK, a modulator of molecular interaction between Sp1ZFDBD or Sp1ID and the corepressors, could affect the transcription of the three Sp1-dependent promoter reporter fusion constructs. The pG5-5x(GC)-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg), the p21Waf/Cip1-Luc (0.2 μg), and the ADH5/FDH-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) were cotransfected into CV-1 cells, either with or without the expression plasmids of the constitutive activator (MEKCA), the dominant negative form (MEKDN) of MEK (0.8 μg), and pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.2 μg). The transfection and reporter assays were performed as described above. In addition, we also tested whether the Erk activator, EGF (50 ng/ml), or the U0126 MEK inhibitor (10 nm, Cell Signaling Technology) could affect the transcription of pG5-5x(GC)-Luc, p21Waf/Cip1-Luc, and ADH5/FDH-Luc. The CV-1 cells were transfected with pG5-5x(G"
https://openalex.org/W2031890687,"Although regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling by receptor kinases and arrestins is a well established biochemical process, the physiological significance of such regulation remains poorly understood. To better understand the in vivo consequences of arrestin function, we have examined the function of the sole arrestin in Caenorhabditis elegans (ARR-1). ARR-1 is primarily expressed in the nervous system, including the HSN neuron and various chemosensory neurons involved in detecting soluble and volatile odorants. arr-1 null mutants exhibit normal chemotaxis but have significant defects in olfactory adaptation and recovery to volatile odorants. In contrast, adaptation is enhanced in animals overexpressing ARR-1. Both the adaptation and recovery defects of arr-1 mutants are rescued by transgenic expression of wild-type ARR-1, whereas expression of a C-terminally truncated ARR-1 effectively rescues only the adaptation defect. A potential mechanistic basis for these findings is revealed by in vitro studies demonstrating that wild-type ARR-1 binds proteins of the endocytic machinery and promotes receptor endocytosis, whereas C-terminally truncated ARR-1 does not. These results demonstrate that ARR-1 functions to regulate chemosensory signaling, enabling organisms to adapt to a variety of environmental cues, and provide an in vivo link between arrestin, receptor endocytosis, and temporal recovery from adaptation.

Modification of behavior in response to environmental change is crucial to the survival of an organism. A wide variety of stimuli, including odorants, light, hormones, peptides, and neurotransmitters, are coordinated into specific behavior through the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ARR, arrestin; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; OE, overexpression; DiD, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ARR, arrestin; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; OE, overexpression; DiD, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt. (1Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Receptor activation promotes GDP/GTP exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins, and the subsequent dissociation of GαGTP and Gβγ subunits mediates signaling via activation of downstream effector molecules (2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). To ensure precise signal magnitude and duration, GPCR signaling cascades are tightly regulated by a complex process involving, in part, GPCR kinases and arrestins (3Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 4Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). GPCR kinases phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs, leading to recruitment of cytosolic arrestin, which in turn sterically inhibits GPCR/G protein interaction and terminates signaling, a regulatory process termed desensitization (3Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Many organisms adapt to stimuli upon prolonged exposure, and although it is often assumed that this physiological phenomenon is the manifestation of the molecular process of GPCR desensitization, little direct evidence supports this assumption. Attenuation of GPCR signaling represents a critical step in the ability of an organism to adapt to a constantly changing environment, and it also impacts the efficacy of pharmaceuticals that target GPCR-mediated signaling pathways. It is therefore of considerable interest to clarify the relationship between the molecular process of desensitization and the phenomenon of adaptation that occurs at the behavioral level of an organism.In mammals there are two classes of arrestin, visual and non-visual. Visual arrestins are expressed selectively in rod (arrestin-1) and cone (arrestin-4) photoreceptor cells and function to quench phototransduction. Non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 (β-arrestin-1) and arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2), are ubiquitously expressed and regulate the desensitization of many GPCRs (3Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Non-visual arrestins also interact with additional proteins that function to regulate receptor trafficking and signaling (4Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 5Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, the binding of the C-terminal region of non-visual arrestins to clathrin and the β-adaptin subunit of AP2 (β2-adaptin), the major protein components of clathrin-coated pits, appears critical for mediating GPCR endocytosis (6Goodman Jr., O.B.

Non-visual arrestins also activate mitogenic signaling pathways by acting as scaffolds to form complexes between receptor and various Src family members and mitogen-activated protein kinases, thereby providing a link between classical GPCR, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (4Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 9Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). A newly appreciated role for non-visual arrestins is in the regulation of receptors other than GPCRs, including various growth factor receptors (10Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C.

Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44238-44245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, non-visual arrestins are versatile adaptor proteins that play a broad role in regulating receptor signaling and trafficking.Much of the initial data delineating the role of arrestins in GPCR regulation emanated from early in vitro studies of rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor (13Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 14Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The visual system of Drosophila melanogaster provided the first in vivo data identifying a role for arrestin as a terminator of phototransduction and more recently as a trigger for apoptotic cell death and photoreceptor degradation (15Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although it is thought that non-visual arrestins play an important role in the regulation of receptor signaling in many organisms, there is a general lack of in vivo data to support this, mainly because of issues concerning functional redundancy and viability. For example, a loss of function in kurtz, the sole non-visual arrestin in Drosophila, results in lethality because of the loss of kurtz in the nervous system (17Roman G. He J. Davis R.L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, knockouts of the individual non-visual arrestins appear overtly normal with defects observed only when animals are challenged with agonist. Specifically, a loss of arrestin-2 leads to enhanced cardiac sensitivity to β-agonists, suggesting a role in β-adrenergic receptor desensitization (18Conner D.A. Mathier M.A. Mortensen R.M. Christe M. Vatner S.F. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas a loss of arrestin-3 results in enhanced morphine analgesia and attenuation of antinociceptive tolerance, suggesting a role in μ-opioid receptor desensitization (19Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). A double knock-out of arrestin-2 and -3 results in embryonic lethality, implying that non-visual arrestins play an important role in mouse development (20Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent study in Zebrafish revealed a role for arrestin-3 in signaling through Smoothened, a receptor that regulates development through hedgehog signaling (21Wilbanks A.M. Fralish G.B. Kirby M.L. Barak L.S. Li Y.X. Caron M.G. Science. 2004; 306: 2264-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies reveal that a complete loss of non-visual arrestin leads to severe developmental defects, whereas loss of individual arrestins primarily impact processes such as drug sensitivity and tolerance. Although these studies address the in vivo role of arrestins, the combination of functional redundancy and embryonic lethality in non-visual arrestin knock-out models has hindered mechanistic insight into the in vivo function of these proteins.In an effort to define further the biological role of non-visual arrestins and begin to correlate structural features with in vivo function, we initiated studies in Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is particularly useful for studying behaviors generated by GPCR pathways as G protein signaling regulates many behaviors, including egg laying, feeding, locomotion, and chemotaxis (22Roayaie K. Crump J.G. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 1998; 20: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Wilkie T.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R853-R856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Genomic analysis reveals the presence of ∼1200 GPCRs in C. elegans, many of which are thought to encode chemoreceptors (24Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Additional G protein signaling components include 20 G protein α subunits, 2 Gβ subunits, 2 Gγ subunits, 13 regulator of G protein signaling proteins, 2 GPCR kinases, and a single arrestin (24Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 25Jansen G. Thijssen K.L. Werner P. van der Horst M. Hazendonk E. Plasterk R.H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).Here we report the characterization of ARR-1, the C. elegans arrestin encoded by the arr-1 gene. ARR-1 is expressed throughout the nervous system, including various chemosensory neurons that detect volatile chemicals. Worms lacking ARR-1 display a number of defects in behaviors mediated by GPCR/G protein signaling, including defects in egg laying and odorant adaptation. Defects in odorant adaptation and recovery were rescued in transgenic animals expressing wild-type ARR-1. Most interestingly, adaptation, but not recovery, was rescued in transgenic animals expressing a C-terminally truncated ARR-1 that lacks residues that mediate binding to clathrin and β2-adaptin. The phenotypes reported here suggest that ARR-1 plays a broad role in GPCR regulation and serves as an important mediator of C. elegans behavior, specifically egg laying and chemosensation. We also demonstrate the importance of binding motifs required for interactions between non-visual arrestin and components of the endocytic machinery, providing the first in vivo data highlighting the importance of these interactions in physiological adaptation and recovery from prolonged stimulation of chemosensory pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Genetics—Worms were cultured using standard methods (26Brenner S.

Strains used in this study were as follows: N2 Bristol wild-type, RB660 arr-1(ok401) X, arr-1(vs96) X, JT734 goa-1(sa734) I, CX10 osm-9(ky10) IV, CX20 adp-1(ky20) II, and MT8190 lin-15(n765) X.Sequence Comparisons—Arrestin ortholog sequences were obtained from Wormbase and the NCBI data base using the following accession numbers: C. elegans arrestin (P51485); bovine arrestin-1 (P08168), arrestin-2 (P17870), and arrestin-3 (P32120); and D. melanogaster kurtz (AF221066), arrestin A (P15372), and arrestin B (P19107). Sequences were compared using BLAST and GCG network programs. Sequence alignments and dendrograms were generated using Clustal X.Isolation of arr-1 Mutant Alleles—The arr-1(vs96) mutant allele was isolated by screening a psoralen-mutagenized library representing ∼960,000 haploid genomes for mutations over 6 of the 10 predicted ARR-1 exons by PCR using gene-specific primers. The arr-1(ok401) deletion allele was obtained from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Knock-out Group of the C. elegans Gene Knock-out Consortium. Genomic DNA was isolated from both arr-1 alleles, and the arr-1 coding and predicted untranslated regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced on both strands using internal primers to determine break points. Mutants were outcrossed to the N2 background at least eight times before use in behavioral assays.Molecular Biology and Plasmid Construction—Subcloning and general DNA manipulations were performed as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The full-length arr-1 cDNA clone yk371g9 was obtained from Dr. Yuji Kohara and sequenced using internal primers. Cosmid F53H8.2 was obtained from the Sanger Centre, and the arr-1 genomic region was sequenced using internal primers.For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from wild-type and arr-1(vs96) and arr-1(ok401) mutant animals by Trizol extraction (Invitrogen). RNA was subjected to electrophoresis and blotting using the NorthernMax system (Ambion) and then probed with a 32P-labeled arr-1 cDNA.The arr-1::GFP fusion construct was prepared by PCR using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science). ∼6.2 kb of the arr-1 region was amplified from cosmid F53H8.2, including the entire genomic sequence encoding ARR-1 and 3 kb of sequence upstream of the predicted start site to serve as an endogenous promoter. BamHI and PstI sites were engineered into the primers and were used to insert the amplified product into the pPD95.77 GFP vector (gift from A. Fire). For animals overexpressing ARR-1, ∼7.2 kb of arr-1 genomic sequence was amplified from cosmid F53H8.2 using Expand polymerase, including ∼3.2 kb of arr-1 genomic coding sequence, ∼3 kb of sequence upstream of the predicted start site to serve as an endogenous promoter, and ∼1 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence. XhoI and PstI sites were engineered into the primers and were used to insert the amplified product into the pBluescript II SK+/– vector. The ODR-3::WT and ODR-3::1–368 constructs for the rescue experiments were generated by amplifying full-length and truncated (encoding residues 1–368) arr-1 cDNAs by PCR using primers that contained 5′ NcoI sites for subcloning into vector pPD49.26, which contains ∼2.7 kb of the odr-3 promoter (22Roayaie K. Crump J.G. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 1998; 20: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), kindly provided by C. Bargmann.Transgenic Animals—Germ line transformations were performed as described previously (28Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The arr-1::GFP and arr-1 pBluescript II SK+/– constructs were injected at 80 ng/μl as a mix with lin-15 DNA (50 ng/μl) as co-injection marker into the gonads of lin-15(n765ts) animals. Transgenic lines were identified by rescue of the lin-15 multivulva phenotype at 20 °C. The ODR-3::WT and ODR-3::1–368 constructs were injected at 80 ng/μl as a mix with lin-15 DNA (50 ng/μl) as co-injection marker into the gonads of arr-1(ok401);lin-15(n765ts) animals. Transgenic lines were identified by rescue of the lin-15 multivulva phenotype at 20 °C. Multiple independent transgenic lines were established from both injections.Antibodies and Immunohistochemistry—A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the C-terminal 114 amino acids of ARR-1 was used to immunize rabbits. Antibodies were purified as described previously (29Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-ARR-1 antibodies from sera were bound to nitrocellulose containing a maltose-binding protein-ARR-1 fusion protein, eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, and then further purified by pre-absorbing against an acetone precipitate from a C. elegans arr-1(ok401) lysate. An anti-peptide antibody directed against residues 289–304 of C. elegans ARR-1 (CPLLSNNKDKRGLALD) was generated by New England Peptide, Inc. The antibody was affinity-purified on a peptide column and then incubated with an acetone precipitate from a C. elegans arr-1(ok401) lysate before use. C. elegans total protein lysates were prepared from washed worm pellets (wild-type, ok401, and vs96) by sonication with lysis buffer. For Western blot analysis, ARR-1 protein was visualized using the purified anti-ARR-1 antibodies, a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and chemiluminescent detection using ECL (Pierce).Whole mounts of C. elegans for antibody staining were prepared as described (30Finney M. Ruvkun G. Cell. 1990; 63: 895-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Purified anti-ARR-1 antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution and were incubated with specimens overnight at room temperature. Secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution) were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit. Secondary antibody incubations were for 1 h at room temperature. Images were collected by using confocal microscopy and MetaMorph software.Egg-laying Assays—Egg-laying rates were assayed as described previously (29Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Both assays were performed on staged adult animals that were isolated as late L4 animals and allowed to develop for 36 h at 20 °C. To quantify the number of unlaid eggs, 30 staged adults were individually dissolved in 50 μl of a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, and the remaining eggs were counted using an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert). To quantify the developmental stage of freshly laid eggs, 30 staged adults were transferred to a clean seeded nematode growth media plate and allowed to lay eggs for 30 min at 20 °C. The developmental stage of each freshly laid egg was then determined by viewing under a high magnification dissecting microscope. Values represent the percent mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.Chemotaxis, Adaptation, and Recovery Assays—Chemotaxis assays were performed as described in Bargmann et al. (31Bargmann C.I. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 515-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Adaptation assays were performed as described in L'Etoile and Bargmann (32L'Etoile N.D. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2000; 25: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Animals were incubated in S-Basal or S-Basal plus 800 μl of isoamyl alcohol/liter, 60 μl of benzaldehyde/liter, or 100 μl of diacetyl/liter for 1 h, washed, and then tested for chemotaxis toward a point source of adapting odorant (1 μl of isoamyl alcohol (diluted 1:100 in ethanol), benzaldehyde (diluted 1:200) or diacetyl (diluted 1:1000) plus 1 μl of 1 m sodium azide). Chemotaxis time course assays were performed as described in Bargmann et al. (31Bargmann C.I. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 515-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) with the exception that worms were allowed to chemotax toward 1 μl of diluted odorant (isoamyl alcohol 1:100, benzaldehyde 1:200, or diacetyl 1:1000 in ethanol) or control (ethanol) point sources with no sodium azide for 120 min with a chemotaxis index calculated every 20 min.To assess recovery from adaptation, two different assays were performed. The first is a modification of the standard adaptation assay. Briefly, animals were incubated in S-Basal or S-Basal plus 800 μl of isoamyl alcohol/liter for 40 min. Animals were washed free of odorant and then allowed to recover in 1 ml of S-Basal for 40 min. Animals were then assayed for their ability to chemotax toward adapting odorant (1 μl of 1:100 isoamyl diluted in ethanol plus azide). The second assay is a modification of the standard chemotaxis assay. Animals were allowed to chemotax toward 1 μl of diluted odorant (1:100 isoamyl alcohol diluted in ethanol) or control (ethanol) point sources with no sodium azide on chemotaxis assay plates. The number of animals at each point source and the total number of animals on the plate were counted after 40 min, and then 1 μl of adapting odorant (1 μl of isoamyl alcohol diluted 1:100 in ethanol plus 1 μl of 1 m sodium azide) was applied to the same chemotaxis assay plate near the original control point source. Animals were tested for chemotaxis toward the new adapting odorant for 1 h. The recovery index was then calculated by subtracting the number of animals at the original odorant point source from the number of animals at the new odorant point source and then dividing this number by the total number of worms on the plate.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Transient transfection was done using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Receptor Internalization Assay—Internalization of FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously with some minor modifications (8Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and various arrestin constructs were split into poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates after 24 h. The next day (48 h post-transfection), cells were treated with 10 μm (–)-isoproterenol and 0.1 mm ascorbate at 37 °C for 15 min, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5 min at ambient temperature, and washed three times with TBS. Cells were then blocked with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (TBS/bovine serum albumin) for 45 min, incubated with a primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in TBS/bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, and washed three times with TBS. Colorimetric visualization of antibody binding was performed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad), and samples were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader using Microplate Manager software (Bio-Rad). The reading from cells that did not express FLAG-β2AR was used as a blank, and the percentage of surface receptor loss was determined by calculating the change in antibody-accessible FLAG-β2AR.Analysis of ARR-1 Interaction with β2-Adaptin and Clathrin—A GST-β2-adaptin appendage (residues 700–937) fusion protein and a GST-clathrin terminal domain (residues 1–579) fusion protein were expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose previously as described (8Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HA-tagged wild-type ARR-1 and ARR-1-(1–368) were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection. ARR-1 extracts were prepared by lysing the cells by Polytron disruption in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine. The extracts were centrifuged (19,000 rpm for 20 min), and the supernatants were frozen at –80 °C until needed. Arrestin-containing lysates were incubated with 5 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (containing ∼10 μg of bound GST or GST fusion protein) in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C (in a total volume of 100 μl). The beads were pelleted (1000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C) and washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and bound ARR-1 was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 10 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and ARR-1 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled horse anti-mouse secondary antibody and chemiluminescence.RESULTSarr-1 Encodes a Non-visual-like Arrestin—The C. elegans arrestin gene arr-1 encodes a protein of 435 amino acids. ARR-1 shares the highest degree of similarity with the Drosophila non-visual arrestin kurtz (70% amino acid similarity) and the two mammalian non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 (65% similarity) and arrestin-3 (64% similarity) (Fig. 1A). The crystal structures of bovine arrestin-1 and -2 reveal that arrestins are composed of two major domains that are held together by a polar core of buried salt bridges (33Han M. Gurevich V.V.

Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Alignment of ARR-1 with bovine arrestin-1, -2, and -3 indicates that ARR-1 contains many of the structural features found in arrestin family members (Fig. 1B), including the polar core, a partially conserved clathrin-binding box, a β2-adaptin binding domain, and two proline-rich motifs in the C-terminal region that may mediate SH3 domain binding (7Laporte S.A.

It has been suggested that disruption of the polar core by interaction with phosphorylated receptor promotes structural changes in arrestin resulting in an active conformation (34Hirsch J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2157168361,"Endotoxin-treated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were recently shown to release high amounts of prostacyclin (PGI2) dependent on the induction of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2). In contrast to endothelial PGI2-synthase, for which nitration and inhibition by peroxynitrite was reported, addition of SIN-1 as a peroxynitrite-generating system did not cause inhibition but rather doubled PGI2 release by VSMC. The hypothesis of peroxynitrite supplementing an unsaturated peroxide tone for PGHS-2 was supported by H2O2 exerting the same effect. Studies performed with purified PGHS-2 revealed maximal elevation of enzyme activity in the presence of equimolar concentrations of *NO and *O2-, which together form peroxynitrite, while excessive production of either one radical was inhibitory. Most importantly, 6-keto-PGF1alpha formation by intact VSMC depended on a nearly equimolar generation of *NO and *O2- for providing the endogenous peroxide tone. These findings, together with the observation that an excess of exogenously added *NO, as well as uric acid as a scavenger of peroxynitrite potently reduced PGI2 release, underlined the role of peroxynitrite as the dominating and rate-limiting intracellular mediator of peroxide tone in VSMC. The results allow us to postulate a new cross-talk between the *NO and the prostanoid pathways with a crucial role for peroxynitrite in providing the peroxide tone for a continuous activation of PGHS-2."
https://openalex.org/W2026994755,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; also known as human herpesvirus 8) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, an endothelial neoplasm. This γ-herpesvirus encodes for several unique proteins that alter target cell function, including the virion envelope-associated glycoprotein B (gB). Glycoprotein B has an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif at the extracellular amino terminus region and binds to the α3β1 surface integrin, which enhances virus entry. We now report that gB can activate the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells and trigger receptor signaling, which can modulate endothelial migration and proliferation. Furthermore, we observed that VEGFR-3 expression and activation enhance KSHV infection and participate in KSHV-mediated transformation. These functional changes in the endothelium may contribute to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and suggest that interventions that inhibit gB activation of VEGFR-3 could be useful in the treatment of this neoplasm.

Viral DNA has been found in KS lesions from patients with all forms of the disease, namely AIDS-KS, classic KS, African endemic KS, and transplantation-associated KS. KS is most commonly found in the dermis but also occurs in viscera including lungs, liver, and intestines (1Antman K. Chang Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 2Moore P.S. Chang Y. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 609-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The KSHV genome encodes over 85 genes, of which <10% are expressed during latent infection (3Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In KS tissues, KSHV infection is localized to KS spindle cells, the majority of which are latently infected. A small subpopulation, however, is lytically infected. Recent evidence suggests that both latency and lytic infection contribute importantly to KS pathogenesis (5Martin D.F. Kuppermann B.D.

KSHV encodes for several biologically active proteins, including the virion envelope-associated glycoprotein B (gB or ORF-8) (4Sarid R. Flore O. Bohenzky R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the herpesvirus gB genes characterized to date, only the KSHV gB has the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif (amino acids 27–29), which is at the extracellular amino-terminal region after the putative signal sequence. This RGD sequence appears to be highly conserved among the KSHV strains analyzed from different geographical regions (8Meng Y.X. Spira T.J. Bhat G.J. Birch C.J. Cruce J.D. Edlin B.R. Edwards R. Gunthel R. Newton R. Stamey F.R. Wood C. Pellett P.E. Virology. 1999; 261: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The RGD amino acids constitute the minimal region of several extracellular matrix proteins required for interaction with certain cell surface integrins. The RGD motif is the most common integrin recognition motif, but other RGD-independent integrin recognition motifs have also been reported (9Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Eto K. Huet C. Tarui T. Kupriyanov S. Liu H.Z. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Zhang X.P. Sheppard D. Engvall E. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Recently, a gB disintegrin-like domain has been identified in the envelope glycoprotein B of the human cytomegalovirus by analysis of its sequence (11Feire A.L. Koss H. Compton T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15470-15475Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This gB disintegrin-like domain is highly conserved in most herpesviruses including KSHV, which suggests that other possible interactions may be recruited in KSHV entry and KSHV-mediated signaling pathways beyond the RGD motif. Furthermore, unlike the gB protein of Epstein-Barr virus, KSHV gB is expressed on the surface of the infected cell membrane and on the virion envelope (12Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 284: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Pertel P.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4390-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Envelope-associated KSHV gB is composed of 75- and 54-kDa polypeptides forming disulfide-linked heterodimers and multimers and binds to heparan sulfate-like molecules on the cell surface (12Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 284: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this way, ubiquitous host cell surface heparan sulfate-like molecules may serve as attachment receptors (15Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 282: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). KSHV envelope gB not only binds heparan sulfate through a conserved region found in most of the herpesvirus gBs (16Shukla D. Spear P.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) but also specifically binds integrin α3β1 through its unique RGD motif (17Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The integrin α3β1, a receptor for laminin 5 and possibly for fibronectin, is expressed abundantly in endothelial cells (18Wu C. Chung A.E. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2511-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johansson S. Svineng G. Wennerberg K. Armulik A. Lohikangas L. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It is localized in the cell-cell junctions of the endothelium and regulates cell motility in wound repair assays (20Yanez-Mo M. Alfranca A. Cabanas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de L. azuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that KSHV also uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and creates a low pH intracellular environment to facilitate infection (21Akula S.M. Naranatt P.P. Walia N.S. Wang F.Z. Fegley B. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7978-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). KS spindle cells are believed to be of lymphatic endothelial origin. Infection by KSHV and virus-induced transformation of the endothelium are key steps in the development of KS. VEGFR-3 (also known as Flt-4) is robustly expressed on the lymphatic endothelium. This receptor mediates signal transduction after engagement of its cognate ligands, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, through a cascade of phosphorylation events. Like VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-2/Flk-1, VEGFR-3 is a member of a subfamily of class III receptor tyrosine kinases characterized by seven extracellular Ig-like domains and a split intracellular domain containing kinase activity. These three receptors have ∼31–36% amino acid identity in their extracellular ligand binding domains (22Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Korhonen J. Kaipainen A. Pertovaara L. Alitalo R. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5738-5743PubMed Google Scholar, 23Galland F. Karamysheva A. Pebusque M.J. Borg J.P. Rottapel R. Dubreuil P. Rosnet O. Birnbaum D.

Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE21Google Scholar). Two isoforms of VEGFR-3 have been described, a short form and long form. The difference between the isoforms arises by alternative splicing in the carboxyl terminus. The long form is the predominant form in most tissues in humans (24Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Armstrong E. Morris S. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2931-2937PubMed Google Scholar). VEGFR-3 is a highly glycosylated protein and migrates as bands with different molecular masses, specifically an ∼175-kDa precursor, an ∼195-kDa mature form, an ∼140-kDa non-glycosylated backbone, and a form that appears to be partially cleaved proteolytically in the extracellular domain to produce an ∼125-kDa species (24Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Armstrong E. Morris S. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2931-2937PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Pelicci G. Weich H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable evidence indicates that VEGFR-3 and its ligands, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, regulate lymphangiogenesis. In the early stages of development, VEGFR-3 is widely expressed in vascular endothelial cells (27Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Mustonen T. Van Hinsbergh V. W.M. Fang G.H. Dumont D. Breitman M. Alitalo K.

Med. 1993; 178: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the VEGFR-3 gene leads to disorganization in the large vessels, resulting in an embryo that dies of cardiovascular failure (29Dumont D. Jussila L. Taipale J. Lymboussaki A. Mustonen T. Pajusola K. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Science. 1998; 282: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, later in development and in the adult, VEGFR-3 expression becomes restricted mainly to lymphatic vessels (27Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Mustonen T. Van Hinsbergh V. W.M. Fang G.H. Dumont D. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). VEGFR-3 signaling involves the interaction of several downstream molecules including adaptor proteins (26Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Pelicci G. Weich H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fournier E. Dubreuil P. Birnbaum D. Borg J.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 921-931PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fournier E. Rosnet O. Marchetto S. Turck C.W.

Expression of VEGFR-3 is increased in KS spindle cells, and its ligand, VEGF-C, stimulates the migration and proliferation of KS cells in vitro (37Jussila L. Valtola R. Partanen T.A. Salven P.

Histopathological studies indicate that KSHV LANA-1 (latent nuclear antigen 1) and VEGFR-3 co-localize in nodular KS (39Dupin N. Fisher C. Kellam P. Ariad S. Tulliez M. Franck N. van Marck E. Salmon D. Gorin I. Escande J.P. Weiss R.A. Alitalo K. Boshoff C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4546-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Akula et al. reported that the integrin α3β1 and its associated signaling pathways are important in KSHV entry into target cells (17Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 21Akula S.M. Naranatt P.P. Walia N.S. Wang F.Z. Fegley B. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7978-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). KSHV gB can mediate cell adhesion via its RGD sequence as well as activate focal adhesion components such as FAK and paxillin (14Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that KSHV gB regulates integrin-dependent FAK, Src, PI 3-kinase, and Rho GTPase signaling pathways and modulates cytoskeletal rearrangements, which are critical for KS pathogenesis (40Sharma-Walia N. Naranatt P.P. Krishnan H.H. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4207-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that KSHV gB-induced signaling pathways may play important roles in the infection of target cells and in KS pathogenesis. We now report that KSHV gB can activate VEGFR-3 on the microvascular endothelium and modulate endothelial cell migration and proliferation via an interaction between the α3β1 integrin and the VEGFR-3 receptor. Our studies also show that the activation of VEGFR-3 facilitates KSHV infection and fosters subsequent transformation. This novel mechanism of virus activation of a key lymphatic endothelial receptor could contribute to the pathogenesis of KS. Cells—Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC; adult) were purchased from Clonetics Inc. (San Diego, CA) and maintained in endothelial basal medium 2 (EBM-2) with EGM-2MV SingleQuots. Recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-KSHV-carrying BCBL-1 cells (GFP-BCBL-1) were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Vieira (Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). BJAB is a line of KSHV and Epstein-Barr virus negative human B cells. These cell lines were grown as described previously (17Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 41Vieira J. O'Hearn P. Kimball L. Chandran B. Corey L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 293 human embryonic kidney cells and 293 cells stably transfected with VEGFR-3 (293/VEGFR-3) were obtained from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies—The anti-VEGFR-3 monoclonal antibody hF4-3C5 was from ImClone Systems (New York, NY). Rabbit anti-human VEGFR-3 polyclonal antibody was from Genentech Inc. Mouse anti-human VEGFR-3 monoclonal antibody was from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). A neutralizing anti-α3 antibody and purified normal mouse IgG were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Rabbit anti-Flt-4 (VEGFR-3) polyclonal antibody, mouse polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, rabbit anti-ERK antibody, mouse anti-phospho-ERK antibody, and goat anti-α3 antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-Akt antibody and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser) antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody and anti-phospho-EGFR antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Isolation—HMVECs were incubated with a rabbit or mouse anti-human VEGFR-3 antibody for 1 h. After washing with 1× PBS, VEGFR-3-expressing cells were isolated using MACS colloidal superparamagnetic MicroBeads conjugated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated cells were cultured and expanded in the medium described above. For immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, cultured cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% BSA in PBS and then washed and resuspended in PBS containing 1.0% normal goat serum. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, cells were incubated with anti-VEGFR-3 antibody or isotype control for 60 min on ice. Primary antibodies were detected by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cellular fluorescence was analyzed on a FACScan™ flow cytometer. Cell Transfection—Plasmids containing wild-type VEGFR-3, dominant negative G857R mutant VEGFR-3, or pRK5 vector were used as described (35Wang J.F. Zhang X.F. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 60% confluence on tissue culture dishes. Transfections were done using Super Effectene transfection reagent according to the supplier's manual (Qiagen). A GFP-labeled pRK5 vector (BD Biosciences) was used as a parallel control to check for transfection efficiency as described (42Guo C.H. Janovick J.A. Kuphal D. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At 3 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with 1× PBS, cultured in medium with 10% fetal calf serum, grown for 48 h, and then treated as indicated. The transfection efficiency was determined to be ∼30–40% by counting green fluorescent cells under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300, Tokyo, Japan) Virus Preparation and Real Time DNA PCR—GFP-BCBL-1 cells were grown to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, induced with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate at 20 ng/ml, and grown for 5 days. To harvest the virus, cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was next removed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 h. The pellet was resuspended in one one-hundredth growth volume with complete media and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then used for virus inoculation and stimulation (17Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 41Vieira J. O'Hearn P. Kimball L. Chandran B. Corey L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed to quantify the viral DNA. Total viral DNA from purified KSHV samples was prepared using the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit. The specific LANA-1 (ORF-73) primers, TaqMan probe, and the external KSHV LANA-1 gene standards have been described previously (43Krishnan H.H. Naranatt P.P. Smith M.S. Zeng L. Bloomer C. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3601-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The QuantiTect Probe PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to perform real time PCR, and the assays followed a protocol reported previously (44Naranatt P.P. Krishnan H.H. Svojanovsky S.R. Bloomer C. Mathur S. Chandran B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to plot a standard graph and calculate the relative copy numbers of viral DNA in the samples. Target cells were exposed to KSHV with a multiplicity of infection of 5–6 viral DNA copies per cell for stimulation or infection. The BJAB cells were treated in the same way with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, as were the GFP-BCBL-1 cells, and supernatants were prepared as negative controls. Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Recombinant wild-type KSHV gBΔTM and a control gB protein, gBΔTM-RGA, which is mutated so that it contains an RGA sequence instead of RGD, have been described previously (14Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 4–6 h in serum-free media. To inhibit phosphotyrosine phosphatases, cells were preincubated for 10 min with 0.5 mm Na3VO4 and then stimulated with gBΔTM, gBΔTM-RGA, or VEGF-C (R&D Systems) as indicated. After stimulation, cell lysates were collected and used for the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays as described previously (35Wang J.F. Zhang X.F. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Radioiodination and Binding Assays—Recombinant VEGF-C (carrier-free) was from R&D Systems. This mutant of human VEGF-C containing a C156S substitution is a selective agonist of VEGFR-3 and does not bind VEGFR-2. 125I-gBΔTM (66.4 μCi/μg), 125I-gBΔTM-RGA (27.3 μCi/μg), and 125I-VEGF-C (129 μCi/μg) were radioiodinated by PerkinElmer Life Sciences using the Iodogen method. 293/VEGFR-3 cells were washed twice in ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.15% gelatin and 25 mm HEPES). Duplicate samples (2 ×106 cells in 200 ml) were incubated with 0.1 nm 125I-gBΔTM or 125I-gBΔTM-RGA with or without the indicated concentrations of unlabeled proteins. Unlabeled HIV-1 gp120 protein from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reagent Program was used as a negative control. Similarly, cells were incubated with 0.1 nm 125I-VEGF-C for 1 h at room temperature as reported previously (45Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L. Noonan D. Salio M. Camussi G. Rockl W. Bussolino F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 46Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Unlabeled VEGF-C, KSHV gBΔTM, or KSHV gBΔTM-RGA was added to the cells immediately before the radiolabeled ligand was added. Unlabeled VEGF (R&D Systems) was used as a negative control. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA, cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and the counts per minute of the released 125I-gBΔTM, 125I-gBΔTM-RGA, or 125I-VEGF-C were measured in a γ counter (Beckman Gamma 5500). The percent binding of the 125I-labeled proteins was then calculated. Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed in triplicate using 24-well transwell plates with 5-μm pore filters (Costar, Boston, MA). The lower side of each filter was coated with 25 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °Cand then rinsed with migration medium (RPMI 1640 with 0.5% BSA), and the supernatant was aspirated immediately before loading the cells. Cells (∼80% confluent) were harvested by releasing them from flasks with 5 mm EDTA. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and one time with migration medium, pre-incubated with anti-α3 and anti-VEGFR-3 (hF4-3C5) or with their isotype controls for 30 min at 4 °C, and then loaded into the upper chamber of the inserts (0.1 ml, 2 × 105 cells/ml). The inserts were transferred to another well containing 650 μl of migration medium in the absence or presence of gBΔTM, gBΔTM-RGA, or VEGF-C. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 100% humidity for 3 h. Non-migrated cells were removed from the upper chambers by wiping the upper surface with a cotton tip applicator, and the migrated cells on the under surface were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik® stain kit (Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, IL). The number of migrated cells was counted in 10 randomly selected high power (200×) fields per insert. No cells were found in the lower chambers where the inserts were placed. The migration index was calculated by dividing the number of cells migrated in response to stimulus by the number of spontaneously migrated cells. Proliferation Assay—Cells were collected with 5 mm EDTA and washed twice with 1× PBS and twice with proliferation medium (EBM-2 with 2% fetal calf serum). The cells were next pre-incubated with hF4-3C5 (2 μg/ml) or its isotype control for 30 min at 4 °C and then plated onto 96-well plates at 3,000 cells/well in the absence or presence of gBΔTM, gBΔTM-RGA, or VEGF-C as indicated and allowed to grow for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by the Biotrak™ cell proliferation ELISA system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Viral Infection, Flow Cytometry Analysis, and Immunoperoxidase Staining—Sixty percent confluent cells were either mock-infected or infected with GFP-KSHV in 24-well plates at 37 °C for 3 h and then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days with growth medium. KSHV infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5–6 KSHV copies per cell. Green fluorescent cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300; 200× magnification) or detached by 5 mm EDTA in PBS and analyzed on a FACScan™ flow cytometer. After green fluorescent cells were counted, cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and immunoperoxidase staining was performed with anti-LANA-1 (ORF-73; Advanced Biotechnology Inc., Columbia, MD) antibody by using the VECTASTAIN® ABC system and the DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Brown staining appeared in the nucleus of KSHV-infected cells. Cell Transformation Assay—HMVECs were exposed to KSHV or mock controls and then cultured in the presence of hF4-3C5 (1 μg/ml) or antibody control in soft agar medium for 21 days following the protocol provided by Chemicon International Inc. After this incubation period, colonies were analyzed morphologically using cell-staining solution. Cytokine ELISA—The supernatant was collected and assayed for VEGF-C and VEGF-D production by using the VEGF-C ELISA kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and the human VEGF-D immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's manual. Data Presentation and Analyses—Each experiment has been repeated at least three times, and representative blots, images, or graphs are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Statistical significance was determined using the analysis of variance test (p < 0.05).Fig. 2Akt and ERK1/2 MAPK are activated by gB. HMVECs were transfected with the G857R mutant VEGFR-3 or with vector alone. After 48 h of transfection, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with gBΔTM (10 nm) or VEGF-C (250 ng/ml) for 15 min. Total cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The phosphorylation of Akt was examined by Western blotting (WB) with an anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (A, top). The blot was then probed with an anti-Akt antibody (A, bottom). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK was examined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (B, top). The blot was then probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (B, bottom), as indicated.

The most evolved mutant is able to discriminate against 5β- or 5α-dihydroprogesterone, 23 and 15 times better than the starting antibody, while maintaining the affinity for progesterone that remains in the picomolar range. The high level of homology with anti-progesterone monoclonal antibody DB3 allowed the construction of three-dimensional models of P15G12C12G11 based on the structures of DB3 in complex with various steroids. These models together with binding data, derived from site-directed mutagenesis, were used to build a phage library in which five first sphere positions in complementarity-determining regions 2H and 3L were varied. Variants selected by an initial screening in competition against a large excess of 5β- or 5α-dihydroprogesterone were characterized by a convergent amino acid signature different from that of the wild-type antibody and had lower cross-reactivity. Binding properties of this first set of mutants were further improved by the addition of second sphere mutations selected independently from an error-prone library. The three-dimensional models of the best variant show changes in the antigen binding site that explain well the increase in selectivity. The improvements are partly linked to a change in the canonical class of the light chain third hypervariable loop.

The improvements are partly linked to a change in the canonical class of the light chain third hypervariable loop. Progesterone is among the most important steroid hormones required for the maintenance of pregnancy. Its dosage is currently performed by immunoassay, and its quantification needs high quality antibodies (1Savouret J.F. Misrahi M. Milgrom E. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, steroids are poorly immunogenic, and thus it is difficult to obtain monoclonal antibodies, particularly with high affinity and specificity. This is complicated by the fact that immunoassays must be carried out in complex media such as blood or urine, where the compound of interest must be quantified in the presence of other chemically related molecules. The contaminating progesterone-related derivatives are characterized by modifications at positions C-3, C-5, C-11, and C-17, which induce different conformations of the steroid skeleton (2Chen J. Wang R. Taussig M. Houk K.N. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 3021-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, C-5α and C-5β are ring A reduced conformers. Although progesterone adopts the so-called conformation A, where ring A is ∼45° to the plane formed by rings B, C, and D, the addition of a proton at position C-5 results in conformations B or C (Fig. 1A). In conformation B, typical of C-5α, ring A is coplanar with the other rings, whereas in conformation C, adopted by C-5β, ring A is at 90° to the plane of the rest of the steroid skeleton (3Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Rohrer D.C. Weeks C.M. Lipids. 1980; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Given these structural differences, it is surprising to find that after stimulation with progesterone, the immune system responds with antibodies like DB3 which strongly cross-react with C-5 dihydro-derivatives such as 5β-androstane-3–17-dione, aetiocholanolone (C-5β), and 5α-pregnane-3-β-hemisuccinate (4Arevalo J.H. Hassig C.A. Stura E.A. Sims M.J. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The structural basis for its cross-reactivity has been mapped to the binding of steroids in two different orientations using two alternative pockets P3 and P3′. The entire binding site of DB3 can be divided into four different pockets or compartments named P1, P2, P3, and P3′ accommodating the different steroid rings (see Fig. 1C) (4Arevalo J.H. Hassig C.A. Stura E.A. Sims M.J. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Rings D, C, and B of progesterone and C-5 dihydro-derivatives are fit in P1 and P2, whereas ring A of C-5α or C-5β derivatives uses P3 or P3′, respectively. Progesterone and C-5α analogs that interact in a syn conformation (with their methyl groups facing TrpH50) place their ring A in pocket P3, whereas C-5β derivatives that adopt an anti-orientation (with their methyl groups facing TrpH100) position their ring A in P3′. The use of alternative binding pockets also comports small compensatory adjustments in the binding site residues to improve shape complementarity. Monoclonal antibody P15G12C12G11 (referred to as C12G11 hereafter) has a high affinity for progesterone with a Kd of 20 pm. Its specificity, as evaluated in competitive immunoassays using biotinylated progesterone and various steroids analogs, includes a strong affinity for 5β- and 5α-dihydroprogesterone (DHP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHP, dihydroprogesterone; CDR, complementarity-determining region; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; H and L preceding a number indicate heavy and light chain position; His6, hexahistidine; VH, variable heavy; VL, variable light; fd, VH and CH1 heavy domains; EMC, ethyl methyl carbonyl. with 30 and 20% of cross-reactivity, respectively. To develop a sensitive and highly specific in vitro immunoassay, we initiated a protein-engineering program with the aim of reducing the cross-reaction with these two analogs while maintaining its subnanomolar affinity for progesterone. The difficulties presented by such a project are associated with the lack of distinctive chemical groups that could be used to differentiate among these three compounds. With the only distinguishing features being the three-dimensional structures that these progesterone derivatives adopt, the outcome of the search for variants possessing the right binding combination appeared difficult. The high homology with DB3 allowed the construction of models of our antibody, enabling us to plan a strategy of reengineering the combining site of C12G11 using combined semirational and random mutagenesis to select by phage display mutants with the desired characteristics. We present here the strategy we used and the fine characterization of the selected mutants. Models of the best variant were built and compared with that of wild-type C12G11 to account tentatively for the structural basis for the improved binding. Cloning and Construction of scFvC12G11—Hybridoma cells producing C12G11 were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber. Cloning and sequencing of mRNA encoding the light chain and the fd heavy chain of C12G11 were done as previously described (6Bettsworth F. Monnet C. Watelet B. Battail-Poirot N. Gilquin B. Jolivet M.

DNA encoding the scFvC12G11 (VL-linker-VH) was generated by PCR-based single overlap extension (7Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar), using an 18-amino acid linker derived from the one initially described by Whitlow et al. (8Whitlow M. Bell B.A. Feng S.L.

Construction of scFv Libraries—Wild-type scFvC12G11 DNA was cloned into the phagemid pAK100 (10Krebber A. Bornhauser S. Burmester J. Honegger A. Willuda J. Bosshard H.R. Pluckthun A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and used as template to build the libraries. A first library named 3L/2H was designed by overlap PCR via simultaneous saturation mutagenesis at positions L94, L95, L96 (CDR3L), H50, and H58 (CDR2H). PCR A was obtained using primer pAK100-For 5′-GTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGG-3′ in combination with a mixture 30/70 (mol/mol) of primers CDR3L94/95/96-Back 5′-GCTTGGTCCCAGCACCGAACGT(MNN)3ATGTGTACTTTGAGAGCAGAAATAG-3′ and CDR3L94/96-Back 5′-GCTTGGTCCCAGCACCGAACGTMNN-CGGMNNTGTGTACTTTGAGAGCAGAAATAG-3′, respectively. PCR B and C were, respectively, performed using the sets of primers CDR-3L-For 5′-TTCGGTGCTGGGACCAAGCTGGAGCTGAAACG-3′/CDR2H-Back 5′-GTTCTCCGTTGTAGGTGTTTATMNNGCCCATCCACCTTAAATCC-3′, and CDR2H-For 5′-ATAAACACCTACAACGGAGAACCA-NNKTATGTCGATGACCTCAGAGGAC-3′/pAK100-Back 5′-CATCGGCATTTTCGGTCATAGCC-3′ (N = A, C, G, or T; M = A or C; K = G or T). A second library was built independently by error-prone PCR (11Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) of the VH domain (epVH) via a Gene Morph PCR Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using a coding primer located within the linker in combination with the complementary primer pAK100-Back. The level of mutations was fixed at two or three amino acid substitutions/amplified VH domain. The DNA encoding the VL-linker-epVH scFv fragment was generated by overlap PCR. Combined variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The GenBank accession number of the VL/CL nucleic and proteic sequences is AY854499 and of the VH/CH1 nucleic and proteic sequences is AY854500. Screening of the Libraries and Characterization of scFv Fragments— The libraries were rescued using helper phage M13KO7, and screened following a procedure derived from that initially described by Hawkins et al. (12Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A preselection round was carried out in the presence of 5 nm progesterone-11α-EMC-oligonucleotide-biotin. The resulting prescreened library was then submitted to five rounds of competitive selection according to the strategy described by Saviranta et al. (13Saviranta P. Pajunen M. Jauria P. Karp M. Pettersson K. Mantsala P. Lovgren T. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 nm progesterone-11α-EMC-oligonucleotide-biotin together with 5 μm 5β-DHP or 5α-DHP. Screening of the error-prone library was performed in competition as described above against 5β-DHP only. Competition ELISA was used to characterize the selected scFv-phages. 1 × 108 particles of each tested recombinant phage were added to each microtiter plate well coated with progesterone-11α-EMC-oligonucleotide and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of decreasing concentrations (3.0 × 10-6 to 3.0 × 10-12 m) of a stock solution (5 mg/ml) of progesterone, 5β-DHP, or 5α-DHP. After three washes, 100 μl/well diluted (1/2,000) biotinylated anti-fd phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times, 100 μl/well diluted (1/2,000) streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated 1 h 30 min at 37 °C. The bound scFv-phages were revealed at 405 nm in the presence of ABTS (Sigma). Descending dose-dependent inhibition curves for the binding of each scFv-phage solution to immobilized progesterone against increasing competitor concentrations were obtained. The IC50 values reflect the relative affinity of the tested scFv for the competitor, defined as the concentration of a particular competitor (progesterone, 5β-DHP, or 5α-DHP) which induces a 50% drop in signal compared with the signal obtained in the absence of competitor. The DNA encoding the best variants were subcloned into pUMR vector and expressed as scFv-His6 fragments in the periplasmic space of MC1061 Escherichia coli bacteria. Resulting scFv-His6 molecules were extracted and IMAC-purified as described previously (14Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed on a BIAcore 3000 biosensor optical (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Dissociation constants (Kd) for progesterone, 5β-DHP, and 5α-DHP were determined by competition BIAcore using a sensor chip saturated with biotinylated progesterone (≈ 690 resonance units) as described previously (15Nieba L. Krebber A. Plückthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A streptavidin surface without biotinylated progesterone was used as a control. 200-μl samples of 10 nm pure scFv variant in a buffer containing various amount of competitor, preincubated over 1 h at 37 °C, were injected through the sample loop of the system. Data were evaluated with BIAevaluation software (Amersham Biosciences) and Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software). Molecular Modeling—Models of the Fv domain of C12G11 antibody were generated using the program MODELLER (16Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) with anti-progesterone antibody DB3 (PDB code 1DBA) as template. The cross-reactive steroids 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP were built using the Cschem 3Dpro program. Models of the progesterone, 5β-DHP, and 5α-DHP complexed to C12G11 were constructed using the experimental structures of the DB3 complexes with progesterone, 5α-pregnane-20-one-3β-ol-hemisuccinate, and 5β-androstane-3,17-dione (PDB codes 1DBB, 2DBL, and 1DBK, respectively). The 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP analogs were fitted in the same orientation as the progesterone analogs bound to DB3. The backbone of the mutated third hypervariable loop in the combined variant ProL94-HisL95-ValL96/TrpH50-ArgH58 + LysH31-HisH32 was built as a hybrid between the same loop in DB3 and antibody J539 (PDB code 2FBJ) (17Suh S.W. Bhat T.N. Navia M.A. Cohen G.H. Rao D.N. Rudikoff S. Davies D.R. Proteins. 1986; 1: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Molecular Models of C12G11—The isotype of the C12G11 is γ1, subgroup IX, D-sp2.9, JH-2 for the heavy chain and κ, subgroup I, V-Jκ5 for the light chain (18Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A FASTA search on the structures deposited in the PDB identified DB3 (4Arevalo J.H. Hassig C.A. Stura E.A. Sims M.J. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), another anti-progesterone antibody, as being the antibody sharing the highest degree of homology with C12G11. The variable light and heavy domains of C12G11 display, respectively, 88.3 and 79.6% of sequence identity with those of DB3, and most changes are highly conservative. The six CDRs are identical in length, and CDR2L and CDR1H have identical sequences (Table I). CDR3H, with five substitutions, is the least conserved hypervariable loop. Overall, 12 of the 16 amino acid residues described as interacting with progesterone in DB3 are conserved in C12G11. The canonical classes of hypervariable loops 1L, 2L, 3L, 1H, and 2H of C12G11 match those assigned to DB3. The theoretical model of C12G11 displays only minor deviations with the overall DB3 backbone (root mean square deviation = 0.15 Å) and no major variation within the hypervariable loops. The antibody C12G11 presents a hydrophobic cavity at the interface of the VL and VH domains, formed by CDR1L, 3L, 1H, 2H, and 3H. Models of C12G11 in complex with native progesterone, 5β-DHP, and 5α-DHP (Fig. 1B) place 7 heavy chain residues in the proximity of the steroids: AsnH35 (CDR1H), TrpH47 (FR2H), TrpH50 (CDR2H), and GlyH95, PheH97, TrpH100, and PheH100k (CDR3H). The light chain contributes with 6 residues: HisL27d (CDR1L), and SerL91, ThrL92, HisL93, ValL94, and ValL96 (CDR3L). The contacts are mainly van der Waals in nature with a strong predominance of hypervariable loops 3H and 3L. Comparing the binding site with that of DB3, we expect progesterone to interact similarly in a syn configuration with the methyl groups facing TrpH50 (CDR2H). The overall orientation of progesterone within binding pockets P1, P2, and P3 is mediated by two hydrogen bonds, the keto groups at positions 3 (ring A) and 20 (ring D) being at hydrogen bonding distances from the side chains of HisL27d and AsnH35 in binding pockets P3 and P1, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Compartments P1 and P2 of C12G11 are markedly hydrophobic in character with residues TrpH47, TrpH50, PheH97, TrpH100, and PheH100k lining the cavity that accommodates progesterone rings D, C, and B, and more specifically, rings B and C are sandwiched between TrpH50 and TrpH100 (Fig. 1B).Table IComparison of amino acid sequences of VL-CDRs and VH-CDRs of the anti-progesterone antibodies DB3 versus C12G11 Open table in a new tab Antibody C12G11 displays strong cross-reactivity toward 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP, two hepatic metabolites of progesterone, in the same way as DB3 interacts with high affinity with analogs such as 5β-androstane-3–17-dione, aetiocholanolone (C-5β), and 5α-pregnane-3-β-hemisuccinate. The x-ray structures of these DB3-steroid complexes have been solved and detailed (4Arevalo J.H. Hassig C.A. Stura E.A. Sims M.J. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It was the similarities between the antigen binding sites of DB3 and C12G11 that allowed us to model the binding of 5β-DHP based on the 5β-androstane-3–17-dione and aetiocholanolone complexes, both C-5β, and 5α-DHP using 5α-pregnane-3-β-hemisuccinate. Thus we modeled 5α-DHP occupying the P1, P2, and P3 binding pockets in C12G11 in a syn configuration close to that of progesterone, whereas 5β-DHP would adopt an anti binding mode, with its ring A positioned into the alternative pocket P3′ delimited by TrpH50 and ValL94, the methyl groups facing TrpH100 (Fig. 1B). We felt confident that because of the high degree of homology between C12G11 and DB3 the three-dimensional models of the steroid complexes would of sufficient accuracy for the development of a mutagenesis strategy. Design of 3L/2H scFv-phage Library—The models emphasized the crucial role played by the binding pockets P3 and P′3 in distinguishing between the binding of progesterone from its 5α and even more strongly from the 5β analogs. Thus, we decided to reengineer the subpockets P3 and P3′ mainly through mutagenesis of the CDR3L to hinder the binding of 5α-DHP and 5β-DHP. Within this loop, GlnL90 and ProL95 determine its canonical structure (19Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), and the side chains of residues ValL94, ProL95, and ValL96 point out in the direction of the antigen binding cavity. The residues that delimit the binding pocket P3′ are ValL94, ProL95, and ValL96 at the extremity of CDR3L, together with TrpH50 and ThrH58 in CDR2H. Consequently, these five positions: L94, L95, L96, H50, and H58, appeared appropriate targets for substitution by combined saturation mutagenesis. Thus, to improve the binding specificity of C12G11 antibody, a first library named 3L/2H was built by simultaneous randomization of these five first sphere positions. Because of the structural role of the canonical residue at position L95, a bias was intentionally introduced during the library construction to maintain theoretically the wild-type residue proline at 70%. The size of the library was estimated at 9.0 × 106 independent clones, with no significant bias in the generated diversity as monitored by analyzing 60 individual clones by DNA sequencing. Screening of 3L/2H scFv-phage Library—Prior to starting the selection by competition, the naïve library was voided of low affinity and nonfunctional scFv-phages by carrying out one round of preselection with just biotinylated progesterone. The prepanned library was then subjected to five rounds of selection in the presence of a large excess of either 5β-DHP or 5α-DHP. After five rounds of competitive panning selection using 5β-DHP or 5α-DHP as competitor, we noticed that the nature of the side chains found at the degenerated positions had evolved during the panning, leading to a marked reduction of the initial diversity (Table II). Thus, position H50 totally recovered the wild-type tryptophan, and position L96 was essentially populated by hydrophobic residues with a strong preference for the wild-type valine. Despite the deliberate bias in favor of the wild-type proline at position L95, we observed a steady drop, from the 70% level forced into the library during construction, to just 21% (4/19) after five rounds of selection with the 5β-DHP competitor with basic residues such as Arg and His becoming dominant at the 58% (11/19) level. Similarly, the wild-type residue ValL94 of the native C12G11 reappeared in only 21% (4/19) of the sequenced clones giving way again to basic amino acids (47%, 9/19), Lys and especially Arg, but also proline appeared in 31% (6/19) of the clones. A large majority (74%, 14/19) of basic amino acids, Arg and His, replaced the wild-type ThrH58. The study with 5α-DHP gave similar results, and the amino acid profiles for the two parallel studies were compared, showing that the diversity of the 5α-DHP-selected clones is more limited than that retained with 5β-DHP (Table II). The proline residue at position L95 disappeared, but proline at position L94 doubled to 74% (14/19). Finally, positions L96 and H50 completely reverted to the wild-type residues, and basic residues were found at position H58 at the same level in both cases.Table IISequence analysis of randomly picked clones after five rounds of panning selection “–” indicates the same amino acids as those in wild-type sequence. Residue numbering is according to the kabat scheme. Open table in a new tab After the two panning procedures, most of the selected clones were produced individually fused to the minor coat protein gIII on the surface of the phage to establish their overall binding properties (see “Experimental Procedures”). Table III gives the change in the IC50 values for progesterone, 5β-DHP, and 5α-DHP for each mutant compared with wild-type (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table III footnotes). The cross-reaction profiles of the mutants for the two analogs were calculated as the ratios of IC50 Prog/IC50 5β-DHP, or IC50 Prog/IC50 5α-DHP, respectively. The first group of variants is characterized by basic amino acid (Lys or Arg) at position L94 and the absence of proline residue at position L95: clones B16, A23, B4, A31, B7, and B19. All but clone A31 display a decrease of their cross-reactivity for 5β-DHP (15.9 to 22.8% versus 26% for the wild-type antibody fragment), and 5α-DHP (4.7 to 5.9% versus 19% for the wild-type). This result suggests that in our case, functional C12G11 variants can be generated despite the absence of proline residue in the CDR3L hypervariable loop, including the canonical one at position L95. Most interestingly, four variants in particular, A3 (ProL94-TyrL95-ValL96/TrpH50-HisH58), B5 (ProL94-ArgL95-ValL96/TrpH50-ArgH58), B21 (ProL94-HisL95-ValL96/TrpH50-AspH58), and B14 (ProL94-HisL95-ValL96/TrpH50-ArgH58), are characterized by a more important reduction of cross-reactivity toward both 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP, than the clones of the first group. Indeed, the percentages of cross-reactivity of the latter are an average of 7.0 versus 26% and 3.0 versus 19%, for 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP, respectively. Furthermore, the deduced IC50 values for progesterone of all selected and tested mutants remain closed to that of the wild-type scFv, with a variation comprised between 1.3 and 3.3 only.Table IIICharacterization of mutants by competition phase-ELISA Bold characters indicate the best combined mutant. Reported results are the means of at least three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Identification of Second Sphere Residues—Undoubtedly, the VH domain of C12G11 plays an important role both in the formation of the binding cavities and in its lack of specificity. Consequently, an error-prone PCR library of variants focused on the VH domain only was built in parallel to the 3L/2H library, and this was to complete tentatively with the structure-based engineering of C12G11. The resulting library was only screened against 5β-DHP because its binding takes in particular advantage of the alternative binding pocket P3′ that is mainly defined by the VH domain (Fig. 1B). After six round of panning, selected clones displayed multiple mutations, a reduced recognition of 5β-DHP with 10 versus 26% of cross-reactivity, but also a significant loss of affinity for progesterone (data not shown). It is noteworthy that a majority of these multiple random mutants contained repeatedly one of following substitutions: asparagine into lysine at position 52 (CDR2H) or glutamic acid into lysine at position 56 (CDR2H) and the double mutation AsnH31 → Lys/TyrH32 → His in CDR1H. Despite the lack of beneficial effect on the cross-reactivity of the corresponding single or double mutants compared with the wild-type, an improvement of specificity was systematically observed upon combination of the double substitution AsnH31 → Lys/TyrH32 → His with the multiple mutants ProL94-(Leu,Arg,His)L95-ValL96/TrpH50-(His,Arg,Asp,Ala)H58 (Table III). Among the bests combined mutants and compared with the wild-type scFv, clone B14 + LysH31-HisH32 displays 3.4 ± 0.4% versus 26.0 ± 5.4% and 1.6 ± 0.4% versus 19.0 ± 1.0% of cross-reactivity toward 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP, respectively. Affinity Measurements—The real affinity in solution of (i) wild-type scFvC12G11, (ii) mutant B14 (ProL94-HL95-ValL96/TrpH50-ArgH58) isolated from the 3L/2H library, and (iii) combined mutant B14 + LysH31-HisH32 for soluble and unmodified progesterone, 5β-DHP, and 5α-DHP, respectively, was determined by competition BIAcore experiments (15Nieba L. Krebber A. Plückthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) using purified recombinant scFv-His6 hybrids. The results clearly establish that clone B14 + LysH31-HisH32 is much more specific than the wild-type antibody fragment with deduced Kd values in the nanomolar range (5.3 and 2.4 nm for 5α-DHP and 5β-DHP, respectively) versus 97 pm (5α-DHP) and 28 pm (5β-DHP) for the wild-type fragment, whereas the affinity for progesterone remains in the picomolar range (Fig. 2). Moreover, comparison of the Kd values obtained for mutant B14 and B14 + LysH31-HisH32 confirms the beneficial effect upon addition of the double mutation AsnH31 → Lys/TyrH32 → His. The improvement in specificity for our best mutant B14 + LysH31-HisH32 compared with the wild-type scFvC12G11 was calculated from measurement obtained under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 2). It shows an increase in discrimination against 5β-DHP and 5α-DHP, 23-fold and 15-fold, respectively, compared with the starting antibody. These improvements were calculated as cross-reaction percentages from experimentally measured Kd values (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the lower cross-reactivity of mutant B14 + LysH31-HisH32 is associated with a moderate 3.8-fold increase in the dissociation constant for progesterone (75 pm versus 20 pm). Strategies of Engineering of Anti-progesterone C12G11 Antibody—In the last decade, the ability of protein engineering to modulate the affinity and specificity of antibodies has been steadily improving, especially in the case of haptens such as steroids, sulfa-antibiotics, cardiac and cancer markers (12Hawkins R.E.

https://openalex.org/W1998030761,"Abstract Organic cation transporters of the OCT family mediate downhill transport of organic cations, compatible with carrier, pore, or gate-lumen-gate mechanisms. We studied rat OCT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, including membrane capacitance (Cm) monitoring. Choline, a transported cationic substrate, elicited the expected inward currents but also elicited decreases of Cm. Similar Cm decreases were caused by the non-transported inhibitors tetrabutylammonium (a cation) and corticosterone (uncharged). Effects on Cm were voltage-dependent, with a maximum at –140 mV. These findings suggest that the empty rOCT2 protein can undergo an electrogenic conformation change, with one conformation highly favored at physiological voltage. Moreover, alkali cations elicited considerable inward currents and inhibited uptake of [14C]tetraethylammonium with a sequence Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ ≈ Li+. Cs+ affected current and capacitance with similar affinity (K0.5 ≈ 50 mm). Tetraethylammonium inhibited Cs+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, Cs+ inhibited tetraethylammonium uptake by a competitive mechanism. Activation energy of the currents estimated from measurements between 12 °C and 32 °C was ∼81 kJ/mol for Cs+ and 39 kJ/mol for tetramethylammonium, compatible with permeation of Cs+ through rOCT2 along the same path as organic substrates and by a mechanism different from simple electrodiffusion. Rationalization of Cs+ selectivity in terms of a pore pointed to a pore diameter of ∼4 A. Intriguingly, that value matches the known selectivity of rOCT2 for organic compounds. Our data show that selective permeability of rOCT2 is not determined by ligand affinity but might rather be understood in terms of the ion channel concept of a distinct “selectivity filter.”"
https://openalex.org/W1979630346,"The beta-catenin pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of certain types of cancers. To gain insight into mechanisms by which altered receptor tyrosine kinases regulate cytoplasmic beta-catenin accumulation, the effect of an oncogenic receptor originated from Nantes (RON) variant on beta-catenin accumulation and the role of beta-catenin in RON-mediated tumorigenic activities were studied. In NIH3T3 cells harboring oncogenic variant RONDelta160, increased beta-catenin accumulation with tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation was observed. Overexpression of RONDelta160 also resulted in increased expression of beta-catenin target genes c-myc and cyclin D1. By analyzing cellular proteins that regulate beta-catenin stabilities, it was found that RONDelta160 activates the protein disheveled (DVL) and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta by Ser-9 residue phosphorylation. These effects were channeled by RONDelta160-activated PI 3-kinase-AKT pathways that are sensitive to specific inhibitors, such as wortmannin, but not to other chemical inhibitors. Silencing RONDelta160 expression by specific small interfering RNA blocked not only beta-catenin expression but also c-myc and cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that RON expression is required for the activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, it was found that knockdown of the beta-catenin gene expression by small interfering RNA techniques reduces significantly the RONDelta160-mediated NIH3T3 cell proliferation, focus-forming activities and anchorage-independent growth. Thus, the oncogenic RON variant regulates beta-catenin stabilities through activation of DVL and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. The activated beta-catenin cascade is one of the pathways involved in tumorigenic activities mediated by the oncogenic RON variant."

MLK3 appears to activate C/EBP-β in response to IFN-γ by a mechanism involving decreased phosphorylation of a specific phosphoacceptor residue, Ser64, within the transactivation domain. Decreased phosphorylation of Ser64 was independent of IFN-γ-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and did not require the ERK phosphorylation site Thr189 located in regulatory domain 2 of C/EBP-β. Together these studies provide the first evidence that MLK3 is involved in IFN-γ signaling and identify a novel mechanism of transcriptional activation by IFN-γ. Transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) regulates a variety of cellular functions in response to exogenous stimuli.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). Although STAT1 is a critical primary regulator of IFN-γ-induced responses, several ISGs are critically dependent on other transcription factors. A STAT1-independent regulation of some genes by IFN-γ has been shown (2Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the IFN-α signal transduction pathway the IRF9 protein forms a trimeric transcription factor, ISGF3, in association with the STAT1 and STAT2 proteins to drive gene expression (4Darnell Jr., J.E.

Phosphorylation of several serine and threonine residues distributed across the backbone of C/EBP-β by different protein kinases appears to contribute to its diverse actions. However, the ligand-inducible factors and the corresponding phosphorylation sites controlling its phosphorylation are not fully understood. Our recent studies have shown that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a critical role in regulating C/EBP-β- and GATE-dependent gene expression. This occurs at least in part by phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr189 by ERK1/2 (20Hu J. Roy S.K. Shapiro P.S. Rodig S.R. Reddy S.P. Platanias L.C. Schreiber R.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol.

Here we show a role for mixed lineage kinases (MLKs), a subgroup of upstream kinases that regulate the MAPK family, in controlling C/EBP-β-dependent transcription. MLKs function as MAPK kinase kinases and have been implicated in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and stress-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and transcription factor NF-κB. Some MLKs also activate p38 MAPK. Interestingly instead of stimulating phosphorylation, MLKs exerted a positive effect on the transactivation domain of C/EBP-β by promoting decreased phosphorylation at a specific serine residue in the transactivation domain. Thus, our studies identified a novel IFN-γ effector pathway involving MLKs and C/EBPβ. Reagents—Murine IFN-γ (Pestka Biomedical Laboratories); SB202190 (Calbiochem); antibodies specific for phospho-ERK1/2; actin (Sigma); native ERK2; and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, transcriptional co-activator p300, and C/EBP-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in these studies. MLK inhibitor CEP-11004 (henceforth referred to as CEP) was generously provided by Cephalon Inc., West Chester, PA. An antibody that detects a phospho-Thr189 form (Thr(P)189) of C/EBP-β was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. An antibody that specifically detects the phospho-Ser64 form (Ser(P)64) of C/EBP-β has been described elsewhere (22Shuman J.D. Sebastian T. Kaldis P. Copeland T.D. Zhu S. Smart R.C. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7380-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the native (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and activated (BIOSOURCE) forms of MLK3 were used in some experiments. In response to extracellular stimuli, the two critical threonine (Thr277) and serine (Ser281) residues located in the activation loop of MLK3 are phosphorylated (23Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The antibody against the activated MLK3 isoform detects the diphosphorylated (Thr(P)277/Ser(P)281) form of the MLK3 protein. GFP-specific antibodies were from Clontech. Cell Culture and Plasmids—The murine macrophage cell line RAW (RAW264.7) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. Isogenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild type, mekk1–/– (24Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum during IFN-γ treatment. The murine ISGF3γ (p48) reporter construct, P4, was described earlier (9Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this construct a 74-bp element of murine p48 gene promoter, encompassing GATE, was cloned upstream of the SV40 early promoter driving luciferase. Mutagenesis of the GATE sequence in this construct caused a loss of IFN-γ response and C/EBP-β binding (12Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A wild type and a catalytically inactive dominant negative mutant (K114R) of Mlk3 cloned in pcDNA3.0 vector was described earlier (25Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The native irf9 promoter (A6-Luc) and the corresponding GATE mutant were described earlier (9Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector with the transactivation domain (TAD) (amino acids 22–109) of C/EBP-β and its corresponding S64A mutant fused to the DNA binding domain of transcription factor GAL4 were described previously (26Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The G-E1b-Luc reporter contains five tandem copies of the GAL4 binding sites placed upstream of minimal E1b promoter and luciferase gene. A pcDNA3.0 vector expressing the HA epitope-tagged p300 was provided by Betsy Barnes, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. GFP-tagged MLK2 expression vector was described elsewhere (27Akbarzadeh S. Ji H. Frecklington D. Marmy-Conus N. Mok Y.F. Bowes L. Devereux L. Linsenmeyer M. Simpson R.J. Dorow D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36280-36287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). siRNA sequences that can specifically knock down the expression of human and mouse MLK3 genes were based on the sequences described recently (28Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1227-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the target sequences were synthesized and cloned into the SalI and XbaI sites of the targeting vector pSuppressor-Neo (Imgenex, Inc.): mouse MLK3, 5′-TCGAGGGGCAGCGATGTCTGGAGCTTGAGTACTGAAGCTCCAGACATCGCTGCCCTTTTT-3′; and human MLK3, 5′-TCGAGGGGCAGTGACGTCTGGAGTTTGAGTACTGAAACTCCAGACGTCACTGCCCTTTTT-3′. Because of the differences in the primary sequences of mouse and human MLK3 mRNAs (underlined bases), these siRNAs target only the cognate mRNA for degradation in the cells (28Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1227-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Gene Expression Analyses—Western blot analyses, transfection, β-galactosidase and luciferase assays, and SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described earlier (9Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA (1.0 μg) was kept constant by adding pBluescript SK DNA if required. In general, 0.4 μg of luciferase and 0.1 μg of C/EBP-β expression vector were used for transfection. A β-actin promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter (0.2 μg) was used as an internal control for normalizing variations in transfection efficiency. ERK activation was monitored by Western blot analysis of cell extracts with a phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Anti-ERK2 antibodies were used for determining the total ERK in these samples. In some experiments, antibodies specific for the native and phosphorylated forms of MLK3 were used. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—These assays were performed as described earlier (29Morris A.C. Beresford G.W. Mooney M.R. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4781-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly cells (1 × 108) were stimulated with IFN-γ for 8 h, and chromatin was cross-linked using paraformaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated, and chromatin was sheared into ∼1–2-kb fragments using a Bronson sonicator fitted with a microtip probe. After removing the debris, soluble chromatin was subjected to IP with either C/EBP-β- or transcriptional co-activator p300-specific antibodies. After extensively washing the immunoprecipitated products, cross-links were reversed, and the DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform. The resultant DNA was used for 32 cycles of PCR with the following primers specific for mouse irf9 promoter: 5′-AAGGTGCTACTGCTGACTGAGG-3′and 5′-AAGGGCGGACGTGAAGAAATGG-3′ (9Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PCR with these primers yields a 443-bp product. DNA extracted from an aliquot of the initial soluble chromatin was used for input control. IFN-γ-induced Gene Expression through GATE Is Inhibited by MLK Inhibitor CEP-11004—To examine the role of MLKs in IFN-γ-regulated signaling pathways, we used a specific semisynthetic inhibitor, CEP. A previously defined concentration of CEP that specifically inhibited MLKs (30Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25302-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but not other MAPKs, was used in this study. These experiments were performed using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Cells were transfected with the P4 reporter gene and then treated with the inhibitors prior to IFN-γ treatment. CEP strongly inhibited (Fig. 1A) GATE-driven transcription. Under these conditions, SB202190, a pan-p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced gene expression through GATE (data not shown). Similar to P4-Luc, expression of A6-Luc, a reporter bearing the native irf9 promoter but not its corresponding mutant lacking a functional GATE, was induced following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1B). Such induction was inhibited by CEP. Thus, the native IRF9 enhancer and minimal enhancer were sensitive to CEP inhibition. To determine whether CEP exerted a similar inhibitory effect on another IFN-γ-regulated enhancer element we used palindromic IFN-response element (pIRE)-luciferase, whose expression is dependent on IFN-γ-activated STAT1 binding to the pIRE. STAT1-dependent expression of pIRE-Luc was unaffected by CEP (Fig. 1C). Similarly CEP did not significantly inhibit epidermal growth factor-induced expression through an activator protein 1-responsive element (Fig. 1D). Together these results suggest that MLK activity is critical for IFN-γ-dependent induction of IRF9. To test whether CEP exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on the expression of the endogenous irf9 gene, we performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis of irf9 mRNA levels following various treatments (Fig. 2A). CEP strongly inhibited the IFN-γ-induced expression of irf9, whereas it had no significant effect on the basal expression of the gene. In contrast, expression of another IFN-γ-regulated mRNA, IRF8/IFN consensus sequence-binding protein, was not inhibited by CEP (Fig. 2B). This gene is dependent on STAT1 for its expression. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was not affected by any of the treatments (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate a specific inhibitory effect of CEP on a subset of IFN-induced genes. CEP Inhibits C/EBP-β-dependent Gene Expression through GATE—The above studies indicate that GATE-driven gene expression is inhibited by CEP. However, they did not identify the transcription factor that is subject to inhibition. Our previous studies have established C/EBP-β as a critical regulator of IFN-γ-induced gene expression through GATE (12Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that C/EBP-β is indeed the target of CEP inhibition, we performed a transient transfection assay with the P4 reporter in cebpb–/– MEFs in the presence of exogenous C/EBP-β. Co-transfection of C/EBP-β but not an empty vector conferred a strong induction of luciferase (Fig. 3A). As reported earlier, C/EBP-β also induced the basal expression of this promoter (12Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CEP potently inhibited C/EBP-β-dependent IFN-γ-induced expression of the reporter but did not affect basal expression. These differential effects on the promoter are not due to variable expression of the C/EBP-β protein because a comparable level of C/EBP-β protein was found between the samples (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that an IFN-γ-induced post-translational modification(s) of C/EBP-β may be inhibited by CEP. Because CEP is an inhibitor of the mixed lineage kinases (30Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25302-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we next determined whether a dominant negative MLK3 inhibits GATE-dependent transcription. We chose to focus on MLK3 because it is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme and has been relatively well characterized compared with the other known members of its family (23Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Vectors carrying wild type Mlk3 and a catalytically inactive mutant were co-expressed with the P4-luciferase reporter to determine their effects on IFN-γ-induced expression through GATE (Fig. 3D). Wild type Mlk3 significantly augmented the IFN-γ-stimulated expression of the reporter (3–4-fold), whereas the catalytically inactive mutant significantly (3-fold) inhibited it. Neither wild type nor mutant Mlk3 altered the basal expression of the reporter. Together with data in Figs. 1 and 2, these observations indicate that MLK3 plays an important role in regulating IFN-induced GATE-dependent transcription. We next checked the relevance of endogenous Mlk3 to IFN-γ-induced gene expression through GATE using siRNAs. Because the mouse and human MLK3 siRNA targets differ in their primary sequence they degrade their target mRNAs in a species-specific manner (31Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We first examined the specificities of these siRNAs in knocking down the expression of Mlk3. RAW cells were transfected with the pSuppressor-Neo vector expressing mouse or human MLK3-specific siRNAs. The mouse Mlk3 siRNA knocked down the expression of MLK3 protein (70%) compared with the empty vector control. As expected, the human MLK3 siRNA did not affect the MLK3 expression (Fig. 3F). A converse effect of mouse siRNA on the expression of human MLK3 was found in HeLa cells (data not shown). Having demonstrated the specificity of these siRNAs, we next tested their effects on IFN-γ-induced transcription in RAW cells. These siRNA vectors were co-transfected with two IFN-γ-inducible reporters: 1) P4-Luc and 2) pIRE-Luc. As mentioned earlier the former is dependent on C/EBP-β and the latter is dependent on STAT1 for their expression. As shown in Fig. 3G, co-expression of mouse MLK3 siRNA, but not the human MLK3 siRNA, significantly inhibited the IFN-γ-induced expression of the P4-Luc compared with vector control. In contrast, these siRNAs did not affect expression of the pIRE-Luc. These data clearly indicate an important role for MLK3 in IFN-γ-induced transcription driven by GATE (Fig. 3G). The MLK proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (23Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). MLK3 protein is expressed ubiquitously. The irf9 gene is induced by IFN-γ in most cell types, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of MLK3. In contrast, the expression of MLK2 is restricted to skeletal muscle, brain, and testis. To test the specificity of MLKs, we examined whether co-expression of MLK2 would also augment IFN-γ-induced transcription. For this purpose a GFP-tagged MLK2 protein was co-expressed with the P4-Luc reporter. GFP-MLK2 did not significantly augment the IFN-γ-induced expression of the luciferase gene when compared with the control, GFP expression vector alone (Fig. 3H). Expression of GFP-tagged MK2 was comparable in the control and IFN-γ-treated cells (Fig. 3I). IFN-γ Activates MLK3—To address the issue of whether endogenous MLK3 is activated, we stimulated RAW cells with IFN-γ for various lengths of time and prepared the cellular lysates. The protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analyses with antibodies that can specifically detect the native and diphosphorylated (Thr(P)277/Ser(P)281) forms of MLK3. Like the other members of the MAPK family, MLK3 is activated by phosphorylation at two critical threonine and serine (Thr277/Ser281) residues present in the activation loop (23Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, MLK3 gains its catalytic activity. These analyses showed a time-dependent increase in MLK3 phosphorylation following treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 4A). As early as 30 min after stimulation with IFN-γ a significant rise in MLK3 phosphorylation occurred compared with the control. Such activation continued to increase up to 6 h and declined thereafter. The kinetics of MLK3 activation is consistent with slow activation of the irf9 gene in response to IFN-γ. We next tested whether CEP blocked the IFN-γ-induced activation of MLK3 using the phosphospecific antibodies described above (Fig. 4B). Cells were exposed to IFN-γ in the absence and presence of CEP. As expected, IFN-γ induced the activation of MLK3 protein. Incubation of cells with CEP blocked such activation. These differences in the activation of MLK3 are not due to different levels of MLK3 protein. We could not measure the activation of other MLKs for the following reasons. 1) Unlike MLK3, the expression of MLK2 is restricted to very few tissues, and 2) no native- or activation-specific antibodies are available for the other isoforms. CEP Does Not Inhibit the ERK-induced Phosphorylation at Thr189 of C/EBP-β—We have shown earlier that ERK1/2 signals play an important role in regulating the irf9 gene (20Hu J. Roy S.K. Shapiro P.S.

Therefore, we examined whether CEP interfered with ERK1/2 activation in response to IFN-γ. Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for diphosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 showed that ERK1/2 were activated equivalently by IFN-γ in the presence and absence of CEP (Fig. 5A). Analysis of total ERK2 levels revealed a comparable expression (Fig. 5B). Thus, CEP did not inhibit ERK activation by IFN-γ. Because our earlier studies identified an important role for the Thr189 residue (a target for ERK1/2-induced phosphorylation), located in the regulatory domain 2 of C/EBP-β, in IFN-γ-induced gene expression (20Hu J.

An antibody that detects the phospho-Thr189 form of C/EBP-β was used as a tool for detecting changes in ligand-induced phosphorylation. The specificity of anti-Thr(P)189 antibody is shown in Fig. 5C. In this experiment protein lysates from cebpb–/– cells transfected with wild type (188GTPS191) and a corresponding alanine-substituted mutant (188GAAA191) of C/EBP-β and stimulated with IFN-γ were used for a Western blot analysis with anti-Thr(P)189. A significant increase in IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation at Thr189 was observed with the wild type but not with the mutant protein. This difference was not due to differential expression of the wild type and mutant proteins (Fig. 5D). In the next experiment we examined whether CEP affected phosphorylation at Thr189 in RAW cells (Fig. 5E). In these studies U0126, a known inhibitor of ERK1/2, was used as an additional control. As expected, IFN-γ induced phosphorylation of Thr189, which was blocked by U0126. In contrast to U0126, CEP had no effect on this process. These inhibitors did not affect either the basal phosphorylation or the expression (Fig. 5F) of C/EBP-β. Thus, CEP appears to target another step involved in IFN-γ-induced CEBP-β activation. IFN-γ Negatively Regulates the Phosphorylation through a Serine Residue at the N Terminus of C/EBP-β—To further gain insight into the domain of C/EBP-β affected by CEP, we examined the sequence of C/EBP-β for potential phosphorylation sites.

Among the sPLA2s, group IIA sPLA2(sPLA2-IIA) is a prototypic proinflammatory sPLA2 thatis found to be highly elevated both in the circulation and locally in thetissue in association with a variety of pathological conditions such asrheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and atherosclerosis(11Seilhamer J.J.

The expression ofsPLA2-IIA is inducible in a wide variety of cells and tissuesfollowing various stimuli, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumornecrosis factor-α (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide, interferon-γ,phorbol esters, and cAMP-elevating agents. Consistent with this markedinducibility, the promoter region of the sPLA2-IIA genecontains TATA and CAAT boxes as well as several elements homologous withconsensus sequences for binding of stimulus-activated transcription factors,such as C/EBPs, cAMP-response element-binding protein, NF-κB, STAT, andAP-1(14Couturier C.

Our current studies have demonstrated that stimulation of rat fibroblastic3Y1 cells with IL-1β and TNFα synergistically induces theexpression of sPLA2-IIA, leading to delayed PGE2biosynthesis in cooperation with inducible COX-2(20Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this system, theexpression of sPLA2-IIA is sensitive to inhibitors ofcPLA2 and LOX and conversely is enhanced by overexpression of12/15-LOX, the only LOX isozyme that is endogenously detectable in 3Y1 cells(20Kuwata H.

Acta. 2004; 1686: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Furthermore, suppression of sPLA2-IIA expression by thecPLA2 inhibitor could be restored by certain lipid products of thecPLA2α-12/15-LOX pathway(22Kuwata H. Yamamoto S. Takekura A. Murakami M. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although theseobservations suggest that the expression of sPLA2-IIA depends onprior activation of the cPLA2-12/15-LOX pathway in these cells, andthe requirement for cPLA2α and/or 12/15-LOX forsPLA2 expression has also been demonstrated in several, even if notall, cellular systems (23Shinohara H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar),the precise underlying machinery for this regulatory pathway and itsphysiological relevance are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that IL-1β/TNFα-stimulatedinduction of sPLA2-IIA mRNA requires prior induction of certainregulatory proteins, expression of which depends on thecPLA2-12/15-LOX pathway. In search of such factors, we identifiedmacrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, a CXC chemokine, as a criticalintermediate regulator of IL-1β/TNFα-dependent, 12/15-LOX-regulatedinduction of sPLA2-IIA. Additionally, we provide evidence that thetranscription factor AP-1 contributes to the positive regulation ofsPLA2-IIA transcription and that signaling by TGF-β and PDGFcontributes to its negative regulation.

ThePCR mixtures were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification by denaturation (30s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 60 °C), and elongation (1 min at 72°C). The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis withethidium bromide. RNA Blot Analysis—All of the blotting procedures wereperformed as described previously(20Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts(10 μg) of total RNA were applied to each lane of 1.2% (w/v)formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and then transferred toImmobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed withcDNA inserts and labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). Hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight in a solution comprising 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.75m NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5×Denhardt's solution (Nakalai Tesque), 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (Sigma), and100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Wako). The membranes were washed three times atroom temperature with 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate,1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8,for 5 min each, followed by two washes at 55 °C with 30 mmNaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 10mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for 15 min each. The blots werevisualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR films anddouble-intensifying screens at -80 °C. Transfection of Antisense Oligonucleotide for MIP-2—Theantisense (5′-TGG CGA GTG GGA GGG GCC AT-3′) and sense(5′-ATG GCC CTC CCA CTC GCC CA-3′) oligonucleotides, whichcorrespond to the translation initiation site for rat MIP-2, were eachincubated at 200 nm with Oligofectamine reagent in 200 μl ofOpti-MEM for 15 min at room temperature and then added to cells that hadattained 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates and had been supplementedwith 800 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the mediumwas replaced with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS in the continuedpresence of 200 nm oligonucleotide. After culture for 24 h, 1 ng/mlIL-1β and 2 ng/ml TNFα were added to the culture to activate thecells. Establishment of MIP-2 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressingCells—The target sequences for MIP-2 siRNA were subcloned intopRNA-U6.1/Hygro (GenScript Corporation) at the HindIII/BamHI sites. The sensesequences of the synthesized oligonucleotides (BEX) used were as follows:5′-GAT CCC GAA CAT CCA GAG CTT GAC GTT CAA GAG ACG TCA AGC TCT GGA TGTTCT TTT TTG GAA A-3′ and 5′-GAT CCC GCC CCC TTG GTT CAG AGG ATTCAA GAG ATC CTC TGA ACC AAG GGG GCT TTT TTG GAA A-3′. The plasmids weretransfected into 3Y1 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to themanufacturer's instructions. Three days after transfection, the cells wereseeded into 96-well plates in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin in orderto establish stable transfectants. The IL-1β/TNFα-dependentexpression levels of MIP-2 in the obtained transfectants were assessed by RNAblotting and immunoblotting. Establishment ofcPLA2α-(1–522)-expressing Cells—ThecDNA for cPLA2α-(1–522), which had been subcloned intopcDNA3.1/Hygro, was transfected into 3Y1 cells with Lipofectamine 2000according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days after transfection,the cells were seeded into 96-well plates in the presence of 100 μg/mlhygromycin in order to establish stable transformants expressingcPLA2α-(1–522). The expression levels ofcPLA2α-(1–522) in the obtained transfectants wereassessed by immunoblotting. To assess immediate and delayed PGE2biosynthesis in these transfectants, the cells were activated with 1μm A23187 for 10 min and IL-1β/TNFα for 24 h,respectively, and the amounts of PGE2 released into the supernatantwere measured. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates (105 cellsequivalent) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10 or 15% (w/v) gels underreducing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted ontonitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semidry blotter(Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After blocking for 2 hwith 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), the membranes wereprobed for 2 h with the respective antibodies (1:5,000 for MIP-2, CXCR-2, andCXCR-1; 1:2,000 for cPLA2α), followed by incubation withhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for cPLA2α),anti-rabbit (for MIP-2 and CXCR2), or anti-goat (for CXCR1) IgG (1:10,000dilution in TBS-Tween). After washing, the membranes were visualized withWestern Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences),as described previously(26Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-strandedoligonucleotides containing the consensus sequences for the binding sites forAP-1 and peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) in the promoterregion of the rat sPLA2-IIA gene were radiolabeled with[α-32P]dCTP at their 3′ ends with a Klenow fragment(Takara Biomedicals) and then purified with a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatographycolumn (Bio-Rad).

Nuclear extracts of the cells were prepared asdescribed previously (27Naraba H. Ueno A. Kosugi Y. Yoshimura M. Murakami M. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. FEBSLett. 1998; 435: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Briefly, the cells were suspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9,containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin and wereincubated for 10 min on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension at afinal concentration of 0.4% (v/v), and the mixtures were vortex-mixedvigorously for 10 s; the nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000× g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 m PMSF, 2 μg/mlleupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin by vigorous mixingfor 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5min, the supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. The nuclear extracts wereincubated with 1 ng of radiolabeled AP-1 or PPRE oligonucleotide in bindingbuffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 50 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT,0.7 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/mlaprotinin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC))for 30 min at 25 °C.

Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Conversely, when 3Y1cells overexpressing 12/15-LOX (a LOX isozyme expressed in 3Y1 cells(21Kuwata H. Yamamoto S. Miyazaki Y. Shimbara S. Nakatani Y. Suzuki H. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Murakami M. Kudo I.

In additionto these observations, we found herein that de novo protein synthesiswas required for full induction of sPLA2-IIA, but not COX-2, mRNA,because adding CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, to 3Y1 cells greatlydecreased the amount of IL-1β/TNFα-induced sPLA2-IIAmRNA in mock- and 12/15-LOX-transfected cells(Fig. 1, lanes 3 and6). Appropriate expression of 12/15-LOX in the transfectants wasconfirmed by its enzymatic activity and mRNA expression, as describedpreviously (21Kuwata H. Yamamoto S. Miyazaki Y. Shimbara S.

Based onthese results, we hypothesized that stimulation by IL-1β/TNFαinduces certain regulatory factor(s), which in turn amplify the expression ofsPLA2-IIA in a manner dependent upon the product(s) of thecPLA2-12/15-LOX pathway. Identification of 12/15-LOX-regulated Genes—In an attempt toidentify such factor(s) that intermediate the cytokine- andcPLA2-12/15-LOX-mediated induction of sPLA2-IIA, weperformed cDNA array analysis to select a panel of genes in which expressionwas significantly altered in IL-1β/TNFα-treated12/15-LOX-overexpressing 3Y1 cells relative to that in replicatemock-transfected cells. As summarized inTable I, increased genesincluded those required for the inflammatory response (e.g. the CXCchemokine MIP-2, several proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, and iNOS),gene transcription (e.g. junD, fra-1, and c-jun), andmaterial transport (e.g. A-FABP and FABP-5). Conversely, decreasedgenes included receptors for several growth factors (e.g.PDGFRα and insulin-like growth factor II receptor) and foranti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TGF-βRII) and annexins (whichcan inhibit the PLA2 reaction through substrate depletion(28Mira J.P.

It is involved in variouscellular processes such as stimulation of DNA synthesis and cellproliferation, as well as differentiation and cell migration. Invitro, numerous cell types synthesize FGF-2 in five molecular isoforms.Four of these isoforms have high molecular masses (21.5, 22, 24, and 34 kDa)and are initiated at alternative CUG codons. The main form (18 kDa) isinitiated at a regular AUG codon. The high molecular mass forms localizeexclusively in the nucleus, their NH2-terminal extension containinga nuclear localization sequence(2Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M.

The 18-kDa isoform isprimarily cytoplasmic and, despite the lack of a classical signal peptide, isreleased by a mechanism bypassing the classical export route taken by mostsecreted proteins via the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus(4Florkiewicz R.Z. Anchin J. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 544-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects exhibited by 18-kDa FGF-2 reflect an intricatecombinatorial process involving interactions between the growth factor, any offour closely related high affinity transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors(FGFR1–4), and low affinity binding sites corresponding to the naturallyheterogeneous glycosaminoglycan chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Theinteraction of FGF-2 with its receptor induces a phosphorylation cascade thatresults in the activation of signalization pathways. Furthermore, in additionto interactions with cell surface receptors, several growth factors enter thenucleus of target cells, either alone or associated with their receptors(5Lin S.Y. Makino K.

These data show thatnuclear localization is a general phenomenon for some growth factors,suggesting nuclear functions independent of the functions as extracellularfactors. For the understanding of the nuclear functions of FGF-2, identification ofinteracting proteins is a crucial step. Here, we report that the exogenouslyadded FGF-2 transiently interacts with nuclear active protein kinase RSK2.Using purified proteins, we show that FGF-2 interacts directly through twoseparate domains with two RSK2 domains. This interaction is cellcycle-dependent and furthermore maintains the RSK2 activity in NIH3T3 cellsundergoing G0/S transition. The interaction of nuclear FGF-2 withpluripotent RSK2 offers a new mechanism through which FGF-2 may controlfundamental cellular processes.

In agreement with thisresult, we have shown a direct interaction between CK2 and nuclear FGF-2in vitro by incubation of a nuclear extract with B-FGF-2 immobilizedon streptavidin beads (18Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol.Chem. 1996; 271: 24781-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) andalso in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation of CK2 and FGF-2 from NIH3T3cells undergoing G0/S transition(13Bailly K. Soulet F. Leroy D. Amalric F. Bouche G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, H3 histone isnot a CK2 substrate. To identify the kinase activities able to interact with B-FGF-2 andphosphorylate H3, we incubated a nuclear extract from NIH3T3 exponentialgrowing cells with B-FGF2 immobilized on streptavidin beads and eluted boundproteins at 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl and performed a kinase assay. Kinaseactivity/activities were detected among the proteins bound to B-FGF-2 as wellas in 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl fractions with or without the addition ofhistone H3 as an exogenous substrate (Fig.1A). In this assay, as described previously(18Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol.Chem. 1996; 271: 24781-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) CK2 was eluted at 0.4m NaCl, and the 0.5 m fraction was unable tophosphorylate exogenously added casein (data not shown). To furthercharacterize the kinase activity/activities from the 0.5 m fractionwe used H3 as substrate and two inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases,olomoucine and roscovitine, as well as staurosporine, a potent and broadspectrum inhibitor of kinases(21Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol.Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). None of these inhibitorsaltered the levels of H3 phosphorylation(Fig. 1B,top). Next, we used Ro318220, an inhibitor of the protein kinase Cisoforms as well as RSK1, RSK2, and MSK1(22Alessi D.R. FEBSLett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,23Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and found that Ro318220blocked the protein kinase activity/activities in a dose-dependent manner(Fig. 1B, bottomleft). Because the protein kinases C are also sensitive to staurosporine,we deduced that the kinase activity/activities of the 0.5 mfraction could correspond to RSK1 and/or RSK2 and/or MSK1 kinases. However,H-89, an inhibitor of MSK1(24Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), did not affect thekinase activity/activities of the 0.5 m fraction(Fig. 1B, bottomright). Furthermore, although RSK1 and RSK2 were detected in the nuclearextract (Fig. 1C,top left), only RSK2 bound to FGF-2 and was present in 0.4 and 0.5m fractions (Fig.1C, top right). Next, we sought to determinewhether RSK2 is in its active form in 0.4 and 0.5 m fractions. Thephosphorylation of serine 227 in the NH2-terminal domain of RSK2 isthe real indicator of RSK2 activity. We therefore used a monoclonal antibodydirected against phosphoserine 227 in a similar experiment. As shown inFig. 1C, bottomright, RSK2 bound to FGF-2 and was present in 0.4 and 0.5 mfractions in its active form. RSK2 has been shown to phosphorylate histone H3 on the serine 10 inepidermal growth factor-stimulated human fibroblasts(25Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To determine whether theFGF-2 bound RSK2, in which Ser-227 is phosphorylated, is able to phosphorylatehistone H3 on Ser-10, we immunoprecipitated RSK2 from the 0.5 mfraction and performed a kinase assay with histone H3 as a substrate. As shownin Fig. 1D, histone H3was specifically phosphorylated on Ser-10 by immunocomplexes obtained withanti-RSK and anti-RSK2 antibodies, respectively. In control experiments usingunrelated IgG, we did not detect kinase activity toward histone H3phosphorylation (Fig.1D, left lane). In addition, RSK1 activity wasnot detected in the 0.5 m fraction(Fig. 1D,lane marked Anti-RSK1). We concluded that RSK2 moleculesbound to FGF-2 are able to phosphorylate Ser-10 of histone H3. To ascertain that the FGF-2/RSK2 interaction was direct and specific, weincubated immobilized B-FGF-2 with purified RSK2(26Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22135-22138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown inFig. 1E, RSK2 bounddirectly to FGF-2 (lane 2). Furthermore, the addition of an excess ofunbiotinylated FGF-2 completely prevented the interaction of RSK2 with B-FGF-2(Fig. 1E, lanes3 and 4), whereas the addition of cytochrome c, aprotein similar in molecular mass and isoelectric point to FGF-2, had noeffect (Fig. 1E,lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these data demonstrate adirect in vitro interaction between FGF-2 and RSK2. Two Domains of FGF-2 Interact with Two Domains of RSK2—Likethe other four members of its family, RSK2 has two kinase domains (NTK and CTKdomains) connected by a regulatory linker region(Fig. 2A,top). To map the FGF-2 interacting domain in RSK2, immobilizedB-FGF-2 was incubated with cellular extracts of COS7 expressing HA-taggedfull-length RSK2 or deletion mutants (Fig.2A, middle). FGF-2 interacts withRSK2-(1–389)-NTK, encompassing the hydrophobic motif (HM) (1–389NTK), and with RSK2-(388–740)-CTK, excluding the HM (–HM CTK). TheRSK2-(1–360)-NTK and RSK2-(401–740)-CTK mutants do not interactwith B-FGF-2 (Fig. 2A,bottom). This finding suggests that the RSK2 sequences betweenresidues 361–381 and residues 388–400 correspond to the domainsinteracting with the FGF-2. It is noteworthy that the sequence between theresidues 390–400 is highly divergent, and the sequence between theresidues 361–381 is conserved in the RSK and MSK families(Fig. 2D,bottom). These two FGF-2-recognized RSK2 domains are not homologousto each other. We thus hypothesize that FGF-2 interacts with RSK2 through twodifferent domains. To delineate the FGF-2 domains interacting with RSK2, we constructed aseries of FGF-2 deletion mutants. Their ability to bind RSK2,RSK2-(1–389)-NTK, and RSK2-(388–740)-CTK (–HM CTK) wasdetermined by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig.2B). We used the FGF-2-(131), in which the last 24residues in the carboxyl end of the molecule were deleted, and theFGF-2-(Δ115–129), which lacks the residues 115–129. TheFGF-2-(131) interacts with RSK2 as well as the FGF-2 wild type does, incontrast to the FGF-2-(Δ115–129) mutant, which interacts neitherwith the full-length RSK2 (Fig.2B, top) nor with the 1–389 NTK or–HM CTK RSK2 mutants (Fig.2B, bottom). To better characterize the RSK2interaction domain of FGF-2, we constructed two FGF-2 mutants,FGF-2-(Δ115–119) and the FGF-2-(Δ124–29), lacking,respectively, the residues 115–119 and 124–29.FGF-2-(Δ115–119) fails to interact with RSK2-(1–389)-NTK,and neither does FGF-2-(Δ124–29) interact withRSK2-(388–40)-CTK (–HM CTK). In addition, likeFGF-2-(Δ115–129), FGF-2-(Δ115–119) andFGF-2-(Δ124–29) fail to interact with full-length RSK2(Fig. 2B,top). Next, we wished to identify amino acids in these two FGF-2 domains thatcould account for recognition of the two FGF-2-recognized RSK2 domains. Withthis aim in view, we constructed several FGF-2 proteins with single pointmutation in the two RSK2 interacting domains and tested their capacity tocoimmunoprecipitate with HA-RSK2. As shown inFig. 2C, thesubstitution of serine 117, leucine 127, or lysine 128 by alanine (S117A,L127A, and K128A respectively) is sufficient to lose the interaction withfull-length RSK2 (supplemental Fig. S1, available in the on-line version ofthis article). We conclude that FGF-2 interacts with RSK2 through two separate domains,and our results suggest that these two domains together are required tomaintain the interaction with full-length RSK2. FGF-2 interacts through theserine 117 with the NTK of RSK2 at the site delineated by the residues361–381 before the HM, through the leucine 127 and the lysine 128 withthe CTK at the site delineated by the residues 388–400 after the HM(Fig. 2D). FGF-2 ·RSK2 Complexes Were Detected in Vivo, andFGF-2/RSK2 Interaction Is Cell Cycle-dependent—We thensought to determine the existence of FGF-2 ·RSK2 complexes invivo. First, using streptavidin beads, we isolated these complexes fromnuclear and cytoplasm extracts of asynchronous growing NIH3T3 cells thatunderwent a 4 h stimulation by B-FGF-2(Fig. 3A,top). RSK2 was found to be associated to B-FGF-2 only in the nuclearextract from stimulated cells. However, B-FGF-2 accumulated both in thenucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig.3A, bottom). To confirm the existence of FGF-2·RSK2 complexes in an independent experiment, asynchronous NIH3T3 cellswere cultured in the presence of HA-FGF-2 for 4 h, and FGF-2·RSK2complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-RSK2 antibodies or unrelated IgG ascontrol (Fig. 3B).FGF-2·RSK2 complexes were only detected in nuclear extractsimmunoblotted with anti-HA and never in control experiments. Thus, isolationof the complexes with FGF-2 or RSK2 antibodies resulted in the same data,reinforcing the existence of FGF-2·RSK2 complexes in vivo inasynchronous growing cells. Modified FGF-2 (B-FGF-2) and tagged FGF-2(HA-FGF-2) used in these experiments have the same mitogenic activities aswild type FGF-2 (13Bailly K. Soulet F. Leroy D. Amalric F. Bouche G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,15Soulet F. Al Saati T. Roga S. Amalric F. Bouche G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, to examinewhether the RSK2 associated with FGF-2 was in an active form, we incubated thecomplexes isolated in Fig.3A in a kinase assay with H3 as an exogenous substrate.Complexes isolated from nuclear extracts phosphorylated H3 as well as severalother proteins (Fig.3C, lane 1). A weak kinase activity was detectedin cytoplasm (Fig. 3C,lane 2), and no activity was found in unstimulated cells(Fig. 3C, lanes3 and 4). Moreover, we searched for FGF-2·RSK2 complexes in asynchronousNIH3T3 grown in the presence of FGF-2 mutants that do not interact with RSK2in vitro. As shown in Fig.3D, no FGF-2·RSK2 complexes were detected in FGF-2mutant-stimulated cells. Yet, just as wild type FGF-2 does, S117A, L127A, andK128A FGF-2 mutants accumulate in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cells(Fig. 3E). Having established the existence of FGF-2·RSK2 complexes essentiallyin the nucleus of asynchronous growing cells, we postulated that thisinteraction could be cell cycle-dependent because cellular FGF-2 uptakeoccurred continuously through the cell cycle, whereas FGF-2 entered thenucleus of target cells during the G1 phase(16Baldin V. Roman A.M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Quiescent(G0) NIH3T3 cells were triggered to re-enter the cell cycle by theaddition of HA-FGF-2. The transition between early and late G1occurred 10 h after stimulation(27Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and NIH3T3 cells enteredthe S phase after 12 h (13Bailly K. Soulet F. Leroy D. Amalric F. Bouche G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).We have focused our study on two periods of time after FGF-2 addition, namelyduring early G1 (2–4 h) after the first transient activationof the MAP kinase signaling pathway, and at the vicinity of the restrictionpoint in late G1 (10 h)(27Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations with anti-RSK2 antibodies were carried out at thesedifferent time points after the stimulation of cells. RSK2 was not detected innuclear extracts of G0-arrested cells(Fig. 3F, sectionN, top). FGF-2·RSK2 complexes were detected in nuclear extracts inearly G1 (2–4 h) with a maximum at 4 h after stimulation ofthe cells and not in late G1(Fig. 3F, sectionN, top). Yet, the amounts of nuclear HA-FGF-2 during early and lateG1 were not significantly different(Fig. 3G, sectionN). FGF-2·RSK2 complexes were never found in the cytoplasm(Fig. 3F, sectionC, bottom), whereas RSK2 and FGF-2 accumulated in this subcellularfraction (Fig. 3F,section C, bottom, and Fig.3G, section C). FGF-2 Interacts with Active Form of RSK2 and Maintains a High Level ofthe Kinase Activity in Vivo—We then tried to relate this cellcycle-dependent interaction to functional interpretation. We stimulatedG0-arrested, HA-RSK2-transfected NIH3T3 cells by FGF-2.Immunoprecipitations of cellular extracts with anti-FGF-2 antibodies werecarried out at different times after stimulation of the cells(Fig. 4A). FGF-2 wasnot detected in cellular extracts of G0-arrested cells(Fig. 4A,top). FGF-2·RSK2 complexes were detected after 2 and 4 h ofstimulation, and RSK2 associated with FGF-2 was phosphorylated on Ser-227(Fig. 4A,middle and bottom, respectively). It is noteworthy thatFGF-2·RSK2 complexes were not detected after 30 min of stimulation,whereas the same amount of FGF-2 was immunoprecipitated at different timesafter stimulation of the cells (Fig.4A, top). Next, in another set of experiments wecompa"
