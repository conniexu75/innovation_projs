https://openalex.org/W1590732591,"Based on our previous finding that desensitization of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system (GTS) requires three components, glucose, insulin, and glutamine, we postulated that the routing of incoming glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance in primary cultured adipocytes. Two approaches were used to test this hypothesis. First, we assessed whether glucose-induced desensitization of the GTS could be prevented by glutamine analogs that irreversibly inactivate glutamine-requiring enzymes, such as glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) the first and the rate-limiting enzyme in hexosamine biosynthesis. Both O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (azaserine) and 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine inhibited desensitization in 18-h treated cells without affecting maximal insulin responsiveness in control cells. Moreover, close agreement was seen between the ability of azaserine to prevent desensitization of the GTS in intact adipocytes (70% inhibition, ED50 = 1.1 microM), its ability to inactivate GFAT in intact adipocytes (64% inhibition, ED50 = 1.0 microM) and its ability to inactivate GFAT activity in a cytosolic adipocyte preparation (ED50 = 1.3 microM). From these results we concluded that a glutamine amidotransferase is involved in the induction of insulin resistance. As a second approach, we determined whether glucosamine, an agent known to preferentially enter the hexosamine pathway at a point distal to enzymatic amidation by GFAT, could induce cellular insulin resistance. When adipocytes were exposed to various concentrations of glucosamine for 5 h, progressive desensitization of the GTS was observed (ED50 = 0.36 mM) that culminated in a 40-50% loss of insulin responsiveness. Moreover, we estimated that glucosamine is at least 40 times more potent than glucose in mediating desensitization, since glucosamine entered adipocytes at only one-quarter of the glucose uptake rate, yet induced desensitization at an extra-cellular dose 10 times lower than glucose. In addition, we found that glucosamine-induced desensitization did not require glutamine and was unaffected by azaserine treatment. Thus, we conclude that glucosamine enters the hexosamine-desensitization pathway at a point distal to GFAT amidation. Overall, these studies indicate that a unique metabolic pathway exists in adipocytes that mediates desensitization of the insulin-responsive GTS, and reveal that an early step in this pathway involves the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate by the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1547508081,"Human monoblast U937 cells contain a soluble phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that is activated over the range of 150-600 nM Ca2+ and is stable only at neutral pH. We have purified this PLA2 over 34,000-fold to near homogeneity using sequential ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography steps. The protein has a Mr of approximately 100,000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an isoelectric point of 5.1. Four lines of evidence indicate that this 100-kDa polypeptide represents the PLA2. (i) The intensity of staining of the 100-kDa protein was proportional to the degree of purification of PLA2 activity, (ii) the relative staining intensity of the 100-kDa protein precisely paralleled the elution profile of PLA2 activity during chromatography steps, (iii) the PLA2 activity recovered from a nondenaturing gel (greater than 60% of the total activity applied) coincided exactly with the major high molecular weight protein detected by silver staining, and (iv) monoclonal antibodies against the 100-kDa protein immunoprecipitated the PLA2. We conclude that the cytosolic PLA2 isolated from U937 cells represents a novel, high molecular weight PLA2 responding to physiological (intracellular) changes in Ca2+ concentration and therefore may play a critical role in cellular signal transduction processes and the biosynthesis of lipid mediators."

https://openalex.org/W2110572140,"Exposure of isolated mouse hepatocytes to a toxic concentration of acetaminophen (5 mM) resulted in damage to the mitochondrial respiratory apparatus. The nature of this damage was investigated by measuring respiration stimulated by site-specific substrates in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes after acetaminophen exposure. Respiration stimulated by succinate at energy-coupling site 2 was most sensitive to inhibition and was decreased by 47% after 1 h. Respiration supported by NADH-linked substrates (site 1) was also decreased but to a lesser extent, while there was no decrease in the rate of ascorbate + N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)-supported respiration (site 3). The loss of mitochondrial respiratory function was accompanied by a decrease in ATP levels and ATP/ADP ratios in the cytosolic compartment and was preceded by a loss of reduced glutathione in both the cytosol and mitochondria. All these effects occurred well before the loss of cell membrane integrity. The putative toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine (NAPQI), produced a similar pattern of respiratory dysfunction in isolated hepatic mitochondria. Respiration stimulated by succinate- and NADH-linked substrates was very sensitive to 50 microM NAPQI, while ascorbate + TMPD-supported respiration was unaffected. The interaction between NAPQI and the respiratory chain was further investigated using submitochondrial particles. Succinate dehydrogenase (associated with respiratory complex II) was found to be very sensitive to NAPQI, while NADH dehydrogenase (respiratory complex I) was inhibited to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that a loss of the ability to utilize succinate- and NADH-linked substrates due to attack of the respiratory chain by NAPQI causes a disruption of energy homeostasis in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1504736651,"To examine the mechanisms of copper incorporation during ceruloplasmin biosynthesis, we developed methods to resolve and identify apo and holoceruloplasmin. The identity of holoceruloplasmin was confirmed by oxidase activity staining, immunoblotting, 67Cu-ligand exchange, and 67Cu-ligand blotting. Following metabolic labeling of human liver and lung cell lines with 67Cu, newly synthesized holoceruloplasmin was detected in the culture media as two species with apparent molecular masses of 84 and 79 kDa. Pulse-chase studies demonstrate that exogenous copper is readily available for incorporation into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin and that the kinetics of apo and holoceruloplasmin synthesis and secretion are identical. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation did not affect the rate or amount of copper incorporated into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin but did result in the secretion of a single 68-kDa holoceruloplasmin moiety. Despite differences in the kinetics of copper uptake between cell lines a linear rate of copper incorporation into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin was observed with no evidence of copper exchange following biosynthesis. Under the conditions studied, holoceruloplasmin accounted for less than 5% of the total ceruloplasmin synthesized and secreted by each cell line. The data indicate that copper is incorporated into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin early in the course of biosynthesis by a process independent of N-linked carbohydrate addition. This process of copper incorporation results in an apparent conformational change in the ceruloplasmin molecule which does not affect the secretory rate of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1547856877,"The three-dimensional structure of the maltose- or maltodextrin-binding protein (Mr = 40,622) with bound maltose has been obtained by crystallographic analysis at 2.8-A resolution. The structure, which has been partially refined at 2.3 A, is ellipsoidal with overall dimensions of 30 x 40 x 65 A and divided into two distinct globular domains by a deep groove. Although each domain is built from two peptide segments from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves, both domains exhibit similar supersecondary structure, consisting of a central beta-pleated sheet flanked on both sides with two or three parallel alpha-helices. The groove, which has a depth of 18 A and a base of about 9 x 18 A, contains the maltodextrin-binding site. We have previously observed the same general features in the well-refined structures of six other periplasmic receptors with specificities for L-arabinose, D-galactose/D-glucose, sulfate, phosphate, leucine/isoleucine/valine, and leucine. The bound maltose is buried in the groove and almost completely inaccessible to the bulk solvent. The groove is heavily populated by polar and aromatic groups many of which are involved in extensive hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions with the maltose. All the disaccharide hydroxyl groups, which form a peripheral polar surface approximately in the plane of the sugar rings, are tied in a total of 11 direct hydrogen bonds with six charged side chains, one Trp side chain, and one peptide backbone NH, and five indirect hydrogen bonds via water molecules. The maltose is wedged between four aromatic side chains. The resulting stacking of these aromatic residues on the faces of the glucosyl units provides a majority of the van der Waals contacts in the complex. The nonreducing glucosyl unit of the maltose is involved in approximately twice as many hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts as the glucosyl unit at the reducing end. The binding protein-maltose complex shows the best example of the extensive use of polar and aromatic residues in binding oligosaccharides. The tertiary structure of the maltodextrin-binding protein, along with the results of genetic studies by a number of investigators, has also enabled us for the first time to map the different regions on the surface of the protein involved in the interactions with the membrane-bound protein components necessary for transport of and chemotaxis toward maltodextrins. These sites permit distinction of the open cleft (without bound sugar) and closed (with bound sugar) conformations of the binding protein by the chemotactic signal transducer with which the maltodextrin-binding protein interacts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1555881845,"The 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp-90) is an abundant cytosolic protein believed to play a role in maintenance of protein trafficking and closely associated with several steroid hormone receptors. Incubation of highly purified hsp-90 with [gamma-32P]ATP results in its autophosphorylation on serine residues. There are several lines of evidence which suggest that this activity is due to a kinase intrinsic to hsp-90 rather than some closely associated protein kinases: 1) the phosphorylation persists after the removal of casein kinase II by heparin chromatography and after immunoprecipitation of hsp-90 with anti-hsp-90 antibodies. 2) The approximate kM for ATP of the reaction is 0.16 mM, higher than that of many other protein kinases. 3) Phosphorylation is not affected by a number of activators and inhibitors of other known kinases which might associate with hsp-90. 4) The phosphorylation displays a unique cation dependence being most active in the presence of Ca2+ and practically inactive with Mg2+, although the autophosphorylation in the presence of Mg2+ is activated by histones and polyamines. 5) The activity is remarkably heat-stable; incubation of hsp-90 for 20 min at 95 degrees C results in only a 60% decrease in autophosphorylation. 6) Finally, and most importantly, purified hsp-90 can be labeled with azido-ATP and it is able to bind to ATP-agarose. The binding shows similar cation dependence to the autophosphorylation. These data are in agreement with the presence of a consensus sequence for ATP binding sites in the primary structure of the protein similar to that observed in the 70-kDa heat-shock proteins. Our data suggest the 90-kDa heat shock protein possesses an enzymatic activity analogous in many respects to the similar activity of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins. This may represent an important, previously unrecognized function of hsp-90."
https://openalex.org/W1581448994,"Sugar-binding characteristics of rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP) were studied using the carbohydrate-recognition domain of this protein expressed from a cloned cDNA. To assess the binding affinity of various test compounds, they were added as inhibitors in a binding assay in which 125I-MBP was incubated with yeast cells and the extent of binding was estimated from the radioactivity associated with the pelleted cells. The results of such inhibition assays suggest that MBP has a small binding site which is probably of the trough-type. The 3- and 4-OH of the target sugar are indispensable, while the 6-OH is not required. These characteristics are shared by the rat hepatic lectin and chicken hepatic lectin, both of which are C-type lectins containing carbohydrate-recognition domains highly homologous to that of MBP. Apparently, the related primary structures of these lectins give rise to similar gross architecture of their binding sites, despite the fact that each exhibits different sugar binding specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1525146040,"The potent cytotoxic capacity of eosinophils for parasites and host tissue has in part been attributed to the catalytic action of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), which preferentially oxidizes Br- to the powerful bleaching oxidant HOBr in buffers that mimic serum halide composition (100 mM Cl-, 20-100 microM Br-, less than 1 microM I-). However, serum also contains 20-120 microM SCN-, a pseudohalide whose peroxidative product, HOSCN, is a weak, primarily sulfhydryl-reactive oxidant. Because of its relative abundance and high oxidation potential, we hypothesized that SCN-, not Br- or I-, is the major substrate for EPO in physiologic fluids. We find that in Earle's buffer (100 mM Cl-) supplemented with 100 microM Br- and varying concentrations of SCN-, HOBr production by activated eosinophils and purified EPO, assayed by conversion of fluorescein to dibromofluorescein, was 50% inhibited (ID50) by only 1 microM SCN-. SCN- also blocked (ID50 10 microM) EPO oxidation of I- to HOI, assayed as iodofluorescein, despite the presence of 100 microM (i.e. grossly supraphysiologic) I-. Thionitrobenzoic acid oxidation kinetics indicate that SCN- is the initial species oxidized by EPO in equimolar mixtures of SCN- and Br- and in human serum. EPO also catalyzed the covalent incorporation of [14C]SCN- into proteins in buffers regardless of Br- concentration and in human serum. Comparing the cytotoxicity of HOSCN and HOBr for host cells, we find that even subphysiologic concentrations of SCN- (3.3-10 microM) nearly completely abrogate the potent Br(-)-dependent toxicity of EPO for 51Cr-labeled aortic endothelial cells and isolated working rat hearts, recently developed models of eosinophilic endocarditis. Thus, HOSCN, hitherto best known as a bacteriostatic agent in saliva and milk, is likely also the major oxidant produced by EPO in physiologic fluids, and the presence of SCN- averts damage to EPO-coated host tissues that might otherwise accrue as a result of HOBr generation. In view of these findings, the potential role of HOSCN in eosinophil killing of parasitic pathogens deserves close examination."
https://openalex.org/W1565651933,"Two genes, MDR1 and MDR3, constitute the human P-glycoprotein gene family. To examine the evolutionary relationship between the three known classes of mammalian P-glycoprotein genes, we have cloned the MDR3 gene and compared its structure with that of the human MDR1 and the mouse mdr1 (mdr1b) genes analyzed by other groups. The MDR3 gene contains 28 exons and 27 of these contain coding sequences for the two homologous halves of the protein that correlate with functional domains. This structure is virtually identical to that of the human MDR1 gene and the mouse mdr1 (mdr1b) gene, indicating that the exon/intron structure was fixed before the duplication events that generated different classes of P-glycoproteins, but after the P-glycoproteins diverged from related genes, like the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which has an entirely different exon/intron structure. The four alternatively spliced transcripts of the MDR3 gene arise from alternative splicing of exons 23 and 26. Our analysis of DNA clones covering about 120 kilobases (kb) of the human MDR locus, including the entire MDR3 gene (74 kb) and the intergenic region between both genes (34 kb), combined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data shows that the human MDR locus covers about 230 kb. In contrast to the mouse mdr genes, both human genes are transcribed in the same direction (MDR3 located downstream of MDR1). The CpG-rich sequences marking the 5' ends of both genes are hypomethylated to different extents in different cell lines. Hypomethylation roughly correlates with transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1599345755,"A 25-amino acid peptide, containing the four protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites and the calmodulin (CaM) binding domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein, has been synthesized and used to determine the effects of phosphorylation on its binding and regulation of CaM. PKC phosphorylation of this peptide (3.0 mol of Pi/mol of peptide) produced a 200-fold decrease in its affinity for CaM. PKC phosphorylation of the peptide resulted in its dissociation from CaM over a time course that paralleled the phosphorylation of 1 mol of serine/mol of peptide. The peptide inhibited CaM's binding to myosin light chain kinase and CaM's stimulation of phosphodiesterase and calcineurin. PKC phosphorylation of the peptide resulted in a rapid release of bound CaM, allowing its subsequent binding to myosin light chain kinase (t1/2 = 1.6 min), stimulation of phosphodiesterase (t1/2 = 1.2 min) and calcineurin (t1/2 = 1.7 min). Partially purified MARCKS protein produced a similar inhibition of CaM-phosphodiesterase which was reversed by PKC phosphorylation. PKC phosphorylation of the peptide occurred primarily at serine 8 and serine 12, and phosphorylation of serine 12 regulated peptide affinity for CaM. Thus, PKC phosphorylation of the peptide and the MARCKS protein results in the rapid release of CaM and the subsequent activation of CaM-dependent enzymes. This process might allow for interplay between PKC and CaM-dependent signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1591597335,"The variable regions of antibody molecules bind antigens with high affinity and specificity. This binding is imparted largely by the hypervariable portions of the variable region. Hypervariable regions typically fold into reverse turn or loop structures. Peptides derived from antibody hypervariable region sequences can bind antigens with similar specificity, albeit with markedly lower affinity. In this study, cyclic and dimeric peptide analogs of an anti-idiotypic/antireceptor antibody hypervariable region were developed. This antibody (87.92.6) binds to reovirus type 3 receptors on cells as well as to a neutralizing anti-reovirus type 3 monoclonal antibody (9B.G5). The cyclic peptides were utilized to probe the optimal conformation for binding to both the receptor and 9B.G5. By dimerizing or constraining the conformation of these peptides, higher affinity binding was produced. By utilizing several different cyclic peptides, the optimal conformation for binding was established. The conformationally optimized cyclic peptide possessed greater than 40-fold higher affinity for the receptor and the idiotype than the linear analog. This study suggests that conformationally constrained and dimeric peptides derived from antibody hypervariable loop sequences can bind antigens (including receptors) with reasonable affinity. hypervariable loop sequences can bind antigens (including"
https://openalex.org/W1531851959,"Products of ras genes are putative elements of growth factor signal transduction. However, the mechanism of action of these proteins in normal and malignant growth is as yet obscure. To test for functional consequences of ras oncogene expression, electrophysiological experiments were performed on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transfected with a transforming Ha-ras MMTV-LTR construct expressing the oncogene on treatment with dexamethasone (+ras). Transfected cells in the absence of dexamethasone (-ras) and nontransfected cells in the presence of dexamethasone (oras) served as controls. In -ras and oras, bradykinin induces a single, transient hyperpolarization. In +ras, bradykinin elicits oscillations of cell membrane potential throughout the presence of the hormone by activation of calcium-sensitive K+ channels. The oscillations of cell membrane potential are abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium. As evident from fura 2 fluorescence, bradykinin leads to a transient increase of intracellular calcium both in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. Oscillations of intracellular calcium could be observed in +ras cells, if bradykinin was applied at reduced extracellular sodium concentration possibly to impair calcium extrusion via the sodium/calcium exchange. Bradykinin induces oscillations of cell membrane potential similarly in -ras cells loaded with GTP[S], a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP. Thus, the altered response of ras oncogene expressing cells to bradykinin relates to the GTP binding property of the ras protein. It is concluded that in cells expressing ras oncogene but not in other fibroblasts bradykinin mimicks the effect of growth factors on the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1500232132,"Pasteurella multocida toxin, both native and recombinant, is an extremely potent mitogen for Swiss 3T3 cells and acts to enhance the formation of total inositol phosphates (Rozengurt, E., Higgins, T., Changer, N., Lax, A.J., and Staddon, J.M. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 123-127). P. multocida toxin also stimulates diacylglycerol production and activates protein kinase C (Staddon, J.M., Chanter, N., Lax, A.J., Higgins, T.E., and Rozengurt, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11841-11848). Here we analyze, by [3H]inositol labeling and high performance liquid chromatography, the inositol phosphates in recombinant P. multocida toxin-treated cells. Recombinant P. multocida toxin stimulated increases in [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ([3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3) and its metabolic products, including Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,4)P2, Ins(4/5)P, and Ins(1/3)P. The profile of the increase in the cellular content of these distinct inositol phosphates was very similar to that elicited by bombesin. Furthermore, recombinant P. multocida toxin, like bombesin, mobilizes an intracellular pool of Ca2+. Recombinant P. multocida toxin pretreatment greatly reduces the Ca2(+)-mobilizing action of bombesin, consistent with Ca2+ mobilization from a common pool by the two agents. The enhancement of inositol phosphates and mobilization of Ca2+ by recombinant P. multocida toxin were blocked by the lysosomotrophic agents methylamine, ammonium chloride, and chloroquine and occurred after a dose-dependent lag period. The stimulation of inositol phosphate production by recombinant P. multocida toxin persisted after removal of extracellular toxin, in contrast to the reversibility of the action of bombesin. Recombinant P. multocida toxin, unlike bombesin and guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate), did not cause the release of inositol phosphates in permeabilized cells. These data demonstrate that recombinant P. multocida toxin, acting intracellularly, stimulates the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1485602922,"The catalytic (C) subunit is the phosphorylating component of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a key element in a multitude of hormonally controlled cellular functions. The C-subunit, thought to be a solitary protein until several years ago, is now known to be a group of isoforms comprising as yet C alpha, C beta, and C gamma. We report here the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone coding for a hitherto undiscovered isoform of the bovine C-subunit. The end parts of the 5'-coding region and the 5'-noncoding region of this 3365-base pair clone are unique, whereas the rest of the coding region and the 3'-noncoding region are identical to those of isoform C beta. The clone has therefore been named C beta 2. The deduced amino acid sequence of C beta 2 has a length of 397 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 46.1 kDa, thus being some 6 kDa higher than that of any known C-subunit. In vitro translation of clone C beta 2 resulted in a single 46-kDa protein. The unique amino-terminal sequence of C beta 2 lacks the usual myristoylation site of C-subunits. It contains a stretch of hydrophobic residues (residues 7-19) and a stretch which may fold into an amphiphilic alpha-helix (residues 16-27) conceivably serving targeting functions. The existence of isoform C beta 2 is confirmed by: (i) the isolation of a second independent C beta 2 clone, (ii) the development of products of expected size and sequence upon amplification from total RNA of various bovine tissues with the polymerase chain reaction using C beta 2-specific primers, and (iii) Northern blots probed with a cDNA fragment containing exclusively C beta 2 sequence. C beta 2 mRNA has a size of 4.4 kilobases and is expressed in various bovine tissues, mainly in heart and brain. Both the size and tissue distribution are indistinguishable from those of C beta mRNA, thus explaining the failure of previous investigations to distinguish it from C beta 2. Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA indicate that intron sequence(s) exist at the C beta 2/C beta deviation site (bases 267/268). The deviation site is equivalent to the exon 1/exon 2 splice site of the mouse C-subunit. Since splice sites are highly conserved and since not a single mutation is found downstream of the deviation site, it is tempting to suppose that C beta 2 and C beta are coded by one gene which possesses two alternatively spliced exons 1."
https://openalex.org/W1544348359,"A monolayer technique was used to study the substrate specificity of hepatic lipase (HL) and the effect of surface pressure and apolipoproteins on hydrolysis of lipid monolayers by this enzyme. HL hydrolyzed readily phosphatidylethanolamine monolayers. Pure trioctanoylglycerol was found to be a poor substrate but when progressively diluted with nonhydrolyzable 1,2-didodecanoylphosphatidylcholine hydrolysis of triacylglycerol by HL reached maximum at a molar ratio of 1:1 triacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine. The activation of triacylglycerol hydrolysis was not due to altered penetration of HL. The surface pressure optimum of HL for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine monolayers was broad between 12.5 and 25 mN/m. When apolipoprotein E was injected beneath the monolayer of phosphatidylethanolamine prior to enzyme addition, a 3-fold activation of HL was observed at surface pressures equal to or below 15 mN/m. Below surface pressures of 20 mN/m apolipoprotein E did not affect the penetration of HL into the lipid-water interface. Apolipoprotein E slightly activated the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol by HL at 10 mN/m. At a high surface pressure of 25 mN/m all apolipoproteins tested (apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I, C-II, C-III, and E) inhibited the penetration into and HL activity on phosphatidylethanolamine At 18.5 mN/m all apolipoproteins except apolipoprotein E inhibited the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in the triacylglycerol:phosphatidylcholine mixed film. Based on these results we present a hypothesis that phospholipid present in apolipoprotein E-rich high density lipoprotein-1 and triacylglycerol in intermediate density lipoprotein would be preferred substrates for HL."

This conclusion was supported by the following results: (a) the PGN- and LPS-binding proteins co-migrated following photoaffinity cross-linking and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (b) cross-linking of PGN to this 70-kDa protein was competitively inhibited by LPS (IC50 = 7.3 microM), LPS from a deep rough mutant (IC50 = 6.9 microM), and lipid A (IC50 = 18-72 microM); (c) cross-linking of LPS to this 70-kDa protein was competitively inhibited by polymeric soluble PGN (IC50 = 0.09 microM) and sonicated high Mr PGN (IC50 = 0.6 microM); (d) cross-linking of both PGN and LPS to this 70-kDa protein was also competitively inhibited by dextran sulfate (IC50 = 115-124 microM); (e) cross-linking of both PGN and LPS to this 70-kDa protein was inhibited by a (GlcNAc)2-specific lectin; and (f) peptide maps of the 70-kDa proteins digested with chymotrypsin, subtilisin, staphylococcal protease V, or papain were identical for PGN- and LPS-binding proteins and unique for each enzyme. Based on competitive inhibition experiments, binding of PGN to the 70-kDa protein was 20-1200 times stronger than the binding of LPS or lipid A on a per mol basis. However, when aggregated micellar structures of LPS or lipid A were considered, the avidities of LPS and PGN binding were similar. These results demonstrate binding of PGN and LPS to the same 70-kDa protein on lymphocytes and suggest that the binding is specific for the (GlcNAc-MurNAc)n backbone of PGN and the (GlcNAc)2 part of lipid A."
https://openalex.org/W1486071978,"Type IX collagen-proteoglycan is a major component of hyaline cartilages where it is located on the surface of the collagen fibrils so that a collagenous domain of the molecule (called COL3) and a non-collagenous domain (called NC4) project at periodic distances away from the surface of the fibril. Type IX collagen-proteoglycan is also present on the surface of the collagen fibrils of the adult chicken vitreous but, unlike cartilage, lacks the NC4 domain and possesses a very long chondroitin sulfate chain which provides an extensive coat to the fibril. A monoclonal antibody (called 4D6) is described which will distinguish cartilage from vitreous type IX collagen. To form the epitope for 4D6 two peptides called C2 and C5 derived, respectively, from the alpha 1(IX) and alpha 3(IX) chains are required. Further analysis shows that specificity for 4D6 resides only in the C2 peptide from cartilage and not in C5. These results are entirely consistent with recent evidence that there are two promoters for transcription of the alpha 1(IX) chain which will result in an alpha 1(IX) chain in which the NC4 domain is either present or absent and that expression of these two promoters has tissue specificity (Nishimura, I., Muragaki, Y., and Olsen, B. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20033-20041). In addition, the function of type IX collagen in cartilage and vitreous may differ with the long chondroitin sulfate chains of vitreous type IX collagen being responsible for the gel-like matrix of this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1584328685,"Expression vectors containing full-length cDNAs for each of the human fibrinogen chains were constructed. COS-1 cells were transfected with single vectors, mixtures of two, or with all three vectors and stable cell lines selected. Cells transfected with single vectors, or with mixtures of any two vectors, expressed the appropriate fibrinogen chains but did not secrete them. COS cells transfected with three vectors expressed all of the chains and secreted fibrinogen. COS cells transfected with three vectors contained, intracellularly, a mixture of fibrinogen-related proteins. The four main intracellular products were nascent fibrinogen, an A alpha.gamma complex, free A alpha chains, and free gamma chains. This is a similar pattern to that noted in Hep G2 cells. The intracellular forms of fibrinogen were sensitive to endoglycosidase H, indicating that they reside in a pre-Golgi compartment. Secreted fibrinogen was endoglycosidase H-insensitive, suggesting that the secreted glycoprotein moieties were processed in the normal manner. When mixed with plasma fibrinogen, radiolabeled recombinant fibrinogen was incorporated into a thrombin-induced clot. These studies demonstrate that COS cells transfected with all three fibrinogen chain cDNAs are capable of assembling and secreting a functional fibrinogen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1496003250,"Abstract Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) is a multivalent, Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor which appears to play an important role in the regulation of hemostasis. LACI directly inhibits factor Xa, and, in a Xa-dependent fashion, also inhibits the factor VIIa-tissue factor catalytic complex. Hybridization of a LACI cDNA probe to DNA isolated from a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids containing different human chromosomes localized the human LACI gene to chromosome 2. In situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes further mapped the gene to the region 2q31----2q32.1. Exons of the human LACI gene were cloned from genomic or chromosome 2-specific phage libraries and sequenced, including approximately 500 base pairs of 5' upstream DNA. The 5' DNA did not contain a prototypical TATAA box or CCAAT sequence, and attempts to identify a unique site for the initiation of transcription were unsuccessful in that primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis indicate multiple transcription initiation sites for LACI messages. Comparing the gene sequence with LACI cDNA sequences indicates that the gene contains nine exons and that alternative splicing can occur, resulting in the absence of exon 2 in the 5' untranslated region of some messages. The three Kunitz domains in LACI are encoded on separate exons. Introns which interrupt coding sequences all occur in the same codon phase interrupting the first and second bases of the codon triplets. The data are consistent with LACI evolving by a combination of gene segment duplications and exon shuffling."

https://openalex.org/W1554635616,"One dominant binding site (70 kDa 6.5 pI protein) for bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN), a macrophage activator and polyclonal B cell mitogen, was demonstrated on mouse B and T lymphocytes and macrophages by photoaffinity cross-linking and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This binding site was not present on erythrocytes. The binding was specific for polymeric PGN and was competitively inhibited by unlabeled PGN with IC50 = 48 micrograms/ml (0.38 microM). The binding was partially inhibited by O-acetylated PGN monomers (IC50 = 469 micrograms/ml, 521 microM), dextran sulfate (IC50 = 1024 micrograms/ml, 124 microM), and (GlcNAc)3 (IC50 = 6.6 mg/ml, 10 mM), and was not inhibited by non-O-acetylated PGN monomers and dimers, muramyl dipeptide, PGN pentapeptide, GlcNAc, teichoic acid, protein A, and gelatin. The cell surface location of the 70-kDa PGN-binding protein was indicated by the ability of PGN to bind to this protein in intact metabolically inactive cells (at 4 degrees C and in the presence of 0.1% NaN3) and by the ability to extract the 70-kDa PGN-binding protein from viable B lymphocytes by noncytotoxic concentration of n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside."
https://openalex.org/W1486704577,"A cytoskeletal extract of pure axoplasm, highly enriched with neurofilaments (ANF), was prepared from the giant axon of the squid. This ANF preparation also contained potent kinase activities which phosphorylated the Mr greater than 400,000 (high molecular weight) and Mr 220,000 squid neurofilament protein subunits. High salt (1 M) extraction of this ANF preparation solubilized most of the neurofilament proteins and kinase activities and gel filtration on an AcA 44 column separated these two components. The neurofilaments eluted in the void volume of the column while the kinase activities eluted in the 17-44-kDa range of the column. Two major kinase activities were measured in this peak of activity. One of these strongly phosphorylated the phosphate acceptor peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and was completely inhibited by the selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile- NH2 (Wiptide). Since addition of cAMP did not stimulate activity, this suggested that this kinase was a free catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase associated with the neurofilaments. The second kinase activity most effectively phosphorylated alpha-casein, and this activity was not affected by Wiptide. The alpha-casein phosphorylating activity (ANF kinase) was the principal activity responsible for neurofilament protein phosphorylation, and was not inhibited by various inhibitors against second messenger regulated kinases, suggesting it was related to the casein kinase family. Four lines of evidence indicate ANF kinase was similar to casein kinase I. These were: 1) the apparent molecular weight determined by gel filtration and the chromatographic elution profile on phosphocellulose column corresponded to casein kinase I; 2) heparin, an inhibitor of casein kinase II at 2-5 micrograms/ml, stimulated both ANF kinase and purified casein kinase I at these concentrations, while CKI-7, a relatively selective inhibitor of casein kinase I, inhibited ANF kinase in a comparable dose-response fashion; 3) purified casein kinase I strongly phosphorylated both ANF protein subunits (like ANF kinase) whereas casein kinase II was relatively ineffective; and 4) tryptic peptide maps of the HMW and Mr 220,000 neurofilament proteins after phosphorylation by ANF kinase or purified casein kinase I showed similar 32P-peptide patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1500554437,"Abstract Most potent mutators heretofore detected in Escherichia coli are associated with defects in epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III, encoded by the dnaQ gene. To elucidate the role of the alpha subunit, the catalytic subunit of the polymerase, in maintaining the high fidelity of DNA replication, we isolated a mutator mutant, the mutation (dnaE173) of which resides on the dnaE gene, encoding the alpha subunit. The dnaE173 mutant was unable to grow in salt-free L broth at temperatures exceeding 44.5 degrees C and exhibited an increased frequency of spontaneous mutations, 1,000 to 10,000-fold the wild type level, at permissive temperatures. The mutator effect of dnaE173 mutation is dominant over the wild type allele. These phenotypes are caused by a single base substitution, resulting in one amino acid change, Glu612 (GAA)----Lys(AAA), in the alpha subunit molecule. DNA polymerase III purified from the dnaE173 mutant contained both alpha and epsilon subunits, in a normal molar ratio. We found no differences between wild type and mutant polymerases in the Vmax, thermolabilities, and salt sensitivities. However, the apparent Km for the substrate nucleotide of the mutant polymerase was 1/6 of that determined with the wild type polymerase. Although the mutant polymerase retained a normal level of 3'----5' exonuclease activity, the proofreading capacity determined by turnover assay was significantly lower in the mutant polymerase, as compared with findings in the normal enzyme. It seems likely that the enhanced mutability in the dnaE173 strain results from, at least in part, a defect in the editing function of DNA polymerase III, and further suggests that a portion of the alpha subunit in which the amino acid change resides may be important for the proper setting of the two subunits at the replication fork so as to facilitate efficient editing during the DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1574002472,"L-Pipecolic acid oxidase has been purified to near homogeneity from Rhesus monkey liver. The protein, a yellow monomer, has a molecular weight of 46,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pI of 8.9. It contains a covalently bound flavin with absorption maxima at 457 and 383 nm and a shoulder at 480 nm. The purified enzyme is most reactive toward L-pipecolic acid, with lesser reactivities toward L-proline and sarcosine. The enzyme has no significant reactivity toward the D-enantiomer of pipecolic acid or toward any other amino acid tested. Benzoic acid is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a Ki of 750 microM. The Km of the purified enzyme is 3.7 mM for L-pipecolic acid. With less purified preparations, the reaction product is alpha-aminodipic acid. The purified enzyme, however, produces an intermediate which reacts with ortho-aminobenzaldehyde to form an alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde adduct. Thus, the formation of alpha-aminoadipic acid requires at least two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1480090202,"Using recombinant DNA techniques, an Escherichia coli periplasmic sulfate receptor or sulfate-binding protein involved in active transport has been overexpressed and characterized. This protein is essentially identical in size, sequence, antigenicity, and ligand affinity and specificity to the sulfate receptor from Salmonella typhimurium whose crystal structure has been refined at 2 A resolution. The dehydrated sulfate is bound in the deep cleft between the two lobes of the bilobate protein. Using the structure of the S. typhimurium as a guide, three site-directed mutants (Ser129Cys, Gly46Cys, and Ser129Cys/Gly46Cys) have been made. In the Cys129/Cys46 mutant the disulfide has been successfully introduced across the opening of the ligand-binding site cleft of the E. coli sulfate-binding protein. The dissociation of sulfate from the double mutant protein is very slow under oxidizing conditions and increases more than 200-fold when reducing agent is added. This effect is attributed to a loss of interdomain structural flexibility in the presence of the disulfide, and underscores the importance of protein conformational change in binding protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1505211027,"Mitochondrial creatine kinase isolated from chicken cardiac muscle was crystallized by vapor diffusion techniques. Depending on the growth conditions, fine needles and platelets as well as large single crystals appeared after a few days. Large crystals were shown to diffract to at least 3.2 A resolution (Schnyder, T., Winkler, H., Gross, H., Sargent, D., Eppenberger, H. M., and Wallimann, T. (1990) Biophys J. 57, 420 and thus are suited for a detailed X-ray analysis in the future. The relatively high density of single crystals measured by a linear organic solvent density gradient indicates a tight packing of mitochondrial creatine kinase molecules within the crystals. Microcrystals, however, were subjected to electron optical examination either after prefixation with glutaraldehyde followed by conventional negative staining or by freeze-fracturing crystals in mother liquor and heavy metal replication with platinum/carbon. In both cases the crystals exhibited a square lattice with parameters of a = b = 139 A and a = b = 132 A in negatively stained and replicated crystals, respectively. No other lattice parameters were found, suggesting that these microcrystals represent a quasi-cubic three-dimensional lattice, which is in accordance with the finding that the building blocks of the crystals are the cube-like octamers described (Schnyder, T., Engel, A., Lustig, A., and Wallimann, T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16954-16962). Digital image processing applied to electron micrographs of crystals clearly revealed the arrangement of mitochondrial creatine kinase octamers in the crystal lattice as well as the subdivision of the octamer into its subdomains at a resolution of 23 A."
https://openalex.org/W1508653991,"Cryptomonad strain CBD phycoerythrin 566 carries four open-chain tetrapyrrole (bilin) prosthetic groups: three singly thioether-linked bilins at alpha-19, beta-82, and beta-158 and a bilin linked through two thioether bonds at beta-50,61 (amino acid sequence numbering from Wilbanks, S. M., Wedemayer, G.J., and Glazer, A.N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17860-17867). The structures of all four peptide-linked prosthetic groups were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The bilin at beta-82 was identified as phycoerythrobilin (PEB), a common prosthetic group in cyanobacterial and red algal phycobiliproteins. The structures of the remaining bilins were novel. The bilin at alpha-19, designated Cys-bilin 618, differed from PEB in having additional double bonds between C-2 and C-3 of ring A and between C-12' and C-12, i.e. an acryloyl substituent at C-12 of ring C. The doubly linked bilin at beta-50,61 designated DiCys-bilin 584, differed from doubly linked PEB (Schoenleber, R.W., Lundell, D.J., Glazer, A.N., and Rapoport, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5481-5484) in possessing an acryloyl substituent at C-12 of ring C in place of a propionyl substituent. Similarly, the bilin at beta-158, designated Cys-bilin 584, differed from singly-linked PEB in possessing an acryloyl substituent at C-12 of ring C in place of a propionyl substituent.

https://openalex.org/W1497432047,"Deacetoxycephalosporin C hydroxylase from cell-free extracts of Streptomyces clavuligerus was stabilized partially and purified to near homogeneity by three anion-exchange chromatographies, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and two gel filtrations. The hydroxylase was a monomer with a Mr of 35,000-38,000. alpha-Ketoglutarate, ferrous iron, and molecular oxygen were required for the enzyme activity. The hydroxylase was optimally active between pH 7.0 and 7.4 in a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer and at 29 degrees C. It was stimulated by a reducing agent, particularly dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione, and ATP. The requirement for ferrous ion was specific, and at least one sulfhydryl group was apparently essential for the enzymatic hydroxylation. The Km values of the hydroxylase for deacetoxycephalosporin C and alpha-ketoglutarate were 59 and 10 microM, respectively, and the Ka for ferrous ion was 20 microM. In addition to its known hydroxylation of deacetoxycephalosporin C to deacetylcephalosporin C, the hydroxylase catalyzed effectively an analogous hydroxylation of 3-exomethylenecephalosporin C to deacetoxycephalosporin C. Surprisingly, the hydroxylase also mediated slightly a novel ring-expansion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C. The substrate specificity of the hydroxylase is overlapping with but distinguishable from that of deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase, the enzyme which normally mediates the ring-expansion reaction (Dotzlaf, J. E., and Yeh, W. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10219-10227). Furthermore, the hydroxylase exhibited an extensive sequence similarity to the synthase. Thus, the two enzymes catalyzing the consecutive reactions for cephamycin C biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus represent apparent products from a divergent evolution."

https://openalex.org/W1559645006,"Lambs, maintained on a selenium-deficient diet supplemented with 94 atom % Na2 27SeO3, have been used as a source of 77Se-enriched erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase. After 5 months on this diet, the percentage of selenium in the enzyme derived from the supplement had reached 88%. From each monthly bleeding of two sheep, approximately 20 mg of 77Se-enriched glutathione peroxidase could be isolated in pure form. Although attempts to observe 77Se NMR signals from the native enzyme labeled with 6,6'-[77Se]diselenobis-(3-nitrobenzoic acid) failed, due to the low solubility of the enzyme, two 77Se resonances were observed after unfolding the enzyme with 8 M urea and reaction with iodoacetamide. These resonances, at 195 and 377 ppm, were from the selenoether alkylamide derivative and from protein cross-linked selenide sulfide species, respectively. Relaxation time measurements on the selenoether at 4.7 and 9.4 teslas enabled an estimate of the chemical shift anisotropy to be made. A value of less than or equal to 262 ppm was determined. Reduction of the denatured selenide sulfide species with dithiothreitol gave an observable 77Se resonance from the Se- moiety at pH 8 and from SeH at pH 4.2. The chemical form of the selenocysteine residue in the resting state enzyme most consistent with formation of the acetamide derivative and the selenide sulfide is Se- or SeH. From the magnitudes of the estimated chemical shift anisotropies, it is predicted that direct observation of selenium in the native enzyme will be feasible if the enzyme concentration can be increased to 0.25 mM tetrameric glutathione peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1500356661,"Three recombination proteins of bacteriophage T4, uvsX, uvsY, and gene 32 proteins, were examined for the formation of a complex with short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules containing either 24 or 69 nucleotides. Gel-shift assays revealed that either the uvsX or uvsY protein, when present alone, formed a stable complex only with the 69-mer, while the gene 32 protein bound stably to both ssDNAs. However, a characteristic stable complex formed on the 24-mer when both the uvsX and uvsY proteins were present, and the uvsY protein bound to this DNA in the presence of the gene 32 protein. Isolation of the complexes by centrifugation through a glycerol gradient revealed their protein constituents and showed that the uvsX protein-uvsY protein-24-mer ssDNA complex formed even in the presence of excess gene 32 protein. The possible biological significance of these protein-DNA complexes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516264319,"The attenuation of the sulfite:cytochrome c activity of sulfite oxidase upon treatment with ferricyanide was demonstrated to be the result of oxidation of the pterin ring of the molybdenum cofactor in the enzyme. Oxidation of molybdopterin (MPT) was detected in several ways. Ferricyanide treatment not only abolished the ability of sulfite oxidase to serve as a source of MPT to reconstitute the aponitrate reductase in extracts of the Neurospora crassa mutant nit-1 but also eliminated the ability of sulfite oxidase to reduce dichlorobenzenoneindophenol after anaerobic denaturation. Additionally, the absorption spectrum of anaerobically denatured ferricyanide-treated molybdenum fragment of rat liver sulfite oxidase was typical of fully oxidized pterins. Ferricyanide treatment had no effect on the protein of sulfite oxidase or on the sulfhydryl-containing side chain of MPT. Quantitation of the ferricyanide reaction showed that 2 mol of ferricyanide were reduced per mol of MPT oxidized, yielding a fully oxidized pterin. These results corroborate the previously reported conclusion that the native state of reduction of MPT in sulfite oxidase is at the dihydro level (Gardlik, S., and Rajagopalan, K.V. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13047-13054). As a result of oxidation of the pterin ring, the affinity of MPT for molybdenum is decreased, leading to eventual loss of molybdenum. Because the loss of molybdenum is slow, a population of sulfite oxidase molecules can exist in which molybdenum is complexed to oxidized MPT. These molecules retain sulfite:O2 activity, a function apparently dependent solely on the molybdenum-thiolate complex, yet have greatly decreased sulfite:cytochrome c activity, a function requiring heme as well as the molybdenum center of holoenzyme. These observations suggest that the pterin ring of MPT participates in enzyme function, possibly in electron transfer, directly in catalysis, or by controlling the oxidation/reduction potential of molybdenum."
https://openalex.org/W1560065907,"Contributions of alpha-helices to biological activity in murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis and protein expression in COS-1 cells. A series of single proline substitutions were made for residues within the four predicted alpha-helices as a means of disrupting local helical secondary structure. Mutations in three of the four helices resulted in marked reductions in bioactivity. Five mutants E21P, L56P, E60P, L63P, and L107P showed 10(2)-10(4)-fold reduction in bioactivity as well as hyperglycosylation. The same Pro substitutions made on non-N-glycosylated molecules had a similar loss in bioactivity implying that a Pro-induced structural change and not hyperglycosylation was responsible for the major decrease in bioactivity. Additional amino acid substitutions at these residues which conserved charge or hydrophobicity, or replaced the original residue with an Ala, verified that conformational changes in the protein structure were specifically due to steric constraints imposed by the Pro residue rather than loss of important side chain functions."
https://openalex.org/W1595445711,"We have modified the single cysteine residue of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) with HgCl2, methylmethane thiosulfonate, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and N-(1-anilinonaphthyl-4)maleimide (ANM). Whereas native alpha 1-PI combines rapidly and quasi-irreversibly with neutrophil elastase, the thiol-modified alpha 1-PI derivatives are dissociable reversible competitive inhibitors of the enzyme, with values of Ki in the range of 6-7 nM. Removal of the thiol modifications restores the rapid irreversible mode of inhibition. Once native alpha 1-PI has combined with neutrophil elastase, the enzyme-inhibitor complex retains a reactive thiol group, but the two proteins can no longer be dissociated by subsequent reaction with ANM, even after exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From kinetic measurements of fluorescence, ANM-modified alpha 1-PI combines with neutrophil elastase via an apparent biomolecular process with a second order rate constant on the order of 10(5) M-1 S-1. We estimate a dissociation rate constant on the order of 10(-3) S-1. The emission of ANM-modified alpha 1-PI is increased in intensity and blue shifted from the maximum in ANM-modified cysteine, consistent with a predominantly nonpolar environment. Association with neutrophil elastase results in an additional blue shift with further increase in intensity, consistent with a further decrease in polarity of the environment of the cysteine. Modification with methylmethane thiosulfonate or GSSG results in a small decrease in quantum yield and a red shift in the tryptophan emission spectrum of the modified inhibitor, suggestive of increased polarity of the environment of at least 1 of the 2 tryptophan residues in alpha 1-PI. These changes are reversed by dithiothreitol and are consistent with a conformational change which transforms the inhibitory activity from a rapid, irreversible mode in native alpha 1-PI to a dissociable competitive mode in the mixed disulfide derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1535120825,"GTP-binding proteins have been implicated to function as key transducing elements in the mechanism underlying receptor activation of a membrane-associated phospholipase C activity. In the present study, the regulation of phospholipase C activity by GTP-binding proteins has been characterized in a detergent-solubilized system derived from bovine brain membranes. Guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP-gamma-S) and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in phospholipase C activity with half-maximal activation at 0.6 microM and 10 microM, respectively. The maximal degree of stimulation due to Gpp(NH)p or GTP-gamma-S was comparable. 100 microM GTP had only a slight stimulatory effect on phospholipase C activity. Adenine nucleotides, 100 microM adenylyl-imidodiphosphate and ATP, did not stimulate phospholipase C activity, indicating that specific guanine nucleotide-dependent regulation of phospholipase C activity was preserved in the solubilized state. Gpp(NH)p or GTP-gamma-S stimulation of phospholipase C activity was time-dependent and required Mg2+.Mg2+ regulated the time course for activation of phospholipase C by guanine nucleotides and the ability of guanine nucleotides to promote an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of phospholipase C. 200 microM GDP-beta-S or 5 mM EDTA rapidly reversed the activation due to GTP-gamma-S or Gpp(NH)p. These findings demonstrate that G protein regulation of phospholipase C activity in a bovine brain membrane- solubilized system occurs through a Mg2+ and time-dependent mechanism. Activation is readily reversible upon addition of excess GDP-beta-S or removal of Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1545459122,"We have characterized a deletion of approximately 9 kilobases which spans from intron 33 to exon 48 of one pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen allele in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The mutation results in the production of an in-frame species of mRNA which lacks the sequences corresponding to residues 595-1,008 of the triple-helical domain. Thus, half of the pro-alpha 1 (III) chains synthesized by the patient's fibroblasts are nearly 30% shorter than normal. The procollagen III molecules composed of either three normal length or three shortened chains are thermally stable and efficiently secreted. In contrast, the procollagen III molecules that contain one or two shortened chains are unstable and are not secreted. Failure to secrete unstable molecules and a residual functional role of the shortened but stable homotrimers may explain the somewhat milder phenotype of this individual compared with that of another Ehlers-Danlos type IV patient bearing a deletion of similar size in the amino-terminal portion of the alpha 1 (III) collagen chain."
https://openalex.org/W1600396376,"DIF-1 is a novel, chlorinated alkyl phenone from Dictyostelium which, at very low concentrations, induces amoebae to differentiate into stalk cells and may act as a morphogen in the formation of the prestalkprespore pattern during development. We report here the existence of a developmentally regulated metabolic pathway which inactivates DIF-1. Radioisotopically labeled DIF-1 was synthesized, incubated with developing cells, the metabolites recovered, and then analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and TLC. At least 12 metabolites are produced and the early steps of a complex metabolic pathway have been deduced by following the flow of counts from one metabolite to another and by determining the fate of purified metabolites when they are incubated with cells. The first metabolite, DM1, is largely cell-associated whereas the more distal ones are found mainly in the medium. Metabolism inactivates DIF-1, since DM1 retains only 7% of the specific activity of DIF-1 in the stalk cell differentiation bioassay and later metabolites possess even less activity. Metabolism is developmentally regulated, increasing toward the end of aggregation to reach maximal levels at the tipped mound stage, as endogenous DIF-1 levels are themselves rising. Cells at this stage of development possess the capacity to metabolize their endogenous DIF-1 with a half-life of a few minutes. We suggest that DIF-1 metabolism is important to prevent the DIF-1 receptor system from becoming saturated by excess ligand, thus allowing cells to respond to changes in DIF-1 production. Metabolism may also produce other effector molecules from DIF-1 or produce DIF-1 gradients in the aggregate by the localized destruction of DIF-1."

A partial cDNA for chicken T-protein was isolated by screening a chicken liver cDNA library with oligonucleotide probes based on amino acid sequences. The clone (CT5C) contains a 675-base pair insert encoding the C-terminal half of the T-protein. Screening of a bovine liver lambda gt10 cDNA library with the insert of CT5C as a probe detected a clone, BT5A, with an insert of about 2 kilobase pairs. The 1191-base pair coding region encodes a precursor protein of 397 amino acids (Mr 42,852) comprised of a 22-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence and a 375-residue mature protein (Mr 40,534). The 33 amino acids immediately following the targeting sequence correspond exactly to those determined by sequence analysis of the amino terminus of the purified bovine T-protein. The mature protein contains several hydrophilic segments with a cluster of arginine and lysine. The T-protein cDNA probe hybridized to an mRNA species of about 2 kilobases in bovine brain, lung, heart, and liver. A probe for H-protein hybridized with two species of mRNA in these tissues and weak signals were also found in spleen. Although the enzymatic activities of T-protein and H-protein were found in these tissues where transcripts were found, activity of P-protein was detected only in liver and brain.

The four copper ligand residues in this 106-residue-containing polypeptide chain are His54, Cys93, His96, and Met99. The Thiobacillus amicyanin is 52% similar to the amicyanin of Pseudomonas AM1, the only other copper protein known with the same spacing between the second histidine ligand and the methionine ligand. T. versutus amicyanin contains no cysteine bridge and is more closely related to the plant copper protein plastocyanin than to the bacterial copper protein azurin. Alignment of the two known amicyanin sequences with the consensus sequence of the plastocyanins and comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of poplar leaves plastocyanin reveals that the bacterial proteins have the same overall structure with two beta-sheets packed face to face. The major structural differences between the amicyanins and the plastocyanins appear to be located in two of the five loops that connect the six identified beta-strands of the amicyanins. The first of these two loops, connecting strands F and G, contains a ligand histidine and must have a different conformation from the same loop in the plastocyanins because it is shorter by two amino acids. Further differences occur in the loop connecting the strands D and E. This loop contains only 17 residues in amicyanin whereas the corresponding loop of plastocyanin contains 25 residues. Despite these differences the amicyanins appear much closer related to the plastocyanins than to the azurins. The present findings demonstrate that the occurrence of blue copper proteins with clearly plastocyanin-like features is not restricted to photosynthetic redox chains."

Previously, five of the synthetases were shown to be phosphorylated in reticulocytes, and the glutaminyl- and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases were shown to be selectively phosphorylated in response to 8-bromo cAMP (Pendergast, A. M., Venema, R. C., and Traugh, J. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5939-5942). Exposure of reticulocytes to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulates the selective phosphorylation of one synthetase in the complex, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. Only the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase is modified to a significant extent when the purified complex is phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C; up to 0.7 mol of phosphate is incorporated per mol of synthetase. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping shows a single tryptic phosphopeptide, which is identical for the enzyme modified in vitro by protein kinase C or in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated cells. Phosphorylation in vivo is reproducibly accompanied by a 38 +/- 10% reduction in aminoacylation activity of partially purified glutamyl-tRNA synthetase assayed in vitro. Phosphorylation in vitro has no detectable effect on aminoacylation. This difference may be due to the absence of a required effector molecule which alters activity by interaction with the phosphorylated synthetase. Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase is one of a growing number of translational components, including initiation factors, which are coordinately modified by protein kinase C in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate."

Profiles of pH dependence and transphosphorylation reaction indicate that the dephosphorylation step of the catalysis is enhanced in the presence of guanidinium chloride. We demonstrate, by fast-flow kinetics and inhibitor titrations, that guanidinium chloride enhances activity by abolishing negative cooperativity and by accelerating the dissociation of rate-limiting enzyme and substrate (E.P) complex."
https://openalex.org/W1586668251,"We recently showed that previously unknown di- and trihydroxylated C21-bile acids are major degradation products of sitosterol and campesterol in bile-fistulated female Wistar rats. Using a mixture of 4-14C- and 22-3H-labeled cholesterol it was shown that such C21-bile acids are formed also from cholesterol in amounts up to about 25% of the total formation of bile acids. The C21-bile acids were formed from labeled cholesterol also in perfused rat liver, demonstrating that the liver is the site of synthesis. The major trihydroxylated C21-bile acids in bile were identified, by means of mass spectrometry, NMR, stereospecific dehydrogenases, and reagents, as 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha, 11 beta, 15 beta-triol-21-oic acid and 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha, 11 beta, 15 alpha-triol-21-oic acid. The corresponding 11-oxo-isomers were also present. A minor trihydroxylated C21-bile acid was identified as 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha, 11 beta, 16-triol-21-oic acid. The major dihydroxylated C21-bile acid was identified by the same means as 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha, 12 alpha-diol-21-oic acid. Male rats converted 4-14C-cholesterol into C21-bile acids less efficiently than did female rats. None of the C21-bile acids from male rats contained a 15-hydroxyl group. It is speculated that the novel C21-bile acids are formed both from cholesterol and from plant sterols by an initial hydroxylation at C21 followed by peroxisomal or mitochondrial beta-oxidation. The presence of a hydroxyl group at C15 may facilitate this reaction. The above formation of C21-bile acids shows that mammalian liver is able to degrade the side chain of cholesterol beyond the C24 stage, even in the absence of a blocking group at C24. C21-bile acids, or one of their precursors, are hydroxylated in the liver by a hitherto unknown 11 beta-hydroxylase. The possible physiological importance of the C21-bile acids is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1490728160,"Novel phospholipids that function as mechanism-based inhibitors for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are described. PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester of these suicide-inhibitory bifunctionally linked substrates (SIBLINKS) followed by a cyclization reaction generates a cyclic anhydride at the active site of the enzyme which leads to inhibition. Structure/activity relationships for the SIBLINKS substituents in the sn-1 and sn-2 position are delineated. Time courses and efficiency of SIBLINKS inhibition are reported and compared for extracellular PLA2s obtained from Naja naja naja, porcine pancreas, bee venom, Crotalus atrox and Crotalus adamanteus. SIBLINKS-inhibited PLA2s cannot process either monomeric or micellar substrates consistent with inhibition at the catalytic site. Some SIBLINKS efficiently inactivate 1 mol of N. naja naja and C. adamanteus PLA2/6-10 mol of SIBLINKS hydrolyzed. Inhibition of N. naja naja PLA2 can be reversed by hydroxylamine, suggesting that a tyrosine residue is acylated."
https://openalex.org/W1542269313,"A eukaryotic sequence-specific endonuclease, Endo.SceI, causes sequence-specific double-stranded scission of double-stranded DNA to produce cohesive ends with four bases protruding at the 3' termini. Unlike in the case of restriction enzymes, an asymmetric 26-base pair consensus sequence was found around the cleavage site for Endo.SceI instead of a common sequence. We analyzed the base pairs that interacted with Endo.SceI on the recognition of its cleavage sites. A region comprising -10 through +16 base pairs from the center of the cleavage site was shown to be essential and sufficient for the sequence-specific cutting with Endo.SceI by experiments involving synthesized DNAs. Methylation interference experiments indicate that bases in the region comprising the +7 through +14 base pairs is involved in close contact with Endo.SceI in its recognition of the cleavage site. This +7 through +14-base pair region overlaps the most stringently conserved sequence in the consensus sequence for the cleavage site, suggesting that this region constitutes the core for the recognition by Endo.SceI."
https://openalex.org/W1548195762,"A comparison of the 3'—-5' proofreading properties between Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and DNA polymerase III' was conducted. This study indicated that the influence of the holoenzyme auxiliary subunits on the proofreading exonuclease parallels their effect on the elongation reaction. At physiological ionic strengths the auxiliary subunits markedly stimulated the exonuclease rate in an ATP-dependent reaction, while the exonuclease rate of DNA polymerase III' was not affected by ATP. E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein stimulated the 3'—-5' exonuclease activity of holoenzyme and inhibited DNA polymerase III'. Similarly, the auxiliary subunits and ATP converted the proofreading activity to a highly processive exonuclease. Our observation, that the exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme responded to ATP, salt, and E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein like the elongation activity, is consistent with the polymerase and exonuclease subunits acting within the same complex in a coordinated reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1536462314,"In order to elucidate late regulatory events which may be involved in the onset of S phase in B lymphocytes, we studied the effect of anti-Ig on phosphorylation of soluble proteins at late G1 phase. Stimulation of murine splenic B lymphocytes with anti-Ig and other mitogens for 18 h was found to be associated with a major increase in phosphorylation of an 85 kDa/pI approximately 5.3 cytosolic protein, conversely, stimulation of the cells with non-mitogenic stimuli did not induce the phosphorylation of pp85. The increase in phosphorylation of pp85 could not be detected after 30 min, was barely detectable after 6 h, but was very prominent after 18 h of stimulation with anti-Ig. Thus, the increase in phosphorylation of pp85 is not an early signal but is rather correlated with the late G1 phase. pp85 could not be detected in the nuclei of either control or stimulated cells. Stimulation of B cells for 30 min with forskolin induced the phosphorylation of pp85, while phorbol ester did not have any effect. The phosphorylation of pp85 was induced by the catalytic subunit of cAMP protein kinase. Comparison of the phosphopeptide map of pp85 phosphorylated by anti-Ig in intact cells to the phosphopeptide map phosphorylated by forskolin or by the catalytic subunit of cAMP protein kinase, showed a striking similarity indicating that cAMP protein kinase may be involved in phosphorylation of pp85 in mitogen-stimulated cells. An increase in intracellular cAMP levels at late G1 phase was found in B cells stimulated by mitogens. These results implicate an important role for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation events, specifically the phosphorylation of pp85/pI 5.3, at late G1 phase during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1577283269,"A tyrosine-protein kinase was purified more than 270-fold from the rat liver plasma membrane fraction by successive column chromatographies on Sephacryl S-300, wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, casein-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite, followed by isoelectrofocusing electrophoresis. The enzyme with pI of 6.2 was a 60-kDa single polypeptide which represented 42% of total protein. The enzyme reacted quantitatively with a monoclonal antibody to the amino-terminal sequence (Cys-3 to Ser-66) specific to the human c-yes protein, but not with antibodies to the specific amino-terminal sequences of the c-src, fyn, and lck proteins. The purified enzyme contained almost no phosphotyrosine residue but was autophosphorylated with Mg.ATP exclusively at tyrosine residues with concomitant increase in the kinase activity. The rates of autophosphorylation of the enzyme and phosphorylation of tyrosine-glutamate (1:4) copolymers, catalyzed by the enzyme were proportional to the square of enzyme concentration, suggesting that p60c-yes undergoes autophosphorylation through intermolecular catalysis, resulting in stimulation of the enzyme activity. Although the enzyme reaction showed an essential requirement for Mg2+ or Mn2+ with optimal concentrations of 20 and 3 mM, respectively, autophosphorylation significantly activated the enzyme only in the presence of Mg2+. Autophosphorylation of the enzyme reduced the Km for tyrosine-glutamate copolymers and tubulin, but not for ATP, and increased the Vmax of copolymer and tubulin phosphorylation."
