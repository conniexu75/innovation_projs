https://openalex.org/W1967277092,"Interactions of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) with supportive vasculature appear critical for their maintenance and function, although the molecular details are still under investigation. Neurotrophin (NT)-3 belongs to the NT family of trophic factors, best known for their effects in promoting neuronal survival. Here we show that NT-3 produced and secreted by endothelial cells of brain and choroid plexus capillaries is required for the quiescence and long-term maintenance of NSCs in the mouse subependymal niche. Uptake of NT-3 from irrigating vasculature and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces the rapid phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase present in the NSCs, leading to the production of NO, which subsequently acts as a cytostatic factor. Our results identify a novel interaction between stem cells and vasculature/CSF compartments that is mediated by an unprecedented role of a neurotrophin and indicate that stem cells can regulate their own quiescence in response to endothelium-secreted molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2033910468,"Defects in ependymal (E) cells, which line the ventricle and generate cerebrospinal fluid flow through ciliary beating, can cause hydrocephalus. Dishevelled genes (Dvls) are essential for Wnt signaling, and Dvl2 has been shown to localize to the rootlet of motile cilia. Using the hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-) mouse, we show that compound genetic ablation of Dvls causes hydrocephalus. In hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-) mutants, E cells differentiated normally, but the intracellular and intercellular rotational alignments of ependymal motile cilia were disrupted. As a consequence, the fluid flow generated by the hGFAP-Cre;Dvl1(-/-);2(flox/flox);3(+/-) E cells was significantly slower than that observed in control mice. Dvls were also required for the proper positioning of motile cilia on the apical surface. Tamoxifen-induced conditional removal of Dvls in adult mice also resulted in defects in intracellular rotational alignment and positioning of ependymal motile cilia. These results suggest that Dvls are continuously required for E cell planar polarity and may prevent hydrocephalus."
https://openalex.org/W1974608673,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common tumors and the molecular mechanism underlying its metastasis is still largely unclear. Here, we show that miR-25 was overexpressed in plasma and primary tumor tissues of GC patients with tumor node metastasis stage (III or IV) or lymph node metastasis. MiR-25 inhibition significantly decreased the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of GC cells in vitro, and reduced their capacity to develop distal pulmonary metastases and peritoneal dissemination in vivo. Furthermore, miR-25 repressed transducer of ERBB2, 1 (TOB1) expression by directly binding to TOB1-3'-UTR, and the inverse correlation was observed between the expressions of miR-25 and TOB1 mRNA in primary GC tissues. Moreover, the loss of TOB1 increased the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of GC cells, and the restoration of TOB1 led to suppressed metastasis, invasion and proliferation. The receiver operating characteristics analysis yielded an area under the curve value of 0.7325 in distinguishing the GC patients with death from those with survival. The analysis of optimal cutoff value revealed poor survival in GC patients with high plasma concentrations of miR-25 (>0.2333 amol/μl). Taken together, miR-25 promotes GC progression by directly downregulating TOB1 expression, and may be a noninvasive biomarker for the prognosis of GC patients."
https://openalex.org/W1978284249,"Psychologists have examined the many psychological barriers to both climate change belief and concern. One barrier is the belief that climate change is too uncertain, and likely to happen in distant places and times, to people unlike oneself. Related to this perceived psychological distance of climate change, studies have shown that direct experience of the effects of climate change increases climate change concern. The present study examined the relationship between physical proximity to the coastline and climate change belief, as proximity may be related to experiencing or anticipating the effects of climate change such as sea-level rise. We show, in a national probability sample of 5,815 New Zealanders, that people living in closer proximity to the shoreline expressed greater belief that climate change is real and greater support for government regulation of carbon emissions. This proximity effect held when adjusting for height above sea level and regional poverty. The model also included individual differences in respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. The results indicate that physical place plays a role in the psychological acceptance of climate change, perhaps because the effects of climate change become more concrete and local."
https://openalex.org/W2028100214,"Recognition of objects from partial information presents a significant challenge for theories of vision because it requires spatial integration and extrapolation from prior knowledge. We combined neurophysiological recordings in human cortex with psychophysical measurements and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms involved in object completion. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1,699 electrodes in 18 epilepsy patients to measure the timing and selectivity of responses along human visual cortex to whole and partial objects. Responses along the ventral visual stream remained selective despite showing only 9-25% of the object. However, these visually selective signals emerged ~100 ms later for partial versus whole objects. The processing delays were particularly pronounced in higher visual areas within the ventral stream, suggesting the involvement of additional recurrent processing. In separate psychophysics experiments, disrupting this recurrent computation with a backward mask at ~75ms significantly impaired recognition of partial, but not whole, objects. Additionally, computational modeling shows that the performance of a purely bottom-up architecture is impaired by heavy occlusion and that this effect can be partially rescued via the incorporation of top-down connections. These results provide spatiotemporal constraints on theories of object recognition that involve recurrent processing to recognize objects from partial information."
https://openalex.org/W2143280546,"Purpose To examine changes in hamstring muscle fatigue and central motor output during a 90-minute simulated soccer match, and the concomitant changes in hamstring maximal torque and rate of torque development. Method Eight amateur male soccer players performed a 90-minute simulated soccer match, with measures performed at the start of and every 15-minutes during each half. Maximal torque (Nm) and rate of torque development (RTD; Nm.s–1) were calculated from maximal isometric knee flexor contractions performed at 10° of flexion. Hamstring peripheral fatigue was assessed from changes in the size and shape of the resting twitch (RT). Hamstring central motor output was quantified from voluntary activation (%) and normalized biceps femoris (BF) and medial hamstrings (MH) electromyographic amplitudes (EMG/M). Results Maximal torque was reduced at 45-minutes by 7.6±9.4% (p<0.05). RTD in time intervals of 0–25, 0–50, and 0–75 ms post-contraction onset were reduced after 15-minutes in the first-half between 29.6 to 46.2% (p<0.05), and were further reduced at the end of the second-half (p<0.05). Maximal EMG/M was reduced for biceps femoris only concomitant to the time-course of reductions in maximal torque (p = 0.007). The rate of EMG rise for BF and MH was reduced in early time periods (0–75 ms) post-contraction onset (p<0.05). No changes were observed for the size and shape of the RT, indicating no hamstring peripheral fatigue. Conclusion Centrally mediated reductions in maximal torque and rate of torque development provide insight into factors that may explain hamstring injury risk during soccer. Of particular interest were early reductions during the first-half of hamstring rate of torque development, and the decline in maximal EMG/M of biceps femoris in the latter stages of the half. These are important findings that may help explain why the hamstrings are particularly vulnerable to strain injury during soccer."
https://openalex.org/W2051118371,"Microbial strains optimization for the overproduction of desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. The strains can be optimized through several techniques in the field of genetic engineering. Gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can engineer the metabolism of microbial cells with the objective to obtain desirable phenotypes. However, the complexities of the metabolic networks have made the process to identify the effects of genetic modification on the desirable phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to the combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene deletion strategy. Basically, the size of a genome-scale metabolic model is usually large. As the size of the problem increases, the computation time increases exponentially. In this paper, we propose Differential Bees Flux Balance Analysis (DBFBA) with OptKnock to identify optimal gene knockout strategies for maximizing the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. This proposed method functions by improving the performance of a hybrid of Bees Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis (BAFBA) by hybridizing Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm into neighborhood searching strategy of BAFBA. In addition, DBFBA is integrated with OptKnock to validate the results for improving the reliability the work. Through several experiments conducted on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium thermocellum as the model organisms, DBFBA has shown a better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes compared to the methods used in previous works."
https://openalex.org/W2000209130,"Plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) has a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by demethylating H3K9-Me2. Several genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region including the PHF2 gene is often deleted in some cancers including colorectal cancer, and this finding encouraged us to investigate the tumor suppressive role of PHF2. As p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in colon cancer, we tested the possibility that PHF2 is an epigenetic regulator of p53. PHF2 was associated with p53, and thereby, promoted p53-driven gene expression in cancer cells under genotoxic stress. PHF2 converted the chromatin that is favorable for transcription by demethylating the repressive H3K9-Me2 mark. In an HCT116 xenograft model, PHF2 was found to be required for the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin. In PHF2-deficient xenografts, p53 expression was profoundly induced by both drugs, but its downstream product p21 was not, suggesting that p53 cannot be activated in the absence of PHF2. To find clinical evidence about the role of PHF2, we analyzed the expressions of PHF2, p53 and p21 in human colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients. PHF2 was downregulated in cancer tissues and PHF2 correlated with p21 in cancers expressing functional p53. Colon and stomach cancer tissue arrays showed a positive correlation between PHF2 and p21 expressions. Informatics analyses using the Oncomine database also supported our notion that PHF2 is downregulated in colon and stomach cancers. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PHF2 acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer development and ensures p53-mediated cell death in response to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2000953416,"Background Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel widely expressed in skin tissues, and peripheral sensory nerve fibres. Activation of TRPV1 releases neuropeptides; the resulting neurogenic inflammation is believed to contribute to the development of pruritus. A TRPV1 antagonist has the potential to perform as an anti-pruritic agent. SB705498 is a TRPV1 antagonist that has demonstrated in vitro activity against cloned TRPV1 human receptors and when orally administered has demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in animal models and clinical studies. Objectives To select a topical dose of SB705498 using the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin; to confirm engagement of the TRPV1 antagonistic action of SB705498 and assess whether the dose selected has an effect on itch induced by two challenge agents. Methods A clinical study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers to assess the effects of 3 doses of SB705498 on skin flare induced by capsaicin. Subjects with a robust capsaicin response were chosen to determine if the selected topical formulation of SB705498 had an effect on challenge agent induced itch. Results Following capsaicin challenge the greatest average reduction in area of flare was seen for the 3% formulation. This dose was selected for further investigation. Itch intensity induced by two challenge agents (cowhage and histamine) was assessed on the Computerised Visual Analogue Scale. The difference in average itch intensity (Weighted Mean Over 15 Mins) between the 3% dose of SB705498 and placebo for the cowhage challenge was −0.64, whilst the histamine challenge showed on average a −4.65 point change. Conclusions The 3% topical formulation of SB705498 cream was clinically well tolerated and had target specific pharmacodynamic activity. However there were no clinically significant differences on pruritus induced by either challenge agent in comparison to placebo. SB705498 is unlikely to be of symptomatic benefit for histaminergic or non-histaminergic induced itch. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01673529"
https://openalex.org/W2080870771,"In Drosophila, the four inner photoreceptor neurons exhibit overlapping but distinct spectral sensitivities and mediate behaviors that reflect spectral preference. We developed a genetic strategy, Tango-Trace, that has permitted the identification of the connections of the four chromatic photoreceptors. Each of the four stochastically distributed chromatic photoreceptor subtypes make distinct connections in the medulla with four different TmY cells. Moreover, each class of TmY cells forms a retinotopic map in both the medulla and the lobula complex, generating four overlapping topographic maps that could carry different color information. Thus, the four inner photoreceptors transmit spectral information through distinct channels that may converge in both the medulla and lobula complex. These projections could provide an anatomic basis for color vision and may relay information about color to motion sensitive areas. Moreover, the Tango-Trace strategy we used may be applied more generally to identify neural circuits in the fly brain."
https://openalex.org/W2015861584,"The prokaryotic ubiquitous Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) operons encode a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin. The most accepted hypothesis of the physiological function of the TA system is the reversible cessation of cellular growth under stress conditions. The major TA family, VapBC is present in the spirochaete Leptospira interrogans. VapBC modules are classified based on the presence of a predicted ribonucleasic PIN domain in the VapC toxin. The expression of the leptospiral VapC in E. coli promotes a strong bacterial growth arrestment, making it difficult to express the recombinant protein. Nevertheless, we showed that long term induction of expression in E. coli enabled the recovery of VapC in inclusion bodies. The recombinant protein was successfully refolded by high hydrostatic pressure, providing a new method to obtain the toxin in a soluble and active form. The structural integrity of the recombinant VapB and VapC proteins was assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Physical interaction between the VapC toxin and the VapB antitoxin was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro by pull down and ligand affinity blotting assays, respectively, thereby indicating the ultimate mechanism by which the activity of the toxin is regulated in bacteria. The predicted model of the leptospiral VapC structure closely matches the Shigella's VapC X-ray structure. In agreement, the ribonuclease activity of the leptospiral VapC was similar to the activity described for Shigella's VapC, as demonstrated by the cleavage of tRNAfMet and by the absence of unspecific activity towards E. coli rRNA. This finding suggests that the cleavage of the initiator transfer RNA may represent a common mechanism to a larger group of bacteria and potentially configures a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation leading to the inhibition of global translation."
https://openalex.org/W2058314494,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that obesity is associated with inflammation of the respiratory tract and the pathogenesis of asthma. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in leptin-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and to suggest a molecular link between obesity and respiratory tract inflammation. We investigated whether leptin, a typical adipocytokine, plays a role in the expression of TNF-α through increased PLD1 activity in Raw 264.7. Leptin enhanced the activity of PLD1 through activation of PLCγ and Src, while PLD1 siRNA decreased the leptin-induced expression and production of TNF-α. Leptin-induced PLD activation was also inhibited by a PLCγ inhibitor (PAO) and Src kinase inhibitor (PP2), indicating that PLCγ and Src kinase are upstream activators of PLD1. Down-regulation of PLD1 also completely blocked activation of p70S6K, an activator of JNK. Leptin-induced expression of TNF-α was also prevented by inhibition of p70S6K and JNK. Taken together, these results indicate that PLD1 acts as an important regulator of leptin-induced expression of TNF-α by participating in the PLCγ/Src/PLD1/PA/p70S6K/JNK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1972863280,"Background Several members of the zinc finger protein family have been recently shown to have a role in cancer initiation and progression. Zinc finger protein 367 (ZNF367) is a member of the zinc finger protein family and is expressed in embryonic or fetal erythroid tissue but is absent in normal adult tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that ZNF367 is overexpressed in adrenocortical carcinoma, malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and thyroid cancer as compared to normal tissue and benign tumors. Using both functional knockdown and ectopic overexpression in multiple cell lines, we show that ZNF367 inhibits cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and adhesion to extracellular proteins in vitro and in vivo. Integrated gene and microRNA expression analyses showed an inverse correlation between ZNF367 and miR-195 expression. Luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-195 directly regulates ZNF367 expression and that miR-195 regulates cellular invasion. Moreover, integrin alpha 3 (ITGA3) expression was regulated by ZNF367. Conclusions/Significance Our findings taken together suggest that ZNF367 regulates cancer progression."

For enhancing the security and privacy of TMIS, it is important while challenging to enhance the TMIS so that a patient and a doctor can perform mutual authentication and session key establishment using a third-party medical server while the privacy of the patient can be ensured. In this paper, we propose an anonymous three-party password-authenticated key exchange (3PAKE) protocol for TMIS. The protocol is based on the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem. For security, we apply the pi calculus based formal verification tool ProVerif to show that our 3PAKE protocol for TMIS can provide anonymity for patient and doctor while at the same time achieves mutual authentication and session key security. The proposed scheme is secure and efficient, and can be used in TMIS."
https://openalex.org/W2075326011,"A central goal of enzymology is to understand the physicochemical mechanisms that enable proteins to catalyze complex chemical reactions with high efficiency. Recent methodological advances enable the contribution of protein dynamics to enzyme efficiency to be explored more deeply. Here, we utilize enzymological and biophysical studies, including NMR measurements of conformational dynamics, to develop a quantitative mechanistic scheme for the DNA repair enzyme AlkB. Like other iron/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AlkB employs a two-step mechanism in which oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate generates a highly reactive enzyme-bound oxyferryl intermediate that, in the case of AlkB, slowly hydroxylates an alkylated nucleobase. Our results demonstrate that a microsecond-to-millisecond time scale conformational transition facilitates the proper sequential order of substrate binding to AlkB. Mutations altering the dynamics of this transition allow generation of the oxyferryl intermediate but promote its premature quenching by solvent, which uncouples 2-oxoglutarate turnover from nucleobase oxidation. Therefore, efficient catalysis by AlkB depends upon the dynamics of a specific conformational transition, establishing another paradigm for the control of enzyme function by protein dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2032913057,"Background Several studies reported olfactory dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis. The estimate of the incidence of olfactory deficits in multiple sclerosis is uncertain; this may arise from different testing methods that may be influenced by patients' response bias and clinical, demographic and cognitive features. Aims To evaluate objectively the olfactory function using Olfactory Event Related Potentials. Materials and Methods We tested the olfactory function of 30 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (mean age of 36.03±6.96 years) and of 30 age, sex and smoking–habit matched healthy controls by using olfactory potentials. A selective and controlled stimulation of the olfactory system to elicit the olfactory event related potentials was achieved by a computer-controlled olfactometer linked directly with electroencephalograph. Relationships between olfactory potential results and patients' clinical characteristics, such as gender, disability status score, disease-modifying therapy, and disease duration, were evaluated. Results Seven of 30 patients did not show olfactory event related potentials. Sixteen of remaining 23 patients had a mean value of amplitude significantly lower than control group (p<0.01). The presence/absence of olfactory event related potentials was associated with dichotomous expanded disability status scale (p = 0.0433), as well as inversely correlated with the disease duration (r = −0.3641, p = 0.0479). Conclusion Unbiased olfactory dysfunction of different severity found in multiple sclerosis patients suggests an organic impairment which could be related to neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative processes of olfactory networks, supporting the recent findings on neurophysiopathology of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084282446,"Grey matter (GM) damage is a clinically relevant feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) that has been previously assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the basal ganglia and thalamus might be increased in MS patients, and correlates with disability scores. Despite the established role of the striatum and thalamus in motor control, mood and cognition, the impact of DTI changes within these structures on motor and neuropsychological performance has not yet been specifically addressed in MS. We investigated DTI metrics of deep GM nuclei and their potential association with mobility and neuropsychological function. DTI metrics from 3T MRI were assessed in the caudate, putamen, and thalamus of 30 MS patients and 10 controls. Sixteen of the patients underwent neuropsychological testing. FA of the caudate and putamen was higher in MS patients compared to controls. Caudate FA correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale score, Ambulation Index, and severity of depressive symptomatology. Putamen and thalamus FA correlated with deficits in memory tests. In contrast, cerebral white matter (WM) lesion burden showed no significant correlation with any of the disability, mobility and psychometric parameters. Our findings support evidence of FA changes in the basal ganglia in MS patients, as well as deep GM involvement in disabling features of MS, including mobility and cognitive impairment. Deep GM FA appears to be a more sensitive correlate of disability than WM lesion burden."
https://openalex.org/W1964168640,"To investigate the mechanism for low pH adaptation by a carboxylesterase, structural and biochemical analyses of EstFa_R (a recombinant, slightly acidophilic carboxylesterase from Ferroplasma acidiphilum) and SshEstI (an alkaliphilic carboxylesterase from Sulfolobus shibatae DSM5389) were performed. Although a previous proteomics study by another group showed that the enzyme purified from F. acidiphilum contained an iron atom, EstFa_R did not bind to iron as analyzed by inductively coupled plasma MS and isothermal titration calorimetry. The crystal structures of EstFa_R and SshEstI were determined at 1.6- and 1.5-Å resolutions, respectively. EstFa_R had a catalytic triad with an extended hydrogen bond network that was not observed in SshEstI. Quadruple mutants of both proteins were created to remove or introduce the extended hydrogen bond network. The mutation on EstFa_R enhanced its catalytic efficiency and gave it an alkaline pH optimum, whereas the mutation on SshEstI resulted in opposite effects (i.e. a decrease in the catalytic efficiency and a downward shift in the optimum pH). Our experimental results suggest that the low pH optimum of EstFa_R activity was a result of the unique extended hydrogen bond network in the catalytic triad and the highly negatively charged surface around the active site. The change in the pH optimum of EstFa_R happened simultaneously with a change in the catalytic efficiency, suggesting that the local flexibility of the active site in EstFa_R could be modified by quadruple mutation. These observations may provide a novel strategy to elucidate the low pH adaptation of serine hydrolases.

These observations may provide a novel strategy to elucidate the low pH adaptation of serine hydrolases. Serine hydrolases are an important class of hydrolytic enzymes that exist in all life and occupy ∼1% of the human proteome (1.Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F.

Carboxylesterases belong to one of the classes of serine hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis and transesterification of carboxyl esters (2.Arpigny J.L. Jaeger K.E.

The mechanism of the hydrolysis of esters is analogous to that of peptide hydrolysis that is catalyzed by serine peptidases, which utilize catalytic mechanisms known as the catalytic triad. The canonical catalytic triad of carboxylesterases is a hydrogen bond network of Ser-His-Asp (5.Wei Y. Contreras J.A. Sheffield P. Osterlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C.

Serine hydrolases with the canonical catalytic triad generally display their highest activity at a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. A study into the pH dependence of chymotrypsin showed its pH-activity profile to have pKa values of 7.0 and 8.9. Direct NMR analysis of chymotrypsin revealed that the pKa value of 7.0 was from the titration of the catalytic His residue (9.Zhong S. Haghjoo K. Kettner C. Jordan F.

Although an acidic pH is known to be severe for serine hydrolases, for a member of the sedolisin family, an exception has been discovered that allows it to function in acidic pHs (10.Oda K. New families of carboxyl peptidases: serine-carboxyl peptidases and glutamic peptidases.J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This acidophilic enzyme group has an overall fold that is similar to that of subtilisin, but it has a unique catalytic triad that consists of Ser-Glu-Asp (11.Wlodawer A. Li M. Gustchina A.

To date, a low pH adaptation of carboxylesterases has never been investigated because of a lack of examples of serine peptidases such as sedolisins. The general pH-activity profiles of carboxylesterases (i.e. showing its highest activities at neutral to alkaline pH) have limited their industrial applications when an acidic pH is required. We previously reported the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a carboxylesterase (SshEstI) from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae DSM5389. In terms of pH-activity profile, SshEstI was of a canonical type, which shows its highest activity at pH 8.0 or higher. Surprisingly, however, the proteomics analyses of the hyperacidophilic archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum have revealed that EstFa, a carboxylesterase from this organism, is a highly acidophilic enzyme (12.Golyshina O.V.

Although the canonical catalytic triad is conserved in the primary amino acid sequences of EstFa, the reported optimum pH for catalytic activity of this enzyme is ∼2.0–3.5, which is exceptionally low for the values of serine hydrolases (13.Ferrer M.

The authors reported that 86% of 186 Ferroplasma proteins, including EstFa, were shown to be iron-containing metalloproteins (12.Golyshina O.V. Golyshin P.N. Timmis K.N. Ferrer M. The ‘pH optimum anomaly’ of intracellular enzymes of Ferroplasma acidiphilum.Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the purity of the EstFa protein was not shown in the previous studies, and thus the importance of iron for EstFa catalysis remains unclear (12.Golyshina O.V. Golyshin P.N. Timmis K.N.

In the present study, the recombinant EstFa (termed EstFa_R) 4The abbreviations used are: EstFa_Rrecombinant EstFaITCisothermal titration calorimetrypNPp-nitrophenylAQGFN248A/P256Q/E257G/S283FPEQ249P/G250ENSA241N/F276SPESQ249P/G250E/F276SNPEA241N/Q249P/G250ENPESA241N/Q249P/G250E/F276S. was purified to homogeneity and enzymatically characterized. Unexpectedly, the recombinant protein displayed an activity without iron. The catalytic efficiency of EstFa_R was significantly lower than the value for SshEstI but even higher than the value reported previously for the enzyme purified from F. acidiphilum (13.Ferrer M. Golyshina O.V. Beloqui A. Golyshin P.N. Timmis K.N. The cellular machinery of Ferroplasma acidiphilum is iron-protein-dominated.Nature. 2007; 445: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). EstFa_R displayed a slightly acidophilic activity with a pH optimum of 5.0, which was still low for the values of carboxylesterases. The crystal structures of EstFa_R and SshEstI were determined and compared, and the structure of EstFa_R served as the first example of a protein from Ferroplasma. A detailed comparison of these two structures identified several structural features that were unique to EstFa_R. Based on these observations, detailed mutational, kinetic, and pH-dependent studies were carried out. The experimental data suggested that the extension of a hydrogen bond network around the active site of EstFa_R may have contributed to the lower catalytic efficiency and low pH adaptation of this enzyme. Possible contributions of other structural factors of EstFa_R for catalytic efficiency and low pH adaptation are also discussed. recombinant EstFa isothermal titration calorimetry p-nitrophenyl N248A/P256Q/E257G/S283F Q249P/G250E A241N/F276S Q249P/G250E/F276S A241N/Q249P/G250E A241N/Q249P/G250E/F276S. F. acidiphilum JCM10970 was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms, RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). p-Nitrophenyl (pNP) acetate and pNP butyrate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. pNP propionate and pNP caproate were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan. pNP caprylate was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan. Plasmid pET22b was obtained from Novagen, Madison, WI. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. The restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan or New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and PEG monomethyl ester 2000 were obtained from Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA. Other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, and Nacalai Tesque. Construction of the plasmid pTrc-SshEstI was described previously (14.Ejima K. Liu J. Oshima Y. Hirooka K. Shimanuki S. Yokota Y. Hemmi H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Molecular cloning and characterization of a thermostable carboxylesterase from an archaeon, Sulfolobus shibatae DSM5389: non-linear kinetic behavior of a hormone-sensitive lipase family enzyme.J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). F. acidiphilum (JCM10970) was cultured at 35 °C in a medium containing 0.04% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.02% (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% KCl, 0.01% K2HPO4, 2.5%FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.016% yeast extract. The pH of the mixture without yeast extract was adjusted to 1.6–1.8 with H2SO4, and the mixture was then filter-sterilized. Yeast extract, prepared as an autoclaved 10% (w/v) solution, was added to the mixture immediately prior to use at the specified concentration. F. acidiphilum genomic DNA was extracted according to the method of Bond et al. (15.Bond P.L. Smriga S.P. Banfield J.F. Phylogeny of microorganisms populating a thick, subaerial, predominantly lithotrophic biofilm at an extreme acid mine drainage site.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The EstFa gene was amplified via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA as a template and the PCR primers EstFaAseI and EstFaNotI (see supplemental Table 1S for nucleotide sequences). The PCR was carried out as follows: 2 min at 94 °C followed by 30 thermal cycles where one thermal cycle consisted of 98 °C for 10 s, a linear gradient of 55–58 °C in 30 s, and then 68 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragment was digested with AseI and NotI, and the resultant 1-kbp fragment was ligated with the NdeI/NotI-digested pET22b to obtain pET22-EstFa. Escherichia coli Mach cells were transformed with pET22-EstFa, and the transformant cells were grown in an LB medium containing 60 μg of ampicillin/ml. The recombinant plasmid was extracted from the cells using a GenEluteTM Plasmid Miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and sequenced using the primers EstFaseq185sense, EstFaseq299anti, and EstFaseq549 (supplemental Table 1S). To create the N248A/P256Q/E257G/S283F (AQGF) mutant of EstFa_R, in vitro mutagenesis of the EstFa gene was carried out by recombinant PCR with plasmid pET22-EstFa (see above) as a template. First, N248A and S283F mutations were prepared. Then, three DNA fragments with overlapping ends were generated by PCR using each possible pair of the following primers: Ps/Pa248, Ps248/Pa283, and Ps283/Pa (supplemental Table 1S). The resultant three fragments were mixed and processed with PCR using primers Ps and Pa to produce the N248A/S283F mutant of EstFa_R. Then, P256Q and E257G mutations were introduced into the N248A/S283F mutant. PCR was used to generate two DNA fragments with overlapping ends using the following primers: Ps/Pa256 and Ps256/Pa (supplemental Table 1S). The fragments were mixed and subjected to PCR using primers Ps and Pa to produce the N248A/P256Q/E257G/S283F mutant. The amplified fragment was digested with AseI and NotI, and the resultant 1-kpb fragment was ligated with the NdeI/NotI-digested pET22b. E. coli Mach cells were transformed with the resultant plasmid, pET22-AQGF, and E. coli transformant cells harboring the plasmid were grown in an LB medium containing 60 μg of ampicillin/ml. Mutants of SshEstI (A241N, F276S, Q249P/G250E (termed PE), A241N/F276S (termed NS), Q249P/G250E/F276S (termed PES), A241N/Q249P/G250E (termed NPE), and A241N/Q249P/G250E/F276S (termed NPES)) were created by in vitro mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The single A241N and F276S mutations and the double Q249P/G250E mutation were introduced into the plasmid pTrc-SshEstI to produce the plasmids pTrc-A241N, pTrc-F276S, and pTrc-PE, respectively. The plasmid pTrc-NS expressing the NS mutant was derived from the plasmid pTrc-F276S. The plasmids pTrc-PES and pTrc-NPE expressing the PES and NPE mutants, respectively, were derived from the plasmid pTrc-PE. The plasmids pTrc-NES, pTrc-NPS, and pTrc-NPES expressing the NES, NPS, and NPES mutants, respectively, were derived from the plasmid pTrc-NS. Sequences of mutagenesis primers are listed in supplemental Table 1S. For the expression of EstFa_R and its AQGF mutants, E. coli BL21(DE3) transformant cells harboring the plasmids pET22-EstFa and pET22-AQGF, respectively, were grown at 37 °C overnight by shaking in a liquid LB medium containing 60 μg of ampicillin/ml. The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold with the same medium, and the cells were further grown under the same conditions. When optical turbidity of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.3–0.5, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the broth at a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and the cells were grown at 30 °C for 7 h for induction. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The standard buffer that was used was 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. For the EstFa_R and its AQGF mutant, harvested cells were resuspended in the standard buffer and disrupted by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was filtered through a Minisart single use filter unit (non-pyrogenic hydrophilic; pore size, 0.2 μm; Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) and processed with an ÄKTA purifier protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a HiTrap Q HP column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the standard buffer. After washing the column extensively with the standard buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m; total gradient volume, 40 ml) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Active fractions were then processed with an ÄKTA purifier system equipped with a Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite column (1.0 × 10 cm, Type I, 40 mm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the standard buffer. After washing the column with the standard buffer, EstFa_R was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0.02–0.5 m; total volume, 100 ml) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Active fractions were collected and dialyzed against the standard buffer. The sample was then processed with an ÄKTA purifier system equipped with a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with the standard buffer. After washing the column with 5 bed volumes of this buffer, the carboxylesterase activity was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m; total gradient volume, 80 ml) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The purified enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration on a Centricon YM-10 membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Wild-type SshEstI and its mutants were heterologously expressed in E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity essentially as described previously (14.Ejima K. Liu J. Oshima Y. Hirooka K. Shimanuki S. Yokota Y. Hemmi H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Molecular cloning and characterization of a thermostable carboxylesterase from an archaeon, Sulfolobus shibatae DSM5389: non-linear kinetic behavior of a hormone-sensitive lipase family enzyme.J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, for the purification of enzymes other than the NPES and PES mutants, HiTrap Q HP chromatography was omitted. Instead, the crude extracts of these enzymes were subjected to heat treatment at 60 °C for 1 h followed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was subjected to chromatography on a Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite column as described above. Quantitative determination of iron in the purified EstFa_R was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS) using an 8800 Triple Quadruple ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies). Thermodynamic analyses for the interactions between EstFa_R and iron were performed by ITC using a MicroCal iTC200 system (GE Healthcare). The purified EstFa_R (10 μm) was dialyzed against buffers with either neutral pH (20 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm Na2S2O4, pH 7.0) or acidic pH (20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm Na2S2O4, pH 4.9), then placed in a calorimeter cell, and titrated with either FeSO4 or FeCl3 (1 mm each in the same buffers) under anaerobic conditions. The ligand solutions were injected 20 times in 2-μl portions over a period of 60 s. As a positive control, 10 μm apotransferrin (bovine; Sigma-Aldrich) was titrated with 1 mm FeSO4 under the same conditions at pH 7.0. Data acquisition and analysis were done using ORIGIN 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). The progress curves of the carboxylesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fatty acid pNP esters were followed by monitoring p-nitrophenol production at 348 nm (ϵ348, 5539 m−1 cm−1) in 1-cm-path length cells with a Hitachi double beam spectrophotometer (Model U-2000). Unless otherwise specified, the reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm KH2PO4-CH3COOH-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm pNP butyrate, 0.01% Triton X-100 (final concentrations), and enzyme in a final volume of 0.4 ml. The mixture without enzyme was preincubated at a specified temperature for 2 min, and the reaction was started by addition of the enzyme. Stock solutions of substrates were prepared by dissolving the substrates in acetonitrile. All initial velocity data were obtained in duplicate or triplicate and corrected for non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate. Data for initial velocity versus substrate concentration were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis using a computer program (SigmaPlot 12 Enzyme Kinetics module, Systat Software, Inc.) (16.Leatherbarrow R.J. Using linear and non-linear regression to fit biochemical data.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The pH-activity profiles of EstFa_R and its AQGF mutant were examined using 2 mm pNP butyrate as a substrate at 35 °C over a pH range of 2.5–8.5. The buffers used were as follows: pH 2.5–3.5, 50 mm glycine HCl or 100 mm sodium citrate; pH 3.0–5.0, 100 mm sodium acetate; pH 5.0–7.0, 100 mm MES-HCl; and pH 7.0–8.5, 100 mm HEPES-NaOH. The pH-activity profiles of SshEstI and its mutants were examined using 2 mm pNP butyrate as a substrate at 40 °C with the following buffers: pH 2.5–3.0, 50 mm glycine HCl; and pH 3.5–9.0, 50 mm KH2PO4-CH3COOH-NaOH. For stability studies of EstFa_R and its AQGF mutant, the enzyme was incubated at 35, 40, 45, and 50 °C (for the wild-type enzyme) or at 40, 50, and 60 °C (for AQGF) in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. At appropriate time intervals (1, 15, 30, and 45 min after incubation for EstFa_R and 1, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after incubation for AQGF mutant), an aliquot of the incubation mixture was withdrawn and immediately assayed for remaining activity as described above. For stability studies of the NPES mutant of SshEstI, the enzyme was incubated at 40, 50, and 60 °C in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. At 10, 20, and 30 min after incubation, an aliquot of the incubation mixture was withdrawn and immediately assayed for remaining activity as described with the noted exception of 50 mm KH2PO4-CH3COOH-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0 used as the buffer component. Protein crystals were obtained at 20 °C by vapor diffusion, mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution. The reservoir solutions for each protein were as follows: EstFa_R, 15% PEG 3350, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0; SshEstI, 13% PEG monomethyl ester 2000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; the PE mutant of SshEstI, 12% PEG 3000, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm phosphate-citrate, pH 4.2. Crystals were frozen at 90 K using 20% PEG 400 or 20% glycerol as cryoprotectants. X-ray diffraction data sets of the PE mutant of SshEstI, SshEstI, and EstFa_R were collected using an in-house CuKα source (Rigaku MicroMax HF007) and synchrotron radiation on beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) and beamline BL-17A at the photon factory (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan), respectively. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program (17.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of SshEstI was solved by the molecular replacement method using EST2 (Protein Data Bank code 1EVQ), a thermophilic carboxylesterase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius as a search model. The sequence identity of EST2 to SshEstI is 41.7%. The crystal structure of EstFa_R was solved using SshEstI (Protein Data Bank code 3WJ1) as a search model. The sequence identity of SshEstI to EstFa is 35.6%. Molecular replacement was performed using the MOLREP CCP4 suite (18.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). The structure of the PE mutant of SshEstI was solved by direct Fourier synthesis of an SshEstI model. The percentages of reflections used for the calculation of Rfree values were as follows: EstFa_R, 5%; SshEstI, 5.1%. The Rfree column in the data set of the PE mutant of SshEstI was extended from that of SshEstI. The Coot program (19.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) was used for manual model building, and the resultant model was refined in conjunction with model rebuilding using the Refmac program (20.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13853) Google Scholar). Omit maps on all residues in the models were prepared to remove initial model biases that may have been introduced. Molecular images were created using the PyMOL program (21.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics Systems. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2002Google Scholar). The Cα atoms of SshEstI and EstFa_R structures were superimposed using the DaliLite program (22.Holm L. Park J. DaliLite workbench for protein structure comparison.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potentials of protein structures were calculated by the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) program within the PyMOL program (23.Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Electrostatics of nanosystems: application to microtubules and the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). The enzymatic study of LigFa, a DNA ligase from F. acidiphilum, revealed its unusual iron requirement for activity and stability (24.Ferrer M. Golyshina O.V. Beloqui A. Böttger L.H. Andreu J.M. Polaina J. De Lacey A.L. Trautwein A.X. Timmis K.N. Golyshin P.N. A purple acidophilic di-ferric DNA ligase from Ferroplasma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because EstFa was also reported to contain one iron ion per protein monomer, we attempted to obtain an iron-containing form of EstFa_R. The EstFa gene was amplified from F. acidiphilum genomic DNA by PCR with primers based on its reported nucleotide sequence (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AJ850914). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into a pET22b vector, and several different E. coli host strains were transformed with the resultant plasmid termed pET22-EstFa. The transformant cells were grown in an LB medium supplemented with 100 μm FeCl2, and crude extracts were prepared and then dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 2.0. However, in all cases examined, the crude extracts displayed no carboxylesterase activity. By contrast, crude extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET22-EstFa without supplemental FeCl2 displayed a carboxylesterase activity at pH 5.0, although EstFa has been reported to show almost no activity at that pH value (12.Golyshina O.V. Golyshin P.N. Timmis K.N. Ferrer M. The ‘pH optimum anomaly’ of intracellular enzymes of Ferroplasma acidiphilum.Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To obtain a homogeneous preparation of EstFa_R, three successive chromatographies were performed (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Inductively coupled plasma MS analysis of the purified EstFa_R confirmed the absence of irons, indicating that iron is not necessary for carboxylesterase activity of EstFa_R, unlike the activity of LigF, which is completely dependent on iron (24.Ferrer M. Golyshina O.V. Beloqui A. Böttger L.H. Andreu J.M. Polaina J. De Lacey A.L. Trautwein A.X. Timmis K.N. Golyshin P.N."
https://openalex.org/W1974464636,"Sepsis and septic shock remain important medical problems with high mortality rates. Today's treatment is based mainly on using antibiotics to target the bacteria, without addressing the systemic inflammatory response, which is a major contributor to mortality in sepsis. Therefore, novel treatment options are urgently needed to counteract these complex sepsis pathologies. Heparin cofactor II (HCII) has recently been shown to be protective against Gram-negative infections. The antimicrobial effects were mapped to helices A and D of the molecule. Here we show that KYE28, a 28 amino acid long peptide representing helix D of HCII, is antimicrobial against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fungus Candida albicans. Moreover, KYE28 binds to LPS and thereby reduces LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses by decreasing NF-κB/AP-1 activation in vitro. In mouse models of LPS-induced shock, KYE28 significantly enhanced survival by dampening the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Finally, in an invasive Pseudomonas infection model, the peptide inhibited bacterial growth and reduced the pro-inflammatory response, which lead to a significant reduction of mortality. In summary, the peptide KYE28, by simultaneously targeting bacteria and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses represents a novel therapeutic candidate for invasive infections."
https://openalex.org/W2045101532,"Introduction There is a need to assess risk of second primary cancers in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, especially since PCa treatment may be associated with increased risk of second primary tumours. Methods We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary tumours comparing men diagnosed with PCa between 1980 and 2010 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (n = 20,559), and the general male population in the Canton. Results A total of 1,718 men developed a second primary tumour after PCa diagnosis, with lung and colon cancer being the most common (15 and 13% respectively). The SIR for overall second primary cancer was 1.11 (95%CI: 1.06–1.17). Site-specific SIRs varied from 1.19 (1.05–1.34) to 2.89 (2.62–4.77) for lung and thyroid cancer, respectively. When stratified by treatment, the highest SIR was observed for thyroid cancer (3.57 (1.30–7.76)) when undergoing surgery, whereas liver cancer was common when treated with radiotherapy (3.21 (1.54–5.90)) and kidney bladder was most prevalent for those on hormonal treatment (3.15 (1.93–4.87)). Stratification by time since PCa diagnosis showed a lower risk of cancer for men with PCa compared to the general population for the first four years, but then a steep increase in risk was observed. Conclusion In the Canton of Zurich, there was an increased risk of second primary cancers among men with PCa compared to the general population. Increased diagnostic activity after PCa diagnosis may partly explain increased risks within the first years of diagnosis, but time-stratified analyses indicated that increased risks remained and even increased over time."
https://openalex.org/W2078549219,"Diabetes is associated with endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation, both of which may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study was to characterize circulating platelets in diabetes and clarify their effects on endothelial function. Male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. Each experiment was performed by incubating carotid arterial rings with platelets (1.65×107 cells/mL; 30 min) isolated from STZ or control rats. Thereafter, the vascular function was characterized in isolated carotid arterial rings in organ bath chambers, and each expression and activation of enzymes involved in nitric oxide and oxidative stress levels were analyzed. Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by acetylcholine was significantly attenuated in carotid arteries treated with platelets isolated from STZ rats. Similarly, treatment with platelets isolated from STZ rats significantly reduced ACh-induced Akt/endothelial NO synthase signaling/NO production and enhanced TXB2 (metabolite of TXA2), while CD61 (platelet marker) and CD62P (activated platelet marker) were increased in carotid arteries treated with platelets isolated from STZ rats. Furthermore, the platelets isolated from STZ rats decreased total eNOS protein and eNOS dimerization, and increased oxidative stress. These data provide direct evidence that circulating platelets isolated from diabetic rats cause dysfunction of the endothelium by decreasing NO production (via Akt/endothelial NO synthase signaling pathway) and increasing TXA2. Moreover, activated platelets disrupt the carotid artery by increasing oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2108587689,"Biomethylation and volatilization of trace elements may contribute to their redistribution in the environment. However, quantification of volatile, methylated species in the environment is complicated by a lack of straightforward and field-deployable air sampling methods that preserve element speciation. This paper presents a robust and versatile gas trapping method for the simultaneous preconcentration of volatile selenium (Se), sulfur (S), and arsenic (As) species. Using HPLC-HR-ICP-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses, we demonstrate that volatile Se and S species efficiently transform into specific non-volatile compounds during trapping, which enables the deduction of the original gaseous speciation. With minor adaptations, the presented HPLC-HR-ICP-MS method also allows for the quantification of 13 non-volatile methylated species and oxyanions of Se, S, and As in natural waters. Application of these methods in a peatland indicated that, at the selected sites, fluxes varied between 190-210 ng Se·m(-2)·d(-1), 90-270 ng As·m(-2)·d(-1), and 4-14 µg S·m(-2)·d(-1), and contained at least 70% methylated Se and S species. In the surface water, methylated species were particularly abundant for As (>50% of total As). Our results indicate that methylation plays a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of these elements."
https://openalex.org/W2092503692,"Shrubs have expanded in Arctic ecosystems over the past century, resulting in significant changes to albedo, ecosystem function, and plant community composition. Willow and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus, L. muta) and moose (Alces alces) extensively browse Arctic shrubs, and may influence their architecture, growth, and reproduction. Furthermore, these herbivores may alter forage plants in such a way as to increase the quantity and accessibility of their own food source. We estimated the effect of winter browsing by ptarmigan and moose on an abundant, early-successional willow (Salix alaxensis) in northern Alaska by comparing browsed to unbrowsed branches. Ptarmigan browsed 82-89% of willows and removed 30-39% of buds, depending on study area and year. Moose browsed 17-44% of willows and browsed 39-55% of shoots. Browsing inhibited apical dominance and activated axillary and adventitious buds to produce new vegetative shoots. Ptarmigan- and moose-browsed willow branches produced twice the volume of shoot growth but significantly fewer catkins the following summer compared with unbrowsed willow branches. Shoots on browsed willows were larger and produced 40-60% more buds compared to unbrowsed shoots. This process of shoot production at basal parts of the branch is the mechanism by which willows develop a highly complex ""broomed"" architecture after several years of browsing. Broomed willows were shorter and more likely to be re-browsed by ptarmigan, but not moose. Ptarmigan likely benefit from the greater quantity and accessibility of buds on previously browsed willows and may increase the carrying capacity of their own habitat. Despite the observed tolerance of willows to browsing, their vertical growth and reproduction were strongly inhibited by moose and ptarmigan. Browsing by these herbivores therefore needs to be considered in future models of shrub expansion in the Arctic."

Available evidence has shown that ABCD1 and ABCD2 display a distinct but overlapping substrate specificity, although much remains to be learned in this respect as well as in their capability to form functional heterodimers. Using a cell model expressing an ABCD2-EGFP fusion protein, we first demonstrated by proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay that ABCD1 interacts with ABCD2. Next, we tested in the pxa1/pxa2Δ yeast mutant the functionality of ABCD1/ABCD2 dimers by expressing chimeric proteins mimicking homo- or heterodimers. For further structure-function analysis of ABCD1/ABCD2 dimers, we expressed chimeric dimers fused to enhanced GFP in human skin fibroblasts of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients. These cells are devoid of ABCD1 and accumulate very long-chain fatty acids (C26:0 and C26:1). We checked that the chimeric proteins were correctly expressed and targeted to the peroxisomes. Very long-chain fatty acid levels were partially restored in transfected X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy fibroblasts regardless of the chimeric construct used, thus demonstrating functionality of both homo- and heterodimers. Interestingly, the level of C24:6 n-3, the immediate precursor of docosahexaenoic acid, was decreased in cells expressing chimeric proteins containing at least one ABCD2 moiety. Our data demonstrate for the first time that both homo- and heterodimers of ABCD1 and ABCD2 are functionally active. Interestingly, the role of ABCD2 (in homo- and heterodimeric forms) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is clearly evidenced, and the chimeric dimers provide a novel tool to study substrate specificity of peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2001875300,"Pyrethroid insecticides, especially permethrin and deltamethrin, have been used extensively worldwide for mosquito control. However, insecticide resistance can spread through a population very rapidly under strong selection pressure from insecticide use. The upregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been reported upon pyrethroid treatment. In Aedes aegypti, the increase in ALDH activity against the hydrolytic product of pyrethroid has been observed in DDT/permethrin-resistant strains. The objective of this study was to identify the role of individual ALDHs involved in pyrethroid metabolism.Three ALDHs were identified; two of these, ALDH9948 and ALDH14080, were upregulated in terms of both mRNA and protein levels in a DDT/pyrethroid-resistant strain of Ae. aegypti. Recombinant ALDH9948 and ALDH14080 exhibited oxidase activities to catalyse the oxidation of a permethrin intermediate, phenoxybenzyl aldehyde (PBald), to phenoxybenzoic acid (PBacid).ALDHs have been identified in association with permethrin resistance in Ae. aegypti. Characterisation of recombinant ALDHs confirmed the role of this protein in pyrethroid metabolism. Understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance provides information for improving vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2032410590,"During Pavlovian incentive learning, the affective properties of rewards are thought to be transferred to their predicting cues. However, how rewards are represented emotionally in animals is widely unknown. This study sought to determine whether 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats may signal such a state of incentive motivation to natural, nutritional rewards. To this end, rats learned to anticipate food rewards and, across experiments, the current physiological state (deprived vs. sated), the type of learning mechanism recruited (Pavlovian vs. instrumental), the hedonic properties of UCS (low vs. high palatable food), and the availability of food reward (continued vs. discontinued) were manipulated. Overall, we found that reward-cues elicited 50-kHz calls as they were signaling a putative affective state indicative of incentive motivation in the rat. Attribution and expression of incentive salience, however, seemed not to be an unified process, and could be teased apart in two different ways: 1) under high motivational state (i.e., hunger), the attribution of incentive salience to cues occurred without being expressed at the USVs level, if reward expectations were higher than the outcome; 2) in all experiments when food rewards were devalued by satiation, reward cues were still able to elicit USVs and conditioned anticipatory activity although reward seeking and consumption were drastically weakened. Our results suggest that rats are capable of representing rewards emotionally beyond apparent, immediate physiological demands. These findings may have translational potential in uncovering mechanisms underlying aberrant and persistent motivation as observed in drug addiction, gambling, and eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2078982676,"Human deciduous and permanent teeth exhibit different developmental processes, morphologies, histological characteristics and life cycles. In addition, their pulp tissues react differently to external stimuli, such as the pulp sensitivity test, dental trauma and pulp therapy materials. These suggest differences in gene expression and regulation, and in this study we compared gene-expression profiles of the human dental pulp from deciduous and permanent teeth. Pulp tissues from permanent premolars and deciduous molars aged 11-14 years were extirpated and mRNA was isolated for cDNA microarray analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Other teeth were used for immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). Microarray analysis identified 263 genes with a twofold or greater difference in expression level between the two types of pulp tissue, 43 and 220 of which were more abundant in deciduous and permanent pulp tissues, respectively. qPCR analysis was conducted for eight randomly selected genes, and the findings were consistent with the cDNA microarray results. IHC confirmed that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) was broadly expressed in deciduous dental pulp tissue, but minimally expressed in permanent dental pulp tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that calbindin 1 (CALB1), leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor beta 1 (GABRB1) were abundantly expressed in permanent predentin/odontoblasts, but only minimally expressed in deciduous dental pulp tissue. These results show that deciduous and permanent pulp tissues have different characteristics and gene expression, suggesting that they may have different functions and responses to therapies focused on pulp or dentin regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2008120640,"Subtle behavioral and cognitive deficits have been documented in patient cohorts with orofacial clefts (OFCs). Recent neuroimaging studies argue that these traits are associated with structural brain abnormalities but have been limited to adolescent and adult populations where brain plasticity during infancy and childhood may be a confounding factor. Here, we employed high resolution magnetic resonance microscopy to examine primary brain morphology in a mouse model of OFCs. Transient in utero exposure to the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway antagonist cyclopamine resulted in a spectrum of facial dysmorphology, including unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate, cleft of the secondary palate only, and a non-cleft phenotype marked by midfacial hypoplasia. Relative to controls, cyclopamine-exposed fetuses exhibited volumetric differences in several brain regions, including hypoplasia of the pituitary gland and olfactory bulbs, hyperplasia of the forebrain septal region, and expansion of the third ventricle. However, in affected fetuses the corpus callosum was intact and normal division of the forebrain was observed. This argues that temporally-specific Hh signaling perturbation can result in typical appearing OFCs in the absence of holoprosencephaly—a condition classically associated with Hh pathway inhibition and frequently co-occurring with OFCs. Supporting the premise that some forms of OFCs co-occur with subtle brain malformations, these results provide a possible ontological basis for traits identified in clinical populations. They also argue in favor of future investigations into genetic and/or environmental modulation of the Hh pathway in the etiopathogenesis of orofacial clefting."
https://openalex.org/W2004375329,"Glycoside hydrolases catalyze the selective hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and their conjugates. β-glucosidases occur in all domains of living organisms and constitute a major group among glycoside hydrolases. On the other hand, the benzoxazinoids occur in living systems and act as stable β-glucosides, such as 2-(2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one)-β-D-gluco-pyranose, which hydrolyse to an aglycone DIMBOA. Here, we synthesized the library of novel 1,3-benzoxazine scaffold based aglycones by using 2-aminobenzyl alcohols and aldehydes from one-pot reaction in a chloroacetic acid catalytic system via aerobic oxidative synthesis. Among the synthesized benzoxazines, 4-(7-chloro-2,4-dihydro-1H-benzo[d][1,3]oxazin-2-yl)phenol (compound 7) exhibit significant inhibition towards glucosidase compared to acarbose, with a IC50 value of 11.5 µM. Based upon results generated by in silico target prediction algorithms (Naïve Bayesian classifier), these aglycones potentially target the additional sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (where a log likelihood score of 2.70 was observed). Furthermore, the in vitro glucosidase activity was correlated with the in silico docking results, with a high docking score for the aglycones towards the substrate binding site of glycosidase. Evidently, the in vitro and in vivo experiments clearly suggest an anti-hyperglycemic effect via glucose uptake inhibition by 4-(7-chloro-2,4-dihydro-1H-benzo[d][1,3]oxazin-2-yl)phenol in the starved rat model. These synthetic aglycones could constitute a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment, or re-enforcement of existing treatments, of type 2 diabetes and associated secondary complications."
https://openalex.org/W2006357633,"The submarine volcano eruption off El Hierro Island (Canary Islands) on 10 October 2011 promoted dramatic perturbation of the water column leading to changes in the distribution of pelagic fauna. To study the response of the scattering biota, we combined acoustic data with hydrographic profiles and concurrent sea surface turbidity indexes from satellite imagery. We also monitored changes in the plankton and nekton communities through the eruptive and post-eruptive phases. Decrease of oxygen, acidification, rising temperature and deposition of chemicals in shallow waters resulted in a reduction of epipelagic stocks and a disruption of diel vertical migration (nocturnal ascent) of mesopelagic organisms. Furthermore, decreased light levels at depth caused by extinction in the volcanic plume resulted in a significant shallowing of the deep acoustic scattering layer. Once the eruption ceased, the distribution and abundances of the pelagic biota returned to baseline levels. There was no evidence of a volcano-induced bloom in the plankton community."
https://openalex.org/W2019990055,"Cattle ticks are distributed worldwide and affect animal health and livestock production. White tailed deer (WTD) sustain and spread cattle tick populations. The aim of this study was to model the efficacy of anti-tick vaccination of WTD to control tick infestations in the absence of cattle vaccination in a territory where both host species coexist and sustain cattle tick populations. Agent-based models that included land cover/landscape properties (patch size, distances to patches) and climatic conditions were built in a GIS environment to simulate WTD vaccine effectiveness under conditions where unvaccinated cattle shared the landscape. Published and validated information on tick life cycle was used to build models describing tick mortality and developmental rates. Data from simulations were applied to a large territory in northeastern Mexico where cattle ticks are endemic and WTD and cattle share substantial portions of the habitat. WTD movements were simulated together with tick population dynamics considering the actual landscape and climatic features. The size of the vegetation patches and the distance between patches were critical for the successful control of tick infestations after WTD vaccination. The presence of well-connected, large vegetation patches proved essential for tick control, since the tick could persist in areas of highly fragmented habitat. The continued application of one yearly vaccination on days 1-70 for three years reduced tick abundance/animal/patch by a factor of 40 and 60 for R. annulatus and R. microplus, respectively when compared to non-vaccinated controls. The study showed that vaccination of WTD alone during three consecutive years could result in the reduction of cattle tick populations in northeastern Mexico. Furthermore, the results of the simulations suggested the possibility of using vaccines to prevent the spread and thus the re-introduction of cattle ticks into tick-free areas."
https://openalex.org/W2025118283,"Background Same-day diagnosis based on histology is increasingly being offered to patients suspected of breast cancer. We evaluated to which extent same-day diagnosis affected diagnostic accuracy and patients' anxiety levels during the diagnostic phase. Patients and methods All 759 women referred for same-day evaluation of suspicious breast lesions between November 2011–March 2013 were included. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by linking all patients to the national pathology database to identify diagnostic discrepancies, in which case slides were reviewed. Patients' anxiety was measured in 127 patients by the State Trait and Anxiety Inventory on six moments during the diagnostic workup and changes over time (< = 1 week) were analyzed by mixed effect models. Results Core-needle biopsy was indicated in 374/759 patients (49.3%) and in 205/759 (27%) patients, invasive or in situ cancer was found. Final diagnosis on the same day was provided for 606/759 (79.8%) patients. Overall, 3/759 (0.4%) discordant findings were identified. Anxiety levels decreased significantly over time from 45.2 to 30.0 (P = <0.001). Anxiety levels decreased from 44.4 to 25.9 (P = <0.001) for patients with benign disease, and remained unchanged for patients diagnosed with malignancies (48.6 to 46.7, P = 0.933). Time trends in anxiety were not affected by other patient or disease characteristics like age, education level or (family) history of breast cancer. Conclusion Same-day histological diagnosis is feasible in the vast majority of patients, without impairing diagnostic accuracy. Patients' anxiety rapidly decreased in patients with a benign diagnosis and remained constant in patients with malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1981550573,"Migration is a fundamental stage in the life history of several taxa, including birds, and is under strong selective pressure. At present, the only data that may allow for both an assessment of patterns of bird migration and for retrospective analyses of changes in migration timing are the databases of ring recoveries. We used ring recoveries of the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica collected from 1908–2008 in Europe to model the calendar date at which a given proportion of birds is expected to have reached a given geographical area (‘progression of migration’) and to investigate the change in timing of migration over the same areas between three time periods (1908–1969, 1970–1990, 1991–2008). The analyses were conducted using binomial conditional autoregressive (CAR) mixed models. We first concentrated on data from the British Isles and then expanded the models to western Europe and north Africa. We produced maps of the progression of migration that disclosed local patterns of migration consistent with those obtained from the analyses of the movements of ringed individuals. Timing of migration estimated from our model is consistent with data on migration phenology of the Barn Swallow available in the literature, but in some cases it is later than that estimated by data collected at ringing stations, which, however, may not be representative of migration phenology over large geographical areas. The comparison of median migration date estimated over the same geographical area among time periods showed no significant advancement of spring migration over the whole of Europe, but a significant advancement of autumn migration in southern Europe. Our modelling approach can be generalized to any records of ringing date and locality of individuals including those which have not been recovered subsequently, as well as to geo-referenced databases of sightings of migratory individuals."

All participants were asked to complete a nurse-administered standard questionnaire concerning age, sex, smoking status, and personal and family histories of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension and other diseases. The participants' body mass index scores, blood pressures and blood glucose levels at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min were measured in response to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test.The overall prevalence of diabetes increased from 27.93% to 34.78% between 2002 and 2012 in high-risk subjects. The study also showed that the prevalence increased much faster in male compared to female subjects. Specifically, an increased rate was seen in middle-aged men, with no change observed in middle-aged females over the eleven-year period.This study showed that sex, age, parental diabetic history, and being overweight were associated with an increased risk for diabetes in high-risk people. Therefore, as prediabetes and diabetes are highly prevalent in people with multiple diabetes risk factors in Shanghai, screening programs targeting these individuals may be beneficial."

First, the subjects were divided into two groups based on a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 7%. Each group was divided into two subgroups, with or without CKD. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CKD was defined as eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the 2hPG-FPG and eGFR. The 2hPG-FPG value was divided into four groups increasing in increments of 36 mg/dl (2.0 mmol/L): 0-72, 72-108, 108-144 and ≥144 mg/dl, based on the quartiles of patients with HbA1c levels ≥7%; then, binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between 2hPG-FPG and the risk of CKD.In the patients with HbA1c levels ≥7%, the 2hPG-FPG was significantly associated with decreased eGFR and an increased risk of CKD independent of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, smoking, and drinking, as well as fasting insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. The patients with 2hPG-FPG values ≥144 mg/dl showed an increased odds ratio (OR) of 2.640 (P = 0.033). Additionally, HbA1c was associated with an increased risk of CKD in patients with HbA1c values ≥7%.The short-term glucose variability expressed by 2hPG-FPG is closely associated with decreased eGFR and an increased risk of CKD in patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c≥7%)."
https://openalex.org/W2027704239,"Bone development and regeneration is associated with the Wnt signaling pathway that, according to literature, can be modulated by lithium ions (Li+). The aim of this study was to evaluate the gene expression profile during peri-implant healing of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) implants with incorporated Li+, while PLGA without Li+ was used as control, and a special attention was then paid to the Wnt signaling pathway. The implants were inserted in rat tibia for 7 or 28 days and the gene expression profile was investigated using a genome-wide microarray analysis. The results were verified by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Histomorphometry was used to evaluate the possible effect of Li+ on bone regeneration. The microarray analysis revealed a large number of significantly differentially regulated genes over time within the two implant groups. The Wnt signaling pathway was significantly affected by Li+, with approximately 34% of all Wnt-related markers regulated over time, compared to 22% for non-Li+ containing (control; Ctrl) implants. Functional cluster analysis indicated skeletal system morphogenesis, cartilage development and condensation as related to Li+. The downstream Wnt target gene, FOSL1, and the extracellular protein-encoding gene, ASPN, were significantly upregulated by Li+ compared with Ctrl. The presence of β-catenin, FOSL1 and ASPN positive cells was confirmed around implants of both groups. Interestingly, a significantly reduced bone area was observed over time around both implant groups. The presence of periostin and calcitonin receptor-positive cells was observed at both time points. This study is to the best of the authors' knowledge the first report evaluating the effect of a local release of Li+ from PLGA at the fracture site. The present study shows that during the current time frame and with the present dose of Li+ in PLGA implants, Li+ is not an enhancer of early bone growth, although it affects the Wnt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2062359063,"Actin filament-associated protein 1 (AFAP1) is an adaptor protein of cSrc that binds to filamentous actin and regulates the activity of this tyrosine kinase to affect changes to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In breast and prostate cancer cells, AFAP1 has been shown to regulate cellular responses requiring actin cytoskeletal changes such as adhesion, invadopodia formation and invasion. However, a normal physiologic role for AFAP1 has remained elusive. In this study, we generated an AFAP1 knockout mouse model that establishes a novel physiologic role for AFAP1 in lactation. Specifically, these animals displayed a defect in lactation that resulted in an inability to nurse efficiently. Histologically, the mammary glands of the lactating knockout mice were distinguished by the accumulation of large cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the alveolar epithelial cells. There was a reduction in lipid synthesis and the expression of lipogenic genes without a corresponding reduction in the production of β-casein, a milk protein. Furthermore, these defects were associated with histologic and biochemical signs of precocious involution. This study also demonstrated that AFAP1 responds to prolactin, a lactogenic hormone, by forming a complex with cSrc and becoming tyrosine phosphorylated. Taken together, these observations pointed to a defect in secretory activation. Certain characteristics of this phenotype mirrored the defect in secretory activation in the cSrc knockout mouse, but most importantly, the activity of cSrc in the mammary gland was reduced during early lactation in the AFAP1-null mouse and the localization of active cSrc at the apical surface of luminal epithelial cells during lactation was selectively lost in the absence of AFAP1. These data define, for the first time, the requirement of AFAP1 for the spatial and temporal regulation of cSrc activity in the normal breast, specifically for milk production."
https://openalex.org/W2167078439,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells and is strongly associated with the presence of islet autoantibodies. Autoantibodies to tyrosine phosphatase-like protein IA-2 (IA-2As) are considered to be highly predictive markers of T1D. We developed a novel lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on a bridging format for the rapid detection of IA-2As in human serum samples. In this assay, one site of the IA-2As is bound to HA-tagged-IA-2, which is subsequently captured on the anti-HA-Tag antibody-coated test line on the strip. The other site of the IA-2As is bound to biotinylated IA-2, allowing the complex to be visualized using colloidal gold nanoparticle-conjugated streptavidin. For this study, 35 serum samples from T1D patients and 44 control sera from non-diabetic individuals were analyzed with our novel assay and the results were correlated with two IA-2A ELISAs. Among the 35 serum samples from T1D patients, the IA-2A LFIA, the in-house IA-2A ELISA and the commercial IA-2A ELISA identified as positive 21, 29 and 30 IA-2A-positive sera, respectively. The major advantages of the IA-2A LFIA are its rapidity and simplicity."
https://openalex.org/W1999439489,"While DNA damage response pathways are well characterized in cancer cells, much less is known about their status in normal cells. These pathways protect tumour cells from DNA damage and replication stress and consequently present potential therapeutic targets. Here we characterize the response of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized normal human urothelial (NHU) and bladder cancer cell lines to agents that disrupt the DNA damage response. Effects of replication and DNA damage response inhibitors on cell cycle progression, checkpoint induction and apoptosis were analysed in hTERT-NHU and bladder cancer cell lines. The primary signalling cascade responding to replication stress in malignant cells (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related-checkpoint kinase 1 (ATR-CHK1)) is not activated in hTERT-NHU cells after treatment with a replication inhibitor and these cells do not depend upon CHK1 for protection from apoptosis during replication stress. Instead, ATM signalling is rapidly activated under these conditions. Intriguingly, an ATM inhibitor suppressed S-phase checkpoint activation after exposure to replication inhibitors and stopped entry of cells into S-phase indicating G1 checkpoint activation. Consistent with this, hTERT-NHU cells treated with the ATM inhibitor showed increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19INK4D, reduced levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4, and reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. In contrast, a bladder cancer cell line cotreated with ATM and replication inhibitors progressed more slowly through S phase and showed a marked increase in apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATM and CHK1 signalling cascades have different roles in tumour and normal epithelial cells, confirming these as promising therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2073202320,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a post-translational modification of various proteins and participates in the regulation of chromatin structure and transcription through complex mechanisms not completely understood. We have previously shown that PARP-1, the major family member of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases, plays an important role in the cell cycle reactivation of resting cells by regulating the expression of Immediate Early Response Genes, such as c-MYC, c-FOS, JUNB and EGR-1. In the present work we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the enzyme induces c-MYC transcription upon serum stimulation of quiescent cells. We show that PARP-1 is constitutively associated in vivo to a c-MYC promoter region recognized as biologically relevant for the transcriptional regulation of the gene. Moreover, we report that serum stimulation causes the prompt accumulation of ADP-ribose polymers on the same region and that this modification is required for chromatin decondensation and for the exchange of negative for positive transcriptional regulators. Finally we provide evidence that the inhibition of PARP activity along with serum stimulation impairs c-MYC induction by preventing the proper accumulation of histone H3 phosphoacetylation, a specific chromatin mark for the activation of Immediate Early Response Genes. These findings not only suggest a novel strategy by which PARP-1 regulates the transcriptional activity of promoters but also provide new information about the complex regulation of c-MYC expression, a critical determinant of the transition from quiescence to proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2082143854,"Females may select a mate based on signalling traits that are believed to accurately correlate with heritable aspects of male quality. Anthropogenic actions, in particular chemicals released into the environment, are now disrupting the accuracy of mating signals to convey information about male quality. The long-term prediction for disrupted mating signals is most commonly loss of female preference. Yet, this prediction has rarely been tested using quantitative models. We use agent-based models to explore the effects of rapid disruption of mating signals. In our model, a gene determines survival. Males signal their level of genetic quality via a signal trait, which females use to select a mate. We allowed this system of sexual selection to become established, before introducing a disruption between the male signal trait and quality, which was similar in nature to that induced by exogenous chemicals. Finally, we assessed the capacity of the system to recover from this disruption. We found that within a relatively short time frame, disruption of mating signals led to a lasting loss of female preference. Decreases in mean viability at the population-level were also observed, because sexual-selection acting against newly arising deleterious mutations was relaxed. The ability of the population to recover from disrupted mating signals was strongly influenced by the mechanisms that promoted or maintained genetic diversity in traits under sexual selection. Our simple model demonstrates that environmental perturbations to the accuracy of male mating signals can result in a long-term loss of female preference for those signals within a few generations. What is more, the loss of this preference can have knock-on consequences for mean population fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2090595274,"Many plants and ants engage in mutualisms where plants provide food and shelter to the ants in exchange for protection against herbivores and competitors. Although several species of herbivores thwart ant defenses and extract resources from the plants, the mechanisms that allow these herbivores to avoid attack are poorly understood. The specialist insect herbivore, Piezogaster reclusus (Hemiptera: Coreidae), feeds on Neotropical bull-horn acacias (Vachellia collinsii) despite the presence of Pseudomyrmex spinicola ants that nest in and aggressively defend the trees. We tested three hypotheses for how P. reclusus feeds on V. collinsii while avoiding ant attack: (1) chemical camouflage via cuticular surface compounds, (2) chemical deterrence via metathoracic defense glands, and (3) behavioral traits that reduce ant detection or attack. Our results showed that compounds from both P. reclusus cuticles and metathoracic glands reduce the number of ant attacks, but only cuticular compounds appear to be essential in allowing P. reclusus to feed on bull-horn acacia trees undisturbed. In addition, we found that ant attack rates to P. reclusus increased significantly when individuals were transferred between P. spinicola ant colonies. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chemical mimicry of colony-specific ant or host plant odors plays a key role in allowing P. reclusus to circumvent ant defenses and gain access to important resources, including food and possibly enemy-free space. This interaction between ants, acacias, and their herbivores provides an excellent example of the ability of herbivores to adapt to ant defenses of plants and suggests that herbivores may play an important role in the evolution and maintenance of mutualisms."

Herein the impacts of RMF on osteoporotic bone microarchitecture, bone strength and bone metabolism were systematically investigated in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats. Thirty two 3-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the Control (n = 10), HU (n = 10) and HU with RMF exposure (HU+RMF, n = 12) groups. Rats in the HU+RMF group were subjected to daily 2-hour exposure to moderate-intensity RMF (ranging from 0.60 T to 0.38 T) at 7 Hz for 4 weeks. HU caused significant decreases in body mass and soleus muscle mass of rats, which were not obviously altered by RMF. Three-point bending test showed that the mechanical properties of femurs in HU rats, including maximum load, stiffness, energy absorption and elastic modulus were not markedly affected by RMF. µCT analysis demonstrated that 4-week RMF did not significantly prevent HU-induced deterioration of femoral trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture. Serum biochemical analysis showed that RMF did not significantly change HU-induced decrease in serum bone formation markers and increase in bone resorption markers. Bone histomorphometric analysis further confirmed that RMF showed no impacts on bone remodeling in HU rats, as evidenced by unchanged mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, osteoblast numbers and osteoclast numbers in cancellous bone. Together, our findings reveal that RMF do not significantly affect bone microstructure, bone mechanical strength and bone remodeling in HU-induced disuse osteoporotic rats. Our study indicates potentially obvious waveform-dependent effects of electromagnetic fields-stimulated osteogenesis, suggesting that RMF, at least in the present form, might not be an optimal modality for inhibiting disuse osteopenia/osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040099343,"Aberrant signaling via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is implicated in numerous diseases including colon cancer. The heterotrimeric G proteins transduce signals from GPCRs to various effectors. So far, the G protein subunit Gβ5 has not been studied in the context of cancer. Here we demonstrate that Gβ5 protects colon carcinoma cells from apoptosis induced by the death ligand TRAIL via different routes. The Gβ5 protein (i) causes a decrease in the cell surface expression of the TRAIL-R2 death receptor, (ii) induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP and (iii) activates the NF-κB signaling pathway. The intrinsic resistance to TRAIL-triggered apoptosis of colon cancer cells is overcome by antagonization of Gβ5. Based on these results, targeting of G proteins emerges as a novel therapeutic approach in the experimental treatment of colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2057204342,"The Crk SH2/SH3 adaptor and the Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase were first identified as oncoproteins, and both can induce tumorigenesis when overexpressed or mutationally activated. We previously reported the surprising finding that inhibition or knockdown of Abl family kinases enhanced transformation of mouse fibroblasts by CrkI. Abl family inhibitors are currently used or are being tested for treatment of human malignancies, and our finding raised concerns that such inhibitors might actually promote the growth of tumors overexpressing CrkI. Here, we identify the Dok1 adaptor as the key effector for the enhancement of CrkI transformation by Abl inhibition. We show that phosphorylation of tyrosines 295 and 361 of Dok1 by Abl family kinases suppresses CrkI transforming activity, and that upon phosphorylation these tyrosines bind the SH2 domains of the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP. Knockdown of RasGAP resulted in a similar enhancement of CrkI transformation, consistent with a critical role for Ras activity. Imaging studies using a FRET sensor of Ras activation revealed alterations in the localization of activated Ras in CrkI-transformed cells. Our results support a model in which Dok1 phosphorylation normally suppresses localized Ras pathway activity in Crk-transformed cells via recruitment and/or activation of RasGAP, and that preventing this negative feedback mechanism by inhibiting Abl family kinases leads to enhanced transformation by Crk."
https://openalex.org/W1969653324,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial and polygenic disease. The aim of this study was to examine the association between six polymorphisms of four alcohol metabolism relevant genes (ADH1B, ADH1C, ALDH1b1, ALDH2) and the risk of CAD in Han Chinese.This was a hospital-based case-control study involving 1365 hypertensive patients. All study subjects were angiographically confirmed. Genotypes were determined with ligase detection reaction method. There was no observable deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for six examined polymorphisms in controls. The genotype and allele distributions of ALDH1b1 rs2073478 and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphisms differed significantly between the two groups (P≤0.005), even after the Bonferroni correction. The most common allele combination was A-C-C-G-C-G (alleles in order of rs1229984, rs1693482, rs2228093, rs2073478, rs886205, rs671) and its frequency was slightly higher in controls than in CAD patients (P = 0.067). After assigning the most common allele combination as a reference, allele combination A-C-C-T-C-A, which simultaneously possessed the risk alleles of rs2073478 and rs671 polymorphisms, was associated with a 1.80-fold greater risk of CAD. Further, a two-locus model including rs2073478 and rs671 that had a maximal testing accuracy of 0.598 and a cross-validation consistency of 10 (P = 0.008) was deemed as the overall best MDR model, which was further validated by classical Logistic regression model.Our findings provide clear evidence for both individual and interactive associations of ALDH1b1 and ALDH2 genes with the development of CAD in Han Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W1995243214,"Background Pulmonary edema plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced respiratory failure. In this study we determined whether treatment with TIP (AP301), a synthetic cyclic peptide that mimics the lectin-like domain of human TNF, decreases pulmonary edema in a mouse model of severe human RSV infection. TIP is currently undergoing clinical trials as a therapy for pulmonary permeability edema and has been shown to decrease pulmonary edema in different lung injury models. Methods C57BL/6 mice were infected with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and received TIP or saline (control group) by intratracheal instillation on day five (early administration) or day seven (late administration) after infection. In a separate set of experiments the effect of multiple dose administration of TIP versus saline was tested. Pulmonary edema was determined by the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio and was assessed at different time-points after the administration of TIP. Secondary outcomes included clinical scores and lung cellular response. Results TIP did not have an effect on pulmonary edema in different dose regimens at different time points during PVM infection. In addition, TIP administration did not affect clinical severity scores or lung cellular response. Conclusion In this murine model of severe RSV infection TIP did not affect pulmonary edema nor course of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012209059,"Objective To investigate a novel method, namely using bilateral internal iliac artery ligation combined with a high-fat diet (BCH), for establishing a rat model of erectile dysfunction (ED) that, compared to classical approaches, more closely mimics the chronic pathophysiology of human ED after acute ischemic insult. Materials and Methods Forty 4-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly placed into five groups (n = 8 per group): normal control (NC), bilateral internal iliac artery ligation (BIIAL), high-fat diet (HFD), BCH, and mock surgery (MS). All rats were induced for 12 weeks. Copulatory behavior, intracavernosal pressure (ICP), ICP/mean arterial pressure, hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining, serum lipid levels, and endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunohistochemical staining of the cavernous smooth muscle and endothelium were assessed. Data were analyzed by SAS 8.0 for Windows. Results Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the HFD and BCH groups than the NC and MS groups. High density lipoprotein levels were significantly lower in the HFD and BCH groups than the NC and MS groups. The ICP values and mount and intromission numbers were significantly lower in the BIIAL, HFD, and BCH groups than in the NC and MS groups. ICP was significantly lower in the BCH group than in the BIIAL and HFD groups. Cavernous smooth muscle and endothelial damage increased in the HFD and BCH groups. Cavernous smooth muscle to collagen ratio, nNOS and eNOS staining decreased significantly in the BIIAL, HFD, and BCH groups compared to the NC and MS groups. Conclusions The novel BCH model mimics the chronic pathophysiology of ED in humans and avoids the drawbacks of traditional ED models."
https://openalex.org/W2084408481,"Ania Lindl. is a small genus of the tribe Collabieae subtribe Collabiinae (Orchidaceae). For the last 150 years, it has generally been treated as a synonym of Tainia Blume. In this study, we critically re-examined morphological characters that have been used to distinguish Ania from Tainia, and assessed the phylogeny of Tainia using morphological and palynological characters. Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS, chloroplast trnL intron and combined DNA data sets were analysed to clarify the delimitation and the phylogeny of these groups. The morphological and palynological survey revealed a number of useful diagnostic characters which permit a clear definition of Ania, after the exclusion of a single taxonomically questionable species. Results confirmed that Ania is distinct from Tainia. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data provided the greatest resolution and produced a morphologically well differentiated clade of Ania. In addition to morphological and suggested palynological characters, the phylogenies were also supported by karyological evidence. Our results support the independent generic status of Ania. The genus name Ania is revived and re-established."
https://openalex.org/W1994166415,"Background Due to the high risk and severity of recurrence after stroke attack, recurrence is a major reason contributing to the disease burden. This study aims to determine whether recurrence is a significant contributor of hospitalization cost in items for ischemic stroke patients. Methods This study assessed acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to an academic medical center in 2003 through 2009. The t-test and Chi-square tests were used to compare first-ever and recurrent ischemic stroke groups in terms of total and categorized hospitalization cost, and multiple regression was performed to assess the influence of stroke recurrence. Results Recurrent ischemic strokes were associated with higher total cost, but examination cost showed no difference between the two groups. The recurrent stroke group showed higher laboratory but lower imaging cost. Of imaging studies, there was no significant difference in computed tomography scan cost while the first-ever stroke group spent more on magnetic resonance imaging and sonography. Controlling for other influential factors, recurrence was discovered to be a significant factor in lowering examination cost. Conclusions The findings of stroke recurrence in lowering examination cost could be explained from two perspectives, different clinical patterns of healthcare utilization and patients' economic status in recurrent stroke."
