https://openalex.org/W2135512849,"A possible mechanism for the frequently proposed involvement of phosphofructokinase in regulation of the rate of carbohydrate metabolism was suggested by the finding of Lardy and Parks (1) that this enzyme is inhibited by excess adenosine triphosphate. Mansour and Mansour (2) showed phosphofructokinase of the liver fluke to be stimulated by cyclic adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate. Inhibition of the corresponding enzyme from guinea pig heart by ATP is overcome by 3’, 5’-AMP, 5’-AMP, or ADP (3). Similar properties of phosphofructokinase from skeletal muscle were suggested as a possible explanation of the Pasteur effect (4). Since 3’,5’-AMP seems to be generally associated with hormonal control mechanisms, we investigated the properties of phosphofructokinase from yeast, the classical organism for study of the Pasteur effect and one presumably lacking hormones. The effect of 5’-AMP on the kinetics of yeast DPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (5) had led us to suspect that this nucleotide may play an important role in the control of energy metabolism in yeast. The results presented here suggest that the ratio of the concentrations of AMP and ATP may regulate the activity of phosphofructokinase in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1522398392,"Abstract : The generic term carboxypeptidase A applies to an enzyme which can be prepared by three different procedures yielding preparations which differ from each other chemically in amino acid composition, in NH2-terminal residues, and in solubility. In the present study, the terminal amino acid residues of each of the preparations were identified. In addition, quantitative data are presented to demonstrate a hitherto undetected heterogeneity in the COOH-terminal region of these enzymes. This heterogeneity involves a single amino acid replacement which probably is an expression of a genetic trait. (Author)"

https://openalex.org/W1977585579,"DURING the course of examinations on the effects of magnesium deficiency in rats1–4, tumours of the thymus developed in a few animals after prolonged periods of deficiency. This incidental finding stimulated a special investigation. Twelve male Holtzman Sprague–Dawley rats (110–125 g body-weight) were fed a magnesium-deficient diet3 for 95 days; twenty controls received the same diet to which was added 0.6 g of magnesium sulphate per 100 g of diet. Only five deficient rats survived until the end of the experiment. Convulsive seizures accounted for most deaths during the first weeks. Animals dying later showed extensive pleural effusion and ascitis; chronic lung disease with bronchiectatic abscesses was also observed. One rat died with a large thymus weighing 1.6 g after 75 days of magnesium deficiency. Microscopic examination revealed a total replacement of the normal architecture of the gland by sheets of large lymphoid cells. Another abnormal thymus was found at autopsy at the end of the experiment. In this case, thymic tissue had extended in all directions, infiltrating the base of the heart as well as the wall of the oesophagus; the same tissue had also grown retrosternally, reaching the diaphragm. Histologically the appearance was again characterized by a predominance of large lymphocytes or lymphoblasts with numerous mitotic figures (Fig. 1). Limited infiltration with similar cells was also seen in the portal spaces of the liver, in the kidney and in the adrenal cortex. The spleen and lymph nodes were not prominently enlarged and the blood was aleuksemic in both cases. The tumour was transplanted subcutaneously in Sprague–Dawley rats and grew rapidly, killing its host in 20–25 days. No tumour of the thymus was found in rats that were not magnesium-deficient."

https://openalex.org/W147153554,"Human carbonic anhydrase B loses enzymatic activity as it undergoes an irreversible conformational change near pH 4 (1). Riddiford (2) further found that seven of the eleven histidyl groups, which are unreactive in the native protein, become titratable during this change. Also, five or six of the eight tyrosyl groups do not ionize freely and reversibly in the native protein (2, 3). Human carbonic anhydrase C has a much greater specific activity (4) and a higher isoelectric point than carbonic anhydrase B (l), but its titration behavior is very similar to that of enzyme B (5). Seven of the twelve imidazole groups are normalized near pH 4.5 (at a slightly higher pH than the value of 4.2 found for enzyme B), coincident with a loss in enzymatic activity. Also, as in carbonic anhydrase B, only two of the eight tyrosyl groups titrate normally. However, enzyme C is more labile above pH 12.25 than is B.l Difference spectra between native and acidified carbonic anhydrase B were first studied by Ghazanfar in this laboratory (1). He observed three characteristic peaks in the difference spectra, at 236, 285, and 291.5 mp. The first of these is the most intense. He showed that there is a very abrupt transition when AQ is plotted against pH. The resulting curve is qualitatively similar to an ordinary titration curve, but is much steeper. At an ionic strength of 0.05 the midpoint of the curve (pH,id) lies near pH 3.5, or slightly above. Here we report studies of the pH dependence of the acid difference spectra at I’/2 = 0.05 and at P/2 = 0.15 of carbonic anhydrases B and C. The difference spectra are time dependent, as Ghazanfar had already found, and we have studied the changes with time in further detail."

https://openalex.org/W2070636110,"WE, and many of our colleagues, did not appreciate the danger of chloroform to adult male mice until the following accident happened in our animal house. Our mouse population included two pure strains, one albino (A.SW), and one brown (CBA-p). There were breeding pairs with litters and non-mated adult stock mice, all in cages kept close together. We found two adult male brown mice dead one morning, and several others apparently very ill. Throughout the following week other mice were affected until our entire stock of adult male brown mice had died."

https://openalex.org/W2046952359,"A WEAK: electrical stimulus on the receptive field of N. trigeminus (parts II and III) in infants between a few weeks and 12 months old is followed by a discharge in the nerves of the muscles, biceps and triceps brachii, and biceps and quadriceps femori, without any visible movement. The activity of these muscles is synchronized. No reciprocal pattern could be detected. We found two groups of latencies—one with a maximum at 140 msec and a second between 300 and 400 msec (Fig. 1). Stimulation of regions other than that supplied by the trigeminal nerve is without effect, unless the stimulus is very strong—a fact which is in accordance with the work of Hooker1 on human fœtuses. We suppose that the myographically- tested reactions of muscles of the extremities have nothing to do with the Moro-reflex, or common fright reaction, which is often seen after very strong visual, acoustic or tactile stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2015194549,"IN the course of investigations using jaundiced Gunn1 rats, serum enzyme examinations were performed on these rats and on those of a Wistar strain. Jaundiced homozygous Gunn rats are lacking in hepatic glucuronyl transferase using bilirubin as a substrate. Many workers have established that hepatic cellular damage is associated with elevation of certain serum enzymes, and an investigation was undertaken to compare the serum enzyme levels in jaundiced Gunn rats and those of a Wistar strain to determine whether the jaundice was associated with raised serum enzyme activities."
