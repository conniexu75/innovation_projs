https://openalex.org/W2905160435,"Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are highly effective in managing Type 2 diabetes if taken appropriately. This study assessed adherence to OHAs among patients with Type 2 diabetes and explored factors associated with adherence behaviour.Mixed methods were used comprising a cross-sectional study using the Arabic version of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale followed by semi-structured interviews using the Theoretical Domain Framework to explore key determinants of adherence.The cross-sectional study included 395 patients of whom 40% achieved a high level of OHA adherence. Lower adherence was associated with younger age (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.084; 95% CI 1.056 to 1.112), higher numbers of non-OHAs (OR 0.848; 95% CI 0.728 to 0.986) and higher HbA1c levels (OR 0.808; 95% CI 0.691 to 0.943). Semi structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domain Framework were completed with 20 patients and identified a wide range of factors potentially associated with OHA adherence, particularly behavioural related factors (e.g. scheduling medication intake, ability to develop a habitual behaviour), social influences (e.g. acting as a role model, the effect of family support), and gaps in knowledge about diabetes and its management with OHAs.This unique mixed-methods study has highlighted possible reasons for the low levels of OHA adherence in this patient population. Whilst the theoretically-derived determinants of behaviour illustrate the complexities associated with OHA adherence, they also provide a robust underpinning for future intervention(s) development to improve adherence and maximise patient health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2905040819,"Purpose To evaluate structural changes in the choroid among patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), with varying grades of diabetic retinopathy (DR), using enhance depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography (EDI SD-OCT) scans. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 82 eyes with DR and DME and 86 healthy control eyes. Eyes with DME were classified according to the severity of DR as per the international DR severity scale. Sub foveal choroidal thickness (SFCT)was obtained using EDI SD-OCT scans. These scans were binarized into luminal and stromal areas, to derive the choroidal vascularity index (CVI). CVI and SFCT were analyzed between the study and control group using paired-T test. Tukey’s test was used to correlate the differences in CVI and SFCT between different grades of DR. Further analysis was done to look for the effect of DR severity and type of DME on CVI as well as SFCT using correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. Results SFCT was significantly increased in eyes with DME as compared to the controls (334.47±51.81μm vs 284.53±56.45μm, p<0.001), and showed an ascending trend with worsening of DR, though this difference was not statistically significant [mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) = 304.33±40.39μm, moderate NPDR = 327.81±47.39μm, severe NPDR = 357.72±62.65μm, proliferative DR (PDR) = 334.59±47.4μm, p-0.09]. CVI was significantly decreased in DME with DR eyes as compared to controls (63.89±1.89 vs 67.51±2.86, p<0.001). CVI was also significantly decreased with worsening DR (mild NPDR = 66.38±0.3, moderate NPDR = 65.28±0.37, severe NPDR = 63.50±0.47, PDR = 61.27±0.9, p<0.001). Conclusion SFCT and CVI are dynamic parameters that are affected by DME. Unlike CVI, SFCT is also affected by ocular and systemic factors like edema and hypertension. CVI may be a more accurate surrogate marker for DME and DR and can potentially be used to monitor the progression of DR."
https://openalex.org/W2903904558,"The NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 is unique amongst sirtuins as it is effective in the cytosol, as well as the mitochondria. Defining the role of cytosolic acetylation state in specific tissues is difficult since even physiological effects at the whole body level are unknown. We hypothesized that genetic SIRT2 knockout (KO) would lead to impaired insulin action, and that this impairment would be worsened in HF fed mice. Insulin sensitivity was tested using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in SIRT2 KO mice and WT littermates. SIRT2 KO mice exhibited reduced skeletal muscle insulin-induced glucose uptake compared to lean WT mice, and this impairment was exacerbated in HF SIRT2 KO mice. Liver insulin sensitivity was unaffected in lean SIRT2 KO mice. However, the insulin resistance that accompanies HF-feeding was worsened in SIRT2 KO mice. It was notable that the effects of SIRT2 KO were largely disassociated from cytosolic acetylation state, but were closely linked to acetylation state in the mitochondria. SIRT2 KO led to an increase in body weight that was due to increased food intake in HF fed mice. In summary, SIRT2 deletion in vivo reduces muscle insulin sensitivity and contributes to liver insulin resistance by a mechanism that is unrelated to cytosolic acetylation state. Mitochondrial acetylation state and changes in feeding behavior that result in increased body weight correspond to the deleterious effects of SIRT2 KO on insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2905212646,"With the popularity of social networking sites (SNSs), the problems of SNS addiction have been increasing. Research has revealed the association between SNS addiction and irrational procrastination. However, the mechanism underlying this relation is still unclear. The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of social networking site fatigue and the moderating role of effortful control in this link among Chinese undergraduate students. The Social Networking Site Addiction Scale, Social Networking Service Fatigue Scale, Effortful Control Scale and Irrational Procrastination Scale were completed by 1,085 Chinese undergraduate students. Results indicated that SNS addiction, SNS fatigue and irrational procrastination were positively correlated with each other, and negatively correlated with effortful control. Further analyses revealed that, SNS addiction has a direct effect on irrational procrastination. SNS fatigue mediated the relationship between SNS addiction and irrational procrastination. Both direct and indirect effects of SNS addiction on irrational procrastination were moderated by effortful control. Specifically, this effect was stronger for people with lower effortful control. These findings help clarify the mechanism underlying the association between SNS addiction and irrational procrastination, which have potential implications for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2978277525,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs, which increasingly drawn researchers' attention in recent years as their importance in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. With the development of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, circRNAs have been widely analysed in animals, but the understanding of characteristics and function of circRNAs is limited in plants, especially in maize. Here, 3715 unique circRNAs were predicted in Zea mays systematically, and 8 of 12 circRNAs were validated by experiments. By analysing circRNA sequence, the events of alternative circularization phenomenon were found prevailed in maize. By comparing circRNAs in different species, it showed that part circRNAs are conserved across species, for example, there are 273 circRNAs conserved between maize and rice. Although most of the circRNAs have low expression levels, we found 149 differential expressed circRNAs responding to heat, cold, or drought, and 1782 tissue-specific expressed circRNAs. The results showed that those circRNAs may have potential biological functions in specific situations. Finally, two different methods were used to search circRNA functions, which were based on circRNAs originated from protein-coding genes and circRNAs as miRNA decoys. 346 circRNAs could act as miRNA decoys, which might modulate the effects of multiple molecular functions, including binding, catalytic activity, oxidoreductase activity, and transmembrane transporter activity. In summary, maize circRNAs were identified, classified and characterized systematically. We also explored circRNA functions, suggesting that circRNAs are involved in multiple molecular processes and play important roles in regulating of gene expression. Our results provide a rich resource for further study of maize circRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2904360036,"In the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS), malaria elimination efforts are targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoirs. Understanding community perceptions about asymptomatic malaria infections and interventions that target this reservoir is critical to the design of community engagement. This article examines knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices related to asymptomatic malaria infections and mass drug administration (MDA) in malaria-endemic villages in southern Savannakhet Province, Laos.A questionnaire consisting of questions on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices on malaria and MDA was administered to each household head or representative (n = 281) in four villages. These topics were also further discussed in 12 single-gender focus group discussions (FGDs). The FGDs were conducted in all four villages and consisted of eight to 10 participants.A minority (14.2%; 40/281) of respondents agreed that a seemingly healthy person could have malaria parasite in his or her blood. Half (52%; 146/281) disagreed and one third (33.8%, 95/281) were unsure. Respondents who responded that ""MDA aims to cure everyone"" [AOR = 4.6; CI: 1.6-13.1], ""MDA is to make our community malaria free"" [AOR = 3.3; CI: 1.3-8.1] and ""I will take part in future MDA"" [AOR = 9.9; CI: 1.2-78.8] were more likely to accept the idea of asymptomatic malaria. During FGDs, respondents recalled signs and symptoms of malaria (fever, chills and headache), and described malaria as a major health problem. Symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections were associated with their work in the forest and living conditions. Measures described to eliminate malaria included using mosquito nets, wearing long-sleeved clothes and taking medicine when symptomatic. Most respondents were unaware of MDA as a tool to eliminate malaria.Awareness of asymptomatic malaria infections, and MDA as a tool to eliminate malaria, was low. With the need to target asymptomatic malaria carriers for elimination efforts in the GMS, as well as informing target groups about asymptomatic infection, accompanying community engagement must build trust in interventions through the active collaboration of government stakeholders, key local persons and community members. This entails training and devolving responsibilities to the community members to implement and sustain the control and elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2904098752,"This study was focused on analyzing the effects of dietary inclusion of raw chickpea seed as a replacement of soybean meal as a primary protein source on bone structure in broiler chickens. Broiler chickens (n = 160) received in their diet either soybean meal (SBM) or raw chickpea seeds (CPS) as a primary protein source throughout the whole rearing period (n = 80 in each group). On the 42th day randomly selected chickens from each group (n = 8) were slaughtered. Collected tibiotarsus were subjected to examination of the biomechanical characteristics of bone mid-diaphysis, microstructure of the growth plate and articular cartilages; the analysis of mineral content and crystallinity of mineral phase, and the measurements of thermal stability of collagen in hyaline cartilage were also carried out. The inclusion of chickpea seeds resulted in increase of bone osteometric parameters (weight, length and mid-diaphysis cross-sectional area) and mechanical endurance (yield load, ultimate load, stiffness, Young modulus). However, when loads were adjusted to bone shape (yield and ultimate stress) both groups did not differ. Mineral density determined by means of densitometric measurements did not differ between groups, however the detailed analysis revealed the differences in the macro- and microelements composition. The results of FT-IR and XRD analyses showed no effect of diet type on mineral phase crystallinity and hydroxyapatite nanocrystallites size. In trabecular bone, the increase of real bone volume (BV/TV) and number of trabeculae was observed in the CPS group. Total thickness of articular cartilage was the same in both groups, save the transitional zone, which was thicker in the SBM group. The total thickness of the growth plate cartilage was significantly increased in the CPS group. The area of the most intense presence of proteoglycans was wider in the SBM group. The structural analysis of fibrous components of bone revealed the increase of fraction of thin, immature collagen content in articular cartilage, trabeculae and compact bone in the CPS group. The dietary inclusion of CPS affected the thermal stability of collagen, as decrease of net denaturation enthalpy was observed. This study showed a beneficial effect of CPS on the skeletal development, improving the overall bone development and the microarchitecture of cancellous bone. It suggests that CPS can be a promising replacement for SBM in broilers feeding in the aspect of animal welfare related to the development of the skeletal system."
https://openalex.org/W2904937201,"Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, inflammation, and immunity. Mean platelet volume (MPV), considered a marker of platelet function and activation, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in sepsis, coronary artery disease, and chronic inflammatory disease. However, the clinical characteristics and prognostic significance of MPV changes for patients with pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU) have not been investigated. This retrospective study was conducted using data from an operational database of patients admitted to a medical ICU between October 2010 and October 2017. Of 235 adult patients with pneumonia admitted to the ICU, clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality values were compared according to MPV, ΔMPVday1–2, ΔMPVday1–3, ΔMPVday1–4, and ΔMPVday1–Discharge between those who survived and those who did not. The MPV increased during the first four days for both non-survivors and survivors (P < 0.001). However, repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significantly higher MPV rate over the first four days in non-survivors than in survivors. Additionally, the ΔMPVday1–2, ΔMPVday1–3, ΔMPVday1–4, and ΔMPVday1–Discharge values were significantly greater in non-survivors than in survivors. For in-hospital mortality, the optimal ΔMPV values were >0.9 fL, P = 0.020; >0.9 fL, P < 0.001; >0.8 fL, P < 0.001; and >1.3 fL, P < 0.001 on day 2, day 3, day 4, and at discharge, respectively. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that ΔMPV during ICU admission may be used as a prognostic marker of mortality in ICU patients with pneumonia. Repeated MPV measurements throughout hospitalization may improve risk stratification for these patients, which could aid in improving patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2904596861,"In nerve regeneration studies, various animal models are used to assess nerve regeneration. However, because of the difficulties in functional nerve assessment, a visceral nerve injury model is yet to be established. The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) plays an essential role in swallowing. Although a treatment for SLN injury following trauma and surgery is desirable, no such treatment is reported in the literature. We recently reported that stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) have a therapeutic effect on various tissues via macrophage polarization. Here, we established a novel animal model of SLN injury. Our model was characterized as having weight loss and drinking behavior changes. In addition, the SLN lesion caused a delay in the onset of the swallowing reflex and gain of laryngeal residue in the pharynx. Systemic administration of SHED-conditioned media (SHED-CM) promoted functional recovery of the SLN and significantly promoted axonal regeneration by converting of macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, SHED-CM enhanced new blood vessel formation at the injury site. Our data suggest that the administration of SHED-CM may provide therapeutic benefits for SLN injury."
https://openalex.org/W2904749043,"Riparian and aquatic habitats support biodiversity and key environmental processes in semi-arid and arid landscapes, but stressors such as conventional livestock grazing, wildfire, and drought can degrade their condition. To enhance habitat for fish and wildlife and increase resiliency in these critical areas, land managers in the interior western United States increasingly use alternative grazing strategies, beaver management, or beaver dam surrogates as low-effort, low-expense restoration approaches. In this study we used historical archives of satellite and aerial imagery spanning three decades to characterize riparian vegetation productivity and document beaver dam occurrences, then evaluated vegetation productivity relative to land management associated with livestock grazing and beaver dam densities while accounting for climate and wildfire. After controlling for stream characteristics such as stream size, elevation, and stream slope, we demonstrate a positive response of riparian area vegetation to conservation-oriented grazing approaches and livestock exclosures, extensive beaver dam development, increased precipitation, and lack of wildfire. We show that livestock management which emphasizes riparian recovery objectives can be an important precursor to beaver activity and describe 11–39% increases in floodplain vegetation productivity where conservation-oriented grazing approaches or livestock exclosures and high beaver activity occur together on low-gradient sites. Land management decisions can therefore potentially confer resiliency to riparian areas under changing and variable climate conditions–the increased vegetation productivity resulting from conservation-oriented grazing or exclosures and high amounts of beaver activity at our sites is the equivalent to moving conventionally-grazed, low-gradient sites without beaver up at least 250 m in elevation or increasing water year precipitation by at least 250 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2905563699,"Background: Randomized controlled trials are often used to inform policy and practice for broad populations. The average treatment effect (ATE) for a target population, however, may be different from the ATE observed in a trial if there are effect modifiers whose distribution in the target population is different that from that in the trial. Methods exist to use trial data to estimate the target population ATE, provided the distributions of treatment effect modifiers are observed in both the trial and target population -- an assumption that may not hold in practice. Methods: The proposed sensitivity analyses address the situation where a treatment effect modifier is observed in the trial but not the target population. These methods are based on an outcome model or the combination of such a model and weighting adjustment for observed differences between the trial sample and target population. They accommodate several types of outcome models: linear models (including single time outcome and pre- and post-treatment outcomes) for additive effects, and models with log or logit link for multiplicative effects. We clarify the methods' assumptions and provide detailed implementation instructions. Illustration: We illustrate the methods using an example generalizing the effects of an HIV treatment regimen from a randomized trial to a relevant target population. Conclusion: These methods allow researchers and decision-makers to have more appropriate confidence when drawing conclusions about target population effects."
https://openalex.org/W2904129788,"Increase in saturated fatty acid (SFA) content in membrane phospholipids dramatically affects membrane properties and cellular functioning. We sought to determine whether exogenous SFA from the diet directly affects the degree of membrane phospholipid unsaturation in adult hearts and if these changes correlate with contractile dysfunction. Although both SFA-rich high fat diets (HFDs) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA)-rich HFDs cause the same degree of activation of myocardial FA uptake, triglyceride turnover, and mitochondrial FA oxidation and accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates, the former induced more severe diastolic dysfunction than the latter, which was accompanied with a decrease in membrane phospholipid unsaturation, induction of unfolded protein response (UPR), and a decrease in the expression of Sirt1 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), catalyzing the conversion of SFA to MUFA. When the SFA supply in the heart overwhelms the cellular capacity to use it for energy, excess exogenous SFA channels to membrane phospholipids, leading to UPR induction, and development of diastolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2904080332,"This paper investigates a brain-based approach for visual merchandising display (VMD) in fashion stores. In marketing, VMD has become a research topic of interest. However, VMD research using brain activation information is rare. We examine the hemodynamic responses (HRs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while positive/negative displays of four stores (menswear, womenswear, underwear, and sportswear) are shown to 20 subjects. As features for classifying the HRs, the mean, variance, peak, skewness, kurtosis, t-value, and slope of the signals for a 20-sec time window for the activated channels are analyzed. Linear discriminant analysis is used for classifying two-class (positive and negative displays) and four-class (four fashion stores) models. PFC brain activation maps based on t-values depicting the data from the 16 channels are provided. In the two-class classification, the underwear store had the highest average classification result of 67.04%, whereas the menswear store had the lowest value of 64.15%. Men’s classification accuracy for the underwear stores with positive and negative displays was 71.38%, whereas the highest classification accuracy obtained by women for womenswear stores was 73%. The average accuracy over the 20 subjects for positive displays was 50.68%, while that of negative displays was 51.07%. Therefore, these findings suggest that human brain activation is involved in the evaluation of the fashion store displays. It is concluded that fNIRS can be used as a brain-based tool in the evaluation of fashion stores in a daily life environment."
https://openalex.org/W2904859000,"Here we describe GoFish, a strategy for single-species environmental DNA (eDNA) presence/absence assays using nested PCR. The assays amplify a mitochondrial 12S rDNA segment with vertebrate metabarcoding primers, followed by nested PCR with M13-tailed, species-specific primers. Sanger sequencing confirms positives detected by gel electrophoresis. We first obtained 12S sequences from 77 fish specimens for 36 northwestern Atlantic taxa not well documented in GenBank. Using these and existing 12S records, we designed GoFish assays for 11 bony fish species common in the lower Hudson River estuary and tested seasonal abundance and habitat preference at two sites. Additional assays detected nine cartilaginous fish species and a marine mammal, bottlenose dolphin, in southern New York Bight. GoFish sensitivity was equivalent to Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding. Unlike quantitative PCR (qPCR), GoFish does not require tissues of target and related species for assay development and a basic thermal cycler is sufficient. Unlike Illumina metabarcoding, indexing and batching samples are unnecessary and advanced bioinformatics expertise is not needed. From water collection to Sanger sequencing results, the assay can be carried out in three days. The main limitations to this approach, which employs metabarcoding primers, are the same as for metabarcoding, namely, inability to distinguish species with shared target sequences and inconsistent amplification of rarer eDNA. In addition, the performance of the 20 assays reported here as compared to other single-species eDNA assays is not known. This approach will be a useful addition to current eDNA methods when analyzing presence/absence of known species, when turnaround time is important, and in educational settings."
https://openalex.org/W2904120920,"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections are responsible for significant economic losses in the swine industry. Commercially available vaccines are not able to inhibit the colonisation of the respiratory tract by M. hyopneumoniae absolutely, therefore vaccination can be completed with antibiotic treatment to moderate clinical signs and improve performances of the animals. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of M. hyopneumoniae is time-consuming and complicated; therefore, it is not accomplished routinely. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to 15 different antibiotics of M. hyopneumoniae isolates originating from Hungarian slaughterhouses and to examine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes affecting susceptibility to antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the examined antibiotics against 44 M. hyopneumoniae strains were determined by microbroth dilution method. While all of the tested antibiotics were effective against the majority of the studied strains, high MIC values of fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin 2.5 μg/ml; marbofloxacin 5 μg/ml) were observed against one strain (MycSu17) and extremely high MIC values of macrolides and lincomycin (tilmicosin, tulathromycin and lincomycin >64 μg/ml; gamithromycin 64 μg/ml; tylosin 32 μg/ml and tylvalosin 2 μg/ml) were determined against another, outlier strain (MycSu18). Amino acid changes in the genes gyrA (Gly81Ala; Ala83Val; Glu87Gly, according to Escherichia coli numbering) and parC (Ser80Phe/Tyr; Asp84Asn) correlated with decreased antibiotic susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and a SNP in the nucleotide sequence of the 23S rRNA (A2059G) was found to be associated with increased MIC values of macrolides. The correlation was more remarkable when final MIC values were evaluated. This study presented the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of M. hyopneumoniae strains circulating in the Central European region, demonstrating the high in vitro efficacy of the tested agents. The observed high MIC values correlated with the SNPs in the examined regions and support the relevance of susceptibility testing and directed antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2903908956,"The authors are developing an intake tool based on the Brief International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health Core Set for Hearing Loss, by operationalizing its categories into a Patient Reported Outcome Measure. This study was aimed at identifying enablers and barriers to using this tool as perceived by hearing health professionals (HHPs) and patients. Focus groups and interviews were held with HHPs (ENT surgeons, N = 14; audiologists, N = 8) and patients (N = 18). Interview questions were based on the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model. Using the COM-B model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), transcript fragments were divided into meaning units, which were then categorized into capability-, opportunity- and motivation-related barriers and enablers. These were further specified into TDF domains. HHP barriers included: lack of time to use the tool (O); and fear of being made responsible for addressing any emerging problems, which may be outside the expertise of the HHP (M). Enablers included integration of the tool in the electronic patient record (O); opportunity for the patient to be better prepared for the intake visit (M); and provision of a complete picture of the patient’s functioning via the tool (M). Patient’ barriers included fear of losing personal contact with the HHP (M); and fear that use of the tool might negatively affect conversations with the HHP (M). Enablers included knowledge on the aim and relevance of the tool (C); expected better self-preparation (M); and a more focused intake (M). These findings suggest that an intervention is needed to enhance HHPs’ knowledge, skills and motivation regarding the relevance and the clinical usefulness of the tool. Providing clear and specific information on the purpose of the tool can also enhance patient motivation. For both HHPs and patients, opportunities relating to the (digital) administration and the design of the tool provide additional targets for successful implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2905377934,"Introduction Components of essential newborn care and neonatal resuscitation are proven interventions for reducing neonatal mortality rate and stillbirth rates. Various studies have been conducted, but they failed in assessing health workers that delivered essential newborn care, facets of the health care system, and different traditional beliefs. As such, the primary aim of this study is to fill the gaps of the aforementioned previous studies, assess mothers’ current practice of essential newborn care and identify factors affecting newborn care practices in Chencha District, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A mixed type, community-based cross sectional study was conducted among 630 study participants by using one-stage cluster sampling method. Three focus group discussions (FGD) with purposively selected 18 mothers were involved for qualitative study. Data entry was carried out by Epi data version 3.1 and analysis was done by SPSS window version 22. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors. Qualitative data were analyzed deductively by using thematic framework analysis approach by using Open Code version 4.02. Results This study found that 38.4% of mothers had good practices in essential newborn care. Of the neonates, 52.9% received safe cord care, 71.0% received optimal thermal care and 74.8% had good neonatal feeding. Factors such as mothers receiving antenatal care, attending pregnant mothers meetings, receiving immediate postnatal care, wealth index, whether a complication was faced during delivery and overall knowledge of mothers were statistically significantly associated with practice. Conclusions This study indicated that the current rate of essential newborn care practice was low. As such, strengthening the provision of antenatal and postnatal care services, information communication education and behavioral change communications on essential newborn care are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2949576524,"Following its introduction over three decades ago, the cohort model has been used extensively to model population trajectories over time in decision-analytic modeling studies. However, the stochastic process underlying cohort models has not been properly described. In this study, we explicate the stochastic process underlying a cohort model, by carefully formulating the dynamics of populations across health states and assigning probability rules on these dynamics. From this formulation, we explicate a mathematical representation of the system, which is given by the master equation. We solve the master equation by using the probability generation function method to obtain the explicit form of the probability of observing a particular realization of the system at an arbitrary time. The resulting generating function is used to derive the analytical expressions for calculating the mean and the variance of the process. Secondly, we represent the cohort model by a difference equation for the number of individuals across all states. From the difference equation, a continuous-time cohort model is recovered and takes the form of an ordinary differential equation. To show the equivalence between the derived stochastic process and the cohort model, we conduct a numerical exercise. We demonstrate that the population trajectories generated from the formulas match those from the cohort model simulation. In summary, the commonly-used cohort model represent the average of a continuous-time stochastic process on a multidimensional integer lattice governed by a master equation. Knowledge of the stochastic process underlying a cohort model provides a theoretical foundation for the modeling method."
https://openalex.org/W2901584188,"Shortened leukocyte and placental telomeres associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) suggest this exposure triggers telomere attrition contributing to adverse outcomes. We applied high resolution Single Telomere Length Analysis (STELA) to placenta from GDM pregnancies with different treatment pathways to determine their effectiveness at preventing telomere attrition. Differences in telomere length between control (N = 69), GDM lifestyle intervention (n = 14) and GDM treated with metformin and/or insulin (n = 17) was tested by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) followed by group comparisons using Fisher’s least significant difference. For male placenta only, there were differences in mean telomere length (F(2,54) = 4.98, P = 0.01) and percentage of telomeres under 5 kb (F(2,54) = 4.65, P = 0.01). Telomeres were shorter in the GDM lifestyle intervention group compared to both controls (P = 0.02) and medically treated pregnancies (P = 0.003). There were more telomeres under 5 kb in the GDM lifestyle intervention group compared to the other two groups (P = 0.03 and P = 0.004). Although further work is necessary, we suggest that early adoption of targeted medical treatment of GDM pregnancies where the fetus is known to be male may be an effective strategy for ameliorating adverse outcomes for children."
https://openalex.org/W2903985462,"Francisella tularensis (Ft) is a biothreat agent for which there is no FDA-approved human vaccine. Currently, there are substantial efforts underway to develop both vaccines and the tools to assess these vaccines. Tularemia laboratory research has historically relied primarily upon a small number of inbred mouse strains, but the utility of such findings to outbred animals may be limited. Specifically, C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible than BALB/c mice to Ft infection and less easily protected against challenge with highly virulent type A Ft. Thus, depending on the inbred mouse strain used, one could be misled as to which immunogen(s)/vaccine will ultimately be effective in an outbred human population. Accordingly, we evaluated an outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model in direct comparison to a well-established, inbred C57BL/6 mouse model. Mucosal vaccination with the live, attenuated Ft LVS superoxide dismutase (sodB) mutant demonstrated significantly higher protection in outbred SW mice compared to inbred C57BL/6 mice against Ft SchuS4 respiratory challenge. The protection observed in vaccinated outbred mice correlated with lower bacterial density, reduced tissue inflammation, and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This protection was CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dependent and characterized by lower titers of serum antibody (Ab) that qualitatively differed from vaccinated inbred mice. Enhanced protection of vaccinated outbred mice correlated with early and robust production of IFN-γ and IL-17A. Neutralizing Ab administered at the time of challenge revealed that IFN-γ was central to this protection, while IL-17A neutralization did not alter bacterial burden or survival. The present study demonstrates the utility of the outbred mouse as an alternative vaccination model for testing tularemia vaccines. Given the limited MHC repertoire in inbred mice, this outbred model is more analogous to the human in terms of immunological diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2904094610,"Introduction The prognostic relevance of gender is undetermined in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Therefore, we investigated whether gender is a prognostic factor in a SCLC cohort after controlling for confounding factors. Materials and methods Fifteen prognostic factors were classified into four groups (patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment). The prognostic relevance of gender was evaluated using propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazards regression, and stepwise fashion adjustments. Results Of 591 patients with SCLC, 88 were women (14.9%). Women were more likely than men to have no history of smoking (48.9% vs. 2.0%, P < 0.001) and limited disease (48.9% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.050). Women had less progressive disease in M stage than men (52.3% vs. 62.8%, P = 0.031). Women had better survival than men in the entire cohort (median survival times [MSTs] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 9.7 months and 7.8–11.6 for women, 8.0 months and 7.0–8.9 for men, log-rank P = 0.034) and in the matched cohort (MSTs and 95% CIs: 8.8 months and 5.8–11.8 for women, 5.9 months and 4.5–7.4 for men, log-rank P = 0.013). Female gender was a prognostic factor predicting better survival, even after stepwise and full adjustment with all prognostic variables (adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs: 0.51 and 0.34–0.77, P = 0.001 for entire cohort, 0.42 and 0.24–0.75, P = 0.003 for matched cohort). Conclusions Our results confirmed that gender is an independent prognostic factor in patients with SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2904290697,"Laboratory science requires careful maintenance of sterile reagents and tools as well as the sterilization of waste prior to disposal. However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators."
https://openalex.org/W2904143250,"The main objective of this work was to estimate the prevalence of disability in European community-dwelling older adults, as well as to investigate differences in the profile of disabled older adults between European regions (Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern). A cross-sectional study based on wave 6 (2015) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) was conducted. Community-dwelling participants aged 65–84 were selected (n = 33,369). Disability was defined as presenting at least one functional limitation in basic activities of daily living (BADL). Sociodemographic, health services, lifestyle and health-related variables were analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out through the Chi-square and ANOVA tests for bivariate analysis, and Poisson regression for multivariate analysis. Overall prevalence of disability was 13.8%: 9.4% in the Northern region, 13.1% in the Southern region, 13.6% in the Central region, and 16.6% in the Eastern region. Portugal, Poland, Estonia and Belgium showed the highest prevalence of BADL limitations, while Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Switzerland showed the lowest prevalence. Besides, disabled older adults from East Europe presented the most disadvantaged health profile, followed by the Southern region. On the other hand, disabled older adults living in the Northern region showed the most advantaged characteristics of most variables, except for smoking and polypharmacy."
https://openalex.org/W2905499793,"We established a new simple approach to study phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) reserves at subcellular level potentially applicable to various types of cells capable of accumulating P- and/or N-rich inclusions. Here, we report on using this approach for locating and assessing the abundance of the P and N reserves in microalgal and cyanobacterial cells. The approach includes separation of the signal from P- or N-rich structures from noise on the energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) P- or N-maps. The separation includes (i) relative entropy estimation for each pixel of the map, (ii) binary thresholding of the map, and (iii) segmenting the image to assess the inclusion relative area and localization in the cell section. The separation is based on comparing the a posteriori probability that a pixel of the map contains information about the sample vs. Gaussian a priori probability that the pixel contains noise. The difference is expressed as relative entropy value for the pixel; positive values are characteristic of the pixels containing the payload information about the sample. This is the first known method for quantification and locating at a subcellular level P-rich and N-rich inclusions including tiny (< 180 nm) structures. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method both to the cells of eukaryotic green microalgae and cyanobacteria. Using the new method, we elucidated the heterogeneity of the studied cells in accumulation of P and N reserves across different species. The proposed approach will be handy for any cytological and microbiological study requiring a comparative assessment of subcellular distribution of cyanophycin, polyphosphates or other type of P- or N-rich inclusions. An added value is the potential of this approach for automation of the data processing and evaluation enabling an unprecedented increase of the EFTEM analysis throughput."
https://openalex.org/W2904583809,"Objective The objective of the present study was to investigate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection as an environmental factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Synovial tissues were collected during surgery from 128 RA and 98 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. DNA was extracted from synovial tissues. The EBV gene was assessed by nested PCR for the amplification of EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was elucidated. HLA-DRB1 genotyping was also performed. Results EBV DNA was more frequently detected in the synovial tissues of RA patients (32.8%) than OA patients (15.3%) (p<0.01). The frequency of EBNA-1 variants did not significantly differ between RA and OA (RA: 17%, OA: 13%). The population with the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) was significantly higher in RA patients (70.3%) than in OA patients (44.9%) (p<0.001). In RA patients, the presence of EBV DNA was similar among SE-positive and -negative patients (SE-positive: 34.4%, -negative: 28.9%). The population with the EBNA-1 variant did not significantly differ between SE-positive and -negative patients (SE-positive: 12.9%, -negative: 27.3%). Discussion The present results indicate that EBV infection contributes to the onset of RA and chronic inflammation in synovial tissues. The frequency of EBNA-1 gene variants was low and not significantly different between RA and OA, suggesting that EBNA-1 gene variants are not a risk factor for RA. HLA-DRB1 with SE is a genetic risk factor for the development of RA. However, neither the presence of EBV nor EBNA-1 gene variants differed between SE-positive and -negative RA patients. Therefore, these two risk factors, SE and EBV, may be independent. Conclusion EBV infection may be an environmental risk factor for the development of RA, while nucleotide variants of EBNA-1 do not appear to contribute to its development."
https://openalex.org/W2903894358,"Vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) is a major cause of cognitive loss in the elderly. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteases involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix in development, injury and repair. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to inflammation mediated by MMPs is a mechanism of white matter injury. Currently there are no treatments besides the control of vascular risk factors. We tested two MMP-9 inhibitors that improved outcome in acute stroke: DP-460 and SB-3CT. We hypothesized that these inhibitors would have a beneficial effect in chronic stroke by reducing edema in white matter and improving behavioral outcomes. Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSPs) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) fed a Japanese Permissive Diet (JPD) were used as a model of VCID. JPD was begun in the 12th week of life. Rats were treated with DP-460 (500 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, or SB-3CT (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks, beginning at the UCAO/JPD onset. Rats treated with a dextrose or DMSO solution served as vehicle controls. Naïve SHRSPs on a standard diet served as sham control. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses of the corpus callosum, external capsule, hippocampus and Morris water maze behavioral tests were conducted. We found an increase in body weight (p = 0.004) and blood pressure (p = 0.007) at 15 weeks with the DP-460 drug. SB-3CT increased body weight at 14 weeks (p = 0.015) and had significant but variable effects on blood pressure. Neither drug affected imaging parameters. Behavioral studies showed an impaired ability to learn with DP-460 (p<0.001) and no effect on learning with SB-3CT. Unchanged MMP-9 levels were detected in DP-460-treated rats via gel zymography. Our findings suggest that MMPs are not major factors in white matter damage in the SHRSP model of VCID and that drugs that are relatively selective for MMP-9 can interfere with learning."
https://openalex.org/W2905369021,"Aurantiochytrium limacinum has received attention because of its abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is synthesized through the polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway in A. limacinum. The related enzymes of the PKS pathway are mainly expressed by three gene clusters, called pks1, pks2 and pks3. In this study, the full-length pks3 gene was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Genome Walking technology. Based on a domain analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the pks3 gene, 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR) and dehydratase (DH) enzyme domains were identified. Herein, A. limacinum OUC168 was engineered by gene knock-in of KR and DH using the 18S rDNA sequence as the homologous recombination site. Total fatty acid contents and the degree of unsaturation of total fatty acids increased after the kr or dh gene was knocked in. The cloning and functional study of the pks3 gene of A. limacinum establishes a foundation for revealing the DHA synthetic pathway. Gene knock-in of the enzyme domain associated with PKS synthesis has the potential to provide effective recombinant strains with higher DHA content for industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2903777300,"Background Dengue is one of the most important vector-bore infectious diseases in China because of its drastic increase in incidence, geographic extension and profound influence on China’s economy. This study aims to retrospectively uncover the epidemiological profile of dengue in Zhejiang, one of the most developed provinces in China, and to find the problem existing in dengue control and prevention. Methodology Descriptive analyses on the dengue incidence and associated factors were performed. We also identified potential space-time cluster and generated the risk map of dengue. Principal findings A total of 529 cases were reported in Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2016, and 44.4% were imported. 67.7% of cases were 25~60 years old and the overall male-to-female sex ratio was 1.09:1. Dengue was reported all year round and 70.7% of cases occurred between August and October. Indigenous cases were only reported in the period between July to November and more than half occurred in September. Geographically, dengue was most distributed in Jinghua (3.62 per million), Shaoxing (1.00 per million) and Taizhou (0.81 per million) prefecture level cities. Outbreaks were confirmed in Yiwu, Keqiao and Huangyan counties in 2009, 2015, and 2016, respectively. 73.9% cases would seek medical advice within two days after onset and be confirmed within 9 days after onset. 75.6% would be recognized as dengue within 8 days after their first visit. The time intervals between onset and confirmation (median 7 vs 6 days; Wilcoxon rank sum test Z = -2.40, P = 0.016), first visit and confirmation (median 7 vs 6 days; Wilcoxon rank sum test Z = -2.59, P = 0.009) of indigenous cases were significantly longer than those of imported ones. However, the time intervals between onset and first visit for indigenous cases was shorter (median 0 vs 1 days; Wilcoxon rank sum test Z = -2.10, P = 0.036). Fever (99.1%), fatigue (81.9), rash (63.7%), headache (67.2%) and myalgia (52.60%) were the most frequently mentioned symptoms. Conclusions Zhejiang has recently witnessed an increase in incidence and geographic extension of dengue. Timely diagnosis is important to stop local transmission and outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2904774464,"Adlay (Coix lacryma-jobi) is a tropical grass that has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine and is known for its nutritional benefits. Recent studies have shown that vitamin E compounds in adlay protect against chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. However, the molecular basis of adlay's health benefits remains unknown. Here, we generated adlay gene sets by de novo transcriptome assembly using long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) and short-read RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). The gene sets obtained from Iso-seq and RNA-seq contained 31,177 genes and 57,901 genes, respectively. We confirmed the validity of the assembled gene sets by experimentally analyzing the levels of prolamin and vitamin E biosynthesis-associated proteins in adlay plant tissues and seeds. We compared the screened adlay genes with known gene families from closely related plant species, such as rice, sorghum and maize. We also identified tissue-specific genes from the adlay leaf, root, and young and mature seed, and experimentally validated the differential expression of 12 randomly-selected genes. Our study of the adlay transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for genetic studies that can enhance adlay breeding programs in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2903741973,"Background International guidelines on the prevention of caries recommend sealing of the pits and fissures of the permanent molars. There is no evidence on which type of material is most effective on demineralized enamel. Aim To evaluate the microleakage of a conventional light-cured, resin-based fissure sealant (LCRBS), GrandiO Seal, and a resin-modified glass ionomer sealant (RMGIS), Vitremer, after application of a fluoride varnish, Bifluorid 12, on demineralized enamel. Design 80 human third molars were divided into eight groups. The groups combined the three study factors (1) type of enamel (intact or demineralized); (2) enamel non-varnished or varnished with Biflourid12; and (3) type of sealant (GrandiO Seal or Vitremer). The percentage of microleakage after thermocycling was measured using imaging analysis software. The Kruskal-Wallis plus Dunn tests were used to compare differences in microleakage in the different groups. Results The lowest microleakage was in the unvarnished groups, and was the same for GrandiO Seal and Vitremer. When varnish was applied, microleakage was greater in demineralized enamel than in intact enamel for both LCRBS and RMGIS. Conclusion The application of fluoride varnish on demineralized enamel increases the microleakage of both GrandiO Seal and Vitremer."
https://openalex.org/W2904544946,"Mammary gland development is a complex and dynamic process that occurs mainly postnatally. Ductal elongation and branching morphogenesis are regulated by a plethora of factors, including cytokines, hormones, growth factors and the extracellular matrix. Gas6 is a secreted gamma-carboxylated protein that binds to a family of receptors tyrosine kinase receptors known as the TAMR family (Tyro3, Axl, Mer). Gas6 function in developmental processes has been shown in nervous, reproductive and immune systems. In this study, we found that Gas6 is highly expressed in virgin adult mammary glands but declines during pregnancy and lactation. Specifically, Gas6 is highly expressed in luminal and basal mammary epithelial cells during puberty and adulthood, while TAMR expression is low. Mammary whole mount analysis revealed that Gas6 germline deletion does not impact ductal elongation, branching morphogenesis or terminal end bud formation. Masson's trichrome staining showed that collagen deposition is similar in Gas6-/- mice as compared to wildtype mice. Gas6-/- mammary glands presented an organized luminal and myoepithelial bilayer of cells, and the proportion of mammary stem cells was unchanged in Gas6-/- mammary glands as compared to wildtype. Finally, proliferation of epithelial cells and macrophage number were similar in both groups. These studies suggest that Gas6 is not essential for pubertal mammary gland development in nulliparous mice."
https://openalex.org/W2904670295,"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are a global concern because these bacteria are resistant to almost all β-lactams. Horizontal interspecies gene transfer via plasmid conjugation has increased the global dissemination of CPE. Recently, an Enterobacteriaceae strain positive for carbapenemase gene but showing a carbapenem-susceptible phenotype was identified, suggesting that these susceptible strains may be challenging to detect solely via antimicrobial susceptibility tests without molecular analysis. Here, we isolated a blaIMP-6 carbapenemase-gene positive but imipenem- and meropenem-susceptible Escherichia coli (ISMS-E) strain A56-1S (imipenem and meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration, ≤ 0.125 mg/L), from a human urine specimen in Japan. A56-1S was carbapenemase negative by the Carba NP test, suggesting that IMP-6 production was low or undetectable. Thus, to characterize the mechanism of this phenotype, a meropenem-resistant E. coli A56-1R strain was obtained using meropenem-selection. A56-1R was positive for carbapenemase production by the Carba NP test, and blaIMP-6 transcription in A56-1R was 53-fold higher than in A56-1S, indicating that blaIMP-6 in A56-1S is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level. Comparative genomic analysis between the two strains revealed that the alleviation of restriction of DNA (ardK) gene encoding a putative transcription factor is disrupted by the IS26 insertion in A56-1R. A cotransformation assay of ardK and the regulatory element upstream of blaIMP-6 showed repression of blaIMP-6 transcription, indicating that ArdK negatively modulates blaIMP-6 transcription. ArdK binding and affinity assays demonstrated that ArdK directly binds to the regulatory element upstream of blaIMP-6 with dissociation constant values comparable to those of general transcription factors. The IMP-6 carbapenemase showed low hydrolytic activity against imipenem, resulting in an imipenem-susceptible and meropenem-resistant (ISMR) phenotype (previously reported as a stealth phenotype). However, the low expression of IMP-6 in the A56-1S strain could be a typical characteristic of ISMS-E due to gene repression, indicating that conventional antimicrobial susceptibility tests might be unable to detect such strains even when using both imipenem and meropenem. Bacteria that exhibit the ISMS phenotype could play a potential role as undetectable reservoirs and might facilitate gene transfer to other organisms while avoiding detection."
https://openalex.org/W2905152890,"Purpose To investigate the feasibility and diagnostic benefit of routinely performed preoperative macular spectral-domain (SD-) optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the detection of macular pathology in patients with normal biomicroscopic funduscopy prior to cataract surgery. Methods Prospective, single center study. A total of 162 eyes of 123 consecutive patients referred for cataract surgery with a visual acuity better than 20/100, absence of macular symptoms such as metamorphopsia, no history of previous intravitreal procedures and a normal funduscopic appearance on biomicroscopy underwent an additional SD-OCT-examination prior to cataract surgery. OCT-scans were classified in three categories: normal, degenerative vitreous changes without impact on visual outcome or pathological with potential impact on visual outcome. Results 80 eyes (49.38%) showed normal OCT-scans. 69 eyes (42.59%) were classified as degenerative vitreous changes without impact on visual outcome and 20 eyes (12.35%) as pathological with potential impact on visual outcome. The indication of cataract surgery or the therapeutic strategy remained unchanged in all patients. In patients with pathological alterations further follow-up examinations were recommended. Conclusions Routine SD-OCT-imaging of the macular region in patients prior to cataract surgery was feasible to detect macular pathologies in a considerable number of patients, which remained undiagnosed on biomicroscopic funduscopy. Although OCT-findings did not impact therapeutic strategy in this study, preoperative judgement of the expected visual outcome and patient´s informed consent can improve."
https://openalex.org/W2904135944,"The present work investigates the process of frosting formation on arched copper samples with different surface temperatures, calculated the thickness of the frost layer by using the scale method, and analyzed frost lodging, melting, and other phenomena that appeared during the frost-formation process. The results showed that the frosting process on an arched surface can be divided into ice-film formation, rapid growth of the frost layer, and stable growth of the frost layer. Meanwhile, the phenomena of frost-branch breakage, lodging, and melting were observed. The surface temperature had a large effect on the frost formation and thickness of the frost layer, e.g., the formation time of the ice film on a surface at -5°C was the longest (~135 s), the frost layer formed on a surface at -20°C was the thickest (~660 μm). When microscopic observation of the frosting process was accompanied by calculation of the frost-layer thickness, it could be seen that the appearance of the frost branches was affected by the different thermal conductivities of the frost layers, undulating surface of the ice film, and temperature difference between the layers. The changes in the frost branches and the soft surface of the frost layer also affected the growth of the frost layer. The findings of this study are expected to provide guidelines for optimization of conventional defrosting methods."
https://openalex.org/W2905215435,"Control of gene expression depends on genetics and environmental factors. The T-cell intracellular antigens T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1), TIA1-like/related protein (TIAL1/TIAR) and human antigen R (HuR/ELAVL1) are RNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression in both situations. This study used massive sequencing analysis to uncover molecular and functional mechanisms resulting from the short-time expression of the b isoforms of TIA1 and TIAR, and of HuR in HEK293 cells. Our gene profiling analysis identified several hundred differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and tens of alternative splicing events associated with TIA1b, TIARb and HuR overexpression. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the controlled expression of these proteins strongly influences the patterns of DEGs and RNA variants preferentially associated with development, reproduction, cell cycle, metabolism, autophagy and apoptosis. Mechanistically, TIA1b and TIARb isoforms display both common and differential effects on the regulation of gene expression, involving systematic perturbations of cell biosynthetic machineries (splicing and translation). The transcriptome outputs were validated using functional assays of the targeted cellular processes as well as expression analysis for selected genes. Collectively, our observations suggest that early TIA1b and TIARb expression operates to connect the regulatory crossroads to protective proteostasis responses associated with a survival quiescence phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2903570905,"Praying mantids are predators that consume a wide variety of insects. While the gut microbiome of carnivorous mammals is distinct from that of omnivores and herbivores, the role of the gut microbiome among predatory insects is relatively understudied. Praying mantids are the closest known relatives to termites and cockroaches, which are known for their diverse gut microbiota. However, little is known about the mantid gut microbiota or their importance to host health. In this work, we report the results of a 16S rRNA gene-based study of gut microbiome composition in adults and late-instar larvae of three mantid species. We found that the praying mantis gut microbiome exhibits substantial variation in bacterial diversity and community composition. The hindgut of praying mantids were often dominated by microbes that are present in low abundance or not found in the guts of their insect prey. Future studies will explore the role of these microbes in the digestion of the dietary substrates and/or the degradation of toxins produced by their insect prey."

This includes a thermal interaction between the human and the seat that has implications on thermal perception and comfort. These interactions are investigated by simulating heat and mass transfer, thus, reducing a need for costly and time demanding subject studies. However, it is not clear, from the available literature, what portion of the body surface area is actually affected by the seat with respect to human anthropometry. The aim of this study was to develop a predicting function of the seat contact area based on anthropometric parameters. The results showed strong linear correlation between the contact area obtained by printing a body silhouette on paper placed at the seat and body weight, height, body surface area, and body mass index. The body surface area and the body weight were identified as the best predictors for the contact area."
https://openalex.org/W2904957593,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disorder characterized by primary muscle degeneration. Patients with DMD reveal progressive muscle weakness leading to ambulatory dysfunction. Novel outcome measures are needed for more sensitive evaluation of therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Multiple parameters of acceleration and angular velocity are used as efficient indicators to quantify the motion of subjects, and these parameters have been recently applied for evaluation of motor function in DMD. In the present study, we evaluated gait in a dystrophic dog model, CXMDJ, by measuring three-axial acceleration and angular velocity over the course of months. Hybrid sensors were placed on the dorsal thoracic and lumbar regions of dogs to detect a wide range of acceleration (±8 G) and angular velocity (±1000 degrees per second). Multiple parameters showed lower values in dystrophic dogs compared to wild-type (WT) dogs, and declined over the course of months. Acceleration magnitude (AM) at the thoracic region in dystrophic dogs was prominently lower compared with WT dogs, even at the age of 2 months, the onset of muscle weakness, whereas AM at the lumbar region drastically declined throughout the disease course. The angular velocity index in the vertical direction in the lumbar region increased in dystrophic dogs, suggesting waddling at the girdle. These parameters also accordingly decreased with exacerbation of clinical manifestations and a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity. The AM of dystrophic dogs was analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging to look for a correlation with crus muscle involvement. Results showed that acceleration and angular velocity are multifaceted kinematic indices that can be applied to assess outcomes in clinical trials for hereditary neuromuscular disorders including DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2905448096,"Metabolic biomarkers may play an important role in the diagnosis, prognostication and assessment of response to pharmacological therapy in complex diseases. The process of discovering new metabolic biomarkers is a non-trivial task which involves a number of bioanalytical processing steps coupled with a computational approach for the search, prioritization and verification of new biomarker candidates. Kinetic analysis provides an additional dimension of complexity in time-series data, allowing for a more precise interpretation of biomarker dynamics in terms of molecular interaction and pathway modulation. A novel network-based computational strategy for the discovery of putative dynamic biomarker candidates is presented, enabling the identification and verification of unexpected metabolic signatures in complex diseases such as myocardial infarction. The novelty of the proposed method lies in combining metabolic time-series data into a superimposed graph representation, highlighting the strength of the underlying kinetic interaction of preselected analytes. Using this approach, we were able to confirm known metabolic signatures and also identify new candidates such as carnosine and glycocholic acid, and pathways that have been previously associated with cardiovascular or related diseases. This computational strategy may serve as a complementary tool for the discovery of dynamic metabolic or proteomic biomarkers in the field of clinical medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2903765995,"Exercise training increases aerobic capacity and is beneficial for health, whereas low aerobic exercise capacity is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and premature death. The purpose of the present study was to determine the metabolic profiles in a rat model of inborn low versus high capacity runners (LCR/HCR) and to determine the effect of inborn aerobic capacity, aging, and exercise training on skeletal muscle metabolic profile.LCR/HCR rats were randomized to high intensity low volume interval treadmill training twice a week or sedentary control for 3 or 11 months before they were sacrificed, at 9 and 18 months of age, respectively. Magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from soleus muscle extracts, and partial least square discriminative analysis was used to determine the differences in metabolic profile.Sedentary HCR rats had 54% and 30% higher VO2max compared to sedentary LCR rats at 9 months and 18 months, respectively. In HCR, exercise increased running speed significantly, and VO2max was higher at age of 9 months, compared to sedentary counterparts. In LCR, changes were small and did not reach the level of significance. The metabolic profile was significantly different in the LCR sedentary group compared to the HCR sedentary group at the age of 9 and 18 months, with higher glutamine and glutamate levels (9 months) and lower lactate level (18 months) in HCR. Irrespective of fitness level, aging was associated with increased soleus muscle concentrations of glycerophosphocholine and glucose. Interval training did not influence metabolic profiles in LCR or HCR rats at any age.Differences in inborn aerobic capacity gave the most marked contrasts in metabolic profile, there were also some changes with ageing. Low volume high intensity interval training twice a week had no detectable effect on metabolic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2904009643,"Despite canine B-cell Lymphoma (BCL) representing the most common haematological tumour, epigenetic events driving development and progression are scarcely known. Recently, canine Diffuse Large BCL (DLBCL) DNA methylome by genome-wide CpG microarray has identified genes and pathways associated to pathogenesis. To validate data previously obtained by array analysis, the CLBL-1 cell line was used and the HOXD10, FGFR2, ITIH5 and RASAL3 genes were selected. CLBL-1 cells were treated with two hypomethylating drugs (HDs; IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration), i.e. azacytidine and decitabine (DEC), either alone or in combination with three histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis; IC20), i.e. valproic acid, trichostatin and vorinostat. Following the incubation with both HDs, an overall decrease of promoter methylation was highlighted, thus confirming target genes hypermethylation. The highest mRNA restoration was observed following the exposure to HDs combined with HDACis, and mostly with valproic acid. Contrasting results were only obtained for RASAL3. An in vivo confirmation was finally attempted treating Nod-Scid mice engrafted with CLBL-1 cells with DEC. Although DEC did not arrest tumour growth, target genes promoter methylation was significantly reduced in DEC-treated mice vs controls. Overall, this work demonstrates that CLBL-1 cell line represents a reliable in vitro model to validate the methylation-dependent silencing of key genes for BCL; moreover, it may be useful for xenograft models in mice, despite its aggressive behaviour. In future, functional studies will be performed to deepen the role of selected genes on BCL pathogenesis and progression, and their methylation-dependent mechanism of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2904022571,"Musicians often perform in forced postures over a long period of time, which in the worst case may lead to playing-related musculoskeletal disorders. In this context, the ergonomics of the musician's chair (construction and surface quality) can be an influencing factor, with impact on the seating position of the upper body and the pressure distribution of the bottom. Therefore, the relationship between different musician chairs and musicians of different playing levels (professional, amateur or student) was analyzed in order to gain useful insights whether playing experience, playing level, playing style (symmetrical or asymmetrical) or gender have an impact.The total dataset of 47 musicians (3 playing levels: professional, amateur, student) were analysed on six musician chairs with different ergonomic layout. Sitting on each chair without instrument (condition 1) and with instrument (condition 2), the upper body posture (videorasterstereography) and the seat pressure (load distribution) were recorded.as Also, a subjective assessment concerning constitutional data, sitting behaviour, prevailing pain in the musculoskeletal system, sport activity and chair comfort rating, was completed using a questionnaire.There were significant differences shown in 6 of 17 variables, where all between and within factors were accounted for with a MANOVA. Two measurements of the upper body posture (scapular distance and scapular height) differentiated between playing level. Four of the pressure measurements (pressure under the sit bone and the thigh for the left and the right side) differentiated between chairs and the two conditions (with and without instrument). Chairs with soft cushioning had a mean pressure reduction of about 30%. The pressure was increased by about 10% while playing an instrument. Subjective rating was correlated to age for some of the chairs.Differences between chairs are mainly associated with the pressure distribution under the sitting surface. Playing with an instrument puts an additional force onto the surface of the chair that is more than the weight of the instrument. No relationship between pressure data and upper body posture data could be found. Therefore, it can be speculated that the intersubject variability is larger than systematic differences introduced by the chair or instrument."
https://openalex.org/W2905495881,"This study investigated the association of central macular thickness (CMT) and macular volume (MV) with severity of Behçet uveitis in the absence of macular edema (ME).This retrospective, interventional study included a total 131 treatment-naïve Behçet patients with varying degree of uveitis in the absence of ME. The mean CMT and MV were obtained by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD ODT). The patients were classified according to the anatomical classification of Behçet uveitis. The main outcome measure was comparison of mean CMT and MV with the types of Behçet uveitis.Sixty patients (45.8%) with no uveitis, 41 patients (31.3%) with anterior uveitis, 18 patients (13.7%) with posterior uveitis, and 12 patients (9.2%) with panuveitis. The mean CMT were 261.6±22.2 μm in no uveitis, 268.1±17.8 μm in anterior uveitis, 306.4±32.9 μm in posterior uveitis, and 300.4±44.0 μm in panuveitis (P < 0.001). The mean MV was 8.7±0.3 mm3 in those without uveitis, 8.8±0.3 mm3 in anterior uveitis, 9.9±1.1 mm3 in those with posterior uveitis, and 9.7±0.4 mm3 in panuveitis (P < 0.001). Types of Behçet uveitis was the only significant factor correlated with the mean CMT (B = 18.170, β = 0.408, P < 0.001) and the mean MV (B = 0.328, β = 0.652, P < 0.001).The mean CMT and MV were significantly thicker in the Behçet uveitis with posterior involvement. SD OCT can be used for an adjunctive tool for screening Behçet uveitis, especially for the presence of posterior involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2904261266,"Given current high market competitiveness, it is necessary to differentiate between products that perform the same function. For this objective, designer can recur to various sources of inspiration in the searching of the more attractive form during the conceptual design stage. One of these sources can be nature, which offers a large number of geometries and textures that can be used from a shape point of view to help the designer in the creative process. This work presents an agent-based approach for a design-aided tool to provide users with some ideas, beginning with simple parts/concepts, and then increasing the complexity level according to the answers offered by designer. The proposed paradigm was implemented using the JADE agent-based platform. In order to validate the platform, several product categories were offered to fifteen different users and a total of sixty design proposals were obtained with the aid of the platform. After evaluating all the proposals, twelve of the sixty designs were finally selected and modelled by a Computer-Aided Design software. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of using an agent-based approach to obtain an adaptive intelligent solution to the product conceptual design problem."
https://openalex.org/W2905419222,"TNF-α-neutralizing antibodies, such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), are effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but they are expensive and become ineffective when patients develop anti-IFX or anti-ADA antibodies (ATI and ATA, respectively). Second-generation anti-TNF-α antibodies, such as Golimumab, Etanercept, Certolizumab-pegol and IFX biosimilars, may solve these issues.To determine the neutralizing capacity of first- and second generation anti-TNF-α antibodies and to determine whether ATI show cross-reactivity with the IFX biosimilar CT-P13 (Inflectra).TNF-α neutralization was measured using a quantitative TNF-α sensor assay consisting of HeLa 8D8 cells that express the Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) under control of a NF-кB response element. All available anti-TNF-α drugs and the IFX biosimilar CT-P13 (Inflectra) were tested for their TNF-α-neutralizing capacity. In addition, patient sera with ATI were tested for their potential to block the activity of IFX, IFX (F)ab2-fragment, biosimilar CT-P13 (Inflectra) and ADA.TNF-α strongly induced GFP expression in Hela 8D8 cells. Higher concentrations of first-generation anti-TNF-α drugs were required to neutralize TNF-α compared to the second-generation anti-TNF-α drugs. Serum of IBD patients with proven ATI blocked TNF-α-neutralizing properties of IFX biosimilar CT-P13 (Inflectra), whereas such sera did not block the effect of ADA.The second-generation anti-TNF-α drugs show increased TNF-α-neutralizing potential compared to first-generation variants. ATI show cross-reactivity toward IFX biosimilar CT-P13 (Inflectra), consequently patients with ATI are unlikely to benefit from treatment with this IFX biosimilar."
https://openalex.org/W2905470309,"Objective The objective was to compare thoracic spinal stiffness between healthy participants and participants with chronic thoracic pain and to explore the associations between spinal stiffness, pain and muscle activity. The reliability of spinal stiffness was also evaluated. Material and methods Spinal stiffness was assessed from T5 to T8 using a mechanical device in 25 healthy participants and 50 participants with chronic thoracic pain (symptoms had to be reported within the evaluated region of the back). The spinal levels for which spinal stiffness was measured were standardized (i.e. T5 to T8 for all participants) to minimize between-individual variations due to the evaluation of different spinal levels. The device load and displacement data were used to calculate the global and terminal spinal stiffness coefficients at each spinal level. Immediately after each assessment, participants were asked to rate their pain intensity during the trial, while thoracic muscle activity was recorded during the load application using surface electromyography electrodes (sEMG). Within- and between-day reliability were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), while the effects of chronic thoracic pain and spinal levels on spinal stiffness and sEMG activity were assessed using mixed model ANOVAs. Correlations between pain intensity, muscle activity and spinal stiffness were also computed. Results ICC values for within- and between-day reliability of spinal stiffness ranged from 0.67 to 0.91 and from 0.60 to 0.94 (except at T5), respectively. A significant decrease in the global (F1,73 = 4.04, p = 0.048) and terminal (F1,73 = 4.93, p = 0.03) spinal stiffness was observed in participants with thoracic pain. sEMG activity was not significantly different between groups and between spinal levels. Pain intensity was only significantly and ""moderately"" correlated to spinal stiffness coefficients at one spinal level (-0.29≤r≤-0.51), while sEMG activity and spinal stiffness were not significantly correlated. Conclusion The results suggest that spinal stiffness can be reliably assessed using a mechanical device and that this parameter is decreased in participants with chronic thoracic pain. Studies are required to determine the value of instrumented spinal stiffness assessment in the evaluation and management of patients with chronic spine-related pain."
https://openalex.org/W2903808891,"The patella is a sesamoid bone embedded within the quadriceps tendon and the patellar tendon that articulates with the femur. However, how is it formed is still unknown. Therefore, here we have evaluated, computationally, how three theories explain, independently, the patella onset. The first theory was proposed recently, in 2015. This theory suggested that the patella is initially formed as a bone eminence, attached to the anterodistal surface of the femur, while the quadriceps tendon is forming. Thereafter, a joint develops between the eminence and the femur, regulated by mechanical load. We evaluated this theory by simulating the biochemical environment that surrounds the tendon development. As a result, we obtained a patella-like structure embedded within the tendon, especially for larger flexion angles. The second and third theories are the most accepted until now. They state that the patella develops within tendons in response to the mechanical environment provided by the attaching muscles. The second theory analyzed the mechanical conditions (high hydrostatic stress) that (according to previous Carter theories) lead to the differentiation from tendon to fibrocartilage, and then, to bone. The last theory was evaluated using the self-optimizing capability of biological tissue. It was considered that the development of the patella, due to tissue topological optimization of the developing quadriceps tendon, is a feasible explanation of the patella appearance. For both theories, a patella onset was obtained as a structure embedded within the tendon. This model provided information about the relationship between the flexion angle and the patella size and shape. In conclusion, the computational models used to evaluate and analyze the selected theories allow determining that the patella onset may be the result of a combination of biochemical and mechanical factors that surround the patellar tendon development."
https://openalex.org/W2905181924,"Fatty acids in adipose tissue share dietary sources and metabolic pathways and therefore occur in patterns. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between adipose tissue fatty acid patterns identified by the data-driven dimension-reducing method treelet transform and the risk of atrial fibrillation. A total of 57,053 Danish men and women aged 50-64 years participating in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort had an adipose tissue biopsy taken at baseline. During a median follow-up of 14.6 years, a total of 4,710 participants developed atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Adipose tissue biopsies were analysed for fatty acid content by gas chromatography for all cases of atrial fibrillation and for a randomly drawn subcohort (n = 3,500) representative for the entire cohort. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for atrial fibrillation according to quintiles of factor scores were determined by weighted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for men and women separately. From the 32 fatty acids measured, 7 major factors/patterns of fatty acids were identified using treelet transform. We found that a pattern consisting of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (except linoleic acid) was associated with a lower hazard of atrial fibrillation. Patterns consisting of marine n-3 PUFA and containing n-9 fatty acids were associated with a lower hazard of atrial fibrillation in women. In conclusion, patterns of fatty acids in adipose tissue identified by treelet transform may be differentially associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2903820603,"Dysmobility syndrome (DMS) was considered as a comprehensive approach to evaluate the condition of musculoskeletal system and adverse health problems in older population. The objective of our study was to examine the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and DMS in a U.S. adult population. 1760 eligible participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 were enrolled in the study. The criteria of DMS consisted of six domains including increased body fat, declined muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, osteoporosis, slow gait speed, and balance problem. A multivariate regression analysis was investigated to clarify the relationship among MetS and its components and DMS. A positive association between increased number of MetS components and the presence of DMS achieved significance (β = 0.142, 95%CI = 0.035, 0.249, p = 0.009). Among the components of MetS, hyperglycemia had a central place in the DMS after adjustment of clinical variables (β = 0.083, 95%CI = 0.030, 0.136, p = 0.002). Notably, insulin resistance assessed by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was correlated to increased body fat (r = 0.092, p<0.05), osteoporosis (r = -0.105, p<0.05) and balance (r = 0.105, p<0.05) among these participants with MetS. Our study demonstrated a strong relationship between DMS and the presence of MetS and its components in elderly population, highlighting a possible mechanism through insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2904718534,"Dysphagia is the major pathophysiologic mechanism leading to aspiration pneumonia in the elderly. Elderly people with dysphagia who show low levels of the cough peak flow (CPF) are at greater risk for aspiration pneumonia. It has been reported that CPF values were significantly lower in the “soft” versus “hard” mode of a pressure-relieving air mattress in healthy volunteers in a supine position. Parameters such as spinal curvature, however, were not evaluated in detail. In this study, we clarified whether the changes in posture associated with two different firmness levels of a pressure-relieving air mattress were associated with cough production and related factors in the elderly with dysphagia. The body sinking distance, pelvic tilt angle, and immersion of the lumbar spine were measured to evaluate changes in posture. Forty subjects met the study criteria for dysphagia. The “soft” mode showed significantly lower CPF values than the “hard” mode (soft 274.9 ± 107.2 L/min vs. hard 325.0 ± 99.5 L/min, MD 50.0 95%CI 33.1–66.9 P < 0.001). Values of forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) were significantly lower in the “soft” mode than in the “hard” mode (MD 0.10 95%CI 0.04–0.17, P = 0.002, MD 3.2 95%CI 0.9–5.5, P = 0.007, respectively). Although there was no significant difference between the two firmness levels, maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax) values also tended to be lower in the “soft” than in the “hard” mode, (MD 2.9 95%CI -0.6–6.3 P = 0.1). At both firmness levels, CPF values were significantly correlated with FVC, PImax, and PEmax. The difference in sinking distance in the anterior superior iliac spine was significantly larger than that in the lesser tubercle of the humerus and patella. Additionally, in the soft mode, the pelvic tilt angle and contact area around the lumbar spine were significantly larger than those observed in the “hard” mode. Parameters associated with the production of cough, including inspiratory muscle strength, lung volume, and ultimately CPF, may be affected by immersion of the lumbar spine and curvature of the spine that results from the “soft” mode in elderly patients with dysphagia."
