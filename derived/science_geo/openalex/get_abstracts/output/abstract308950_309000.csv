https://openalex.org/W2030571034,"The ecdysone agonist RH 5849 (1,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine) causes the premature initiation of molting at all stages of larval development of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. This phenomenon occurs without an increase in the endogenous ecdysone (20-hydroxyecdysone) titers. RH 5849 likewise provokes the initiation of molting in larval abdomens in the absence of a source of endogenous hormone. Although substantially less active than 20-hydroxyecdysone in vitro, RH 5849 was 30 to >670 times as active as the authentic molting hormone in bioassays with isolated larval abdomens or intact hornworms. This reversal in potency can be attributed to the superior transport properties and metabolic stability of RH 5849 relative to 20-hydroxyecdysone. Thus RH 5849 and its analogs are relatively persistent ecdysone agonists that halt feeding in larval lepidoptera by forcing an ultimately lethal, developmentally premature molt."

This integration indicates that the long-term motion of the planet Pluto is chaotic. Nearby trajectories diverge exponentially with an e-folding time of only about 20 million years.
https://openalex.org/W2000767762,"The decrease in atmospheric ozone over Antarctica during spring implies enhanced levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation received at the earth's surface. Model calculations show that UV irradiances encountered during the occurrence of an Antarctic ""ozone hole"" remain less than those typical of a summer solstice at low to middle latitudes. However, the low ozone amounts observed in October 1987 imply biologically effective irradiances for McMurdo Station, Antarctica, that are comparable to or greater than those for the same location at December solstice. Life indigenous to Antarctica thereby experiences a greatly extended period of summerlike UV radiation levels."
https://openalex.org/W2061619179,"Among the nitrogen (N(2))-fixing Cyanobacteria, the filamentous, nonheterocystous marine Oscillatoria spp. (Trichodesmium) appears enigmatic; it exhibits N(2) fixation in the presence of oxygenic photosynthesis without structural protection of the N(2-)fixing apparatus (nitrogenase) from potential inhibition by molecular oxygen (O(2)). Characteristically, N(2) fixation is largely confined to aggregates (bundles) of filaments. Previous work has suggested that spatial partitioning of photosynthesis and of N(2) fixation occurs in the bundles as a means of allowing both processes to occur contemporaneously. The probing of freshly sampled bundles with O(2) microelectrodes directly confirmed such partitioning by showing the presence of O(2-)depleted (reduced) microzones in photosynthetically active, N(2-)fixing bundles. Bundle size was directly related to both the development of internal reduced microzones and cellular N(2) fixation rates. By enhancing microzone formation, bundles optimize N(2) fixation as a means of supporting Oscillatoria spp. blooms in surficial, nitrogen-depleted tropical and subtropical waters."
https://openalex.org/W2028556734,"Ocean general circulation theories predict that the position of the boundary between subtropical and subpolar gyres (and therefore the position of the Gulf Stream-North Atlantic Current system and the subpolar-subtropical front) is set by the line of zero ""Ekman pumping,"" where there is no convergence or divergence of water in the directly wind-forced surface layer of the ocean. In the present-day North Atlantic Ocean this line runs southwest to northeast, from off the Carolinas to off Ireland. However, during the last ice age (18,000 years ago) the subpolar-subtropical boundary ran more zonally, directly toward Gibraltar. A numerical atmospheric general circulation model indicates that the field of Ekman pumping 18,000 years ago was modified by the presence of a continental ice cap more than 3 kilometers thick such that the line of zero Ekman pumping overlaid the paleogyre boundary. These results demonstrate that the presence of a thick continental ice sheet could have caused changes in sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic during Quaternary glaciations by altering wind patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2054596801,"A new computer code can solve Einstein's equations of general relativity for the dynamical evolution of a relativistic star cluster. The cluster may contain a large number of stars that move in a strong gravitational field at speeds approaching the speed of light. Unstable star clusters undergo catastrophic collapse to black holes. The collapse of an unstable cluster to a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy may explain the origin of quasars and active galactic nuclei. By means of a supercomputer simulation and color graphics, the whole process can be viewed in real time on a movie screen."

https://openalex.org/W2089971391,"In the article “Fusion plan gathers steam” describing the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Environment Subcommittee hearing on restructuring the fusion energy program ([22 Mar., p. 1660][1]), Andrew Lawler quotes me as “warn[ing] that the lack of small-scale university fusion experiments is keeping young people from entering the field.” While this statement is likely correct, it was not part of my written testimony nor my remarks at the hearing. As co-chair of a recent National Research Council (NRC) study, Plasma Science: From Fundamental Science to Technological Applications (National Academy Press, 1995), I focused my remarks on small-scale basic research in plasma science. Of all of the areas considered in the NRC study, this was found to be the area of plasma science most in need of support. Because the fusion program is the largest nondefense user of plasma science, the study recommended that the program provide increased support for research in the underlying basic science.

Rather than being a critic of the new Department of Energy (DOE) program, I am pleased to say that both the report of DOE's Fusion Energy Advisory Committee, and the testimony of Martha Krebs at the hearing, indicate that they recognize the need to increase support for basic plasma science. Krebs, director of the Office of Energy Research, outlined DOE's plans to significantly increase funding for basic plasma science, beginning in fiscal year 1997, which will be an important step in remedying the current situation.

https://openalex.org/W2091443265,"R. L. Greene's letter of 23 February (p. 1039) mentions the important contributions of F. Wellstood and his co-workers to our present understanding of the pairing symmetry of high- T c superconductors, as well as the Maryland group's involvement in the development of scanning SQUID microscopy. Readers should also be aware of the original pioneering work in the field of SQUID microscopy at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in the early 1980s. F. P. Rogers, then a co-op student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with S. Bermon of IBM, developed the first scanning SQUID microscopy and demonstrated sensitivity to individual superconducting flux vortices ([1][1]). An integrated thin film version of the SQUID system used by Rogers and Bermon, from which all subsequent designs used in the recent IBM work were derived, was disclosed in the early 1980′s and was ultimately published in 1985 ([2][2]).
