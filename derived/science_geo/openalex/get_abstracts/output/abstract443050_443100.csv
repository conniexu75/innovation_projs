https://openalex.org/W2142755954,"Stroma in the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression, but how it promotes metastasis is poorly understood. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by many cell types and enable a potent mode of intercellular communication. Here, we report that fibroblast-secreted exosomes promote breast cancer cell (BCC) protrusive activity and motility via Wnt-planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. We show that exosome-stimulated BCC protrusions display mutually exclusive localization of the core PCP complexes, Fzd-Dvl and Vangl-Pk. In orthotopic mouse models of breast cancer, coinjection of BCCs with fibroblasts dramatically enhances metastasis that is dependent on PCP signaling in BCCs and the exosome component, Cd81 in fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that trafficking in BCCs promotes tethering of autocrine Wnt11 to fibroblast-derived exosomes. This work reveals an intercellular communication pathway whereby fibroblast exosomes mobilize autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling to drive BCC invasive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2145606954,"Ian Tomlinson and colleagues report the identification of germline variants in POLE and POLD1 that are susceptibility alleles for colorectal cancer. POLE and POLD1 encode DNA polymerases that function in DNA replication. Many individuals with multiple or large colorectal adenomas or early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) have no detectable germline mutations in the known cancer predisposition genes. Using whole-genome sequencing, supplemented by linkage and association analysis, we identified specific heterozygous POLE or POLD1 germline variants in several multiple-adenoma and/or CRC cases but in no controls. The variants associated with susceptibility, POLE p.Leu424Val and POLD1 p.Ser478Asn, have high penetrance, and POLD1 mutation was also associated with endometrial cancer predisposition. The mutations map to equivalent sites in the proofreading (exonuclease) domain of DNA polymerases ɛ and δ and are predicted to cause a defect in the correction of mispaired bases inserted during DNA replication. In agreement with this prediction, the tumors from mutation carriers were microsatellite stable but tended to acquire base substitution mutations, as confirmed by yeast functional assays. Further analysis of published data showed that the recently described group of hypermutant, microsatellite-stable CRCs is likely to be caused by somatic POLE mutations affecting the exonuclease domain."
https://openalex.org/W2113486281,"The high level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) present in neuronal genomes suggests that mechanisms interpreting 5hmC in the CNS may differ from those present in embryonic stem cells. Here, we present quantitative, genome-wide analysis of 5hmC, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and gene expression in differentiated CNS cell types in vivo. We report that 5hmC is enriched in active genes and that, surprisingly, strong depletion of 5mC is observed over these regions. The contribution of these epigenetic marks to gene expression depends critically on cell type. We identify methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the major 5hmC-binding protein in the brain and demonstrate that MeCP2 binds 5hmC- and 5mC-containing DNA with similar high affinities. The Rett-syndrome-causing mutation R133C preferentially inhibits 5hmC binding. These findings support a model in which 5hmC and MeCP2 constitute a cell-specific epigenetic mechanism for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression."

Here, we examined defined intermediate cell populations poised to becoming iPSCs by genome-wide analyses. We show that induced pluripotency elicits two transcriptional waves, which are driven by c-Myc/Klf4 (first wave) and Oct4/Sox2/Klf4 (second wave). Cells that become refractory to reprogramming activate the first but fail to initiate the second transcriptional wave and can be rescued by elevated expression of all four factors. The establishment of bivalent domains occurs gradually after the first wave, whereas changes in DNA methylation take place after the second wave when cells acquire stable pluripotency. This integrative analysis allowed us to identify genes that act as roadblocks during reprogramming and surface markers that further enrich for cells prone to forming iPSCs. Collectively, our data offer new mechanistic insights into the nature and sequence of molecular events inherent to cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2011589116,"Humans can see and name thousands of distinct object and action categories, so it is unlikely that each category is represented in a distinct brain area. A more efficient scheme would be to represent categories as locations in a continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the cortical surface. To search for such a space, we used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3ZWNkYzY3ZDRjOTFhY2IyM2M3OTFiMTQ1NjBjODcxYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MDE5MjExfQ.MnXqcH39fpSRVO-OGdiBQ4TA4YVMsfbp9BwgaXbD0UdjVdMVjxguJaLEcEjWn_jeLw62aNtoSTwVbgYECKSCxOV8JB3KVxwuLZLlwxScCBgmRBa4fEJ4AE73yyYqf0UNlMr1dvprFgupjUex_nlk0cJsqnNhqyt09V-od-7aRnj0HVawvGriN0EbDpUXKPuh2hFmRVUX43QrvfNwMmy9rN2t5lB_chBLlZZ2KjAMIbGypv5k2sM6VOzbU5WeONr5TP4Qn26AfULqEAMbOrKVacvLkkxNLeQEc2zl7icizgB9NgoicprQoEJx4R4YoflOvWRmGnXawndW9NKKTkZhxQ(mp4, (74.34 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2116527577,"Cell migration toward areas of higher extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity via a process called ""durotaxis"" is thought to contribute to development, immune response, and cancer metastasis. To understand how cells sample ECM rigidity to guide durotaxis, we characterized cell-generated forces on the nanoscale within single mature integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs). We found that individual FAs act autonomously, exhibiting either stable or dynamically fluctuating (""tugging"") traction. We show that a FAK/phosphopaxillin/vinculin pathway is essential for high FA traction and to enable tugging FA traction over a broad range of ECM rigidities. We show that tugging FA traction is dispensable for FA maturation, chemotaxis, and haptotaxis but is critical to direct cell migration toward rigid ECM. We conclude that individual FAs dynamically sample rigidity by applying fluctuating pulling forces to the ECM to act as sensors to guide durotaxis, and that FAK/phosphopaxillin/vinculin signaling defines the rigidity range over which this dynamic sensing process operates."
https://openalex.org/W2133009026,"If trait-associated variants alter regulatory regions, then they should fall within chromatin marks in relevant cell types. However, it is unclear which of the many marks are most useful in defining cell types associated with disease and fine mapping variants. We hypothesized that informative marks are phenotypically cell type specific; that is, SNPs associated with the same trait likely overlap marks in the same cell type. We examined 15 chromatin marks and found that those highlighting active gene regulation were phenotypically cell type specific. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) was the most phenotypically cell type specific (P < 1 × 10(-6)), driven by colocalization of variants and marks rather than gene proximity (P < 0.001). H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with 37 SNPs for plasma low-density lipoprotein concentration in the liver (P < 7 × 10(-5)), 31 SNPs for rheumatoid arthritis within CD4(+) regulatory T cells (P = 1 × 10(-4)), 67 SNPs for type 2 diabetes in pancreatic islet cells (P = 0.003) and the liver (P = 0.003), and 14 SNPs for neuropsychiatric disease in neuronal tissues (P = 0.007). We show how cell type-specific H3K4me3 peaks can inform the fine mapping of associated SNPs to identify causal variation."
https://openalex.org/W1969655931,"Itch-specific neurons have been sought for decades. The existence of such neurons has been doubted recently as a result of the observation that itch-mediating neurons also respond to painful stimuli. We genetically labeled and manipulated MrgprA3(+) neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and found that they exclusively innervated the epidermis of the skin and responded to multiple pruritogens. Ablation of MrgprA3(+) neurons led to substantial reductions in scratching evoked by multiple pruritogens and occurring spontaneously under chronic itch conditions, whereas pain sensitivity remained intact. Notably, mice in which TRPV1 was exclusively expressed in MrgprA3(+) neurons exhibited itch, but not pain, behavior in response to capsaicin. Although MrgprA3(+) neurons were sensitive to noxious heat, activation of TRPV1 in these neurons by noxious heat did not alter pain behavior. These data suggest that MrgprA3 defines a specific subpopulation of DRG neurons mediating itch. Our study opens new avenues for studying itch and developing anti-pruritic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2063287758,"We report the ∼2.66-Gb genome sequence of a female Yunnan black goat. The sequence was obtained by combining short-read sequencing data and optical mapping data from a high-throughput whole-genome mapping instrument. The whole-genome mapping data facilitated the assembly of super-scaffolds >5× longer by the N50 metric than scaffolds augmented by fosmid end sequencing (scaffold N50 = 3.06 Mb, super-scaffold N50 = 16.3 Mb). Super-scaffolds are anchored on chromosomes based on conserved synteny with cattle, and the assembly is well supported by two radiation hybrid maps of chromosome 1. We annotate 22,175 protein-coding genes, most of which were recovered in the RNA-seq data of ten tissues. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of the primary and secondary follicles of a cashmere goat reveal 51 genes that are differentially expressed between the two types of hair follicles. This study, whose results will facilitate goat genomics, shows that whole-genome mapping technology can be used for the de novo assembly of large genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1976896999,"Mice expressing a constitutively active form of RagA are unable to inhibit mTORC1 after birth and to trigger autophagy, and succumb perinatally. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is a major regulator of growth in eukaryotes and a drug target for common diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration. It is known that mTORC1 senses amino acids through the Rag family of GTPases, but their physiological importance is unknown. David M. Sabatini and colleagues show that following birth, which stops the maternal nutrient supply, mTORC1 is inhibited in mice in a Rag-dependent fashion. This inhibition triggers autophagy, which promotes the release of amino acids needed to sustain plasma glucose levels via gluconeogenesis between birth and suckling. Thus the Rag pathway acts as a general nutrient sensor, and through its regulation of mTORC1, helps maintain nutrient homeostasis and survival in neonates. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates organismal growth in response to many environmental cues, including nutrients and growth factors1. Cell-based studies showed that mTORC1 senses amino acids through the RagA–D family of GTPases2,3 (also known as RRAGA, B, C and D), but their importance in mammalian physiology is unknown. Here we generate knock-in mice that express a constitutively active form of RagA (RagAGTP) from its endogenous promoter. RagAGTP/GTP mice develop normally, but fail to survive postnatal day 1. When delivered by Caesarean section, fasted RagAGTP/GTP neonates die almost twice as rapidly as wild-type littermates. Within an hour of birth, wild-type neonates strongly inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycaemia and a decrease in plasma amino-acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition does not occur in RagAGTP/GTP neonates, despite identical reductions in blood nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wild-type neonates recover their plasma glucose concentrations, but RagAGTP/GTP mice remain hypoglycaemic until death, despite using glycogen at a faster rate. The glucose homeostasis defect correlates with the inability of fasted RagAGTP/GTP neonates to trigger autophagy and produce amino acids for de novo glucose production. Because profound hypoglycaemia does not inhibit mTORC1 in RagAGTP/GTP neonates, we considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well as amino-acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to glucose deprivation in RagAGTP/GTP fibroblasts, and glucose, like amino acids, controls its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Thus, the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino-acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have an unexpectedly key role in neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient homeostasis and viability."
https://openalex.org/W2053694886,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is caused by the cooperation of multiple oncogenic lesions. We used exome sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent filtering, we predict seven new oncogenic driver genes in T-ALL. We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7.9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9.8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10. Yeast and lymphoid cells expressing the RPL10 Arg98Ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis defect. Our data provide insights into the mutational landscape of pediatric versus adult T-ALL and identify the ribosome as a potential oncogenic factor."

Inhibiting Ligase IV could result in amassing of DSBs, thereby serving as a strategy toward treatment of cancer. Here, we identify a molecule, SCR7 that inhibits joining of DSBs in cell-free repair system. SCR7 blocks Ligase IV-mediated joining by interfering with its DNA binding but not that of T4 DNA Ligase or Ligase I. SCR7 inhibits NHEJ in a Ligase IV-dependent manner within cells, and activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

The genetic information is protected by processes such as DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis. DSBs are considered as one of the most lethal types of DNA damage within cells. Unrepaired DSBs can lead to chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, deletions, etc., resulting in oncogenic transformations or cell death (Nambiar and Raghavan, 2011Nambiar M. Raghavan S.C. How does DNA break during chromosomal translocations?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar; Zhu et al., 2002Zhu C. Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O.

In higher eukaryotes, NHEJ is one of the primary mechanisms of DSB repair and is active throughout the cell cycle (Mao et al., 2008Mao Z. Bozzella M. Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination during cell cycle in human cells.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). During NHEJ, KU70/KU80 heterodimer binds to the DNA ends and recruits proteins such as DNA-PKcs, Artemis, or Pol μ or λ to the repair site, resulting in end-processing followed by Ligase IV, XRCC4, and XLF complex-mediated ligation (Gostissa et al., 2011Gostissa M.

Nucleic Acids. 2010; 2010https://doi.org/10.4061/2010/389129Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Besides Ligase IV, Ligase I and III are the other two ligases in mammals (Ellenberger and Tomkinson, 2008Ellenberger T. Tomkinson A.E. Eukaryotic DNA ligases: structural and functional insights.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Ligase IV has a multidomain architecture, consisting of a conserved ligase domain at N terminus and a tandem BRCT domain at the C terminus. The central catalytic domain comprises adenylation and oligo-binding domains. It has been shown that N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) of Ligase IV is crucial for its interaction with DNA (Jayaram et al., 2008Jayaram S. Ketner G. Adachi N. Hanakahi L.A. Loss of DNA ligase IV prevents recognition of DNA by double-strand break repair proteins XRCC4 and XLF.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5773-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, unlike Ligase I, there is limited information about the structure of DBD of Ligase IV because it is yet to be crystallized (Pascal et al., 2004Pascal J.M. O’Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA.Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar; Sibanda et al., 2001Sibanda B.L.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Radio- and chemotherapy lead to the generation of DSBs as intermediates during their action. NHEJ plays a major role in providing resistance to cancer cells to these agents (Begg et al., 2011Begg A.C. Stewart F.A. Vens C. Strategies to improve radiotherapy with targeted drugs.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). For example, KU70/KU80 is overexpressed in breast and gastric cancers (Pucci et al., 2001Pucci S. Mazzarelli P. Rabitti C. Giai M. Gallucci M. Flammia G. Alcini A. Altomare V. Fazio V.M. Tumor specific modulation of KU70/80 DNA binding activity in breast and bladder human tumor biopsies.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Higher expression of DNA-PKcs has been correlated with radioresistance in oral squamous cell carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and esophageal cancer (Shintani et al., 2003Shintani S. Mihara M. Li C. Nakahara Y. Hino S. Nakashiro K. Hamakawa H.

Cancer. 1999; 35: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further, chemoresistant murine breast cancer cells exhibit reduced levels of γH2AX foci upon γ-radiation implying hyperactive DSB repair (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang M. Atkinson R.L. Rosen J.M. Selective targeting of radiation-resistant tumor-initiating cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 3522-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Patients with mutations or lower levels of Ligase IV are shown to be radiosensitive (Riballo et al., 1999Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. et al.Identification of a defect in DNA ligase IV in a radiosensitive leukaemia patient.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, polymorphisms in XRCC4 and Ligase IV have been reported in breast cancers (Kuschel et al., 2002Kuschel B. Auranen A. McBride S. Novik K.L. Antoniou A. Lipscombe J.M. Day N.E. Easton D.F. Ponder B.A. Pharoah P.D. Dunning A. Variants in DNA double-strand break repair genes and breast cancer susceptibility.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, downregulation of NHEJ in cancer cells could lead to elevated sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. This prompted us to hypothesize that inhibition of NHEJ can be used as a means of making cancer cells hypersensitive to radiations and other DSB inducing agents. We chose Ligase IV as a potential target because it is the crucial enzyme involved in NHEJ. Specifically, we considered strategic targeting of the DBD of Ligase IV such that it reduces its binding affinity for DSBs and deters its physiological function. In the present study, we identify SCR7 as a putative inhibitor of NHEJ. SCR7 blocked end-joining (EJ) by interfering with Ligase IV binding to DNA, thereby leading to accumulation of DSBs within the cells, culminating into cytotoxicity. Further, using various mouse models, we show that SCR7 impedes progression of tumor growth by activating intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and thereby enhancing lifespan. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with SCR7 resulted in a significant increase in the sensitivity of tumors toward radiation and etoposide. In absence of structural information for DBD of Ligase IV, a representative 3D model of human Ligase IV (1–241 aa) was built by a threading approach (I-TASSER) using multiple templates arising from crystal structures of DBDs of other Ligases. DBD of Ligase IV exhibited overall structural similarity with that of Ligase I (RMSD = 1.6 Å for 190 Cα atoms) (Figure 1A). It is noted that the conserved RLRLG and ELGVGD motif of the DBD of Ligase I that interacts with nicked DNA (Pascal et al., 2004Pascal J.M. O’Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA.Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) is conserved spatially in DBD of Ligase IV (DLKLG and AYGIKE in Ligase IV), suggesting that these ligases might exhibit similar contacts with the substrate DNA (Figure 1A). Multiple sequence alignment of DBDs of other ligases also showed the conservation of this motif (Figure S1A available online). Based on these clues, a DNA-containing DSB was docked with DBD of Ligase IV. Side chains of Lys30, Arg32, Lys35, Arg69, Lys195, Gly197 (main chain NH), Ser199, Gln201, Lys85, and Tyr82 from the DBD of Ligase IV were found to be involved in hydrogen bonding with anionic oxygen (Sp) of phosphates of DSB (Figure 1B).Figure S1Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of SCR7 and Its Effect on DNA End-Joining, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Multiple sequence alignment of DNA binding domain of various ligases.

The bar graph shows mean ± standard error mean (SEM) from three independent experiments. “PSLU” is “photostimulated luminescence unit.” A previous docking study on Ligase I with potential inhibitors had identified the small molecule L189 to possess inhibitory action against all three mammalian ligases (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Zhong S. Zhu X. Dziegielewska B. Ellenberger T. Wilson G.M. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Tomkinson A.E. Rational design of human DNA ligase inhibitors that target cellular DNA replication and repair.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3169-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Its docking with the current homology modeled complex of Ligase IV DBD and substrate DSB DNA duplex helped us in understanding possible interactions that could be exploited in designing potential Ligase IV inhibitors. Examining the amino acid composition of binding pocket together with multiple sequence alignment (Figure S1A) suggested that placing a substituent (ring C) emanating from amine group meta to the SH group (ring A) such as benzaldehyde might increase its inhibitory action. In silico docking of the modified compound indicated that addition of the ring C could result in the loss of vital interactions involving conserved basic residues viz., Lys35, Lys30 or Lys184, Arg188 of DBD of Ligase IV, and anionic phosphates of DNA duplex, in addition to other conserved residues (Figure S1B). The designed inhibitors were then docked with DBD of Ligase IV, and their binding energies estimated. The results pointed to a favorable binding energy (−29.14 kcal/mol) for the compound SCR7 as compared to others (Figures 1C and S1C). Further, the inhibitors were synthesized and characterized (Figures 1C and S1D). Previously, it was shown that testicular cell-free extracts are proficient in NHEJ (Sathees and Raman, 1999Sathees C.R. Raman M.J. Mouse testicular extracts process DNA double-strand breaks efficiently by DNA end-to-end joining.Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Sharma et al., 2011Sharma S.

Life Sci. 2011; 68: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, a cell-free repair assay system derived from rat testes was used to study the effect of putative Ligase IV inhibitors on NHEJ (Figures S1E and S1F) (Kumar et al., 2010Kumar T.S. Kari V. Choudhary B. Nambiar M. Akila T.S. Raghavan S.C. Anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 down-regulates DNA end joining in cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32657-32670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; Sharma et al., 2011Sharma S. Choudhary B. Raghavan S.C. Efficiency of nonhomologous DNA end joining varies among somatic tissues, despite similarity in mechanism.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results showed inhibition of end-joining of DSBs (5′ overhangs) by different compounds, and SCR7 was found to be the most potent (Figures S1G and S1H). The purity of SCR7 was characterized by MS and LC-MS. Previously reported ligase inhibitors, L189 (referred as SCR6) and L82 (inhibits Ligase I, SCR5), were used as controls (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Zhong S. Zhu X. Dziegielewska B. Ellenberger T. Wilson G.M. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Tomkinson A.E. Rational design of human DNA ligase inhibitors that target cellular DNA replication and repair.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3169-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). SCR7 inhibited EJ of [γ-32P]ATP labeled double-stranded oligomeric DNA possessing 5′ compatible, blunt, 5′-5′ or 5′-3′ noncompatible ends. Irrespective of the type of DSBs, SCR7 inhibited EJ mediated by testicular extracts in a concentration-dependent manner from 50 μM (Figures 1D–1G). However, when extracts from liver and kidney, possessing lower NHEJ were used, SCR7 inhibited the joining even at 10 μM (Figures S2A and S2B). On the other hand, SCR5 did not inhibit EJ catalyzed by testicular extracts (Figure 1H). SCR7 could also inhibit EJ of a plasmid DNA linearized with EcoRI, HindIII (5′ overhangs) or PstI (3′ overhangs) (Figure 1I). Thus, SCR7 inhibited EJ irrespective of configuration of DSBs. Ligase IV/XRCC4 complex can efficiently join compatible ends (Gu et al., 2007Gu J. Lu H. Tippin B. Shimazaki N. Goodman M.F. Lieber M.R. XRCC4:DNA ligase IV can ligate incompatible DNA ends and can ligate across gaps.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1010-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas joining of noncompatible termini requires additional proteins for end processing. To further confirm whether SCR7 interfered with Ligase IV activity, we used purified Ligase IV/XRCC4 complex for joining assay (Figures S2C, S2F, S2H, and 2A). Results showed that incubation with increasing concentrations of SCR7 inhibited the formation of multimers at 200 μM and above, unlike SCR5 (Figures 2B and 2C ). The effect of SCR7 on joining catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase and mammalian Ligase I and III was investigated to test its specificity. In the case of T4 DNA ligase, no reduction in the joining was observed when compatible ends were used (Figure 2C). Further, SCR7 did not affect joining catalyzed by Ligase I on nicked substrates when equimolar concentration of protein was used (Figures 2D and S2D and S2H). However, when purified Ligase IIIα/XRCC1 was used, SCR7 inhibited the ligation of nicked substrates (Figures 2D and S2E, S2H, and S2I). In order to further validate the specificity of SCR7 with respect to NHEJ in cell-free extracts, Ligase IV complementation was performed. Results showed that the addition of SCR7 to the testicular extracts abrogated end-joining (Figure 2E, lane 3, and 2F). Interestingly, addition of purified Ligase IV/XRCC4 restored joining including that of noncompatible ends (Figures 2E and 2F), establishing SCR7 as an inhibitor of NHEJ. Studies using Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and gel shift assay ruled out the possibility of SCR7 acting as an intercalating agent (Figures S3A–S3C). Based on the above studies, we were interested in testing how SCR7 interferes with NHEJ. It is known that KU70/KU80 complex recruits and stabilizes Ligase IV/XRCC4 to the DNA ends (Nick McElhinny et al., 2000Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Ku recruits the XRCC4-ligase IV complex to DNA ends.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Results showed that Ligase IV/XRCC4 had more affinity to the KU70/KU80-coated ternary DNA complex, consistent with previous reports (Figures 3A and 3B ) (Nick McElhinny et al., 2000Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Ku recruits the XRCC4-ligase IV complex to DNA ends.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Addition of purified Ligase IV/XRCC4 to the KU:DNA complex resulted in a supershift due to its interaction with the KU bound DNA (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3D). Interestingly, a dose-dependent reduction in supershift was observed, upon addition of SCR7 indicating the unavailability of Ligase IV to interact with DNA (Figures 3C, lanes 4–6, and S3D, lanes 3–9). More importantly, addition of Ligase IV/XRCC4 (30, 60, and 90 fmol) to the reaction led to a concentration-dependent supershift, confirming the specificity of SCR7 to Ligase IV (Figure 3C, lanes 7–9). In order to exclude the effect of the interacting partner, XRCC4 and determine the domain responsible for binding of SCR7 to Ligase IV, we used purified Ligase IV and its DBD for CD spectroscopy (Figures 3D, S2G, and S2H). Results showed a clear shift in the spectrum upon addition of SCR7 to Ligase IV or its DBD, as compared to control (Figure 3D). Further, the shift observed upon binding of SCR7 to DBD was directly proportional to its concentration until 6 × 10−18 M and remained unchanged thereafter (Figure S3E). In addition, SCR7 binding also resulted in a significant decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of DBD, suggesting the quenching of aromatic residues present at the interaction site (Figure 3E). Hence, these results suggest specific binding of SCR7 to DBD of Ligase IV. To examine the mechanism by which SCR7 disrupts binding of DBD of Ligase IV to the DNA duplex, we performed docking studies. A putative binding pocket defined by residues Arg69 and Asp193 to Gly197 (conserved DLKLG motif) within the DBD was chosen. Three poses for SCR7 were generated (data not shown), out of which a pose with favorable energy and appropriate shape complementarity was docked with DBD complexed with a DSB (Figure 3F). Atom groups OH, N, and SH from the ring A of SCR7 engage in a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp193, Arg69, and the backbone carbonyl of Leu196 (Figure 3G). As a result of the binding of SCR7, hydrogen bond interactions observed earlier, involving residues Arg69, Lys195, Gly197 (of the DLKLG motif), Ser199, and Gln201 of DBD and anionic oxygen of the phosphates of DNA duplex were completely lost (Figures 3G and 3H). Also, the aromatic ring C of SCR7 sterically blocked the interactions that could arise from the other highly conserved basic residues viz., Lys184 and Arg188 (Figure 3F). Loss of these critical interactions seemingly renders SCR7 as a competitive inhibitor, which is consistent with above observations (Figures 3, S3D, and S3E). An extrachromosomal assay system was used to evaluate the effect of SCR7 on NHEJ inside the cells. I-SceI-induced DSBs in pJS296 episome, which upon repair by NHEJ can restore GFP expression (Figure 4A). Results showed GFP-positive recombinants upon expression of I-SceI confirming NHEJ (Figure 4A). Interestingly, upon addition of SCR7, a decrease in the recombination, following normalization of transfection efficiency, was observed suggesting inhibition of NHEJ at the intracellular level (Figure 4A). Based on the above observations, we wondered whether the inhibition of innate NHEJ could result in the accumulation of unrepaired DSBs at the genome level. To test this, we treated breast (MCF7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines with SCR7, followed by immunofluorescence and western blotting studies, by using anti-γH2AX. Results showed an increase in levels of γH2AX foci and protein, indicative of unrepaired DSBs within cells (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4A–S4C). The number of foci observed due to SCR7 was comparable to those generated during siRNA knockdown of Ligase IV (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4B). As a control, we used scrambled siRNA and siRNA against Ligase I and III (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4B). However, similar experiments on K562 cells did not yield any γH2AX foci, even at highest concentrations of SCR7, possibly due to low expression of Ligase IV (Figure S4A). To exclude the possibility that SCR7 could generate DSBs directly, independent of Ligase IV, N114 (Ligase IV−/−), and Nalm6 (wild-type) cells were treated with SCR7 and assessed for γH2AX levels by western blotting and immunofluorescence (Figures S4D and S4E). Results showed that γH2AX expression remained unchanged upon SCR7 treatment in Ligase IV−/− cells, whereas a significant increase was noted in case of Nalm6 cells (Figure S4D). Both the cell lines showed substantial enhancement in γH2AX and foci expression upon bleomycin treatment, a known DSB inducing agent (Figures S4D and S4E). Overall, these results suggest that SCR7 does not induce DSBs directly to the genome and is Ligase IV dependent. Besides, upon incubation of oligomeric dsDNA or supercoiled plasmid DNA with increasing concentrations of SCR7, there was no evidence for DNA breaks (Figure S4F). Thus, SCR7 interferes with NHEJ in cells, leading to accumulation of unrepaired DSBs. To evaluate whether accumulation of DSBs leads to cell death upon SCR7 treatment, we performed a comparison of cytotoxicity among various human cell lines derived from breast (MCF7, T47D), cervical (HeLa), lung (A549), and ovarian (A2780) cancers; fibrosarcoma (HT1080); and leukemia (K562, Reh, Nalm6 and CEM), by using either MTT or trypan blue exclusion assays. Results showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation of MCF7, A549, and HeLa (Figures 4D–4G) with an IC50 of 40, 34, and 44 μM, respectively, which was further confirmed by DIC imaging in MCF7 (Figure 4E). T47D, A2780, and HT1080 were also sensitive to SCR7, with an IC50 of 8.5, 120, and 10 μM, respectively (Figure 4G). In contrast, SCR7-mediated cytotoxicity was limited when leukemic cell lines were used, except for Nalm6, which showed an IC50 of 50 μM (Figure 4G). Expression of Ligase IV in different cancer cells could be correlated with their sensitivity to SCR7 (Figure S4G), with an exception of T47D, which has low levels of Ligase IV. This could be possibly due to a change in the proapoptotic to antiapoptotic ratio, because of its aberrant BCL2 status (Zapata et al., 1998Zapata J.M. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Huang R.P. Takayama S.

Treat. 1998; 47: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To delineate the effect of SCR7 on homologous recombination (HR) and NHEJ, an HR-deficient cell line, HCC1937 (BRCA1−/−) was used. Results showed elevated sensitivity of this cell line to SCR7, compared to its wild-type, MCF7, indicating that in the absence of HR, DSBs generated due to blockage of Ligase IV remain unrepaired leading to enhanced cell death (Figure 4D). To further investigate whether the cytotoxicity observed was specific to Ligase IV inhibition, N114, and Nalm6 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SCR7. Results showed that N114 remained"

Here we describe a microRNA (miRNA)-dependent association between apelin (APLN) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). APLN deficiency in these cells led to increased expression of FGF2 and its receptor FGFR1 as a consequence of decreased expression of miR-424 and miR-503, which directly target FGF2 and FGFR1. miR-424 and miR-503 were downregulated in PAH, exerted antiproliferative effects in PAECs and inhibited the capacity of PAEC-conditioned medium to induce the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth-muscle cells. Reconstitution of miR-424 and miR-503 in vivo ameliorated pulmonary hypertension in experimental models. These studies identify an APLN-dependent miRNA-FGF signaling axis needed for the maintenance of pulmonary vascular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2042892138,"Mice overexpressing eIF4E show autism-related behaviours and altered synaptic activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum, and these phenotypes can be rescued with the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4EGI-1. Aberrant protein synthesis has been hypothesized as one causal mechanism of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the details of which pathways are disrupted remain unknown. Disruption of eIF4E, a key factor for translation initiation, has been associated with human autism, and now two independent papers implicate excessive cap-dependent translation in synaptic and ASD-related behavioural deficits in mice. Nahum Sonenberg and colleagues show that mice lacking 4E-BP2, an eIF4E repressor, display increased translation of neuroligins, synaptic proteins strongly implicated in autism. The mice also display ASD-related behaviors and alterations in hippocampal synaptic activity, which are reversed by normalization of eIF4E activity or neuroligin 1 levels. Eric Klann and colleagues show that mice overexpressing eIF4E also display ASD-related behaviours and altered synaptic activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum, and that some phenotypes can be rescued with the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4EGI-1. The converging results from these two studies implicate cap-dependent translation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of ASD-related symptoms. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are an early onset, heterogeneous group of heritable neuropsychiatric disorders with symptoms that include deficits in social interaction skills, impaired communication abilities, and ritualistic-like repetitive behaviours1,2. One of the hypotheses for a common molecular mechanism underlying ASDs is altered translational control resulting in exaggerated protein synthesis3. Genetic variants in chromosome 4q, which contains the EIF4E locus, have been described in patients with autism4,5. Importantly, a rare single nucleotide polymorphism has been identified in autism that is associated with increased promoter activity in the EIF4E gene6. Here we show that genetically increasing the levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in mice7 results in exaggerated cap-dependent translation and aberrant behaviours reminiscent of autism, including repetitive and perseverative behaviours and social interaction deficits. Moreover, these autistic-like behaviours are accompanied by synaptic pathophysiology in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus. The autistic-like behaviours displayed by the eIF4E-transgenic mice are corrected by intracerebroventricular infusions of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4EGI-1. Our findings demonstrate a causal relationship between exaggerated cap-dependent translation, synaptic dysfunction and aberrant behaviours associated with autism."

We leverage new insights into anaerobe metabolism to propose geochemical origins that account for the ubiquity of chemiosmotic coupling, and Na(+)/H(+) transporters in particular. Natural proton gradients acting across thin FeS walls within alkaline hydrothermal vents could drive carbon assimilation, leading to the emergence of protocells within vent pores. Protocell membranes that were initially leaky would eventually become less permeable, forcing cells dependent on natural H(+) gradients to pump Na(+) ions. Our hypothesis accounts for the Na(+)/H(+) promiscuity of bioenergetic proteins, as well as the deep divergence between bacteria and archaea."
https://openalex.org/W2094584847,"Chromatin modifications have been implicated in the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the function of histone variant H2A.Z in ESCs remains unclear. We show that H2A.Z is highly enriched at promoters and enhancers and is required for both efficient self-renewal and differentiation of murine ESCs. H2A.Z deposition leads to an abnormal nucleosome structure, decreased nucleosome occupancy, and increased chromatin accessibility. In self-renewing ESCs, knockdown of H2A.Z compromises OCT4 binding to its target genes and leads to decreased binding of MLL complexes to active genes and of PRC2 complex to repressed genes. During differentiation of ESCs, inhibition of H2A.Z also compromises RA-induced RARα binding, activation of differentiation markers, and the repression of pluripotency genes. We propose that H2A.Z mediates such contrasting activities by acting as a general facilitator that generates access for a variety of complexes, both activating and repressive."
https://openalex.org/W3037615265,"Smoke, fog, jelly, paints, milk and shaving cream are common everyday examples of colloids, a type of soft matter consisting of tiny particles dispersed in chemically distinct host media. Being abundant in nature, colloids also find increasingly important applications in science and technology, ranging from direct probing of kinetics in crystals and glasses to fabrication of third-generation quantum-dot solar cells. Because naturally occurring colloids have a shape that is typically determined by minimization of interfacial tension (for example, during phase separation) or faceted crystal growth, their surfaces tend to have minimum-area spherical or topologically equivalent shapes such as prisms and irregular grains (all continuously deformable--homeomorphic--to spheres). Although toroidal DNA condensates and vesicles with different numbers of handles can exist and soft matter defects can be shaped as rings and knots, the role of particle topology in colloidal systems remains unexplored. Here we fabricate and study colloidal particles with different numbers of handles and genus g ranging from 1 to 5. When introduced into a nematic liquid crystal--a fluid made of rod-like molecules that spontaneously align along the so-called 'director'--these particles induce three-dimensional director fields and topological defects dictated by colloidal topology. Whereas electric fields, photothermal melting and laser tweezing cause transformations between configurations of particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total charge of particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet and Poincaré-Hopf index theorems. This allows us to establish and experimentally test the procedure for assignment and summation of topological charges in three-dimensional director fields. Our findings lay the groundwork for new applications of colloids and liquid crystals that range from topological memory devices, through new types of self-assembly, to the experimental study of low-dimensional topology."

We propose that human intelligence is composed of multiple independent components Each behavioral component is associated with a distinct functional brain network The higher-order “g” factor is an artifact of tasks recruiting multiple networks The components of intelligence dissociate when correlated with demographic variables Few topics in psychology are as old or as controversial as the study of human intelligence. In 1904, Charles Spearman famously observed that performance was correlated across a spectrum of seemingly unrelated tasks (Spearman, 1904Spearman C. “General intelligence” objectively determined and measured.Am. J. Psychol. 1904; 15: 201-293Crossref Google Scholar). He proposed that a dominant general factor “g” accounts for correlations in performance between all cognitive tasks, with residual differences across tasks reflecting task-specific factors. More controversially, on the basis of subsequent attempts to measure “g” using tests that generate an intelligence quotient (IQ), it has been suggested that population variables including gender (Irwing and Lynn, 2005Irwing P.

Jensen A.R. Thirty years of research on race differences in cognitive ability.Psychololgy, Public Policy, and Law. 2005; 11: 235-294Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar) correlate with “g” and, by extension, with one’s genetically predetermined potential. It remains unclear, however, whether population differences in intelligence test scores are driven by heritable factors or by other correlated demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, education level, and motivation (Gould, 1981Gould S.J. The Mismeasure of Man. Norton, New York1981Google Scholar; Horn and Cattell, 1966Horn J.L. Cattell R.B. Refinement and test of the theory of fluid and crystallized general intelligences.J. Educ. Psychol. 1966; 57: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). More relevantly, it is questionable whether they relate to a unitary intelligence factor, as opposed to a bias in testing paradigms toward particular components of a more complex intelligence construct (Gould, 1981Gould S.J. The Mismeasure of Man. Norton, New York1981Google Scholar; Horn and Cattell, 1966Horn J.L. Cattell R.B. Refinement and test of the theory of fluid and crystallized general intelligences.J. Educ.

Indeed, over the past 100 years, there has been much debate over whether general intelligence is unitary or composed of multiple factors (Carroll, 1993Carroll J.B. Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-Analytic Studies. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1993Crossref Google Scholar; Cattell, 1949Cattell R.B.

Bouchard T.J. The structure of human intelligence: It is verbal, perceptual, and image rotation (VPR), not fluid and crystallized.Intelligence. 2005; 33: 393-416Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This debate is driven by the observation that test measures tend to form distinctive clusters. When combined with the intractability of developing tests that measure individual cognitive processes, it is likely that a more complex set of factors contribute to correlations in performance (Carroll, 1993Carroll J.B. Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-Analytic Studies. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1993Crossref Google Scholar). Defining the biological basis of these factors remains a challenge, however, due in part to the limitations of behavioral factor analyses. More specifically, behavioral factor analyses do not provide an unambiguous model of the underlying cognitive architecture, as the factors themselves are inaccessible, being measured indirectly by estimating linear components from correlations between the performance measures of different tests. Thus, for a given set of behavioral correlations, there are many factor solutions of varying degrees of complexity, all of which are equally able to account for the data. This ambiguity is typically resolved by selecting a simple and interpretable factor solution. However, interpretability does not necessarily equate to biological reality. Furthermore, the accuracy of any factor model depends on the collection of a large number of population measures. Consequently, the classical approach to intelligence testing is hampered by the logistical requirements of pen and paper testing. It would appear, therefore, that the classical approach to behavioral factor analysis is near the limit of its resolution. Neuroimaging has the potential to provide additional constraint to behavioral factor models by leveraging the spatial segregation of functional brain networks. For example, if one homogeneous system supports all intelligence processes, then a common network of brain regions should be recruited whenever difficulty increases across all cognitive tasks, regardless of the exact stimulus, response, or cognitive process that is manipulated. Conversely, if intelligence is supported by multiple specialized systems, anatomically distinct brain networks should be recruited when tasks that load on distinct intelligence factors are undertaken. On the surface, neuroimaging results accord well with the former account. Thus, a common set of frontal and parietal brain regions is rendered when peak activation coordinates from a broad range of tasks that parametrically modulate difficulty are smoothed and averaged (Duncan and Owen, 2000Duncan J. Owen A.M. Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). The same set of multiple demand (MD) regions is activated during tasks that load on “g” (Duncan, 2005Duncan J. Prefrontal cortex and Spearman’s g.in: Duncan J. Phillips L.H. McLeod P. Measuring the Mind: Speed, Control, and Age. Oxford University Press, Oxford2005: 249-272Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar; Jung and Haier, 2007Jung R.E. Haier R.J.

Brain Sci. 2007; 30 (discussion 154–187): 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), while the level of activation within frontoparietal cortex correlates with individuals differences in IQ score (Gray et al., 2003Gray J.R. Chabris C.F. Braver T.S. Neural mechanisms of general fluid intelligence.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Critically, after brain damage, the size of the lesion within, but not outside of, MD cortex is correlated with the estimated drop in IQ (Woolgar et al., 2010Woolgar A. Parr A. Cusack R. Thompson R. Nimmo-Smith I. Torralva T. Roca M. Antoun N. Manes F. Duncan J. Fluid intelligence loss linked to restricted regions of damage within frontal and parietal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 14899-14902Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, these results should not necessarily be equated with a proof that intelligence is unitary. More specifically, if intelligence is formed from multiple cognitive systems and one looks for brain responses during tasks that weigh most heavily on the “g” factor, one will most likely corecruit all of those functionally distinct systems. Similarly, by rendering brain activation based on many task demands, one will have the statistical power to render the networks that are most commonly recruited, even if they are not always corecruited. Indeed, there is mounting evidence demonstrating that different MD regions respond when distinct cognitive demands are manipulated (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L.

However, such a vast array of highly specific functional dissociations have been proposed in the neuroimaging literature as a whole that they often lack credibility, as they fail to account for the broader involvement of the same brain regions in other aspects of cognition (Duncan and Owen, 2000Duncan J. Owen A.M.

The role of the right inferior frontal gyrus: inhibition and attentional control.Neuroimage. 2010; 50: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The question remains, therefore, whether intelligence is supported by one or multiple systems, and if the latter is the case, which cognitive processes those systems can most broadly be described as supporting. Furthermore, even if multiple functionally distinct brain networks contribute to intelligence, it is unknown whether the capacities of those networks are independent or are related to the same set of diffuse biological factors that modulate general neural efficiency. It is unclear, therefore, whether the pattern of individual differences in intelligence reflects the functional organization of the brain. Here, we address the question of whether human intelligence is best conceived of as an emergent property of functionally distinct brain networks using factor analyses of brain imaging, behavioral, and simulated data. First, we break MD cortex down into its constituent functional networks by factor analyzing regional activation levels during the performance of 12 challenging cognitive tasks. Then, we build a model, based on the extent to which the different functional networks are recruited during the performance of those 12 tasks, and determine how well that model accounts for cross-task correlations in performance in a large (n = 44,600) population sample. Factor solutions, generated from brain imaging and behavioral data, are compared directly, to answer the question of whether the same set of cognitive entities is evident in the functional organization of the brain and in individual differences in performance. Simulations, based on the imaging data, are used to determine the extent to which correlations between first-order behavioral components are predicted by cognitive tasks recruiting multiple functional brain networks, and the extent to which those correlations may be accounted for by a spatially diffuse general factor. Finally, we examine whether the behavioral components of intelligence show a degree of independence, as evidenced by dissociable correlations with the types of questionnaire variable that “g” has historically been associated with. Sixteen healthy young participants undertook the cognitive battery in the MRI scanner. The cognitive battery consisted of 12 tasks, which, based on well-established paradigms from the neuropsychology literature, measured a range of the types of planning, reasoning, attentional, and working memory skills that are considered akin to general intelligence (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). The activation level of each voxel within MD cortex was calculated separately for each task relative to a resting baseline using general linear modeling (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and the resultant values were averaged across participants to remove between-subject variability in activation—for example, due to individual differences in regional signal intensity. The question of how many functionally distinct networks were apparent within MD cortex was addressed using exploratory factor analysis. Voxels within MD cortex (Figure 1A) were transformed into 12 vectors, one for each task, and these were examined using principal components analysis (PCA), a factor analysis technique that extracts orthogonal linear components from the 12-by-12 matrix of task-task bivariate correlations. The results revealed two “significant” principal components, each of which explained more variability in brain activation than was contributed by any one task. These components accounted for ∼90% of the total variance in task-related activation across MD cortex (Table S1). After orthogonal rotation with the Varimax algorithm, the strengths of the task-component loadings were highly variable and easily comprehensible (Table 1 and Figure 1B). Specifically, all of the tasks in which information had to be actively maintained in short-term memory, for example, spatial working memory, digit span, and visuospatial working memory, loaded heavily on one component (MDwm). Conversely, all of the tasks in which information had to be transformed in mind according to logical rules, for example, deductive reasoning, grammatical reasoning, spatial rotations, and color-word remapping, loaded heavily on the other component (MDr). When factor scores were generated at each voxel using regression and projected back onto the brain, two clearly defined functional networks were rendered (Figure 1D). Thus, the insula/frontal operculum (IFO), the superior frontal sulcus (SFS), and the ventral portion of the anterior cingulate cortex/ presupplementary motor area (ACC/preSMA) had greater MDwm component scores, whereas the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), and the dorsal portion of the ACC/preSMA had greater MDr component scores. When the PCA was rerun with spherical regions of interest (ROIs) centered on each MD subregion, with radii that varied from 10 to 25 mm in 5 mm steps and excluding voxels that were on average deactivated, the task loadings correlated with those from the MD mask at r > 0.95 for both components and at all radii. Thus, the PCA solution was robust against variations in the extent of the ROIs. When data from the whole brain were analyzed using the same method, three significant components were generated, the first two of which correlated with those from the MD cortex analysis (MDr r = 0.76, MDwm r = 0.83), demonstrating that these were the most prominent active-state networks in the brain. The factor solution was also reliable at the individual subject level. Rerunning the same PCA on each individual’s data generated solutions with two significant components in 13/16 cases. There was one three-component solution and two four-component solutions. Rerunning the two-component PCA with each individual’s data set included as 12 separate columns (an approach that did not constrain the same task to load on the same component across participants) demonstrated that the pattern of task-component loadings was also highly reliable at the individual subject level (Figure 1C). In order to test the reliability of the functional networks across participants, the data were concatenated instead of averaged into 12 columns (an approach that does not constrain the same voxels to load on the same components across individuals), and component scores were estimated at each voxel and projected back into two sets of 16 brain maps. When t contrasts were calculated against zero at the group level, the same MDwm and MDr functional networks were rendered (Figure 1E).Table 1PCA and ICA of Activation Levels in 2,275 MD Voxels during the Performance of 12 Cognitive TasksPCAICAMDrMDwmMDrMDwmSelf-ordered search0.380.691.453.26Visuospatial working memory0.270.841.242.68Spatial span0.170.860.512.23Digit span0.280.760.762.20Paired associates0.560.621.901.97Spatial planning0.580.502.432.74Feature match0.680.492.000.88Interlocking polygons0.740.312.110.61Verbal reasoning0.780.152.620.60Spatial rotation0.750.442.861.88Color-word remapping0.690.423.070.95Deductive reasoning0.900.183.980.19PCA/ICA correlation MDrr = 0.92PCA/ICA correlation MDwmr = 0.81 Open table in a new tab While the PCA works well to identify the number of significant components, a potential weakness for this method is that the unrotated task-component loadings are liable to be formed from mixtures of the underlying factors and are heavily biased toward the component that is extracted first. This weakness necessitates the application of rotation to the task-component matrix; however, rotation is not perfect, as it identifies the task-component loadings that fit an arbitrary set of criteria designed to generate the simplest and most interpretable solution. To deal with this potential issue, the task-functional network loadings were recalculated using independent component analysis (ICA), an analysis technique that exploits the more powerful properties of statistical independence to extract the sources from mixed signals. Here, we used ICA to extract two spatially distinct functional brain networks using gradient ascent toward maximum entropy (code adapted from Stone and Porrill, 1999Stone, J.V., and Porrill, J. (1999). Regularisation using spatiotemporal independence and predictability. Computational Neuroscience Report 201. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.45.7701&rep=rep1&type=pdf.Google Scholar). The resultant components were broadly similar, although not identical, to those from the PCA (Table 1). More specifically, all tasks loaded positively on both independent brain networks but to highly varied extents, with the short-term memory tasks loading heavily on one component and the tasks that involved transforming information according to logical rules loading heavily on the other. Based on these results, it is reasonable to conclude that MD cortex is formed from at least two functional networks, with all 12 cognitive tasks recruiting both networks but to highly variable extents. A critical question is whether the loadings of the tasks on the MDwm and MDr functional brain networks form a good predictor of the pattern of cross-task correlations in performance observed in the general population. That is, does the same set of cognitive entities underlay the large-scale functional organization of the brain and individual differences in performance? It is important to note that factor analyses typically require many measures. In the case of the spatial factor analyses reported above, measures were taken from 2,275 spatially distinct “voxels” within MD cortex. In the case of the behavioral analyses, we used scores from ∼110,000 participants who logged in to undertake Internet-optimized variants of the same 12 tasks. Of these, ∼60,000 completed all 12 tasks and a post task questionnaire. After case-wise removal of extreme outliers, null values, nonsense questionnaire responses, and exclusion of participants above the age of 70 and below the age of 12, exactly 44,600 data sets, each composed of 12 standardized task scores, were included in the analysis (see Experimental Procedures). The loadings of the tasks on the MDwm and MDr networks from the ICA were formed into two vectors. These were regressed onto each individual’s set of 12 standardized task scores with no constant term. When each individual’s MDwm and MDr beta weights (representing component scores) were varied in this manner, they centered close to zero, showed no positive correlation (MDwm mean beta = 0.05 ± 1.78; MDr mean beta = 0.11 ± 2.92; MDwm-MDr correlation r = −0.20), and, importantly, accounted for 34.3% of the total variance in performance scores. For comparison, the first two principal components of the behavioral data accounted for 36.6% of the variance. Thus, the model based on the brain imaging data captured close to the maximum amount of variance that could be accounted for by the two best-fitting orthogonal linear components. The average test-retest reliability of the 12 tasks, collected in an earlier Internet cohort (Table S2), was 68%. Consequently, the imaging ICA model predicted >50% of the reliable variance in performance. The statistical significance of this fit was tested against 1,000 permutations, in which the MDwm and MDr vectors were randomly rearranged both within and across vector prior to regression. The original vectors formed a better fit than the permuted vectors in 100% of cases, demonstrating that the brain imaging model was a significant predictor of the performance data relative to models with the same fine-grained values and the same level of complexity. Two further sets of permutation tests were carried out in which one vector was held constant and the other randomly permuted 1,000 times. When the MDwm vector was permuted, the original vectors formed a better fit in 100% of cases. When the MDr vector was permuted, the original vectors formed a better fit in 99.3% of cases. Thus, both the MDwm and the MDr vectors were significant predictors of individual differences in behavioral performance. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out on the behavioral data using PCA. There were three significant behavioral components that each accounted for more variance than was contributed by any one test (Table S3) and that together accounted for 45% of the total variance. After orthogonal rotation with the Varimax algorithm, the first two components showed a marked similarity to the loadings of the tasks on the MDwm and MDr networks (Table 2). Thus, the first component (STM) included all of the tasks in which information was held actively on line in short-term memory, whereas the second component (reasoning) included all of the tasks in which information was transformed in mind according to logical rules. Correlation analyses between the task to functional brain network loadings and the task to behavioral component loadings confirmed that the two approaches generated broadly similar solutions (STM-MDwm r = 0.79, p < 0.001; reasoning-MDr r = 0.64, p < 0.05). The third behavioral component was readily interpretable and easily comprehensible, accounting for a substantial proportion of the variance in the three tasks that used verbal stimuli (Table 2), these being digit span, verbal reasoning, and color-word remapping. A relevant question regards why there was no third network in the analysis of the MD cortex activation data. One possibility was that a spatial equivalent of the verbal component did exist in MD cortex but that it accounted for less variance than was contributed by any one task in the imaging analysis. Extracting three-component PCA and ICA solutions from the imaging data did not generate an equivalent verbal component, a result that is unsurprising, as a defining characteristic of MD cortex is its insensitivity to stimulus category (Duncan and Owen, 2000Duncan J. Owen A.M. Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). A more plausible explanation was that the third behavioral component had a neural basis in category-sensitive brain regions outside of MD cortex. In line with this view, the task-factor loadings from the third behavioral component correlated closely with those from the additional third component extracted from the PCA of all active voxels within the brain (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). In order to identify brain regions that formed a likely analog of the verbal component, the task-component loadings were standardized so that they had unit deviation and zero mean and were used to predict activation unconstrained within the whole brain mass (see Experimental Procedures). Regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral temporal lobes were significantly more active during the performance of tasks that weighed on the verbal component (Figure 2). This set of brain regions had little overlap with MD cortex, an observation that was formalized using t tests on the mean beta weights from within each of the anatomically distinct MD cortex ROIs. This liberal approach demonstrated that none of the MD ROIs were significantly more active for tasks that loaded on the verbal component (p > 0.05, uncorrected and one tailed).Table 2Task-Component Loadings from the PCA of Internet Data with Orthogonal Rotation1 (STM)2 (Reasoning)3 (Verbal)Spatial span0.690.22Visuospatial working memory0.690.21Self-ordered search0.620.160.16Paired associates0.580.25Spatial planning0.410.45Spatial rotation0.140.66Feature match0.150.570.22Interlocking polygons0.540.3Deductive reasoning0.190.52−0.14Digit span0.26−0.20.71Verbal reasoning0.330.66Color-word remapping0.220.350.51 Open table in a new tab Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to infer that the behavioral factors that underlie correlations in an individual’s performance on tasks of the type typically considered akin to intelligence have a basis in the functioning of multiple brain networks. This observation allows novel insights to be derived regarding the likely basis of higher-order components. More specifically, in classical intelligence testing, first-order components generated by factor analyzing the correlations between task scores are invariably correlated positively if allowed to rotate into their optimal oblique orientations. A common approach is to undertake a seco"

They identify low-frequency coding variants at both known and newly associated loci with insulin processing and secretion. Insulin secretion has a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, and failure to secrete sufficient insulin is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci contributing to insulin processing and secretion1,2; however, a substantial fraction of the genetic contribution remains undefined. To examine low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.5–5%) and rare (MAF < 0.5%) nonsynonymous variants, we analyzed exome array data in 8,229 nondiabetic Finnish males using the Illumina HumanExome Beadchip. We identified low-frequency coding variants associated with fasting proinsulin concentrations at the SGSM2 and MADD GWAS loci and three new genes with low-frequency variants associated with fasting proinsulin or insulinogenic index: TBC1D30, KANK1 and PAM. We also show that the interpretation of single-variant and gene-based tests needs to consider the effects of noncoding SNPs both nearby and megabases away. This study demonstrates that exome array genotyping is a valuable approach to identify low-frequency variants that contribute to complex traits."

Thus, the cortex has the fundamental capacity to modulate the nature of its own input. In contrast to other sensory modalities, the olfactory system is unusual in that sensory information is initially processed in the olfactory bulb (OB) and conveyed directly (without a thalamic relay) to the olfactory cortex. Like the corticothalamic pathway, anatomical studies show that the axons of olfactory cortex pyramidal cells send abundant, long-range “centrifugal” projections back to the OB (de Olmos et al., 1978de Olmos J.

However, functional properties of cortical feedback projections such as their neuronal targets, effects on local circuits, and impact on OB odor processing in vivo are poorly understood. In the OB, principal mitral and tufted (M/T) cells belonging to unique glomeruli are activated by particular molecular features of individual odorants (Rubin and Katz, 1999Rubin B.D. Katz L.C.

Indeed, odors can elicit purely inhibitory M/T cell responses reflecting a major role for circuits mediating lateral inhibition in the OB (Cang and Isaacson, 2003Cang J. Isaacson J.S.

Reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses between M/T cell lateral dendrites and the distal dendritic spines of GABAergic granule cells (GCs) are the major source of recurrent and lateral inhibition of M/T cells and dendrodendritic inhibition triggered by M/T cell glutamate release is strongly dependent on the activation of GC NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (Chen et al., 2000Chen W.R.

Sensory information from the OB is relayed via M/T cell axons within the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) directly to pyramidal cells in piriform cortex (PCx), a three-layered cortical region where bulbar inputs are integrated to form odor percepts (Haberly, 2001Haberly L.B. Parallel-distributed processing in olfactory cortex: new insights from morphological and physiological analysis of neuronal circuitry.Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 551-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Axon collaterals of PCx pyramidal cells provide excitatory projections back to the OB that are densest in the GC layer (Shipley and Adamek, 1984Shipley M.T. Adamek G.D.

Bull. 1984; 12: 669-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), suggesting that M/T cell inhibition is regulated by a long-range cortical feedback loop (Nakashima et al., 1978Nakashima M. Mori K. Takagi S.F. Centrifugal influence on olfactory bulb activity in the rabbit.Brain Res. 1978; 154: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In bulb-cortex slices, extracellular stimulation of PCx produced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in GCs and cortical input that drives GC action potentials (APs) is proposed to enhance M/T cell dendrodendritic self- and lateral inhibition (Balu et al., 2007Balu R.

Gamma-frequency excitatory input to granule cells facilitates dendrodendritic inhibition in the rat olfactory Bulb.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This bulbo-cortical loop is also thought to contribute to oscillatory dynamics in the OB and cortex (Neville and Haberly, 2003Neville K.R. Haberly L.B. Beta and gamma oscillations in the olfactory system of the urethane-anesthetized rat.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and proximal (presumptive cortical) inputs on GCs express long-term potentiation (LTP), suggesting they may play a role in olfactory learning (Gao and Strowbridge, 2009Gao Y.

Adult neurogenesis promotes synaptic plasticity in the olfactory bulb.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recordings in awake, behaving rodents show that M/T cell activity can be modulated by contextual information suggesting that higher cortical regions can influence odor processing in the OB (Kay and Laurent, 1999Kay L.M. Laurent G. Odor- and context-dependent modulation of mitral cell activity in behaving rats.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of cortical feedback in the regulation of OB circuits, the functional properties of these long-range projections are unclear. In large part, this reflects the challenge of selectively manipulating this feedback pathway using conventional extracellular electrical stimulation since cortical fibers are intermingled with the axons and dendrites of bulbar neurons. In this study, we express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in olfactory cortex pyramidal cells and examine the impact of cortical feedback on circuits in OB slices and its actions on odor-evoked activity in vivo. We took advantage of a transgenic mouse line (Ntsr1-creGN209 from the GENSAT project) that expresses Cre recombinase in olfactory cortex pyramidal cells, but not in pyramidal cells of other cortical regions or in inhibitory interneurons (Experimental Procedures) (Stokes and Isaacson, 2010Stokes C.C.

We injected the anterior PCx of neonatal mice with an adeno-associated virus (AAV-double floxed-ChR2-mCherry) to drive Cre-dependent coexpression of the light-activated channel ChR2 (Atasoy et al., 2008Atasoy D. Aponte Y. Su H.H. Sternson S.M. A FLEX switch targets Channelrhodopsin-2 to multiple cell types for imaging and long-range circuit mapping.J.

We chose this conditional strategy since injections of unconditional AAV-ChR2 could reach the lateral ventricle, leading to ChR2 expression in OB interneurons of wild-type mice (not shown). With this conditional approach, unilateral injections labeled layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in PCx and fibers that projected rostrally (Figures 1A1 and 1A2). Consistent with anatomical studies of the axonal projections of PCx pyramidal cells (Matsutani, 2010Matsutani S.

Bull. 1984; 12: 669-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), expression of ChR2-mCherry was present in the ipsi- but not contralateral OB with the densest labeling in the GC layer and lesser expression in the glomerular layer (Figures 1A3 and 1A4). Two-photon imaging of the GC layer confirmed that ChR2 was present only in fibers and axonal varicosities (Figure 1B) rather than cell bodies of OB neurons. Consistent with tracing studies of the axonal trajectories of PCx pyramidal cells (Matsutani, 2010Matsutani S. Trajectory and terminal distribution of single centrifugal axons from olfactory cortical areas in the rat olfactory bulb.Neuroscience. 2010; 169: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we observed only scattered expression of ChR2-expressing fibers in the EPL, yet fibers and varicosities were found to surround but not extend into glomeruli (Figure 1C). Pyramidal cells of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON, the most rostral region of olfactory cortex) project to both ipsi- and contralateral OBs, however, only rarely (5/39 injections) did we observe labeled fibers in the anterior pole of the anterior commissure or contralateral OB. Together, these results indicate that we can exclusively express ChR2 in long-range axonal projections within the OB that predominantly arise from PCx. We first examined the influence of cortical feedback projections on mitral cells by activating ChR2-expressing cortical fibers in OB slices using brief (1–4 ms) flashes of blue light. In mitral cells voltage-clamped at the reversal potential for EPSCs (Vm = 0 mV), light flashes elicited inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (Figure 2A) that were abolished by the GABAA antagonist gabazine (10 μM, n = 5; Figure 2A2). Light-evoked mitral cell IPSCs were unaffected by application of the NMDAR antagonist APV alone (100 μM, 97 ± 9% of control, n = 4) but completely blocked in the presence of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist NBQX (20 μM, 1.2 ± 0.7% of control, n = 11; Figure 2A3). Thus, activation of cortical fibers elicits indirect inhibition of mitral cells that is mediated by AMPAR-driven excitation. We next recorded from mitral cells in current clamp to determine the effects of cortical inputs on cell excitability. We depolarized cells (Vm = −51.3 ± 2.6 mV, n = 9) so that they were suprathreshold for firing APs and interleaved control trials with those containing a train of light flashes (five pulses, 20 Hz; Figure 2B1). The desensitization properties of ChR2 precluded using higher stimulus frequencies (Petreanu et al., 2009Petreanu L. Mao T. Sternson S.M. Svoboda K. The subcellular organization of neocortical excitatory connections.Nature. 2009; 457: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Individual light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs, first flash −5.0 ± 0.8 mV, last flash −4.9 ± 0.6 mV) transiently suppressed AP firing while the decay of the IPSP led to rebound firing (78 ± 48% increase in APs relative to control trials, 15 ms time window). These effects are consistent with previous studies showing that brief membrane hyperpolarization generates rebound APs in mitral cells (Balu and Strowbridge, 2007Balu R. Strowbridge B.W. Opposing inward and outward conductances regulate rebound discharges in olfactory mitral cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Desmaisons et al., 1999Desmaisons D. Vincent J.D. Lledo P.M. Control of action potential timing by intrinsic subthreshold oscillations in olfactory bulb output neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10727-10737PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the firing rate with and without activation of cortical fibers over the time period coinciding with the onset of the train of flashes to 50 ms after the last flash. Although the firing rate of most cells (7/9) was reduced by activation of cortical fibers (Figure 2B2), other cells (2/9) showed no change or an increase in firing rate due to rebound spikes triggered by IPSPs. We did not detect evidence for conventional fast excitatory synaptic responses elicited by photoactivation of cortical fibers in mitral cells, however, we observed small inward currents (average amplitude 15.1 ± 3 pA, Vm = −80 mV, n = 19) that preceded the onset of IPSCs (by 3.6 ± 0.6 ms, n = 6) and persisted in the presence of GABAA blockers (gabazine, 10 μM or picrotoxin, 100 μM). These evoked currents were blocked by NBQX (12.9 ± 4.5% of control, n = 5) but had unusual properties including slow kinetics (10%–90% rise time 6.7 ± 0.9 ms, decay τ 36.3 ± 1.1 ms, n = 19), virtually no trial-to-trial amplitude variability (coefficient of variation 0.05 ± 0.01, n = 19), and little sensitivity to membrane potential (7.5 ± 2.7% reduction in amplitude from −80 mV to −40 mV, n = 7) (Figure S1 available online). These responses were also observed in cells in which the primary apical dendrite was severed (n = 3). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that these small responses reflect synaptic contacts that only occur onto electrotonically remote regions of lateral dendrites or axons, they could also reflect glutamate spillover from cortical fibers onto distal processes, intracellular detection of local field potentials, or gap junctional coupling with cells receiving direct synaptic input. Regardless of their exact origin, these small currents did not have an obvious effect on mitral cell excitability since they caused only weak membrane depolarization (0.3 ± 0.1 mV at rest, n = 9) and never elicited APs. Granule cells are thought to be the major target of direct excitation from cortical feedback projections (Strowbridge, 2009Strowbridge B.W. Role of cortical feedback in regulating inhibitory microcircuits.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1170: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, brief light flashes evoked EPSCs in GCs (Figure 3A1) with fast kinetics (10%–90% rise time: 0.76 ± 0.06 ms, decay τ: 1.49 ± 0.08 ms, amplitude range:13 to 587 pA, n = 20) and little jitter in their onset times (SD = 0.23 ± 0.02 ms, n = 20). Light-evoked EPSCs in GCs were abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM, n = 6) but were partially recovered following subsequent application of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 1 mM, n = 5; Figure 3A2). Consistent with previous studies (Petreanu et al., 2009Petreanu L. Mao T. Sternson S.M. Svoboda K. The subcellular organization of neocortical excitatory connections.Nature. 2009; 457: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), the synaptic response elicited in the presence of TTX and 4-AP indicates that we could trigger transmission via direct ChR2-mediated depolarization of boutons, however, the responses we observe under normal conditions reflect AP-mediated transmitter release from cortical fibers. Membrane depolarization (Vm = +40 mV) in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μM) revealed a slow NMDAR component to cortically-driven EPSCs that was abolished by APV (n = 4), while the fast EPSCs were blocked by NBQX (n = 7, Figure 3A3). The current-voltage relationship of the isolated AMPAR response was linear (n = 5; Figure 3A4), indicating that AMPARs at cortical synapses on GCs are Ca2+-impermeable (Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). We think it likely that GCs are a major source of cortically-evoked disynaptic inhibition onto mitral cells. Cell-attached recordings of GCs revealed that cortical input is sufficient to drive GCs to spike threshold (n = 5; Figure 3B1). Furthermore, simultaneous whole-cell recordings indicated that the onset of evoked mitral cell IPSCs followed EPSCs in GCs with a disynaptic latency (3.2 ± 0.4 ms, n = 7; Figure 3B2). We also tested the relative contribution of glomerular layer interneurons to mitral cell inhibition. LED illumination was restricted to a spot (∼150 μm diameter) and we compared the amplitude of IPSCs elicited when the photostimulus was over the GC layer versus when the illumination surrounded the glomerulus containing the dendritic tuft of the recorded mitral cell (filled with fluorescent indicator). Shifting the location of the photostimulus from the GC layer to the glomerular layer largely abolished light-evoked mitral cell IPSCs (Figure 3C; 4.0 ± 1.6% of GC layer response, n = 6), indicating that cortically-evoked mitral cell inhibition arises primarily from the GC layer. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that activation of cortical fibers is sufficient to elicit disynaptic inhibition onto mitral cells that results from AMPAR-mediated excitation of GCs. Intriguingly, activation of cortical feedback projections also elicited feedforward IPSCs in GCs. GABAAR-mediated IPSCs (recorded at the reversal potential for excitation) followed light-evoked EPSCs with a disynaptic delay (3.5 ± 0.5 ms, n = 14; Figures 4A1 and 4A2) and were abolished following application of glutamate receptor antagonists (Figure 4A3). Short-latency feedforward inhibition plays an important role in regulating time windows for excitation (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Indeed, in current clamp recordings (Vm = −60 mV) of cells with a mixed EPSP-IPSP, blocking the disynaptic IPSP greatly prolonged the duration of cortically-evoked EPSPs (½ width = 6.5 ± 1.7 ms versus 58.4 ± 18.7 before and after gabazine, respectively) without effecting peak EPSP amplitude (110.4 ± 7.7% of control, n = 5, Figure 4B). Although the amplitudes of light-evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances were similar across the population of recorded GCs (average excitation [GE] = 1.1 ± 0.3 nS, inhibition [GI] = 1.4 ± 0.3 nS, n = 42), the relative contribution of inhibition to the total conductance (GI/(GE + GI)) varied widely within individual cells (Figure 4C). Anatomical reconstruction of dye-filled GCs did not reveal an obvious correlation between cell morphology and the excitation/inhibition ratio (n = 7, data not shown). Heterogeneity in the relative amount of excitation versus inhibition received by individual GCs suggests that cortical feedback inputs could have diverse effects: activation of the same cortical fibers could cause a net increase in the excitability of some GCs while neighboring GCs are suppressed. We tested this idea by giving nearby (within 100 μm) GCs depolarizing current steps sufficient to elicit APs and interleaving trials with and without trains of light flashes. Indeed, we found that cortical fiber activation in the same region could either enhance or suppress AP firing in GCs (Figure 4D1). Although the majority of cells receiving light-evoked input responded with net excitation (7/12 cells, three slices), net inhibition was also observed (4/12 cells; Figure 4D2). Together, these results indicate that in addition to direct excitation, cortical projections drive feedforward inhibition of GCs and that the net effect of cortical input on individual GCs can vary between excitation and inhibition. What circuit underlies cortically-evoked feedforward inhibition of GCs? Deep short axon cells (dSACs) in the GC layer are a heterogeneous class of GABAergic interneurons that mediate interneuron-selective inhibition: EM analysis indicates that dSAC terminals target GC dendrites but do not form synaptic contacts onto M/T cells (Eyre et al., 2008Eyre M.D. Antal M. Nusser Z. Distinct deep short-axon cell subtypes of the main olfactory bulb provide novel intrabulbar and extrabulbar GABAergic connections.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8217-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and paired-recordings have shown that dSACs generate IPSCs onto GCs (Eyre et al., 2008Eyre M.D. Antal M. Nusser Z.

Blanes cells mediate persistent feedforward inhibition onto granule cells in the olfactory bulb.Neuron. 2006; 49: 889-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the excitatory inputs governing the activation of dSACs are unclear. We targeted dSACs for recording based on the size of their cell bodies (>10 μm) and their multipolar morphology. Activation of cortical fibers elicited EPSCs with little onset jitter (SD = 0.27 ± 0.04 ms, n = 10; Figure 5A) indicating that, in addition to GCs, dSACs are also a direct target of cortical feedback projections. We next made simultaneous recordings from dSACs synaptically connected to GCs (Figure 3B1; unitary conductance = 0.8 ± 0.4 nS, n = 6) to probe the contribution of dSACs to cortically-evoked inhibition of GCs. Brief light flashes drove APs in dSACs that coincided with GC IPSCs. Interestingly, on interleaved trials in which the dSAC was hyperpolarized below spike threshold the amplitudes of light-evoked GC IPSCs were strongly attenuated (Figure 3B2). In all paired recordings, cortically-driven GC IPSCs were significantly smaller when the connected dSAC failed to fire APs (Figure 5B3; 71.7 ± 9.7% reduction, n = 6, t test, p = 0.03). This suggests that relatively few dSACs contribute to cortically-evoked IPSCs in an individual GC. Furthermore, these results provide strong evidence that dSACs are a major source of the cortically-driven disynaptic inhibition of GCs. We next considered whether cortical feedback projections preferentially target GCs or dSACs. To address this, we used simultaneous or sequential recordings from dSACs and GCs (within 300 μm) to compare the projections onto these two cell types. Surprisingly, dSACs consistently received stronger excitation than GCs (Figures 5C and 5D). In all paired (12/12) or sequential (5/5) recordings, evoked EPSCs were larger in dSACs than GCs. Similar results were obtained in wild-type mice injected in PCx with an unconditional AAV-ChR2 construct, ruling out the possibility that these differences are unique to projections from Ntsr1-cre pyramidal cells (Figure 5D). On average, the EPSC in dSACs (306 ± 81 pA, n = 17) was ∼10 times larger than in GCs (28 ± 9 pA, n = 17). This difference in EPSC amplitude could be due either to stronger unitary connections between cortical fibers and dSACs or a higher convergence of cortical pyramidal cell axons onto dSACs. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we determined the strength of single fiber connections onto both cell types using minimal optical stimulation. In these experiments, we reduced light intensity to the point at which clear failures of synaptic responses were observed on ≥50% of trials (Figure 5E1) and we measured the average amplitudes of successes in each cell. The average amplitude of the single-fiber EPSC was actually somewhat larger for inputs onto GCs compared to dSACs (29.8 ± 4.6 pA and 17.0 ± 3.8 pA for GCs (n = 17) and dSACs (n = 10), respectively; K-S test, p = 0.04; Figure 5E2). Together, these data suggest that dSACs receive stronger excitation than GCs due to a higher convergence of feedback inputs. In addition to their targets in the GC layer, the presence of cortical fibers in the glomerular layer suggests that additional classes of bulbar neurons receive cortical input. Therefore, we next explored how cortical feedback projections influence circuits in the glomerular layer by studying responses of three major classes of juxtaglomerular cells: principal external tufted (ET) cells, GABAergic superficial short axon cells (sSACs), and GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells. ET cells lack lateral dendrites and receive excitation from olfactory sensory neurons as well as PG cell-mediated dendrodendritic inhibition on their apical dendritic tufts (Gire and Schoppa, 2009Gire D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2025969629,"Social decisions are crucial for the success of individuals and the groups that they comprise. Group members respond vicariously to benefits obtained by others, and impairments in this capacity contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and sociopathy. We examined the manner in which neurons in three frontal cortical areas encoded the outcomes of social decisions as monkeys performed a reward-allocation task. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) predominantly encoded rewards that were delivered to oneself. Neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) encoded reward allocations to the other monkey, to oneself or to both. Neurons in the anterior cingulate sulcus (ACCs) signaled reward allocations to the other monkey or to no one. In this network of received (OFC) and foregone (ACCs) reward signaling, ACCg emerged as an important nexus for the computation of shared experience and social reward. Individual and species-specific variations in social decision-making might result from the relative activation and influence of these areas."

Moreover, while microstimulation is a valuable tool for causally probing neural function, it is unclear whether artificially elicited movements are a valid model of real behavior. In this study, we sought to address whether long-duration intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) would evoke naturalistic movements of the hand by recruiting muscles in a synergistic fashion. We electrically microstimulated sites throughout the motor cortex of two rhesus macaques, “G1” and “G2” (Figure 1A). The animals were awake during ICMS and were either moving their arms or at rest in different postures. We considered 46 locations (G1: 33, G2: 13), mostly in primary motor cortex (MI: 32 sites), plus others in premotor cortex, both dorsal (PMd: 9) and ventral (PMv: 5). We stimulated each site with biphasic pulses (2 × 0.2 ms) at suprathreshold currents (8–100 μA) and an intermediate frequency (200 Hz) over multiple (≥7), relatively long trains (150–500 ms). We recorded electromyograms (EMGs) from electrodes chronically implanted in forelimb muscles and (with G2) joint kinematics from a custom flex sensor glove. We first investigated whether ICMS would move the hand toward specific final postures, as previously seen for limb movements. In all analyses, we focused on effects observed between 25 and 150 ms from the onset of stimulation, a duration in which we expected EMG responses to be relatively unaffected by voluntary reactions to ICMS (Nelson et al., 1990Nelson R.J. McCandlish C.A. Douglas V.D. Reaction times for hand movements made in response to visual versus vibratory cues.Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1990; 7: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The kinematic data from monkey G2 illustrate the pattern of movements noted for both animals. At each of G2’s 13 stimulation sites, we applied ICMS trains with the hand at rest at different starting postures. Pre-ICMS joint positions varied over 19° ± 11° (mean ± SD, range 4°–50° over sites and trains). The trains elicited 20° ± 18° (range 4°–55°) of (2-norm) movement over the joints. Regardless of the initial hand posture, ICMS at most sites evoked convergent motions of one or more joints. At the site shown in Figure 1B, for instance, ICMS drove the thumb toward a posture defined by relative opposition (joint o1) and intermediate abduction (a1). The dispersion of hand postures around their mean was reduced over the 150 ms of ICMS, by a significant degree in both joint dimensions shown (p < 0.05). Over the 13 stimulation sites in G2, such convergence was observed among 3.2 ± 2.9 of the 8–9 joints measured per site (range 0–9). We next examined the patterns of muscle activity underlying such movements. We considered only the first seven ICMS trials (the minimal number available) per stimulation site. As illustrated in Figure 2A, the evoked EMG varied little from one stimulation train to the next. We defined ICMS-evoked EMG vectors by integrating the data of each of the electrodes (G1: 15, G2: 19) between 25 and 150 ms into each ICMS train (i.e., the vertical black-to-gray columns of EMG in Figure 2A). Comparing all pairs of vectors at a given site yielded pairwise dot products that averaged 0.95 ± 0.04 across sites for G1 (range 0.86–0.99) and 0.97 ± 0.02 for G2 (0.94–0.99). While the vectors were stable over stimulation trains, they nevertheless differed between sites. Average EMG vectors for each of G2’s ICMS locations are shown in Figure 2B. Each site yielded a unique balance of activation across a number of muscles spanning multiple joints. The foregoing analysis suggested that each ICMS site was defined by both a unique convergent posture and a unique balance of activity across muscles. But did these microstimulation-driven EMGs bear any resemblance to muscle activity observed in natural behavior? We inspected muscle data collected from the same animals while they performed a behavioral task prior to each of the ICMS sessions. The task required reach, grasp, and transport of 25 cylinders, cubes, and spheres between two wells (Figure 3A). We computed the average EMG activity across 40 trials performed with each of the 50 object shape, size, and position combinations. This EMG activity averaged 30μV ± 23μV for G1 (range 5μV–50μV over muscles) and 44μV ± 46μV for G2 (4μV–153μV), exceeding but overlapping with the activity evoked by ICMS: 10μV ± 10μV for G1 (2μV–28μV) and 16μV± 21μV for G2 (1μV–50μV). We found that the EMG data could be compactly represented by combinations of a small number of synchronous synergies, each a vector capturing a pattern of invariant coactivation across muscles. We used nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) to extract as many of these “grasp-related” synergies as needed to capture at least 95% of the variance in the EMG data (10 for G1, 8 for G2; Figure 3B). To directly compare the grasp-related and ICMS-evoked EMG patterns, we likewise reduced the latter data into a smaller set of synergistic bases using NNMF. As we had observed for the grasp-related muscle data, the ICMS-evoked EMG vectors could be decomposed into a small number of “ICMS-derived” synergies (7 for G1, 6 for G2) with ≥95% of the EMG variability accounted for (Figure 3C). But more striking than the comparable dimensionality of the grasp-related and ICMS-evoked EMG data was the correspondence of the extracted dimensions themselves. We used a greedy search procedure to iteratively find the best-matching pairs of grasp-related and ICMS-derived synergies (Figure 3D). For G1 and G2, 6/7 and 6/6 of the ICMS-derived synergies could be matched with a corresponding grasp-related synergy. (Monkey G1’s seventh ICMS-derived synergy is shown with the remaining, insignificantly matched grasp-related synergy.) The pairings yielded dot products averaging 0.86 ± 0.05 (range 0.81–0.93) for G1 and 0.83 ± 0.05 (0.75–0.92) for G2 and were each significant (p < 0.05) with reference to bootstrap populations of EMG-shuffled synergies. Finally, we examined whether these ICMS-derived synergies were represented in any organized fashion on the cortical surface. The topographical data in Figure 4 suggest that this may have been the case. The sites evoking a synergy tended to cluster nonuniformly, at least in MI where most were located. For each site and ICMS-derived synergy, we calculated the mean synergy scaling coefficient necessary to reconstruct the evoked EMG activity over seven ICMS trains. We deemed to be significantly nonuniform any topographical map containing a mean coefficient exceeding a 95th percentile chance threshold, based on a population of coefficients drawn randomly from a uniform distribution. For monkey G1 and G2, 6/7 and 6/6 of the ICMS-derived synergies were associated with a significantly nonuniform representation peaking in MI. There are at least three aspects of these results that are surprising. First, we found systematic evidence that ICMS can drive the hand, including digits, toward particular postures (Figure 1B). ICMS-evoked hand postures including precision and power grips have previously been observed (Graziano et al., 2002Graziano M.S.A. Taylor C.S.R. Moore T.

Conner J.M. Tuszynski M.H. A form of motor cortical plasticity that correlates with recovery of function after brain injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11370-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) but not studied in detail. That ICMS could evoke convergent movements of the hand, as had earlier been reported for more proximal limb and axial movements, is nonobvious. In primates, much of motor cortex is specialized for controlling the forelimb, especially the hand (Lemon, 1993Lemon R.N. The G. L. Brown Prize Lecture. Cortical control of the primate hand.Exp. Physiol. 1993; 78: 263-301PubMed Google Scholar). This control is facilitated by direct corticomotoneuronal projections to the spinal cord (Fetz and Cheney, 1978Fetz E.E. Cheney P.D. Muscle fields of primate corticomotoneuronal cells.J. Physiol. (Paris). 1978; 74: 239-245PubMed Google Scholar) that may enable muscular coordination unconstrained by evolutionarily primitive synergies encoded downstream of cortex (Rathelot and Strick, 2009Rathelot J.A. Strick P.L. Subdivisions of primary motor cortex based on cortico-motoneuronal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 918-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The stimulation sites in our study were primarily located in superficial motor cortex, rather than the rostral bank of the central sulcus from which most corticomotoneuronal projections originate. The convergent hand movements we observed may thus reflect motor primitives unobscured by these pathways. Second, the muscle activations underlying these convergent movements had much in common with those seen in natural behaviors (Figure 3), however “unnatural” the neural activity induced by ICMS (Strick, 2002Strick P.L. Stimulating research on motor cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It could have been the case that convergent postures are a trivial biomechanical result of imposing artificial patterns of tonic muscle contraction. Instead, we found that the evoked EMG patterns resembled muscle coactivations seen in temporally complex behaviors like reach and grasp. Our findings extend existing behavioral evidence that microstimulation-evoked force-field primitives (Giszter et al., 1993Giszter S.F. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Bizzi E. Convergent force fields organized in the frog’s spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 467-491PubMed Google Scholar), bell-shaped speed profiles (Graziano et al., 2005Graziano M.S.A. Aflalo T.N. Cooke D.F. Arm movements evoked by electrical stimulation in the motor cortex of monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4209-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), postural synergies (Gentner and Classen, 2006Gentner R. Classen J. Modular organization of finger movements by the human central nervous system.Neuron. 2006; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and invariant endpoints (Graziano et al., 2004aGraziano M.S.A. Cooke D.F. Taylor C.S.R. Moore T. Distribution of hand location in monkeys during spontaneous behavior.Exp. Brain Res. 2004; 155: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) all tend to coincide with movements and postures found in spontaneous behavior. Consistent with the role of evoked motor primitives in simplifying motor control, other investigators have noted that when microstimulation is applied at multiple points in the spinal cord (Tresch and Bizzi, 1999Tresch M.C. Bizzi E. Responses to spinal microstimulation in the chronically spinalized rat and their relationship to spinal systems activated by low threshold cutaneous stimulation.Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 129: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or motor cortex (Ethier et al., 2006Ethier C. Brizzi L. Darling W.G. Capaday C. Linear summation of cat motor cortex outputs.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the final posture, convergent forces, and EMG activity all tend to sum linearly across sites. Precisely how long-train ICMS-evoked EMG yields invariant final postures remains to be explored, as does the extent to which this EMG changes with initial posture—variously found to be little (Loeb et al., 1993Loeb E.P. Giszter S.F. Borghesani P. Bizzi E. Effects of dorsal root cut on the forces evoked by spinal microstimulation in the spinalized frog.Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1993; 10: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Griffin et al., 2011Griffin D.M. Hudson H.M. Belhaj-Saïf A. Cheney P.D. Hijacking cortical motor output with repetitive microstimulation.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13088-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), modest (Mussa-Ivaldi et al., 1990Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Giszter S.F. Bizzi E. Motor-space coding in the central nervous system.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or considerable (Graziano et al., 2004bGraziano M.S.A. Patel K.T. Taylor C.S.R. Mapping from motor cortex to biceps and triceps altered by elbow angle.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Third, we were surprised to find a nonuniform representation of most ICMS-derived synergies (Figure 4), given long-standing disagreements about whether motor cortex is organized topographically or is even divisible into functionally distinct areas—and about what motor cortex represents in the first place (Schieber, 2001Schieber M.H. Constraints on somatotopic organization in the primary motor cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2125-2143PubMed Google Scholar; Graziano and Aflalo, 2007Graziano M.S.A. Aflalo T.N. Mapping behavioral repertoire onto the cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, we had little reason to expect that motor cortex would encode muscle synergies, despite observing that ICMS-evoked EMG patterns could be resolved into such primitives (Figure 3). Instead, synergies may be encoded, if anywhere, downstream of motor cortex, in the brainstem (Roh et al., 2011Roh J. Cheung V.C. Bizzi E. Modules in the brain stem and spinal cord underlying motor behaviors.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1363-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or spinal cord (Tresch et al., 1999Tresch M.C. Saltiel P. Bizzi E. The construction of movement by the spinal cord.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar; Saltiel et al., 2001Saltiel P. Wyler-Duda K. D’Avella A. Tresch M.C. Bizzi E. Muscle synergies encoded within the spinal cord: evidence from focal intraspinal NMDA iontophoresis in the frog.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 605-619PubMed Google Scholar; Hart and Giszter, 2010Hart C.B. Giszter S.F. A neural basis for motor primitives in the spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1322-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The spinal cord may organize even distal forelimb synergies, as it contains premotor interneurons facilitating multiple muscles including ones intrinsic to the hand (Takei and Seki, 2010Takei T. Seki K. Spinal interneurons facilitate coactivation of hand muscles during a precision grip task in monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 17041-17050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nor is cortex needed for convergent-movement primitives, as these can be evoked by long-train microstimulation in—or even downstream of—the spinal cord (Giszter et al., 1993Giszter S.F. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Bizzi E. Convergent force fields organized in the frog’s spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 467-491PubMed Google Scholar; Aoyagi et al., 2004Aoyagi Y. Stein R.B. Mushahwar V.K. Prochazka A. The role of neuromuscular properties in determining the end-point of a movement.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng. 2004; 12: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The activations we evoked may thus be the result of filtering projections from motor cortex through neuromuscular webs that bind muscles together. Rather than encoding synergies directly, the primate’s cortical specialization for forelimb behaviors may reflect its capacity to combine lower-level synergies into adaptive motor sequences (Overduin et al., 2008Overduin S.A. d’Avella A. Roh J. Bizzi E. Modulation of muscle synergy recruitment in primate grasping.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Data were collected from two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): “G1” (5.9 kg, 8 years old) and “G2” (6.5 kg, 4 years old, male). All procedures were approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care. Muscle implantation surgeries are described in detail elsewhere (Overduin et al., 2008Overduin S.A. d’Avella A. Roh J. Bizzi E. Modulation of muscle synergy recruitment in primate grasping.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cranial surgeries were performed under sterile conditions and general anesthesia (0.05 mg/kg atropine and 10 mg/kg ketamine injected intramuscularly, followed in G1 by 5 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital intravenously and in G2 by inhalation of 1%–2% isoflurane with 2 l O2). Craniotomies (20–28 mm wide) and stainless steel wells were centered over motor cortex in the right hemisphere. The animals were given analgesics and systemic antibiotics after surgeries. Areas MI, PMd, and PMv were identified by MRI data and by sensorimotor mapping using both peripheral sensory and intracortical electrical stimulation (Figure 1A). The sensorimotor mapping took place both during initial mapping studies and during the subsequent experimental sessions. This mapping used tungsten microelectrodes, each having a 50 μm shaft diameter tapered to a 3-μm-wide tip and 0.3–3 MΩ impedance (FHC). In each session, up to ten such electrodes were introduced perpendicularly into the brain using manual microdrives (30 μm depth resolution, spaced ≥1 mm apart). Once the electrodes had been lowered into cortex, the somatosensory response fields of cortical units near the electrodes were estimated by alternatively moving the monkeys’ limbs and passively stimulating the skin. At the end of the sessions, the same electrodes were used to apply relatively short-train, high-frequency ICMS for mapping purposes. This form of ICMS (and not the longer-train, lower-frequency ICMS whose effects are the focus of this study) consisted of 2 × 0.2 ms cathodal-leading biphasic pulses of 1–150 μA current, presented in 50 ms trains at a 330 Hz pulse frequency. The pulses were created by staggering two pulse trains (Grass Technologies) and inverting the polarity of one train (BAK Electronics). Monkeys G1 and G2 participated in 19 and 9 experimental sessions spanning 50 and 15 days, respectively. During each session, subjects performed a learned behavior in which they had to press a start button and then reach for, grasp, and transport one of 25 objects of various sizes and shapes (Figure 3A) between two wells on either side of their midline. A separate analysis of a portion of these grasping-related data has previously been reported (Overduin et al., 2008Overduin S.A. d’Avella A. Roh J. Bizzi E. Modulation of muscle synergy recruitment in primate grasping.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The data used here comprise 2,000 successful trials from each animal, including 40 trials in each of the 50 = 5 × 5 × 2 (object shape × size × position) conditions. At the end of the experimental sessions, the cortex was stimulated using relatively long trains of intermediate-frequency pulses, as compared to the ICMS used for sensorimotor mapping and described above. This ICMS consisted of 2 × 0.2 ms cathodal-leading biphasic pulses presented in 150 to 500 ms trains at a 200 Hz pulse frequency. Regardless of the train length, the analysis here focuses on data collected between 25 and 150 ms into each ICMS train or “trial.” Currents were fixed at 100 μA, except for the first 9 of G1’s 33 sites, for which they were set between 8–80 μA. Currents were at or above the 28 ± 24 μA (3–100 μA) thresholds at which movement could be reliably evoked by short-train, high-frequency ICMS (used for cortical mapping) when applied in rising increments of 10:10:100 μA (G1) or 25:25:100 μA (G2), for all but 3 (G1) and 6 (G2) sites at which thresholds were unspecified (i.e., >100 μA). For G1, trains were delivered periodically (once every 1 s) while the animal was either at rest or engaged in a food retrieval task (wherein dried fruit morsels were placed in the task wells instead of objects and were transported by the animal to its mouth rather than the opposing well). For G2, trains were delivered every few seconds at times chosen by the experimenter while the monkey’s forelimb was at rest after being positioned and released at different postures. For both animals, analysis was restricted to locations at which ≤100 μA long-train ICMS could reliably evoke movement on a majority of trials. As G1’s ICMS was sometimes delivered while it was moving, those trains preceded by relatively large-amplitude movements were excluded to better equate its remaining trials with those of G2. For each EMG channel and stimulation site, muscle activity in the [–250:0] ms period just prior to ICMS was compared to a threshold (the root-mean-square EMG level over a [–250:+750] ms window around each ICMS train onset, concatenated over trains). These threshold values averaged 22μV ± 18μV (range 8μV–48μV over channels). G1’s remaining 23 ± 15 ICMS trials per site (range 7–63), as well as G2’s 13 ± 3 trials (9–17), were deemed to have had insignificant forelimb movement immediately prior to ICMS. Subsequent analysis of EMG data was limited to those locations at which at least seven ICMS trials were available and to the first seven trials at each such site. These sites included 33 from G1 (MI: 21, PMd: 8, PMv: 4) and 13 from G2 (MI: 11, PMd: 1, PMv: 1). Joint movements were recorded from monkey G2 using a custom flex sensor glove (and preprocessed as in Overduin et al., 2010Overduin S.A. Zaheer F. Bizzi E. d’Avella A. An instrumented glove for small primates.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 187: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Nine sensors embedded in the glove sampled extension/flexion and ulnar/radial deviation (i.e., adduction/abduction) of the wrist (sensors eW and dW); carpometacarpal opposition/reposition of digit 5 (o5); flexion/extension at the metacarpophalangeal joints of digits 5, 3, 2, and 1 (f5, f3, f2, and f1); and trapeziometacarpal abduction/adduction and opposition/reposition of digit 1 (a1 and o1). (The f3 channel was not available during stimulation at 3 of the 13 sites.) EMG data were recorded through 15 (G1) or 19 (G2) electrodes chronically implanted in left forelimb muscles. Proximal muscles acting on the shoulder and elbow included Del (deltoideus), Pec (pectoralis major), TriU and TriR (triceps brachii, ulnar and radial short heads), Bic (biceps brachii longus), and BR (brachioradialis). Wrist and extrinsic hand extensors included AbPL (abductor pollicis longus) and extensors ECRB (carpi radialis brevis), EDC (digitorum communis), ED23 (digiti secundi and tertii proprius), ED45 (digiti quarti and quinti proprius), and ECU (carpi ulnaris). Wrist and extrinsic hand flexors included FCR (carpi radialis), FDS (digitorum superficialis), FDPU and FDPR (digitorum profundus, ulnar and radial), and FCU (carpi ulnaris). Intrinsic hand muscles included AbPB (abductor pollicis brevis), AdP (adductor pollicis), OpP (opponens pollicis), F5B (flexor digiti quinti brevis manus), and Op5 (opponens digiti quinti manus). Both grasping-related and ICMS-evoked EMG data were band-pass filtered, notch filtered, amplified, and digitized by hardware, as described elsewhere (Overduin et al., 2008Overduin S.A. d’Avella A. Roh J. Bizzi E. Modulation of muscle synergy recruitment in primate grasping.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and then further band-pass filtered and full-wave rectified. Grasp-related EMG data were integrated within 9 ms (G1) or 11 ms (G2) bins, depending on the relative speed of the animal’s movements. ICMS-evoked EMG data were instead integrated between 25 and 150 ms from the onset of each ICMS train. For grasp-related data, trials were time-aligned on the moment of object removal from the first well, truncated to windows of 100 samples spanning [–350:+550] ms (G1) or [–500:+600] ms (G2) around this moment, and averaged over the 40 trials in each of the 50 object conditions. Each channel was normalized to its maximum integrated EMG level observed over these averaged trials. The same normalization factors were applied to the ICMS-evoked data. These software preprocessing steps, as well as the subsequent analyses, were done in MATLAB (MathWorks). Kinematic “convergence” was defined as a reduction in joint distance from a mean posture observed across trials. Using Figure 1B as an example, absolute displacements between the nine black dots (defining hand posture at 25 ms into ICMS, over nine stimulation trials) and their mean were calculated for each joint dimension (e.g., a1). This was then repeated for the nine lightest gray dots defining hand posture at 150 ms into ICMS by taking these points' absolute displacements from their mean. These two sets of numbers were compared using a one-sided t test to see whether the displacement had decreased significantly by 150 ms into ICMS. This comparison was repeated for all combinations of joints to find those stimulation sites with significant convergence in one or more joint dimensions (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for the number of comparisons involving each joint). For illustration purposes, Figure 1B includes an ellipse defining the mean ± SD of all the intersection points between nine straight-line trajectories passing through each pair of black and lightest gray dots. For each subject, NNMF was used to identify a set of synchronous muscle synergies underlying either the grasp-related EMG data, G, or the EMG patterns elicited by ICMS, I. Each of the O = 50 object conditions in G = G(e,s,o) was represented by S = 100 samples of integrated data in each of the E EMG channels, so the dimensionality of G was 15 × 100 × 50 (monkey G1) or 19 × 100 × 50 (G2). The ICMS-evoked data I = I(e,t,l) included the E-channel EMG vectors evoked over the initial T = 7 trains delivered at each of the L ICMS locations (Figure 2), so the dimensionality of I was 15 × 7 × 33 (G1) or 19 × 7 × 13 (G2). The NNMF decompositions (Lee and Seung, 1999Lee D.D. Seung H.S. Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization.Nature. 1999; 401: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9452) Google Scholar; Tresch et al., 1999Tresch M.C. Saltiel P. Bizzi E. The construction of movement by the spinal cord.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) allowed EMG activity to be reconstructed as a combination of the corresponding n = 1,…,Ngrasp or 1,…,Nicms synergy vectors, each expressing a unique coactivation across e = 1,…,E EMG channels. Concatenated over synergies, these vectors could be compactly represented as Vgrasp(e,n) or Vicms(e,n). In these EMG reconstructions, each synergy was weighted by nonnegative coefficients Wgrasp(n,s,o) or Wicms(n,t,l) that could vary both within conditions (i.e., over time samples s or ICMS trains t) and across conditions (i.e., over object conditions o or locations l). In matrix form, these reconstructions could be expressed as:G(e,s,o)=Vgrasp(e,:)·Wgrasp(:,s,o)(1) I(e,t,l)=Vicms(e,:)·Wicms(:,t,l)(2) where the colon operator indicates a vector of data in the matrix indexed by e, s, o, etc. For a given dimensionality Ngrasp or Nicms, the algorithms iteratively updated synergies Vgrasp and Vicms, and associated weights Wgrasp and Wicms, until the total reconstruction error (R2, the fraction of variance accounted for) grew by less than 0.001 over ten iterations. The synergies able to explain the most EMG variation over five repetitions of the algorithm were chosen for further analysis. To facilitate comparisons across animals and data sets, we set each of the dimensionalities Ngrasp and Nicms to the number of synergies able to account for ≥95% of the variability in the corresponding data sets G (Figure 3B) and I (Figure 3C). In comparing synergies for each animal (Figure 3D), a greedy search procedure was used. First, dot products were computed for all Ngrasp × Nicms possible pairs of grasp-related versus ICMS-derived synergies (e.g., 8 × 6 = 48 dot products, in the case of G2). Second, the best-matching grasp-related versus ICMS-derived pair was defined to be the one with the highest dot product. The second-best match was the one with the highest dot product among the remaining (Ngrasp – 1) × (Nicms – 1) synergy pairs (7 × 5 = 35 for G2), and so on. This process continued until there were no more unpaired synergies left in one set (min(8,6) = 6 iterations for G2; Tresch et al., 1999Tresch M.C. Saltiel P. Bizzi E. The construction of movement by the spinal cord.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The significance of each matched pair was determined by Monte Carlo simulation. For each monkey, the greedy search procedure was run 10,000 times, each time after randomly shuffling muscle identity. Then the dot product of the best-matched pair of actual grasp-related and ICMS-derived synergies was compared with the distribution of dot products from the 10,000 best-matched pairs of shuffled synergies—or more precisely, with the 95th percentile of this distribution, as this defined a threshold for significant similarity at p < 0.05. The process was then repeated for the second-best pair of actual synergies versus the 10,000 second-best pairs of shuffled synergies, and so on. These procedures were also used to compare ICMS-derived synergies between G1 and G2, after first restricting the synergies to the 12 channels common to both animals (Figure 3D). Each animal’s cortical topography of ICMS-derived muscle synergies (Figure 4) was tested for nonuniformity as follows. First, the degree to which a given synergy n was represented at a given ICMS location l was taken to be the mean coefficient Wicms(n,t,l) over t = 1,…,7 ICMS trains delivered at the site, i.e., Wicms(n,:,l)¯. (The Wicms(n,:,l)¯ values are indicated in Figure 4 by the width of each circle.) For each ICMS location l, 10,000 vectors each of 33 (G1) or 13 (G2) values were randomly taken from a uniform distribution with the same mean and SD as the observed Wicms(n,:,l)¯. Second, the 95th percentile of the 10,000 maximum values from each vector was selected. Any observed Wicms(n,:,l)¯ values in excess of this threshold were deemed to reflect significant nonuniformity in the cortical representation of synergy n, peaking around cortical location(s) l (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected for the number of synergies and the number of locations).

We report here that protocadherin 10 (Pcdh10), an autism-spectrum disorders gene, is necessary for this process. MEF2 and FMRP cooperatively regulate the expression of Pcdh10. Upon MEF2 activation, PSD-95 is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) and then binds to Pcdh10, which links it to the proteasome for degradation. Blockade of the Pcdh10-proteasome interaction inhibits MEF2-induced PSD-95 degradation and synapse elimination. In FMRP-lacking neurons, elevated protein levels of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α (EF1α), an Mdm2-interacting protein and FMRP target mRNA, sequester Mdm2 and prevent MEF2-induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and synapse elimination.

The cellular mechanisms that underlie activity or experience-dependent synapse elimination in the central nervous system are largely unknown. The discovery that activation of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors suppresses synapse number provides an important molecular link to understand how neuronal activity leads to synapse elimination (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W.

MEF2 is activated upon neuronal depolarization and calcium influx, which induces the expression of MEF2 target genes that are thought to lead to synapse elimination (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W.

The identity of the MEF2 target genes that promote synapse elimination or their mechanisms of action in synapse elimination is unknown. We recently demonstrated that MEF2-induced synapse elimination requires fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), an RNA-binding protein that regulates translation of its target mRNAs (Bassell and Warren, 2008Bassell G.J. Warren S.T. Fragile X syndrome: loss of local mRNA regulation alters synaptic development and function.Neuron. 2008; 60: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). FMRP is encoded by the Fmr1 gene, which is transcriptionally silenced in patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism (Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008Abrahams B.S. Geschwind D.H. Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology.Nat. Rev.

The autistic neuron: troubled translation?.Cell. 2008; 135: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In neurons of the mouse model of FXS, Fmr1 knockout (KO), MEF2-triggered synapse elimination is absent (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the observed excess of dendritic spines on cortical neurons of FXS patients and the Fmr1 KO mouse (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C. Greenough W.T. From mRNP trafficking to spine dysmorphogenesis: the roots of fragile X syndrome.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that underlie the deficiencies in synapse elimination associated with FXS are unknown. Our previous results indicated that FMRP functions downstream of MEF2-induced transcription to eliminate synapses (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Based on the known function of FMRP, we hypothesized that FMRP regulated translation of MEF2-generated transcripts. To identify candidate transcripts involved in synapse elimination, we compared the known MEF2 target genes (Flavell et al., 2008Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Gray J.M. Harmin D.A. Hemberg M. Hong E.J. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Bear D.M. Greenberg M.E. Genome-wide analysis of MEF2 transcriptional program reveals synaptic target genes and neuronal activity-dependent polyadenylation site selection.Neuron. 2008; 60: 1022-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) with FMRP-interacting mRNAs (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Of the many common MEF2- and FMRP-interacting transcripts, we focused on protocadherin 10 (Pcdh10), also known as OL-protocadherin, a member of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules (Morishita and Yagi, 2007Morishita H. Yagi T. Protocadherin family: diversity, structure, and function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Importantly, homologous deletion of Pcdh10 in humans is associated with autism (Morrow et al., 2008Morrow E.M. Yoo S.Y. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Lin Y. Hill R.S. Mukaddes N.M. Balkhy S. Gascon G. Hashmi A. et al.Identifying autism loci and genes by tracing recent shared ancestry.Science. 2008; 321: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Pcdh10 and other family members of the δ2 nonclustered protocadherin family (Pcdh8 and 19) demonstrate weak homophilic binding activity relative to the classical cadherins (Hirano et al., 1999Hirano S. Yan Q. Suzuki S.T. Expression of a novel protocadherin, OL-protocadherin, in a subset of functional systems of the developing mouse brain.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the diverse structure of protocadherins’ cytoplasmic C termini is consistent with the multifunctional roles of protocadherins in cell signaling and function, in addition to cell adhesion (Kim et al., 2011Kim S.Y. Yasuda S. Tanaka H. Yamagata K. Kim H. Non-clustered protocadherin.Cell Adhes. Migr. 2011; 5: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar; Yasuda et al., 2007Yasuda S. Tanaka H. Sugiura H. Okamura K. Sakaguchi T. Tran U. Takemiya T. Mizoguchi A. Yagita Y.

Pcdh10 is primarily expressed in the brain (Hirano et al., 1999Hirano S. Yan Q. Suzuki S.T. Expression of a novel protocadherin, OL-protocadherin, in a subset of functional systems of the developing mouse brain.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is required for the growth of striatal axons and patterning of thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections during embryonic development (Uemura et al., 2007Uemura M. Nakao S. Suzuki S.T. Takeichi M. Hirano S. OL-Protocadherin is essential for growth of striatal axons and thalamocortical projections.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pcdh10 is highly expressed in mature cortical neurons, where nothing is known of its function (Kim et al., 2011Kim S.Y. Yasuda S. Tanaka H. Yamagata K. Kim H. Non-clustered protocadherin.Cell Adhes. Migr. 2011; 5: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Pcdh10 is required for MEF2-induced synapse elimination and functions to deliver ubiquitinated postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a critical synaptic scaffolding molecule to the proteasome. Fmr1 KO neurons have deficits in ubiquitination and degradation of PSD-95, and we uncover the molecular basis of this defect. Our results reveal mechanisms by which the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2 refines synaptic connections in wild-type neurons and identify the mechanisms that underlie abnormal synapse refinement in fragile X syndrome. Importantly, this work demonstrates the necessity and distinct cellular functions of three genes linked to autism in the same synapse elimination process (Pcdh10, Fmr1. and Mef2; Novara et al., 2010Novara F. Beri S. Giorda R. Ortibus E. Nageshappa S. Darra F. Dalla Bernardina B. Zuffardi O. Van Esch H. Refining the phenotype associated with MEF2C haploinsufficiency.Clin. Genet. 2010; 78: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and thus provides evidence for a common synaptic deficit among different genetic causes of autism. To study the role of Pcdh10 in MEF2 and FMRP regulation of synapse number, we first validated the association of FMRP and Pcdh10 mRNA (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). We performed an RNA immunoprecipitation with an anti-FMRP antibody and pulled down Pcdh10 mRNA from hippocampal lysates of wild-type (WT) mice, but not Fmr1 KO mice (Figure 1A), providing evidence for Pcdh10 as an mRNA target of FMRP. We next examined whether Pcdh10 expression is regulated by MEF2 and FMRP, using lentivirus to transfect tamoxifen-inducible, constitutively active MEF2 (MEF2-VP16ERtm) (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar; Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E.

Basal levels of Pcdh10 mRNA and another MEF2 target gene Nurr77 were not different between WT and Fmr1 KO neurons (vehicle; white bars, Figure 1B). After 6 hr of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (tamoxifen, 1 μm) treatment, which induces translocation of MEF2-VP16ERtm to the nucleus to activate target genes (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), both Pcdh10 and Nurr77 mRNAs were elevated in WT and Fmr1 KO neurons (black bars, Figure 1B), indicating that FMRP is not required for MEF2-induced transcription of target genes. Surprisingly, the level of Pcdh10 mRNA induced with MEF2 activation in Fmr1 KO neurons was greater than in WT neurons, perhaps reflecting a role of FMRP in RNA stability (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang M. Wang Q. Huang Y. Fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP and the RNA export factor NXF2 associate with and destabilize Nxf1 mRNA in neuronal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pcdh10 protein is basally higher in Fmr1 KO neurons and is unresponsive to MEF2 activation (Figure 1C). Similar to cultured neurons, Pcdh10 protein is elevated in hippocampal lysates of Fmr1 KO mice (Figures 1D and S1A). One function of FMRP is to suppress translation of its mRNA targets (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J.

To test this possibility, we performed metabolic labeling under basal and MEF2 activated conditions. 35S-Met/Cys was added with vehicle or tamoxifen for 6 hr to MEF2-VP16ERtm-transfected cultures followed by immunoprecipitation of Pcdh10 or Tubulin (normalization control). We observed enhanced newly synthesized Pcdh10 in WT neurons upon tamoxifen treatment (Figure 1E). In Fmr1 KO neurons, basal translation rates of Pcdh10 were elevated and MEF2 activation failed to further increase Pcdh10 synthesis. To determine whether MEF2 regulates the half-life of Pcdh10, we applied a 2 hr pulse of 35S-Met/Cys label to neuronal cultures and chased this with fresh medium containing vehicle or tamoxifen for the time points indicated in Figure 1F. The half-life of Pcdh10 was not affected by genotype or MEF2 activation (Figure 1F). This data indicates that the elevated basal levels of Pcdh10 in Fmr1 KO neurons are due to elevated protein synthesis rates and not reduced turnover.Figure S1Validation of Antibodies and Fmr1 Mosaic Cultures Used in This Study, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Full sample western blots with antibodies against critical proteins (Pcdh10, Mdm2, PSD-95, EF1α and FMRP) examined in this study.(B) Immunohistochemistry of GFP, FMRP and NeuN from dissociated hippocampal neuron culture of GFP/Fmr1 mosaic mice.(C) Immunohistochemistry of Pcdh10 and GFP from two Pcdh10 shRNAs transfected hippocampal neurons.

Quantification of Pcdh10 signal from GFP positive and negative dendrites in a same image (n = 21) is shown on the right. To determine whether dendritic Pcdh10 protein levels are elevated in Fmr1 KO neurons and to assess the cell autonomous role of FMRP in regulation of Pcdh10, we performed immunohistochemistry for Pcdh10 and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a dendritic marker, in dissociated neuron cultures prepared from GFP/Fmr1 mosaic mice (i.e., GFP+ cells are “wild type” and GFP− cells are Fmr1 KO; see Extended Experimental Procedures available online). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that FMRP and GFP are coexpressed in hippocampal and cortical neurons of GFP/Fmr1 mosaic mice (Niere et al., 2012Niere F. Wilkerson J.R. Huber K.M. Evidence for a fragile X mental retardation protein-mediated translational switch in metabotropic glutamate receptor-triggered Arc translation and long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5924-5936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). Pcdh10, but not MAP2, were elevated in both the soma and dendrites of Fmr1 KO neurons (Figure 1G) in comparison to neighboring GFP+, WT neurons. These results support a role for FMRP in translational suppression of Pcdh10, which leads to elevated Pcdh10 in Fmr1 KO neurons. Immunohistochemistry for Pcdh10 in WT cultures revealed that Pcdh10 was present in dendritic spines where PSD-95, the postsynaptic excitatory synapse marker, was also enriched (Figure 1H). To validate the specificity of the antibody used for immunohistochemistry, we performed staining on hippocampal neurons transfected with two independent shRNAs against Pcdh10 (Figure S1C). The results showed similar knockdown efficiency (>50%) by shRNAs as observed with western blot (Figures 3F and S3B), validating the fluorescence signal of Pcdh10 seen in Figure 1H. Therefore, Pcdh10 is present in spines at the site of excitatory synapses and may function in MEF2 regulation of excitatory synapse number. Because the expression of Pcdh10 is regulated by both MEF2 and FMRP, we hypothesized that Pcdh10 is required for MEF2- and FMRP-dependent synapse elimination (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We first determined whether manipulation of Pcdh10 alone was sufficient to affect excitatory synaptic transmission. To do this, we overexpressed mouse Pcdh10 in WT organotypic hippocampal slice cultures using biolistic transfection (Figures S2A and S2B) (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At 16–30 hr after transfection, we performed simultaneous whole-cell patch clamp recordings from Pcdh10-transfected and neighboring untransfected CA1 pyramidal neurons. Pcdh10 overexpression had no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission, as measured by the frequency or amplitude of miniature (m) EPSCs or evoked EPSC amplitude (Figure S2B and Table S1). Similarly, there was no effect of Pcdh10 on paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of evoked EPSCs, an indicator of presynaptic release probability (Table S1). In the converse experiment, we knocked down endogenous Pcdh10 in WT hippocampal slice cultures using either one of two shRNAs targeting different regions of Pcdh10 mRNA. After 40–60 hr transfection, neither shRNA against Pcdh10 nor a control nontarget shRNA had any effect on the aforementioned measurements of excitatory synaptic function (Figures S2C, S2D, and S2E and Table S1). Similarly, transfection of dissociated hippocampal cultures with either Flag-Pcdh10 or shRNA against Pcdh10 (Figures S2F and S2G) had no effect on synapse number, as measured by coclusters of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins synapsin-1 and PSD-95, or PSD-95 puncta number and size. These results indicate that acute changes in Pcdh10 levels are not sufficient to affect excitatory synaptic function. To test whether Pcdh10 is required for MEF2-induced synapse elimination, we cotransfected WT hippocampal slice cultures with plasmids generating either one of two shRNAs against Pcdh10 together with MEF2-VP16ERtm. Sister cultures were cotransfected with a control shRNA together with MEF2-VP16ERtm. After 24 hr, tamoxifen was applied to the slices to activate MEF2 for another 16–32 hr, followed by simultaneous recordings of transfected and neighboring untransfected CA1 neurons. As shown, neurons transfected with MEF2-VP16ERtm and control shRNA had a decrease in mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitude but no change in PPF (Figure 2A and Table S1). These changes are consistent and correlate with structural synapse elimination that we previously demonstrated with MEF2-VP16ERtm in this preparation (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar; Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M. Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.Neuron. 2010; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, MEF2-induced functional synapse elimination was blocked in neurons transfected with shRNA against Pcdh10 (Figures 2B and S2H and Table S1) and rescued by cotransfection of a shRNA-insensitive Pcdh10 (Figure 2C and Table S1) together with the Pcdh10 shRNA. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pcdh10 did not affect MEF2-induced transcription of Nurr77 as measured with real-time RT-PCR (Figure S2I), suggesting that Pcdh10 functions in synapse elimination downstream of MEF2 activated transcription. To determine the cellular mechanism by which Pcdh10 mediates MEF2-induced synapse elimination, we turned to dissociated cortical neuron cultures, which are amenable to biochemical methods. We hypothesized that MEF2 activation causes rapid synapse elimination by the regulated degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins. To investigate this possibility, we monitored the level of several postsynaptic scaffolding proteins in MEF2-VP16ERtm transfected cortical neuron cultures after 6 hr of tamoxifen treatment. As shown in Figure 3A, PSD-95 levels were significantly decreased in WT neurons, whereas other synaptic proteins (mGluR5, Homer, and CaMKIIα) remained unchanged. Consistent with the deficit in MEF2-induced synapse elimination in Fmr1 KO neurons, PSD-95 levels were unchanged upon MEF2 activation in Fmr1 KO neurons. Similar results were observed with immunohistochemistry for PSD-95 in dissociated hippocampal neurons (Figure 3B). This result also suggests that the downregulation of PSD-95 is a common consequence of MEF2 activation in both cortical and hippocampal neurons. To determine whether the downregulation of PSD-95 resulted from reduced synthesis or increased degradation, we performed metabolic labeling with 35S-Met/Cys in dissociated cortical neuron cultures. After 6 hr of MEF2 activation and 35S-Met/Cys label, there was no change in newly synthesized PSD-95 from either WT or Fmr1 KO neurons (Figure 3C). However, using the pulse-chase 35S-Met/Cys labeling assay, the half-life of PSD-95 was reduced by ∼35% after MEF2 activation in WT neurons (Figure 3D). Like PSD-95 protein levels (Figures 3A and 3B), PSD-95 half-life was unaffected by MEF2 activation in Fmr1 KO neurons. To investigate whether MEF2-induced degradation of PSD-95 in WT neurons is proteasome dependent, we applied proteasome inhibitors MG132 (5 μM) or lactacystin (5 μM), together with tamoxifen (Figures 3E and S3A). Both MG132 and lactacystin blocked MEF2-induced downregulation of PSD-95 in WT neurons, and no changes in PSD-95 were observed under any condition in Fmr1 KO neurons. To determine whether MEF2-induced degradation of PSD-95 is mediated by Pcdh10, we used lentivirus to deliver MEF2-VP16ERtm along with one of two different shRNAs against Pcdh10 into dissociated cortical neuron cultures. Knocking down Pcdh10 with either shRNA inhibited MEF2-induced PSD-95 degradation (Figures 3F and S3B). PSD-95 degradation is rescued by lentiviral coexpression of shRNA-insensitive Pcdh10 together with the Pcdh10 shRNA (Figure S3C). These findings indicate that Pcdh10 is required for MEF2-induced degradation of PSD-95 and suggest a molecular mechanism for Pcdh10 in MEF2-induced synapse elimination. To better determine the role of Pcdh10 in MEF2-induced regulation of PSD-95, we investigated whether Pcdh10 physically associated with PSD-95 and whether this changed with MEF2 activation. Using coimmunoprecipitation of Pcdh10 with PSD-95 from cortical neuron cultures (in the presence of MG132), we found that Pcdh10 could associate with PSD-95 (Figure 4A). Activation of MEF2 for 6 hr drastically increased the association between Pcdh10 and PSD-95 in WT neurons, but not in Fmr1 KO neurons (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained in hippocampal neuron cultures (Figure S4A). Given that MEF2 increases the expression of Pcdh10 in WT cultures (Figure 1D), we considered whether the MEF2-induced association of Pcdh10 and PSD-95 is due to enhanced production of Pcdh10. We used lentivirus to transfect WT or Fmr1 KO cortical cultures with a Flag-tagged Pcdh10 driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter whose transcription is not regulated by MEF2. Although total Flag-Pcdh10 levels were unchanged upon MEF2 activation, immunoprecipitation of PSD-95 revealed an increase in Flag-Pcdh10 association with PSD-95 (Figure 4B, in the presence of MG132). This suggests that MEF2 promotes the association of Pcdh10 with PSD-95 independent of regulating Pcdh10 levels. In"
https://openalex.org/W2067387842,"Most studies on TCF7L2 SNP variants in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) focus on a role of the encoded transcription factor TCF4 in β cells. Here, a mouse genetics approach shows that removal of TCF4 from β cells does not affect their function, whereas manipulating TCF4 levels in the liver has major effects on metabolism. In Tcf7l2−/− mice, the immediate postnatal surge in liver metabolism does not occur. Consequently, pups die due to hypoglycemia. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with gene expression profiling, we identify a TCF4-controlled metabolic gene program that is acutely activated in the postnatal liver. In concordance, adult liver-specific Tcf7l2 knockout mice show reduced hepatic glucose production during fasting and display improved glucose homeostasis when maintained on high-fat diet. Furthermore, liver-specific TCF4 overexpression increases hepatic glucose production. These observations imply that TCF4 directly activates metabolic genes and that inhibition of Wnt signaling may be beneficial in metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003068184,"Sensory perception is not a simple feed-forward process, and higher brain areas can actively modulate information processing in ""lower"" areas. We used optogenetic methods to examine how cortical feedback projections affect circuits in the first olfactory processing stage, the olfactory bulb. Selective activation of back projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus/cortex (AON) revealed functional glutamatergic synaptic connections on several types of bulbar interneurons. Unexpectedly, AON axons also directly depolarized mitral cells (MCs), enough to elicit spikes reliably in a time window of a few milliseconds. MCs received strong disynaptic inhibition, a third of which arises in the glomerular layer. Activating feedback axons in vivo suppressed spontaneous as well as odor-evoked activity of MCs, sometimes preceded by a temporally precise increase in firing probability. Our study indicates that cortical feedback can shape the activity of bulbar output neurons by enabling precisely timed spikes and enforcing broad inhibition to suppress background activity."
https://openalex.org/W2053256698,"The extracellular matrix has a crucial role in determining the spatial orientation of epithelial polarity and the formation of lumens in glandular tissues; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By using Cre–Lox deletion we show that β1 integrins are required for normal mammary gland morphogenesis and lumen formation, both in vivo and in a three-dimensional primary culture model in which epithelial cells directly contact a basement membrane. Downstream of basement membrane β1 integrins, Rac1 is not involved; however, ILK is needed to polarize microtubule plus ends at the basolateral membrane and disrupting each of these components prevents lumen formation. The integrin–microtubule axis is necessary for the endocytic removal of apical proteins from the basement-membrane–cell interface and for internal Golgi positioning. We propose that this integrin signalling network controls the delivery of apical components to the correct surface and thereby governs the orientation of polarity and development of lumens."

Recent work suggests that Piwi-bound precursor piRNAs are trimmed by a 3′-to-5′ exonuclease and then methylated on the 2′-OH of the 3′ residue of the mature piRNA (Kawaoka et al., 2011Kawaoka S.

The C. elegans piRNAs, known as 21U-RNAs, are an abundant class of germline-expressed small RNAs that interact with the Piwi ortholog PRG-1 (Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M.

Similar to mammalian pachytene piRNAs, 21U-RNAs are diverse in sequence, and the overwhelming majority lack perfectly complementary RNA targets. Unlike mammalian piRNAs, however, 21U-RNAs do not appear to be processed from long RNA precursors. Instead, they derive from individual gene-like loci that are dispersed within two large clusters on chromosome IV (Cecere et al., 2012Cecere G. Zheng G.X. Mansisidor A.R. Klymko K.E. Grishok A.

Within these clusters, more than 15,000 distinct 21U-RNAs are expressed from both strands and reside within introns and intergenic regions, but are rarely found in coding regions (Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M. Chiang R. Fahlgren N. Kasschau K.D. Chaves D.A. Gu W. Vasale J.J. Duan S. et al.PRG-1 and 21U-RNAs interact to form the piRNA complex required for fertility in C. elegans.Mol.

The presence of a conserved 8 nucleotide (nt) motif and A/T-rich region upstream of each 21U-RNA led Ruby et al. (Ruby et al., 2006Ruby J.G. Jan C. Player C. Axtell M.J. Lee W. Nusbaum C. Ge H.

Consistent with this idea, a recent study identified Forkhead-family transcription factors that associate with the 8 nt motif and whose activity was correlated with 21U-RNA expression (Cecere et al., 2012Cecere G. Zheng G.X. Mansisidor A.R. Klymko K.E. Grishok A. Promoters recognized by forkhead proteins exist for individual 21U-RNAs.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 734-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using 5′ RACE, this study also amplified 70 nt of a longer transcript that initiated 2 nt upstream of one of two overlapping 21U-RNAs (21ur-3372 and 21ur-14,222), suggesting that these 21U-RNAs may be processed from a transcript greater than 70 nt in length. In this paper we explore the biogenesis of 21U-RNAs genome wide. To do this, we use two complementary 5′ anchored RNA deep-sequencing approaches called CIP-TAP and CapSeq. Unlike published cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE)-related methods involving affinity purification (de Hoon and Hayashizaki, 2008de Hoon M. Hayashizaki Y. Deep cap analysis gene expression (CAGE): genome-wide identification of promoters, quantification of their expression, and network inference.Biotechniques. 2008; 44 (630, 632): 627-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the CapSeq protocol, developed in this study, utilizes an efficient enzymatic approach to dramatically reduce the background of structural RNA reads and to enrich for 70–90 nt sequence tags corresponding to the capped 5′ ends of longer RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We show that CapSeq identifies pre-mRNAs, trans-spliced mRNAs, primary (pri-) miRNAs, and noncoding RNAs, thus defining candidate transcription start (TS) sites for >50% of annotated genes. This information is absent for most current WormBase annotations. Surprisingly, however, we show that CapSeq reads derive from less than 0.5% of annotated 21U-RNA loci. Instead, using CIP-TAP cloning (Affymetrix/Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome Project, 2009Affymetrix ENCODE Transcriptome ProjectCold Spring Harbor Laboratory ENCODE Transcriptome ProjectPost-transcriptional processing generates a diversity of 5′-modified long and short RNAs.Nature. 2009; 457: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), we show that piRNA loci express an endogenous capped small (cs) RNA species. csRNAs are native 18–40 nt Pol II products thought to arise through early termination or polymerase pausing, and previous studies have shown that csRNAs are expressed, often bidirectionally, at promoter regions in a variety of organisms (Haussecker et al., 2008Haussecker D. Cao D. Huang Y. Parameswaran P. Fire A.Z. Kay M.A. Capped small RNAs and MOV10 in human hepatitis delta virus replication.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Core L.J. Lis J.T. Sharp P.A. Divergent transcription: a new feature of active promoters.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, csRNAs have not been described to date in C. elegans. Our CIP-TAP data, which are far from saturation, detect csRNAs at Pol II promoters genome wide, including >50% of annotated 21U-RNA loci. Interestingly, we show that csRNA transcription initiates precisely 2 nt upstream of the corresponding mature 21U-RNA, suggesting that csRNAs are processed into piRNAs by removing the cap plus two nucleotides and by trimming the 3′ end. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a U residue at the +3 position of a csRNA is critical for piRNA processing or stability. In summary, we present a fully enzymatic approach, CapSeq, for 5′ anchored RNA profiling, and use this approach to define the first TS site annotations for many Pol II loci in C. elegans. We show that csRNAs identified by CIP-TAP cloning, rather than longer RNAs identified by CapSeq, are the likely piRNA precursors. Our findings also identify csRNAs transcribed at promoters genome wide as 21U-RNA precursors, nearly doubling the repertoire of piRNAs available for genome surveillance. 21U-RNAs are thought to be expressed from thousands of independent loci (Ruby et al., 2006Ruby J.G. Jan C. Player C. Axtell M.J. Lee W. Nusbaum C. Ge H. Bartel D.P. Large-scale sequencing reveals 21U-RNAs and additional microRNAs and endogenous siRNAs in C. elegans.Cell. 2006; 127: 1193-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and could thus comprise ∼40% of the transcription units in the C. elegans genome. However, systematic RNA-seq methods to profile RNA expression (Allen et al., 2011Allen M.A. Hillier L.W. Waterston R.H. Blumenthal T. A global analysis of C. elegans trans-splicing.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar; Lamm et al., 2011Lamm A.T. Stadler M.R. Zhang H. Gent J.I. Fire A.Z. Multimodal RNA-seq using single-strand, double-strand, and CircLigase-based capture yields a refined and extended description of the C. elegans transcriptome.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have not identified likely 21U-RNA precursors. Therefore, to increase the chance of identifying 21U-RNA precursors, we sought to generate a comprehensive profile of 5′ anchored RNA sequence tags. To do this we developed CapSeq, which employs a straightforward series of enzymatic treatments to enrich the 5′ ends of Pol II transcripts (Figure 1), with as little as 0.5–2 μg of total RNA as starting material (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Using CapSeq, we generated five libraries from three different developmental stages (L1, L3, and adult) and obtained ∼61 million reads that mapped to the C. elegans genome, including 46 million that mapped to nonstructural RNAs. Visual inspection using the genome browser software “GBrowse” (Stein et al., 2002Stein L.D. Mungall C. Shu S. Caudy M. Mangone M. Day A. Nickerson E. Stajich J.E. Harris T.W. Arva A. Lewis S. The generic genome browser: a building block for a model organism system database.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) revealed that most CapSeq reads are indeed enriched at the 5′ ends of genes transcribed by RNA Pol II (Figure 2A, CapSeq). To estimate the fidelity with which CapSeq defines the actual 5′ ends of transcripts, as opposed to internally truncated RNAs, we took advantage of the fact that many worm transcripts contain a capped trans-spliced 5′ leader sequence. Using two different methods, we found that CapSeq enriches approximately 15,000-fold for reads starting at the actual 5′ end (indicated by the 5′-most nt of the spliced leader sequence) over reads starting at any other nucleotide downstream (see Extended Discussion available online). The TS sites for C. elegans genes are poorly mapped, in part because many mRNAs are trans-spliced to a capped ∼22 nt spliced leader (SL), which results in removal of the pre-mRNA 5′ end (Blumenthal and Steward, 1997Blumenthal T. Steward K. RNA Processing and Gene Structure.in: Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1997Google Scholar). Our CapSeq data identified 70% of the 15,759 SL trans-splice sites annotated in the WS215 genome release, as well as 5,711 new trans-splice sites (Figure S1A, top; Table S1A). Most gene annotations in WormBase simply indicate the 5′ end of the trans-spliced exon, or the position of the AUG codon. The 5′ ends of many non-SL CapSeq reads mapped near, and often upstream of, current 5′ end annotations (Figure 2A; data not shown). We hypothesized that the 5′ ends of these reads could represent TS sites. Consistent with this idea, we noticed that these reads exhibit a strong bias for a 2 nt motif of pyrimidine (Y) purine (R), or YR, in which R represents the first nt (+1) in the CapSeq read and Y represents the adjacent 5′ nt (Figure 2B). The YR motif is part of an extended consensus yYRyyy (lower case indicates weaker preference), with a strong preference for A as the R at position +1 and a slight preference for T at flanking positions. The YR motif and extended consensus resemble the initiator element required for RNA Pol II transcription initiation in mammals, plants, and flies (de Hoon and Hayashizaki, 2008de Hoon M.

Using a cutoff of one CapSeq read per 10 million total reads, and a requirement for a YR motif, our CapSeq data predicted approximately 64,000 candidate TS sites genome wide (Table S1B). In order to pair candidate TS sites with existing annotations, we considered CapSeq reads within a window from 1,000 nt upstream to 100–200 nt downstream of annotated 5′ ends. The 1,000 nt upstream distance was chosen as a conservative upper limit to allow for the possibility of nonannotated 5′ exon sequence or long distances between the TS site and the first splice-acceptor site required for trans-splicing. For most genes, the 3′ limit was arbitrarily set at 200 nt. However, in order to reduce the chance of scoring degradation products as TS sites, this 3′ limit was reduced to 100 nt for very abundantly transcribed genes whose total read counts exceeded 1,000 reads per 10 million. Using these criteria, we could assign candidate TS sites to more than 50% of annotations in WS215 (Table S1B), including 52% of annotated protein-coding genes (10,667 genes), 15% of annotated pseudogenes (226), 54% of annotated noncoding RNAs (137), 74% of snoRNAs (102), and 37% of snRNA genes (42). We found that TS sites often appeared to be clustered over regions of several to sometimes more than 50 nt (Figure 2A, CapSeq), suggesting that there is an inherent flexibility in transcription initiation mediated by RNA Pol II at these promoters. We also identified ∼20,000 candidate TS sites that did not pair with annotations based on our criteria (Table S1B). These included 12,457 clusters of TS sites that resembled TS-site clusters typical of annotated Pol II genes. The majority of these (84%) were separated from other annotations or from each other by greater than 1 kb. These findings suggest that there are many as yet nonannotated Pol II loci in the C. elegans genome and/or that many of the existing annotations are separated from their actual 5′ ends by greater than the arbitrarily set 1 kb limit used for our analysis. miRNAs are sequentially processed from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) synthesized by Pol II. Drosha processes pri-miRNAs into stem-loop precursors (pre-miRNAs) that are exported to the cytoplasm and processed by Dicer into mature miRNAs (Hutvagner and Simard, 2008Hutvagner G. Simard M.J. Argonaute proteins: key players in RNA silencing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In most organisms, the TS sites of pri-miRNAs have not been identified, likely because the original 5′ end is rapidly removed during miRNA maturation. To identify candidate TS sites for miRNA genes, we analyzed CapSeq reads mapping upstream of annotated miRNAs. Because many miRNAs are coexpressed in a single primary transcript (Lau et al., 2001Lau N.C. Lim L.P. Weinstein E.G. Bartel D.P. An abundant class of tiny RNAs with probable regulatory roles in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2001; 294: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), there are only about 100 unique miRNA loci annotated in the C. elegans genome, encoding ∼140 miRNAs. We identified at least one candidate TS site for 56 of the 100 annotated miRNA loci corresponding to 74 individual mature miRNAs (Table S1E). As with other Pol II loci, we found that CapSeq reads that mapped upstream of the pre-miRNAs were often clustered within a 50 nt interval (Figure 2D; Table S1E). We found evidence for only a single group of TS sites upstream of each miR cluster, including the mir-54–56, mir-35–41 and mir-229/64–66 clusters (Figure 2D; Table S1E), indicating that each cluster is coexpressed (Lau et al., 2001Lau N.C. Lim L.P. Weinstein E.G. Bartel D.P. An abundant class of tiny RNAs with probable regulatory roles in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2001; 294: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). Pri-miRNAs were rarely trans-spliced; a total of five SL-containing reads were associated with pri-miRNAs, and all of these were spliced to pri-let-7. The five SL-containing reads mapped ∼30 nt upstream of the Drosha-processed pre-let-7 RNA, while 20 non-SL reads mapped approximately 200 nt further upstream. Interestingly, we found that some pri-miRNAs were expressed at levels comparable to the pre-mRNAs of common protein-coding genes (Figure S1E), a finding that differs from previously published RNA-Seq data (Lamm et al., 2011Lamm A.T. Stadler M.R. Zhang H. Gent J.I. Fire A.Z. Multimodal RNA-seq using single-strand, double-strand, and CircLigase-based capture yields a refined and extended description of the C. elegans transcriptome.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; see Discussion). The CapSeq protocol we describe should be useful for 5′ anchored RNA profiling from small quantities of tissue. To confirm that CapSeq can identify TS sites from other species, we performed a pilot study using mouse testis RNA. As shown in Figure 3A, we found that CapSeq reads were strongly biased for the 5′ end of annotated mouse genes. By searching for reads upstream of annotated miRNA loci, we identified candidate TS sites for hundreds of primary mouse miRNA genes (Table S2). We also analyzed reads mapping to mouse piRNA clusters. We found that multiple mouse piRNAs appeared to share a TS site (Figure 3B), consistent with previous studies suggesting that piRNAs may be processed from longer precursor RNAs (Aravin et al., 2006Aravin A. Gaidatzis D. Pfeffer S. Lagos-Quintana M. Landgraf P. Iovino N. Morris P. Brownstein M.J. Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Nakano T. et al.A novel class of small RNAs bind to MILI protein in mouse testes.Nature. 2006; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar; Girard et al., 2006Girard A. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Carmell M.A. A germline-specific class of small RNAs binds mammalian Piwi proteins.Nature. 2006; 442: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Finally, we analyzed the motif surrounding candidate mouse TS sites and observed a clear YR motif within a broader motif of YRNyy, in which R (usually an A) corresponds to the predicted 5′ nt (Figure 3C). Thus our data show that CapSeq is generally useful for identifying Pol II TS sites, and that C. elegans TS sites are similar to mammalian TS sites. Despite the considerable depth of our CapSeq libraries, we were surprised to find that only 217 of >9,000 annotated unique 21U-RNA loci were identified by CapSeq reads. These included a single 88 nt CapSeq read mapping to the locus from which Cecere et al., 2012Cecere G. Zheng G.X. Mansisidor A.R. Klymko K.E. Grishok A. Promoters recognized by forkhead proteins exist for individual 21U-RNAs.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 734-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar identified a 70 nt 5′ RACE product. In contrast, our mouse CapSeq data identified CapSeq reads associated with most of the annotated piRNA loci. These findings could indicate that pre-21U-RNAs are exceptionally unstable or, alternatively, that the actual precursors are shorter than the 70 nt (minimum length) sequence tags amplified by CapSeq. To test the latter idea, we employed CIP-TAP cloning to identify native csRNAs (Figure 1; Extended Experimental Procedures). Total RNA was size-fractionated to recover 18–40 nt RNA species. To select against the recovery of abundant uncapped small RNA species, including 22G-RNAs, miRNAs and mature piRNAs, we treated the sample with CIP to remove 5′ mono- or triphosphates, reducing the accessibility of these species to 5′ ligation. The 3′ end of the small RNA was ligated to a linker and gel purified. Three fourth"

Even though it has an important role in responses against blood-borne antigens, lymphocyte migration in the marginal zone has not been intravitally visualized due to challenges associated with achieving adequate imaging depth in this abdominal organ. Here we develop a two-photon microscopy procedure to study marginal zone and follicular B-cell movement in the live mouse spleen. We show that marginal zone B cells are highly motile and exhibit long membrane extensions. Marginal zone B cells shuttle between the marginal zone and follicles with at least one-fifth of the cells exchanging between compartments per hour, a behaviour that explains their ability to deliver antigens rapidly from the open blood circulation to the secluded follicles. Follicular B cells also transit from follicles to the marginal zone, but unlike marginal zone B cells, they fail to undergo integrin-mediated adhesion, become caught in fluid flow and are carried into the red pulp. Follicular B-cell egress via the marginal zone is sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)-dependent. This study shows that marginal zone B cells migrate continually between marginal zone and follicles and establishes the marginal zone as a site of S1PR1-dependent B-cell exit from follicles. The results also show how adhesive differences of similar cells critically influence their behaviour in the same microenvironment."

MITRAC is a cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediate MITRAC regulates mitochondrial translation in human mitochondria TIM21 is a constituent of MITRAC and presequence translocase complexes TIM21 ushers imported subunits of complexes I and IV to assembly intermediates The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system generates the bulk of cellular ATP in most eukaryotic cells. This major task of energy metabolism is fulfilled by five multisubunit protein complexes, referred to as complexes I–V, residing in the inner membrane of mitochondria. They consist of subunits of dual genetic origin, encoded on both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (Mick et al., 2011Mick D.U. Fox T.D. Rehling P.

This exceptional situation requires well-balanced and sophisticated regulation of protein expression, transport, and integration of subunits into the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they assemble to form oligomeric complexes. Cofactors, required for electron transport, have to be incorporated during the assembly process to establish functional, redox-active enzymes (Carr and Winge, 2003Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Assembly of cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondrion.Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At the same time, cells need to be protected from the production of deleterious reactive oxygen species formed in partially assembled complexes (Khalimonchuk et al., 2007Khalimonchuk O. Bird A.

Most of our current knowledge on human respiratory-chain biogenesis stems from analyses of patients suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, such as Leigh Syndrome. The molecular details of the respiratory-chain assembly process are best studied for the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Distinct steps of the assembly process have been dissected and depend on so-called assembly factors. These proteins assist in the progression of the assembly process and stabilize intermediates in the membrane. Studies in yeast have provided insight into mechanisms and regulatory principles of assembly and have identified more than 20 complex IV-specific assembly factors (Mick et al., 2011Mick D.U. Fox T.D. Rehling P. Inventory control: cytochrome c oxidase assembly regulates mitochondrial translation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar; Soto et al., 2012Soto I.C. Fontanesi F. Liu J. Barrientos A. Biogenesis and assembly of eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase catalytic core.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1817: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, most of these lack robust mammalian homologs. In the course of this study, an in silico analysis that aimed to identify proteins with sequence similarity to these yeast factors revealed potential candidates, each of which awaits confirmation in vivo (Szklarczyk et al., 2012Szklarczyk R. Wanschers B.F. Cuypers T.D. Esseling J.J. Riemersma M. van den Brand M.A. Gloerich J. Lasonder E. van den Heuvel L.P. Nijtmans L.G.

Clearly, the highest degree of similarity is found among known factors involved in cofactor biogenesis, exemplified by the conserved SURF1/Shy1 protein, implicated in heme a insertion into the central subunit COX1 (Mashkevich et al., 1997Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. SHY1, the yeast homolog of the mammalian SURF-1 gene, encodes a mitochondrial protein required for respiration.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutations in SURF1 are the most frequent cause of Leigh Syndrome with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (Shoubridge, 2001Shoubridge E.A. Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.Am. J. Med.

Mitochondrial medicine: a metabolic perspective on the pathology of oxidative phosphorylation disorders.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, corresponding mutations in the yeast homolog Shy1 have been found to differentially influence mitochondrial translation (Barrientos et al., 2002Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A.

Genet. 2011; 20: 2379-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In yeast, expression of mitochondria-encoded Cox1 is highly regulated at the translational level. The COX1 messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific translational activator Mss51 is recruited to and inactivated in early Cox1 assembly-intermediate complexes containing the assembly factors Cox14, Coa3, and Coa1 (Barrientos et al., 2004Barrientos A.

In situations where intermediates accumulate, this complex stalls Cox1 translation, so that the Cox1 assembly status feeds back to its own translation. In human mitochondria, factors that influence COX1 translation, such as TACO1 or c12orf62 (COX14), have been described; however, it is still unclear whether they represent functional counterparts of the yeast proteins described above (Szklarczyk et al., 2012Szklarczyk R.

Genet. 2012; 90: 142-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, molecular mechanisms that regulate COX1 translation in human mitochondria are unknown. The assembly process of single respiratory-chain complexes revolves around membrane integration and stabilization of central mitochondria-encoded subunits that are subsequently joined by nuclear-encoded subunits entering the organelle from the cytosol. Nuclear-encoded subunits of the respiratory chain predominantly harbor N-terminal presequences for mitochondrial targeting (Vögtle et al., 2009Vögtle F.-N. Wortelkamp S. Zahedi R.P. Becker D. Leidhold C. Gevaert K. Kellermann J. Voos W. Sickmann A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Global analysis of the mitochondrial N-proteome identifies a processing peptidase critical for protein stability.Cell. 2009; 139: 428-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The molecular machines that facilitate their insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane are well studied and highly conserved among eukaryotes (Dolezal et al., 2006Dolezal P. Likic V. Tachezy J. Lithgow T. Evolution of the molecular machines for protein import into mitochondria.Science. 2006; 313: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Whereas mitochondria-encoded proteins are inserted by the Oxa1 insertase, most nuclear-encoded respiratory-chain subunits are imported by the presequence translocase (TIM23 complex) (Chacinska et al., 2009Chacinska A. Koehler C.M. Milenkovic D. Lithgow T. Pfanner N. Importing mitochondrial proteins: machineries and mechanisms.Cell. 2009; 138: 628-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar; Neupert and Herrmann, 2007Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). This translocase consists of five membrane proteins: the channel-forming Tim23, the closely associated Tim17, the presequence receptor Tim50, Mgr2, and Tim21. Yeast Tim21 associates with respiratory-chain supercomplexes to promote insertion of presequence-containing precursors into the inner membrane (Saddar et al., 2008Saddar S. Dienhart M.K. Stuart R.A. The F1F0-ATP synthase complex influences the assembly state of the cytochrome bc1-cytochrome oxidase supercomplex and its association with the TIM23 machinery.J. Biol.

A role for Tim21 in membrane-potential-dependent preprotein sorting in mitochondria.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2271-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This association is critical under growth conditions that restrict the membrane potential, which drives ATP synthesis and transport across the inner membrane. Despite detailed insight into the mechanism of protein import, it is still unknown how preproteins, which are inserted into the inner membrane by the presequence translocase, are directed to assembling respiratory-chain subcomplexes. So far, no assembly factors or candidate proteins that mediate transport of imported proteins to the different respiratory-chain subassemblies have been proposed. Here, we comprehensively identified mammalian cytochrome c oxidase assembly factors. These analyses led to the discovery of MITRAC12, which defines the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase) complexes. A detailed characterization of the MITRAC12 interaction network revealed gene products that are involved in early steps of mammalian complex IV biogenesis and link assembly to COX1 translational regulation in human. Our analyses reveal a dynamic distribution of the uncharacterized human TIM21 between TIM23 and MITRAC complexes that contain the central mitochondria-encoded subunits. We demonstrate that TIM21 is the first assembly factor that is involved in the transfer of newly imported proteins from the presequence translocase to assembling respiratory-chain complexes. In human mitochondria, the molecular mechanisms and components of early steps of COX1 biogenesis are ill defined. In contrast, biochemical isolation of yeast Cox1 assembly intermediates with ZZ-tagged Shy1 as bait led to the identification of new assembly factors (Mick et al., 2007Mick D.U. Wagner K. van der Laan M. Frazier A.E. Perschil I. Pawlas M. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rehling P.

Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and extended mechanistic insights into the concept of tight coupling between cytochrome c oxidase assembly and translational regulation of COX1 mRNA (Barrientos et al., 2004Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A.

Based on this strategy, we generated a stable HEK293 cell line expressing SURF1 with a C-terminal ZZ-tag. Isolated mitochondria containing SURF1ZZ were solubilized and subjected to IgG chromatography. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A). Mass spectrometric analysis identified a prominent low-molecular-weight band as the uncharacterized human protein CCDC56, which we termed MITRAC12. MITRAC12 is a conserved protein with a calculated molecular weight of 11.7 kDa and contains a single predicted transmembrane span (Figure 1B). To address whether MITRAC12 was a mitochondrial protein, we synthesized and radiolabeled the protein in reticulocyte lysate. [35S]MITRAC12 was subsequently imported into isolated human mitochondria, and radiolabeled ornithine-transcarbamylase (OTC) served as a control. MITRAC12 was efficiently imported into mitochondria and became protected against protease treatment. No processing of the imported protein was observed, suggesting that it is not directed into mitochondria by a cleavable presequence (Figure 1C). Although MITRAC12 import was largely dependent on the membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane, a fraction was transported into mitochondria in the absence of a Δψ (Figure 1C, lane 4). Similarly, Δψ-independent import has been reported for small inner-mitochondrial-membrane proteins (Wagner et al., 2009Wagner K. Rehling P. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Taylor R.D. Pfanner N. van der Laan M. Mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase: the small subunits e and g associate with monomeric complexes to trigger dimerization.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To address the submitochondrial localization of MITRAC12, we generated a stable Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 cell line expressing the protein with a C-terminal FLAG-tag under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promotor. Similar to the inner-membrane protein TIM23, MITRAC12FLAG was recovered with isolated mitochondria and only became accessible to externally added protease when the outer membrane was disrupted by hypo-osmotic treatment (mitoplasts) or sonication (Figure 1D). As MITRAC12 was resistant to carbonate extraction, we concluded that MITRAC12 was an inner-mitochondrial-membrane protein with its C terminus exposed to the intermembrane space (IMS). Identical results were obtained for authentic MITRAC12 with an antiserum directed against the C terminus (see Figure 4A). To support coisolation of MITRAC12 with SURF1, we analyzed SURF1ZZ isolation samples by western blotting with an antiserum against the C terminus of MITRAC12. Whereas LETM1, an inner-mitochondrial-membrane protein, did not copurify with SURF1ZZ, MITRAC12 was efficiently isolated (Figure 1E). However, only minute amounts of COX1 were coisolated, suggesting that the tagged SURF1 was functionally compromised. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated authentic MITRAC12 from HEK293 cells after solubilization. Wild-type SURF1 and COX1 efficiently coprecipitated (Figure 1F), suggesting that these proteins formed a complex in the inner membrane. To address the nature of this complex under native conditions, we again utilized MITRAC12FLAG, which we expressed at endogenous levels and which could be specifically eluted from an anti-FLAG antibody matrix with FLAG peptide. As for the endogenous MITRAC12, COX1 and SURF1 were specifically recovered in MITRAC12FLAG immunoisolations as assessed by western blotting after SDS-PAGE (Figure 1G and Figure S1A available online). When analyzing mitochondrial protein complexes by two-dimensional electrophoresis (blue native-PAGE [BN-PAGE] followed by SDS-PAGE) and western blotting, MITRAC12 comigrated with a subcomplex of COX1 that we termed MITRAC (Figure 1H). Native isolation of MITRAC12FLAG-containing complexes recovered the MITRAC complex that contained COX1 (Figure 1I). Moreover, small amounts of mature complex IV were co-isolated as indicated by the presence of a COX1-containing complex in the eluate that comigrated with mature complex IV in the total. In conclusion, purification of SURF1 led to the identification of MITRAC12, an uncharacterized human protein associated with COX1.Figure S1MITRAC Complexes Are Productive Cytochrome c Oxidase Assembly Intermediates that Regulate COX1 Expression, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) IP from control or MITRAC12FLAG-expressing mitochondria using anti-FLAG-agarose.

Copurification of MITRAC12 with COX1 and SURF1 suggested a role in early steps of cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis. Hence, we addressed whether MITRAC12 interacted with newly synthesized COX1. Therefore, we labeled mitochondrial translation products, isolated mitochondria containing MITRAC12FLAG, and performed immunoisolation. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled copurifying proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Among the mitochondrial translation products, COX1 was specifically enriched in the MITRAC12FLAG eluate (Figure 2A). COX2 was recovered with MITRAC12 to a lesser extent, in agreement with the observed coisolation of minute amounts of mature complex IV (Figure 1I). BN-PAGE analysis of MITRAC12FLAG immunoisolation samples after labeling of mitochondrial translation products confirmed this result and showed that no other complexes containing mitochondrial translation products were copurified (Figure 2B). To directly address whether MITRAC was a genuine COX1 assembly intermediate, we labeled mitochondrial translation products with [35S]methionine and followed the assembly of COX1 over the course of an extended chase by separating protein complexes on first-dimension BN-PAGE and subsequent second-dimension SDS-PAGE. Newly synthesized COX1 rapidly accumulated in MITRAC. Over the course of the chase, an increasing amount of radiolabeled COX1 appeared at the size of mature complex IV, while concomitantly the MITRAC signal was reduced (Figure S1B). Accordingly, COX1 was integrated into mature cytochrome c oxidase from the productive MITRAC assembly intermediate. To analyze the function of MITRAC12 in complex IV biogenesis, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of MITRAC12 in HEK293 cells. MITRAC12 knockdown resulted in a growth defect that was rescued by expression of MITRAC12FLAG, indicating that the construct was functional (Figure S1C). Specific MITRAC12 siRNA-treated and nontargeting control cells were initially subjected to steady-state protein analysis. MITRAC12-depleted cells displayed a selective reduction of COX1 and the early-assembling nuclear-encoded subunit COX4-1. In contrast, COX6A, a peripheral late-associating complex subunit, was hardly affected (Figure 2C). In agreement with this observation, mitochondria from MITRAC12-depleted cells displayed reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity as assessed by in-gel activity staining of mitochondrial protein complexes and enzyme activity measurements, whereas complex V activity was not affected (Figures 2D and S1D). When we analyzed the amounts of complex IV by BN-PAGE and western blotting or ELISA, we found them significantly reduced in mitochondria lacking MITRAC12 as compared to the control (Figures 2D and S1E). The loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity in MITRAC12 siRNA-treated cells directly correlated with the reduction in the amount of complex IV, suggesting that the remaining complexes maintained wild-type activity (Figure S1F). Because MITRAC12 had not been identified as a complex IV subunit, we reasoned that MITRAC12 could be involved in complex IV biogenesis. Yeast complex IV assembly mutants and patient cells affected in c12orf62 display defects in COX1 translation. Thus, we used metabolic labeling to analyze mitochondrial translation in cells depleted for MITRAC12 or c12orf62. COX1 translation was specifically affected in HEK293 cells with reduced levels of MITRAC12 or c12orf62 (Figure 2E). Similarly, the selective reduction of COX1 was also apparent when fibroblasts were used (Figure S1G). COX1 labeling was reduced to approximately 50% (Figure 2F). To address whether the reduction of COX1 in MITRAC12-depleted cells was due to increased turnover by the mitochondrial quality-control system, we pulse-labeled mitochondrial translation products in control and MITRAC12-depleted cells and followed the labeled proteins for prolonged time. The stability of COX1 was clearly reduced in MITRAC12-depleted cells com"
https://openalex.org/W2020790775,"Nucleosome occupancy is fundamental for establishing chromatin architecture. However, little is known about the relationship between nucleosome dynamics and initial cell lineage specification. Here, we determine the mechanisms that control global nucleosome dynamics during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation into endoderm. Both nucleosome depletion and de novo occupation occur during the differentiation process, with higher overall nucleosome density after differentiation. The variant histone H2A.Z and the winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 both act to regulate nucleosome depletion and gene activation, thus promoting ES cell differentiation, whereas DNA methylation promotes nucleosome occupation and suppresses gene expression. Nucleosome depletion during ES cell differentiation is dependent on Nap1l1-coupled SWI/SNF and INO80 chromatin remodeling complexes. Thus, both epigenetic and genetic regulators cooperate to control nucleosome dynamics during ES cell fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2118038068,"Neurites are the characteristic structural element of neurons that will initiate brain connectivity and elaborate information. Early in development, neurons are spherical cells but this symmetry is broken through the initial formation of neurites. This fundamental step is thought to rely on actin and microtubule dynamics. However, it is unclear which aspects of the complex actin behavior control neuritogenesis and which molecular mechanisms are involved. Here, we demonstrate that augmented actin retrograde flow and protrusion dynamics facilitate neurite formation. Our data indicate that a single family of actin regulatory proteins, ADF/Cofilin, provides the required control of actin retrograde flow and dynamics to form neurites. In particular, the F-actin severing activity of ADF/Cofilin organizes space for the protrusion and bundling of microtubules, the backbone of neurites. Our data reveal how ADF/Cofilin organizes the cytoskeleton to drive actin retrograde flow and thus break the spherical shape of neurons."

To explore their influence on dentate excitability and hippocampal function, we generated a conditional transgenic mouse line, using the Cre/loxP system, in which diphtheria toxin receptor was selectively expressed in mossy cells. One week after injecting toxin into this line, mossy cells throughout the longitudinal axis were degenerated extensively, theta wave power of dentate local field potentials increased during exploration, and deficits occurred in contextual discrimination. By contrast, we detected no epileptiform activity, spontaneous behavioral seizures, or mossy-fiber sprouting 5-6 weeks after mossy cell degeneration. These results indicate that the net effect of mossy cell excitation is to inhibit granule cell activity and enable dentate pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W1999828796,"Brain function is shaped by postnatal experience and vulnerable to disruption of Methyl-CpG-binding protein, Mecp2, in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. How Mecp2 contributes to the experience-dependent refinement of specific cortical circuits and their impairment remains unknown. We analyzed vision in gene-targeted mice and observed an initial normal development in the absence of Mecp2. Visual acuity then rapidly regressed after postnatal day P35-40 and cortical circuits largely fell silent by P55-60. Enhanced inhibitory gating and an excess of parvalbumin-positive, perisomatic input preceded the loss of vision. Both cortical function and inhibitory hyperconnectivity were strikingly rescued independent of Mecp2 by early sensory deprivation or genetic deletion of the excitatory NMDA receptor subunit, NR2A. Thus, vision is a sensitive biomarker of progressive cortical dysfunction and may guide novel, circuit-based therapies for Mecp2 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1995651729,"In the adult brain, continual neurogenesis of olfactory neurons is sustained by the existence of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subependymal niche. Elimination of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) leads to premature exhaustion of the subependymal NSC pool, suggesting a relationship between cell cycle control and long-term self-renewal, but the molecular mechanisms underlying NSC maintenance by p21 remain unexplored. Here we identify a function of p21 in the direct regulation of the expression of pluripotency factor Sox2, a key regulator of the specification and maintenance of neural progenitors. We observe that p21 directly binds a Sox2 enhancer and negatively regulates Sox2 expression in NSCs. Augmented levels of Sox2 in p21 null cells induce replicative stress and a DNA damage response that leads to cell growth arrest mediated by increased levels of p19(Arf) and p53. Our results show a regulation of NSC expansion driven by a p21/Sox2/p53 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2142844745,"HLA-DR molecules bind microbial peptides in an endosomal compartment and present them on the cell surface for CD4 T cell surveillance. HLA-DM plays a critical role in the endosomal peptide selection process. The structure of the HLA-DM-HLA-DR complex shows major rearrangements of the HLA-DR peptide-binding groove. Flipping of a tryptophan away from the HLA-DR1 P1 pocket enables major conformational changes that position hydrophobic HLA-DR residues into the P1 pocket. These conformational changes accelerate peptide dissociation and stabilize the empty HLA-DR peptide-binding groove. Initially, incoming peptides have access to only part of the HLA-DR groove and need to compete with HLA-DR residues for access to the P2 site and the hydrophobic P1 pocket. This energetic barrier creates a rapid and stringent selection process for the highest-affinity binders. Insertion of peptide residues into the P2 and P1 sites reverses the conformational changes, terminating selection through DM dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1966888972,"The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood. We report that partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer, and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status. Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype. However, loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability, disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and decreased cell-cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac-GTP pathway. Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3, suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell-cell cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W2138705006,"The crystal structure of prolyl tRNA synthetase simultaneously bound to its substrate ATP and its inhibitor halofuginone, a derivative of a compound used to treat malaria, indicates that (through interactions with ATP) halofuginone occupies both the amino acid and tRNA binding sites on the synthetase, revealing a new model for developing synthetase inhibitors. The halogenated derivative of an active ingredient in Chinese traditional medicine used as an antimalarial treatment, halofuginone (HF), is currently in clinical trials. HF is known to inhibit prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS), resulting in an accumulation of uncharged tRNAs. Paul Schimmel and colleagues have solved the crystal structure of ProRS bound to ATP and HF. They find that ATP helps to lock the drug on ProRS so that it occupies two substrate binding sites — one for proline and the other for the 3′ end of the tRNA. The authors suggest that this information might be used to develop other synthetase inhibitors that would occupy both sites in a modular fashion. Febrifugine is the active component of the Chinese herb Chang Shan (Dichroa febrifuga Lour.)1,2, which has been used for treating malaria-induced fever for about 2,000 years. Halofuginone (HF), the halogenated derivative of febrifugine, has been tested in clinical trials for potential therapeutic applications in cancer and fibrotic disease3,4,5,6. Recently, HF was reported to inhibit TH17 cell differentiation by activating the amino acid response pathway7, through inhibiting human prolyl-transfer RNA synthetase (ProRS) to cause intracellular accumulation of uncharged tRNA8,9. Curiously, inhibition requires the presence of unhydrolysed ATP. Here we report an unusual 2.0 Å structure showing that ATP directly locks onto and orients two parts of HF onto human ProRS, so that one part of HF mimics bound proline and the other mimics the 3′ end of bound tRNA. Thus, HF is a new type of ATP-dependent inhibitor that simultaneously occupies two different substrate binding sites on ProRS. Moreover, our structure indicates a possible similar mechanism of action for febrifugine in malaria treatment. Finally, the elucidation here of a two-site modular targeting activity of HF raises the possibility that substrate-directed capture of similar inhibitors might be a general mechanism that could be applied to other synthetases."

We have now performed a genetic dissection of ligand function in the retina, where the TAM receptor Mer is required for the circadian phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells. This process is severely attenuated in Mer mutant mice, which leads to photoreceptor death. We find that retinal deletion of either Gas6 or Protein S alone yields retinae with a normal number of photoreceptors. However, concerted deletion of both ligands fully reproduces the photoreceptor death seen in Mer mutants. These results demonstrate that Protein S and Gas6 function as independent, bona fide Mer ligands, and are, to a first approximation, interchangeable with respect to Mer-driven phagocytosis in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2168121286,"In Drosophila, most individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) project bilaterally to both sides of the brain. Having bilateral rather than unilateral projections may represent a useful redundancy. However, bilateral ORN projections to the brain should also compromise the ability to lateralize odours. Nevertheless, walking or flying Drosophila reportedly turn towards the antenna that is more strongly stimulated by odour. Here we show that each ORN spike releases approximately 40% more neurotransmitter from the axon branch ipsilateral to the soma than from the contralateral branch. As a result, when an odour activates the antennae asymmetrically, ipsilateral central neurons begin to spike a few milliseconds before contralateral neurons, and at a 30 to 50% higher rate than contralateral neurons. We show that a walking fly can detect a 5% asymmetry in total ORN input to its left and right antennal lobes, and can turn towards the odour in less time than it requires the fly to complete a stride. These results demonstrate that neurotransmitter release properties can be tuned independently at output synapses formed by a single axon onto two target cells with identical functions and morphologies. Our data also show that small differences in spike timing and spike rate can produce reliable differences in olfactory behaviour."

We report here that the mother centriole of neurons migrating tangentially from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) assembles a short primary cilium and exposes this cilium to the cell surface by docking to the plasma membrane in the leading process. Primary cilia are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is also required for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal transduction in vertebrates. We show that Shh pathway perturbations influenced the leading process morphology and dynamics of MGE cells. Whereas Shh favored the exit of MGE cells away from their tangential migratory paths in the developing cortex, cyclopamine or invalidation of IFT genes maintained MGE cells in the tangential paths. Our findings show that signals transmitted through the primary cilium promote the escape of future GABAergic interneurons from their tangential routes to colonize the cortical plate."

We used a multi-step siRNA-based screening strategy to identify regulators of the first step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at the plasma membrane. A primary genome-wide screen identified 334 hits that caused accumulation of CCV cargo on the cell surface. A secondary screen identified 92 hits that inhibited cargo uptake and/or altered the morphology of clathrin-coated structures. The hits include components of four functional complexes: coat proteins, V-ATPase subunits, spliceosome-associated proteins and acetyltransferase subunits. Electron microscopy revealed that V-ATPase depletion caused the cell to form aberrant non-constricted clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. The V-ATPase-knockdown phenotype was rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol, indicating that the knockdown blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by preventing cholesterol from recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. Robinson and colleagues perform a human-genome-wide siRNA screen to identify regulators of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. The knockdown phenotype of one of their hits, V-ATPase, is rescued by exogenous cholesterol, revealing an intriguing link between cholesterol and clathrin-coated vesicle formation."

Here, we report a close correspondence between the preferred direction (PD) and the morphology of DS cells in the optic tectum. Ca(2+) imaging in cells expressing the genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator GCaMP3 and multiphoton-targeted patch-clamp recordings allowed us to compare structure and function in single neurons. The arbors of differently tuned cell types showed stereotypic differences in shape and laminar profile within the tectal neuropil. Excitatory synaptic inputs were directionally tuned and matched the PD of spike output in these cells, while inhibitory inputs were selective for nonpreferred directions. Functional Ca(2+) imaging in afferent axons showed a matching laminar distribution of DS presynaptic activity. Hence, different directions are represented in different layers, which suggests a simple mechanism for how tectal neurons acquire directional tuning in a nascent circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2080203273,"The specification of tissue size during development involves the coordinated action of many signalling pathways responding to organ-intrinsic signals, such as morphogen gradients, and systemic cues, such as nutrient status. The conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway, which promotes both cell-cycle exit and apoptosis, is a major determinant of size control. The pathway core is a kinase cassette, comprising the kinases Hpo and Warts (Wts) and the scaffold proteins Salvador (Sav) and Mats, which inactivates the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki). We performed a split-TEV-based genome-wide RNAi screen for modulators of Hpo signalling. We characterize the Drosophila salt-inducible kinases (Sik2 and Sik3) as negative regulators of Hpo signalling. Activated Sik kinases increase Yki target expression and promote tissue overgrowth through phosphorylation of Sav at Ser 413. As Sik kinases have been implicated in nutrient sensing, this suggests a link between the Hpo pathway and systemic growth control."

Here, we discovered a mechanism regulating KCNQ2/3 transcriptional expression by neuronal activity in rodent neurons, involving activation of calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) transcription factors, orchestrated by A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)79/150. The signal requires Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels and both local and global Ca(2+) elevations. We postulate increased M-channel expression to act as a negative feedback to suppress neuronal hyperexcitability, demonstrated by profoundly upregulated KCNQ2/3 transcription in hippocampi from wild-type, but not AKAP150(-/-), mice after drug-induced seizures. Thus, we suggest a distinct role of AKAP79/150 and the complex it organizes in activity-dependent M-channel transcription, which may potentially serve throughout the nervous system to limit overexcitability associated with disease states such as epilepsy."

Here, we describe a transcriptional circuitry that dynamically converts signaling inputs into faster rates without amplifying final equilibrium levels. Using time-lapse microscopy, we find that transcriptional activators accelerate human cytomegalovirus (CMV) gene expression in single cells without amplifying steady-state expression levels, and this acceleration generates a significant replication advantage. We map the accelerator to a highly self-cooperative transcriptional negative-feedback loop (Hill coefficient ∼7) generated by homomultimerization of the virus's essential transactivator protein IE2 at nuclear PML bodies. Eliminating the IE2-accelerator circuit reduces transcriptional strength through mislocalization of incoming viral genomes away from PML bodies and carries a heavy fitness cost. In general, accelerators may provide a mechanism for signal-transduction circuits to respond quickly to external signals without increasing steady-state levels of potentially cytotoxic molecules."

Current gain-field models assume that the modulation of visual responses by eye position is accurate at all times, even around the time of a saccade. Here, we show that for at least 150 ms after a saccade, gain fields in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are unreliable. The majority of LIP cells with steady-state gain fields reflect the presaccadic eye position. The remainder of the cells have responses that cannot be predicted by their steady-state gain fields. Nonetheless, a monkey's oculomotor performance is accurate during this time.

The demographic histories of the M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Female A. gambiae have an extremely high preference for feeding on human hosts. The problems of drug resistance to established drugs and the emergence of resistance to artemisinin-based therapies (2Dondorp A.M. Nosten F. Yi P. Das D. Phyo A.P. Tarning J. Lwin K.M. Ariey F. Hanpithakpong W. Lee S.J. Ringwald P. Silamut K. Imwong M. Chotivanich K. Lim P. Herdman T. An S.S. Yeung S. Singhasivanon P. Day N.P. Lindegardh N. Socheat D. White N.J. Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.New Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar), combined with the limited efficacy of vaccines (3RTSS Clinical Trials PartnershipA phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in African infants.New Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 2284-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), suggest that approaches that reduce the contact between mosquitoes and their human host will remain as important approaches in combating the transmission of malaria (4Trape J.F. Rogier C. Combating malaria morbidity and mortality by reducing transmission.Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The selectivity of the female mosquito for human hosts is guided by olfactory responses to odor molecules that emanate from human skin and sweat (5Hallem E.A. Nicole Fox A. Zwiebel L.J. Carlson J.R. Olfaction: mosquito receptor for human-sweat odorant.Nature. 2004; 427: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Individuals vary in their intrinsic attractiveness to mosquitoes (6Mukabana W.R. Takken W. Coe R. Knols B.G. Host-specific cues cause differential attractiveness of Kenyan men to the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.Malaria J. 2002; 1: 17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Knols B.G. de Jong R. Takken W. Differential attractiveness of isolated humans to mosquitoes in Tanzania.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 89: 604-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and one of the main reasons for this may be the differences in the composition of human sweat (8Skinner W.A. Tong H. Pearson T. Strauss W. Maibach H. Human sweat components attractive to mosquitoes.Nature. 1965; 207: 661-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Several compounds have been identified in human sweat which may contribute to the avoidance of certain people by mosquitoes (9Logan J.G. Birkett M.A. Clark S.J. Powers S. Seal N.J. Wadhams L.J.

Ecol. 2008; 34: 308-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One of these compounds, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MH), 2The abbreviations used are: 6-MH6-methyl-5-hepten-2-oneBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneDEETN,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamideHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence1-NPNN-phenyl-1-naphthylamine1,8-ANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acidOBPodorant-binding proteinPDBProtein Data Bank. has been shown to repel mosquitoes in arm-in-cage testing (10Logan J.G.

Arm-in-cage testing of natural human-derived mosquito repellents.Malaria J. 2010; 9: 239Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is also used in many plant-based or natural repellents (11Maia M.F. Moore S.J. Plant-based insect repellents: a review of their efficacy, development and testing.Malaria J. 2011; 10: S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide heteronuclear single quantum coherence N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid odorant-binding protein Protein Data Bank. The perception of odorants in insects occurs predominantly in the olfactory sensilla. Within these specialized structures, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), expressed by specialized support cells, are secreted into the lymph fluid that surrounds the olfactory dendrites (12Vogt R.G. Biochemical diversity of odor detection: OBPs, ODEs and SNMPs.in: Blomquist G.J. Vogt R.G. Insect Pheromone Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier, London2003: 391-446Google Scholar). These OBPs are present in high concentrations (millimolar) (13Vogt R.G. Köhne A.C. Dubnau J.T. Prestwich G.D. Expression of pheromone binding proteins during antennal development in the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar.J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3332-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are one of the first components of the olfactory system to come into contact with airborne odorants and repellents. OBPs are proposed to have multiple roles including protection of odorants from odorant-degrading enzymes, and transporting hydrophobic odor molecules through the lymph fluid to membrane-bound odorant receptors. There is evidence that OBPs function as passive carriers (14Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J.

Smith D.P. Activation of the T1 neuronal circuit is necessary and sufficient to induce sexually dimorphic mating behavior in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Disruption of the normal olfactory responses to odor molecules that control mosquito behavior provides a means to reduce human-mosquito interactions; a primary method for achieving this is the use of repellents. N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is considered the most broad spectrum and effective insect repellent available (22Katz T.M. Miller J.H. Hebert A.A. Insect repellents: historical perspectives and new developments.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2008; 58: 865-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although effective, DEET is also known to be toxic (23Briassoulis G. Narlioglou M. Hatzis T. Toxic encephalopathy associated with use of DEET insect repellents: a case analysis of its toxicity in children.Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 2001; 20: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), to have reduced efficacy with time after application, and to be ineffective against species that develop resistance (24Rutledge L.C. Moussa M.A. Lowe C.A. Sofield R.K. Comparative sensitivity of mosquito species and strains to the repellent diethyl toluamide.J. Med. Entomol. 1978; 14: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The need for a new, more effective, and less toxic repellent is evident, and to develop a new repellent the mechanism of their action must first be elucidated. Despite its widespread use, the mechanism of action and molecular targets of DEET are still the subject of some debate. It has been shown that DEET blocks electrophysiological responses of olfactory sensory neurons to odors in A. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster (25Ditzen M. Pellegrino M. Vosshall L.B. Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET.Science. 2008; 319: 1838-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that DEET can prevent normal interactions of odorants with the olfactory receptor to block host odor recognition, although the exact mechanism that underlies this is not clear (26Pellegrino M. Steinbach N. Stensmyr M.C. Hansson B.S. Vosshall L.B. A natural polymorphism alters odour and DEET sensitivity in an insect odorant receptor.Nature. 2011; 478: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that DEET functions to activate olfactory neurons that elicit avoidance behavior (27Syed Z. Leal W.S. Mosquitoes smell and avoid the insect repellent DEET.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13598-13603Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided evidence that DEET can also interact directly with OBPs, including OBP1 (28Tsitsanou K.E. Thireou T. Drakou C.E. Koussis K. Keramioti M.V. Leonidas D.D. Eliopoulos E. Iatrou K. Zographos S.E. Anopheles gambiae odorant-binding protein crystal complex with the synthetic repellent DEET: implications for structure-based design of novel mosquito repellents.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous work has established that OBP1 is required for olfactory responses to indole and 3-methyl-indole, which are major components of incubated human sweat (29Biessmann H. Andronopoulou E. Biessmann M.R. Douris V. Dimitratos S.D. Eliopoulos E. Guerin P.M. Iatrou K. Justice R.W. Kröber T. Marinotti O. Tsitoura P. Woods D.F. Walter M.F. The Anopheles gambiae odorant-binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1) mediates indole recognition in the antennae of female mosquitoes.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9471Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and that the formation of a heterodimeric interaction between OBP1 and 4, which co-localizes with OBP1, may be important for the increased binding affinity of odorants (30Qiao H. He X. Schymura D. Ban L. Field L. Dani F.R. Michelucci E. Caputo B. della Torre A. Iatrou K. Zhou J.J. Krieger J. Pelosi P. Cooperative interactions between odorant-binding proteins of Anopheles gambiae.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the heterodimeric interaction between OBP1 and 4 requires indole (31Davrazou F. Dong E. Murphy E.J. Johnson H.T. Jones D.N. New insights into the mechanism of odorant detection by the malaria-transmitting mosquito Anopheles gambiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34175-34183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, DEET acting on OBPs to disrupt the interactions that they make with other OBPs or other components of the olfactory system could disrupt downstream activation of odorant receptors. Here, we present the crystal structure of OBP1 bound to 6-MH, which reveals that this natural repellent binds at the same site as DEET. We use NMR spectroscopy to show that OBP1 does not interact with OBP4 in the presence of 6-MH or DEET and that addition of 6-MH to the OBP1-indole-OBP4 complex disrupts this interaction. We propose that repellents such as DEET and 6-MH may function to prevent OBP heterodimerization and so inhibit odor recognition. Our results suggest evidence for a complex interplay between OBPs and their ligands and that attraction and repulsion may be controlled by conformational changes in OBPs and the interactions that they facilitate. OBP1 and 4 were expressed and purified as described previously (32Kruse S.W. Zhao R. Smith D.P. Jones D.N.

For NMR experiments, proteins were isotopically labeled by expression in minimal media containing 15N-labeled ammonium chloride (99 atom %). Samples for NMR were made in 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.4 containing 10% D2O. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer. 15N T1 and T2 relaxation measurements were acquired using the standard pulse sequences supplied by the manufacturer. For these measurements the T1 relaxation delay time was varied between 10 and 1300 ms, and T2 relaxation times between 10 and 210 ms with a recycle delay of 3.5 s between each scan. Values of the individual relaxation time constants for each residue were obtained by fitting the intensities of each peak as a function of the delay time to a standard exponential decay in CcpNmr Analysis 2.2.2 (34Fogh R.

The CCPN data model for NMR spectroscopy: development of a software pipeline.Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). The overall correlation time was then calculated from the average T1/T2 ratio of those residues in ordered regions of secondary structure, according to Equation 1, where νN is the NMR frequency of the 15N nucleus in hertz. The resulting value was then compared with established correlation times for well characterized monomeric globular proteins of varying molecular mass (36Rossi P. Swapna G.V. Huang Y.J. Aramini J.M.

NMR. 2010; 46: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequently for the OBP1-DEET complex, an estimate of the correlation time was obtained from a fit of global T1 and T2 relaxation times using one-dimensional versions of the 15N relaxation experiments as described previously (37Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Backbone dynamics of a free and phosphopeptide-complexed Src homology 2 domain studied by 15N NMR relaxation.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) by fitting the integrated signal intensity from backbone amides in the amide 1H region as a function of delay time to an exponential decay. Each experiment was repeated three times. τc≈14πνN6T1T2−7(Eq. 1) OBP1 crystals were grown in 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8.78, 31% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 at 4 °C. Both the protein and well solution were saturated with 6-MH prior to crystallization. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Molecular Biology Consortium Beamline 4.2.2 (wavelength = 1.0 Å) at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. Data sets for OBP1 were processed using d*Trek (38Pflugrath J.W. The finer things in x-ray diffraction data collection.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement starting from the published structure of OBP1 (PDB 2ERB) using Phaser (39McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar) and refined using Refmac5 (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13864) Google Scholar) followed by manual rebuilding in COOT (42Emsley P. Cowtan K. COOT: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23318) Google Scholar). To measure the affinity of the fluorescent probes, 1-NPN and 1,8-ANS, protein solutions of between 0.1 and 1.0 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, were titrated with the probe (1 mm in methanol) to final concentrations of ≈ 16 μm (1-NPN) and ≈ 60 μm (1,8-ANS). Emission fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C in a 1-cm path length cuvette. For 1-NPN an excitation wavelength of 337 nm was used, and emission spectra were recorded between 380 and 600 nm, for 1,8-ANS the excitation wavelength used was 380 nm, and spectra were recorded between 400 and 600 nm. Emission was recorded at 1-nm intervals with an integration time of 0.5 s and slit widths of 5 nm for both probes. To determine the KD for probe binding, the fluorescence intensity (cps) at the emission maxima (408 nm for OBP1–1-NPN, 402 nm for OBP4–1-NPN, and 456 nm for both OBP1–1,8-ANS and OBP4–1,8-ANS) was plotted against the total concentration of probe and the resulting curves were fit using Equation 2. This is an explicit solution to the binding equation and accounts for ligand depletion where free ligand cannot be equated to total ligand concentration (43Swillens S. Interpretation of binding curves obtained with high receptor concentrations: practical aid for computer analysis.Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). In this equation Fmax is the maximum emission intensity of the bound reporter, the term A gives the concentration of the bound protein, P is the total protein concentration, L is the total probe concentration, and I is the concentration of any competitor. Equation 2 includes a correction for the fluorescence from excess free probe, Flig, which is the maximum emission intensity of the free probe at the emission wavelength of the bound state of the probe. This was determined by titration of probe into binding buffer and is in units of cps per μm of free probe. We assumed that the protein is 100% active and that the protein:probe stoichiometry is 1:1. This assumption is based on crystal structures of other OPBs that show a single molecule of 1-NPN (44Spinelli S. Lagarde A. Iovinella I. Legrand P. Tegoni M. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Crystal structure of Apis mellifera OBP14, a C-minus odorant-binding protein, and its complexes with odorant molecules.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 42: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and 1,8-ANS (45Lartigue A. Gruez A. Spinelli S. Rivière S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. The crystal structure of a cockroach pheromone-binding protein suggests a new ligand binding and release mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30213-30218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) bound to these proteins. Under these assumptions, the term A also represents the concentration of bound ligand. For experiments performed in the absence of any competitor, Kapp simplifies to KD for the ligand. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the values reported are the mean ± S.D. Ki values for ligands were determined in two ways. To confirm that binding of ligands is competitive for binding of probe, assays were performed by titrating the fluorescent probe into protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of ligand. OBPs were incubated with ligand competitor at 25 °C for 30 min prior to probe titration. If binding was directly competitive, binding data were simultaneously fit for all concentrations of the competing ligand to Equation 2, where KD and Ki were shared across each individual data set (Equations 3 and 4). Alternatively, fluorescent probe displacement assays were carried out by titrating ligand into samples of the protein-probe complex. For 1-NPN displacement assays OBPs (1 μm OBP1 or 0.5 μm OBP4) were incubated with equimolar 1-NPN for 30 min at 25 °C. Ligands (10 mm in methanol) were titrated in to final concentrations of ∼150 μm and the change in fluorescence intensity recorded. EC50 values were calculated by fitting plots of fluorescence intensity at the emission wavelength of the bound probe as a function of ligand concentration to a one-site binding model using GraphPad Prism, version 5.0a. The Cheng-Prusoff correction (Equation 5) was used to convert EC50 to Ki. 1,8-ANS displacement assays were carried out in the same way using 5 μm protein and 20 μm 1,8-ANS. All binding experiments were repeated three times and the values reported are the mean ± S.D. F=FmaxAp+Flig(L−A)(Eq. 2) where A=(Kapp+L+P)−(Kapp+L+P)2−4PL2(Eq. 3) and Kapp=KD(1+[I]Ki)(Eq. 4) Ki=EC50/(1+LKL)(Eq. 5) The crystal structure of the OBP1–6-MH complex (PDB 4FQT) was solved to a 2.2 Å resolution (Fig. 1 and Table 1) with final values of Rwork and Rfree of 18.4 and 23.8%, respectively. As described previously (46Wogulis M. Morgan T. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wilson D.K. The crystal structure of an odorant-binding protein from Anopheles gambiae: evidence for a common ligand release mechanism.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) the overall fold of OBP1 is similar to that of other OBPs with six α-helices connected with three disulfide bridges. The crystal contains two protein molecules per asymmetric unit with a dimeric interface being formed across the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis that buries ∼1200 Å2 of surface area. The OBP1–6-MH complex resembles both the previous structure of OBP1 bound to PEG (PDB 2ERB) (46Wogulis M. Morgan T. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wilson D.K.

Eliopoulos E. Iatrou K. Zographos S.E.

Life Sci. 2012; 69: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with root mean square deviations of the backbone atoms of 0.41 Å and 0.43 Å (OBP1-PEG and OBP1-DEET, respectively). In the original structure of OBP1 bound to PEG (2ERB), there was continuous electron density that defined the location of a single PEG molecule that crosses between the two monomers of the asymmetric unit in what has been described as a hydrophobic tunnel (46Wogulis M. Morgan T. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wilson D.K. The crystal structure of an odorant-binding protein from Anopheles gambiae: evidence for a common ligand release mechanism.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the structure described here, the electron density is not continuous but shows distinctive breaks in the region of the tunnel at the interface between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. An Fo − Fc omit map clearly shows two areas of unconnected flattened density which can be modeled as 6-MH. Even in the structures refined in the presence of 6-MH, there is no indication of any additional density between the density defining the 6-MH and the adjacent PEG molecule (see below). In further support of this structure, we also obtained multiple crystals of OBP1 in the absence of 6-MH and in these cases the electron density in the “tunnel” is continuous, consistent with the presence of PEG binding (data not shown) as observed in the original structure of OBP1 (46Wogulis M. Morgan T. Ishida Y. Leal W.S. Wilson D.K. The crystal structure of an odorant-binding protein from Anopheles gambiae: evidence for a common ligand release mechanism.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This gives further confidence that the density we observe in the present structure originates from 6-MH.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement)Crystal parametersOBP1–6-MH (PDB ID 4FQT)Space groupP1 21 1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)32.77, 68.99, 64.52α, β, γ (°)90.0, 104.71, 90.0Data collectionResolution (Å)31.70–2.20 (2.3699–2.2001)Rmerge0.095 (0.310)I/σI7.41 (3.17)Completeness (%)99.17 (98.51)Redundancy3.50 (3.19)Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)2.20No. reflections14,068 (1,450)Rwork (%)/Rfree (%)18.51/23.89 (31.22/37.31)No. atomsProtein4,370Ligand/ion45Water170Average B-factor (Å2)32.3Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.010Bond angles (°)1.419 Open table in a new tab One 6-MH"
https://openalex.org/W2045868762,"Viral Fusion Effectors Viral fusogens are anchored in the viral membrane, and the initial fusogenic conformational change allows them to insert into the cell membrane. This transition is triggered by interactions of the virus particle with the host cell—either binding a cell surface receptor or protons in the acidic endosomal environment. During the fusogenic conformational change, the fusion protein initially adopts an intermediate extended conformation in which a “fusion peptide” projects away from the virus particle and inserts into the target membrane. The fusion protein subsequently collapses into a “hairpin” conformation in which the fusion peptide becomes juxtaposed to the viral transmembrane (TM) segment, thereby juxtaposing the two membranes. The structures of the postfusion hairpin conformation for a number of viruses are presented, highlighting common structural features of the observed hairpins. The overall process of virus-cell fusion and the accompanying conformational changes of the effector proteins have been reviewed, see for example Harrison (2008). The viral fusion proteins analyzed so far fall into three structural classes in which the postfusion form is a trimer of hairpins with different architectures. The predicted location of the fused membrane is outlined above the trimers. The class I motif is characterized by a 7 residue periodicity of nonpolar amino acids (i.e.,“heptad repeats”) that give rise to a central parallel trimeric a-helical coiled coil along the long axis of a rod-shaped molecule (blue in the ribbon diagrams). The N and C termini (labeled in blue and cyan) pack against each other at the membrane proximal end. A “stutter,” a region where the coiled helix unwinds and alters the nonpolar repeat pattern (in red), permits the structural alignment of the various hairpin trimers (Igonet et al., 2011). The heptad repeats are also interrupted by hydrophilic layers (indicated in magenta, with horizontal arrows). Class II proteins are folded essentially as b sheets with no long coiled a helix, and the trimer of hairpins is formed by the parallel interactions of domains I and II (red and yellow). The trimer is further clamped in place by the lateral interactions of domain III (in blue), which stabilizes the hairpin conformation. A stem region (only partially present in the available structures) connects to the TM segment. The fusion peptide is internal, situated in the loop between two b strands, and is therefore termed “fusion loop” (FL). Class III proteins appear to be intermediate between classes I and II: they have a central parallel coiled coil (blue), but they have an elongated, b-sheet-rich fusion domain N terminal to it (yellow) instead of a fusion peptide as in class I. Although this fusion domain is superficially similar to its counterpart in class II proteins, the topological b-strand organization is unrelated, suggesting convergent rather than divergent evolution. The central parallel coiled coil also has a stutter, allowing a close alignment to the class I fusion proteins. The fusion domain of class III proteins has two fusion loops labeled FL1 and FL2. Although there is no amino acid sequence conservation across virus families, the structures show clear homology within classes II and III. However, the simple heptad repeat pattern of class I fusogens is in several cases not sufficient to distinguish between divergent or convergent evolution and therefore, only for a subset of families displayed in the figure do the fusion proteins appear as clearly homologous. Fusion of Intracellular Vesicles A variety of different proteins control the fusion of intracellular vesicles, but the actual fusion effectors are believed to be the SNARE proteins, as reviewed by Sudhof and Rothman (2009). The prefusion form of the SNAREs appears to be largely unstructured, and the postfusion form consists of a hetero-oligomeric complex formed by SNARE subunits that were anchored in the two opposing membranes before their fusion. The SNAREs in their postfusion conformation share with viral proteins of classes I and III an elongated, a-helical, parallel oligomeric coiled-coil organization in which the C-terminal TM segments are juxtaposed at the same end, making a stable protein rod termed “SNAREpin” by analogy to the viral hairpin. The SNAREpin organization differs from the viral proteins because it is a four-stranded coiled coil in which the amino acid sequence of each a helix is different. At the center, there is a hydrophilic, or “ionic,” layer consisting of a central arginine (R) and three glutamine (Q) residues that hydrogen bond the guanidinium group of the arginine. This feature has allowed the classification of the SNAREs into four different categories—R-SNAREs and Qa-, Qb-, and Qc-SNAREs—with one representative of each being necessary for formation of a functional SNAREpin, as displayed in the figure."
