https://openalex.org/W1986919258,Several triterpenes and the tetraterpene perhydro-beta-carotene have been identified in the branched-cyclic hydrocarbon fraction of this Eocene shale. The analytical procedure included thiourea adduction followed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.
https://openalex.org/W2081181444,"Induction of three drug-metabolizing enzymes occurred in liver microsomes of mice and rats kept on softwood bedding of either red cedar, white pine, or ponderosa pine. This induction was reversed when animals were placed on hardwood bedding composed of a mixture of beech, birch, and maple. Differences in the capacity of various beddings to induce may partially explain divergent results of studies on drug-metabolizing enzymes. The presence of such inducing substances in the environment may influence the pharmacologic responsiveness of animals to a wide variety of drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1976503652,"Algal stromatolites are used for detailed rock-stratigraphic correlation for a distance of 160 kilometers in the Pethei Formation, of Aphebian (Precambrian) age, in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Laterally linked stromatolites are initiated by the draping of successive laminations over intraclasts or other irregularities in the bedding surface. Stromatolite shapes and orientations are related to paleocurrent direction determined from associated sedimentary structures. Thus stromatolite geometry is at least in part environmentally controlled."

https://openalex.org/W2020258035,"Two worker ants preserved in amber of Upper Cretaceous age have been found in New Jersey. They are the first undisputed remains of social insects of Mesozoic age, extending the existence of social life in insects back to approximately 100 million years. They are also the earliest known fossils that can be assigned with certainty to aculeate Hymenoptera. The species, Sphecomyrma freyi, is considered to represent a new subfamily (Sphecomyrminae), more primitive than any previously known ant group. It forms a near-perfect link between certain nonsocial tiphiid wasps and the most primitive myrmecioid ants."
https://openalex.org/W2073052339,"Our work has shown that the apparently simple chlorination of unsaturated materials in nonpolar media is actually rather complex because of the occurrence of competitive reaction pathways, one polar and one radical. Means of recognizing, predicting, and separating the pathways have been developed, and general characteristics of each with respect to relative rates and product distributions have been elucidated. A most intriguing discovery is that of the spontaneous generation of radicals by interaction of certain unsaturates and chlorine; much more work is needed for clarifying the nature of this unexpected reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2021491790,"Fossiliferous Cambrian, Ordovician, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian rocks, never before found in southern Mexico, have been discovered in the Nochixtl√°n region. Superjacent unfossiliferous sedimentary rocks may be Permian in age. Early Paleozoic and late Paleozoic intervals of marine sedimentation were bounded by intervals of positive tectonism and erosion."

https://openalex.org/W1966202613,"Sinkholes up to 125 meters wide and 50 meters deep have developed catastrophically in thick unconsolidated debris above pinnacle-weathered dolomite after lowering of the groundwater surface by at least 160 meters. They are caused by shrinkage of desiccated debris, downward migration of debris into bedrock openings, and upward growth of multiple debris ""caverns"" by roof spalling."

https://openalex.org/W2000575787,"Pebbles of pisolitic bauxite occur in Pleistocene drift on Martha's Vineyard. The bauxite contains plant remains and relict quartz and was derived from plant-bearing sediments, probably from the preglacial coastal plain of New England. The preservation of plant tissue suggests that bauxitization took place beneath, rather than above, the water table, as generally believed. This occurrence of bauxite is the northernmost known in eastern North America and suggests the possible existence of undiscovered deposits in the northern coastal plain."
