https://openalex.org/W3006468674,"Memory consolidation is thought to depend on the reactivation of waking hippocampal firing patterns during sleep. Following goal learning, the reactivation of place cell firing can represent goals and predicts subsequent memory recall. However, it is unclear whether reactivation promotes the recall of the reactivated memories only or triggers wider reorganization. We trained animals to locate goals at fixed locations in two different environments. Following learning, by performing online assembly content decoding, the reactivation of only one environment was disrupted, leading to recall deficit in that environment. The place map of the disrupted environment was destabilized but re-emerged once the goal was relearned. These data demonstrate that sleep reactivation facilitates goal-memory retrieval by strengthening memories that enable the selection of context-specific hippocampal maps. However, sleep reactivation may not be needed for the stabilization of place maps considering that the map of the disrupted environment re-emerged after the retraining of goals."

https://openalex.org/W3008043783,"Purpose We hypothesize that MRI-based renal compartment volumes, particularly renal sinus fat as locally and potentially independently acting perivascular fat tissue, increase with glucose intolerance. We therefore analyze the distribution of renal volumes in individuals with normal glucose levels and prediabetic and diabetic individuals and investigate potential associations with other typical cardiometabolic biomarkers. Material and methods The sample comprised N = 366 participants who were either normoglycemic (N = 230), had prediabetes (N = 87) or diabetes (N = 49), as determined by Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. Other covariates were obtained by standardized measurements and interviews. Whole-body MR measurements were performed on a 3 Tesla scanner. For assessment of the kidneys, a coronal T1w dual-echo Dixon and a coronal T2w single shot fast spin echo sequence were employed. Stepwise semi-automated segmentation of the kidneys on the Dixon-sequences was based on thresholding and geometric assumptions generating volumes for the kidneys and sinus fat. Inter- and intra-reader variability were determined on a subset of 40 subjects. Associations between glycemic status and renal volumes were evaluated by linear regression models, adjusted for other potential confounding variables. Furthermore, the association of renal volumes with visceral adipose tissue was assessed by linear regression models and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results Renal volume, renal sinus volume and renal sinus fat increased gradually from normoglycemic controls to individuals with prediabetes to individuals with diabetes (renal volume: 280.3±64.7 ml vs 303.7±67.4 ml vs 320.6±77.7ml, respectively, p < 0.001). After adjustment for age and sex, prediabetes and diabetes were significantly associated to increased renal volume, sinus volume (e.g. βPrediabetes = 10.1, 95% CI: [6.5, 13.7]; p<0.01, βDiabetes = 11.86, 95% CI: [7.2, 16.5]; p<0.01) and sinus fat (e.g. βPrediabetes = 7.13, 95% CI: [4.5, 9.8]; p<0.001, βDiabetes = 7.34, 95% CI: [4.0, 10.7]; p<0.001). Associations attenuated after adjustment for additional confounders were only significant for prediabetes and sinus volume (ß = 4.0 95% CI [0.4, 7.6]; p<0.05). Hypertension was significantly associated with increased sinus volume (β = 3.7, 95% CI: [0.4, 7.0; p<0.05]) and absolute sinus fat volume (β = 3.0, 95% CI: [0.7, 5.3]; p<0.05). GFR and all renal volumes were significantly associated as well as urine creatinine levels and renal sinus volume (β = 1.6, 95% CI: [0.1, 2.9]; p<0.05). Conclusion Renal volume and particularly renal sinus fat volume already increases significantly in prediabetic subjects and is significantly associated with VAT. This shows, that renal sinus fat is a perivascular adipose tissue, which early undergoes changes in the development of metabolic disease. Our findings underpin that renal sinus fat is a link between metabolic disease and associated chronic kidney disease, making it a potential imaging biomarker when assessing perivascular adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3008273378,"The plasma protein fetuin-A mediates the formation of protein-mineral colloids known as calciprotein particles (CPP)-rapid clearance of these CPP by the reticuloendothelial system prevents errant mineral precipitation and therefore pathological mineralization (calcification). The mutant mouse strain D2,Ahsg-/- combines fetuin-A deficiency with the calcification-prone DBA/2 genetic background, having a particularly severe compound phenotype of microvascular and soft tissue calcification. Here we studied mechanisms leading to soft tissue calcification, organ damage and death in these mice. We analyzed mice longitudinally by echocardiography, X-ray-computed tomography, analytical electron microscopy, histology, mass spectrometry proteomics, and genome-wide microarray-based expression analyses of D2 wildtype and Ahsg-/- mice. Fetuin-A-deficient mice had calcified lesions in myocardium, lung, brown adipose tissue, reproductive organs, spleen, pancreas, kidney and the skin, associated with reduced growth, cardiac output and premature death. Importantly, early-stage calcified lesions presented in the lumen of the microvasculature suggesting precipitation of mineral containing complexes from the fluid phase of blood. Genome-wide expression analysis of calcified lesions and surrounding (not calcified) tissue, together with morphological observations, indicated that the calcification was not associated with osteochondrogenic cell differentiation, but rather with thrombosis and fibrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that soft tissue calcification can start by intravascular mineral deposition causing microvasculopathy, which impacts on growth, organ function and survival. Our study underscores the importance of fetuin-A and related systemic regulators of calcified matrix metabolism to prevent cardiovascular disease, especially in dysregulated mineral homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3007213074,"Introduction Previous studies of fetal effects have suggested that intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of adverse neonatal outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and stillbirth. The objective was to compare the neonatal and maternal consequences in pregnancies affected by intrahepatic cholestasis and normal pregnancies. Material and methods This case-control study compares pregnancies affected by intrahepatic cholestasis (pruritus and bile acid ≥ 10 μmol/L) with low-risk pregnancies managed between December 2006 and December 2014 at a French university hospital center. Results There were 83 (59.3%) cases of mild cholestasis (10≤ BA ≤39 μmol/L), 46 (32.8%) of moderate cholestasis (40≤ BA ≤99 μmol/L), and 11 (7.9%) of severe cholestasis (BA ≥100 μmol/L). No in utero fetal deaths occurred in the 140 women with cholestasis or the 560 controls analyzed. The rate of respiratory distress syndrome was higher in neonates of women with intrahepatic cholestasis (17.1% vs. 4.6%, P<0.001; crude OR 4.46 (CI95% 2.49–8.03)). This risk was also significant after adjustment for gestational age at birth and mode of delivery, adjusted OR 2.56 (CI95%1.26–5.18). The postpartum hemorrhage rate was twice as high among the case mothers (25% versus 14.1% for controls, P = 0.002). Conclusion After adjustment on the confounding factors we found a higher rate of respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal morbidity among neonates of the cholestasis group."
https://openalex.org/W3007016063,"Alcohol consumption is regarded as one of the leading risk factors for secondary osteopenia. Coupled angiogenesis and osteogenesis via distinct type-H vessels orchestrates subtle biological processes of bone homeostasis. The dysfunction of angiogenesis and osteogenesis contributes to decreased bone mass during the development of osteopenia. Herein, we identified microRNA-136-3p was remarkedly downregulated in the mouse model of alcohol-induced osteopenia. Following the alcohol administration, downregulated microRNA-136-3p significantly suppressed vascularization and osteogenic differentiation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), respectively. Furthermore, microRNA-136-3p could target phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in both HUVECs and BMSCs, thus substantially modulating the capacity of vessel formation and osteogenic differentiation. In the mouse model, microRNA-136-3p Agomir ameliorated alcohol-induced osteopenia, with the concomitant restoration of bone mass and type-H vessel formation. For the first time, this study demonstrated the pivotal role of microRNA-136-3p/PTEN axis in regulations of vascularization and bone formation, which might become the potential therapeutic target of alcohol-induced bone loss."

https://openalex.org/W3006982954,"Introduction The decision-making process for malaria control and elimination strategies has become more challenging. Interventions need to be targeted at council level to allow for changing malaria epidemiology and an increase in the number of possible interventions. Models of malaria dynamics can support this process by simulating potential impacts of multiple interventions in different settings and determining appropriate packages of interventions for meeting specific expected targets. Methods The OpenMalaria model of malaria dynamics was calibrated for all 184 councils in mainland Tanzania using data from malaria indicator surveys, school parasitaemia surveys, entomological surveillance, and vector control deployment data. The simulations were run for different transmission intensities per region and five interventions, currently or potentially included in the National Malaria Strategic Plan, individually and in combination. The simulated prevalences were fitted to council specific prevalences derived from geostatistical models to obtain council specific predictions of the prevalence and number of cases between 2017 and 2020. The predictions were used to evaluate in silico the feasibility of the national target of reaching a prevalence of below 1% by 2020, and to suggest alternative intervention stratifications for the country. Results The historical prevalence trend was fitted for each council with an agreement of 87% in 2016 (95%CI: 0.84–0.90) and an agreement of 90% for the historical trend (2003–2016) (95%CI: 0.87–0.93) The current national malaria strategy was expected to reduce the malaria prevalence between 2016 and 2020 on average by 23.8% (95% CI: 19.7%-27.9%) if current case management levels were maintained, and by 52.1% (95% CI: 48.8%-55.3%) if the case management were improved. Insecticide treated nets and case management were the most cost-effective interventions, expected to reduce the prevalence by 25.0% (95% CI: 19.7%-30.2) and to avert 37 million cases between 2017 and 2020. Mass drug administration was included in most councils in the stratification selected for meeting the national target at minimal costs, expected to reduce the prevalence by 77.5% (95%CI: 70.5%-84.5%) and to avert 102 million cases, with almost twice higher costs than those of the current national strategy. In summary, the model suggested that current interventions are not sufficient to reach the national aim of a prevalence of less than 1% by 2020 and a revised strategic plan needs to consider additional, more effective interventions, especially in high transmission areas and that the targets need to be revisited. Conclusion The methodology reported here is based on intensive interactions with the NMCP and provides a helpful tool for assessing the feasibility of country specific targets and for determining which intervention stratifications at sub-national level will have most impact. This country-led application could support strategic planning of malaria control in many other malaria endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W3007302105,"Kinesin is a molecular motor that moves along microtubules. Kinesin family member 9 (KIF9) is evolutionarily conserved and expressed strongly in mouse testis. In the unicellular flagellate Chlamydomonas, KLP1 (ortholog of KIF9) is localized to the central pair microtubules of the axoneme and regulates flagellar motility. In contrast, the function of KIF9 remains unclear in mammals. Here, we mutated KIF9 in mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Kif9 mutated mice exhibit impaired sperm motility and subfertility. Further analysis reveals that the flagella lacking KIF9 showed an asymmetric waveform pattern, which leads to a circular motion of spermatozoa. In spermatozoa that lack the central pair protein HYDIN, KIF9 was not detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. These results suggest that KIF9 is associated with the central pair microtubules and regulates flagellar motility in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3007832669,"Population genetics focuses on the analysis of genetic differences within and between-group of individuals and the inference of the populations' structure. These analyses are usually carried out using Bayesian clustering or maximum likelihood estimation algorithms that assign individuals to a given population depending on specific genetic patterns. Although several tools were developed to perform population genetics analysis, their standard graphical outputs may not be sufficiently informative for users lacking interactivity and complete information. StructuRly aims to resolve this problem by offering a complete environment for population analysis. In particular, StructuRly combines the statistical power of the R language with the friendly interfaces implemented using the shiny libraries to provide a novel tool for performing population clustering, evaluating several genetic indexes, and comparing results. Moreover, graphical representations are interactive and can be easily personalized. StructuRly is available either as R package on GitHub, with detailed information for its installation and use and as shinyapps.io servers for those users who are not familiar with R and the RStudio IDE. The application has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows operative systems and can be launched as a shiny app in every web browser."
https://openalex.org/W3006844228,"Functional trait-based approaches are increasingly used for studying the processes underlying community assembly. The relative influence of different assembly rules might depend on the spatial scale of analysis, the environmental context and the type of functional traits considered. By using a functional trait-based approach, we aim to disentangle the relative role of environmental filtering and interspecific competition on the structure of European ant communities according to the spatial scale and the type of trait considered. We used a large database on ant species composition that encompasses 361 ant communities distributed across the five biogeographic regions of Europe; these communities were composed of 155 ant species, which were characterized by 6 functional traits. We then analysed the relationship between functional divergence and co-occurrence between species pairs across different spatial scales (European, biogeographic region and local) and considering different types of traits (ecological tolerance and niche traits). Three different patterns emerged: negative, positive and non-significant regression coefficients suggest that environmental filtering, competition and neutrality are at work, respectively. We found that environmental filtering is important for structuring European ant communities at large spatial scales, particularly at the scale of Europe and most biogeographic regions. Competition could play a certain role at intermediate spatial scales where temperatures are more favourable for ant productivity (i.e. the Mediterranean region), while neutrality might be especially relevant in spatially discontinuous regions (i.e. the Alpine region). We found that no ecological mechanism (environmental filtering or competition) prevails at the local scale. The type of trait is especially important when looking for different assembly rules, and multi-trait grouping works well for traits associated with environmental responses (tolerance traits), but not for traits related to resource exploitation (niche traits). The spatial scale of analysis, the environmental context and the chosen traits merit special attention in trait-based analyses of community assembly mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3007527145,Human activity recognition is an important and difficult topic to study because of the important variability between tasks repeated several times by a subject and between subjects. This work is motivated by providing time-series signal classification and a robust validation and test approaches. This study proposes to classify 60 signs from the American Sign Language based on data provided by the LeapMotion sensor by using different conventional machine learning and deep learning models including a model called DeepConvLSTM that integrates convolutional and recurrent layers with Long-Short Term Memory cells. A kinematic model of the right and left forearm/hand/fingers/thumb is proposed as well as the use of a simple data augmentation technique to improve the generalization of neural networks. DeepConvLSTM and convolutional neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy compared to other models with 91.1 (3.8) and 89.3 (4.0) % respectively compared to the recurrent neural network or multi-layer perceptron. Integrating convolutional layers in a deep learning model seems to be an appropriate solution for sign language recognition with depth sensors data.
https://openalex.org/W3008428603,"Bletilla striata is an endangered traditional Chinese medicinal plant with multiple uses and a slow regeneration rate of its germplasm resources. To evaluate the callus growth kinetics and accumulation of secondary metabolites (SMs), a callus suspension culture was proven to be a valuable approach for acquiring high yields of medicinal compounds. An effective callus suspension culture for obtaining B. striata callus growth and its SMs was achieved with the in vitro induction of calluses from B. striata seeds. The callus growth kinetics and accumulation of SMs were analyzed using a mathematical model. The resulting callus growth kinetic model revealed that the growth curves of B. striata suspension-cultured calluses were sigmoidal, indicating changes in the growth of the suspension-cultured calluses. Improved Murashige and Skoog callus growth medium was the most favorable medium for B. striata callus formation, with the highest callus growth occurring during the stationary phase of the cultivation period. Callus growth acceleration started after 7 days and thereafter gradually decreased until day 24 of the cultivation period and reached its highest at day 36 period in both the dry weight and fresh weight analyses. The coelonin concentration peaked during the exponential growth stage and decreased afterward during the stationary stage of the callus suspension culture. The maximum content of coelonin (approximately 0.3323 mg/g callus dry weight) was observed on the 18th day of the cultivation cycle, while dactylorhin A and militarine reached the highest concentrations at day 24, and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol at day 39. This investigation also laid a foundation for a multimathematical model to better describe the accumulation variation of SMs. The production of SMs showed great specificity during callus growth and development. This research provided a well-organized way to increase the accumulation and production of SMs during the scaled-up biosynthesis of calluses in B. striata callus suspension cultures."
https://openalex.org/W3007169104,"The small GTPase cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) plays essential roles in neurogenesis and brain development. Previously, using murine embryonic P19 cells as a model system, we showed that CDC42 stimulates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and thereby up-regulates transcription factors required for the formation of neural progenitor cells. However, paradoxically, although endogenous CDC42 is required for both the initial transition of undifferentiated P19 cells to neural progenitors and their ultimate terminal differentiation into neurons, ectopic CDC42 overexpression promotes only the first stage of neurogenesis (<i>i.e.</i> the formation of neuroprogenitors) and not the second phase (differentiation into neurons). Here, using both P19 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells, we resolve this paradox, demonstrating that two splice variants of CDC42, differing only in nine amino acid residues in their very C-terminal regions, play distinct roles in neurogenesis. We found that a CDC42 splice variant that has a ubiquitous tissue distribution, termed here as CDC42u, specifically drives the formation of neuroprogenitor cells, whereas a brain-specific CDC42 variant, CDC42b, is essential for promoting the transition of neuroprogenitor cells to neurons. We further show that the specific roles of CDC42u and CDC42b in neurogenesis are due to their opposing effects on mTORC1 activity. Specifically, CDC42u stimulated mTORC1 activity and thereby induced neuroprogenitor formation, whereas CDC42b worked together with activated CDC42-associated kinase (ACK) in down-regulating mTOR expression and promoting neuronal differentiation. These findings highlight the remarkable functional specificities of two highly similar CDC42 splice variants in regulating distinct stages of neurogenesis."

With an effort of 4,797 km in 725 km2 of western Gir Protected Area, India, we used polygon search based spatially explicit capture recapture framework to estimate lion density. Using vibrissae patterns and permanent body marks we identified 67 lions from 368 lion sightings. We conducted distance sampling on 35 transects with an effort of 101.5 km to estimate spatial prey density using generalized additive modeling (GAM). Subsequently, we modeled lion spatial density with prey, habitat characteristics, anthropogenic factors and distance to baiting sites. Lion density (>1-year-old lions) was estimated at 8.53 (SE 1.05) /100 km2 with lionesses having smaller movement parameter (σ = 2.55 km; SE 0.12) compared to males (σ = 5.32 km; SE 0.33). Detection corrected sex ratio (female:male lions) was 1.14 (SE 0.02). Chital (Axis axis) was the most abundant ungulate with a density of 63.29 (SE 10.14) as determined by conventional distance sampling (CDS) and 58.17 (SE 22.17)/km2 with density surface modeling (DSM), followed by sambar (Rusa unicolor) at 3.84 (SE 1.07) and 4.73 (SE 1.48)/km2 estimated by CDS and DSM respectively. Spatial lion density was best explained by proximity to baiting sites and flat valley habitat but not as much by prey density. We demonstrate a scientifically robust approach to estimate lion abundance, that due to its spatial context, can be useful for management of habitat and human-lion interface. We recommend this method for lion population assessment across their range. High lion densities in western Gir were correlated with baiting. The management practice of attracting lions for tourism can perturb natural lion densities, disrupt behavior, lion social dynamics and have detrimental effects on local prey densities."
https://openalex.org/W3007463199,"The number of biomedical sciences PhDs persisting in academic faculty careers has been declining. As one potential influence on trainees’ intention to persist, we investigate the development of scientific communication (SC) skills, hypothesizing that attitudes and behaviors regarding scientific writing, speaking, and presenting predict academic research career intention, through science identity. After adapting a social-cognitive career theoretical model of SC to include science identity and mentor practices, we conducted a longitudinal survey of 185 doctoral and postdoctoral fellows. Structural equation modeling was used to examine relationships among SC productivity, SC self-efficacy, SC outcome expectations, mentor practices in SC, science identity, and research career intention. Results confirmed the overall model and revealed additional specific pathways: SC productivity and SC outcome expectations directly predicted career intention; SC productivity and mentor practices predicted science identity through SC self-efficacy. Demographic factors did not predict intention when controlling for SC variables. Findings support a model of SC skill development as a predictor of research career intention (R2 = .32). The finding that SC language use predicts science identity has important sociolinguistic implications. The key factors in this process are actionable at the trainee, mentor, and institutional levels, suggesting potential for SC interventions to increase career persistence."

Nearly 14.8% of those screened had Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk score ≥20%, 34.6% had CVD risk not recorded. Of 663 patients registered with diabetes and/or hypertension in 05 townships, 27 (4.1%) patients made three follow-up visits after the baseline visit, of whom, CVD risk assessment, systolic blood pressure and blood sugar measurement was done in all visits in 89.0%, 100.0% and 78.0% of cases respectively. Health facility assessment showed 64% of the sanctioned posts were filled; 90% of those appointed been trained in PEN; key essential medicines for PEN were available in half of the facilities surveyed. Confidence of the health care staff in managing common NCD and perceived benefits of the project were some of the strengths.High loss to follow up, poor recording of CVD risk score, lack of essential medicines and equipments were the key challenges identified that need to be addressed before further expansion of PEN project to other townships."
https://openalex.org/W3008593853,"The transition to parenthood (TTP) is a stressful life event for most couples. Therefore, the way both partners jointly cope with stress (i.e., dyadic coping) is important for the prevention of individual adjustment problems (e.g., depression). For dyadic coping to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, efforts of both partners should be equal. However, many couples experience a decrease of equity in task division within the domestic sphere across the TTP. The current study investigates the equity of a specific skill within the ‘relationship sphere’, because similarly to a decreased equity in household and childcare, a decreased equity of dyadic coping is likely to be associated with poorer individual adjustment. We collected longitudinal self-report data on dyadic coping and depressive symptoms from 104 mixed-gender first-time parents (n = 208 individuals) from pregnancy until 40 weeks postpartum. We created an equity score for men and women that measured their perceived difference between received and provided dyadic coping. On average, women reported providing more and receiving less dyadic coping than men. While both genders agreed on this distribution, men did perceive a higher equity of dyadic coping than women. Furthermore, the decrease of equity perceived by women across TTP was not visible in men. In line with our assumptions based on the equity theory, perceived equity of dyadic coping was associated with depressive symptoms in a curvilinear manner: Decreases in women’s perceived equity in either direction (over- or underbenefit) were associated with more depressive symptoms in women and their male partners. This association was found above and beyond the beneficial effect of dyadic coping itself. This implies that not only how well partners support each other in times of stress, but also how equal both partners’ efforts are, is important for their individual adjustment across TTP."

Particular attention is focussed on the aquatic fauna that shows marked diachronic changes related to increasing aridification. This is reflected in the decreasing amount of fish remains compared to mammals and, within the fish fauna, by changes through time in the proportion of the species and by a reduction of fish size.

Here, we sought to investigate the early transcriptional programs of hypoxic ECs by using RNA-Seq of primary cultured human umbilical vein ECs exposed to progressively increasing severity and duration of hypoxia. We observed that hypoxia modulates the expression levels of approximately one-third of the EC transcriptome. Intriguingly, expression of the gene encoding the developmental transcription factor SOX7 (SRY-box transcription factor 7) rapidly and transiently increased during hypoxia. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of ECs following SOX7 depletion established its critical role in regulating hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.

The ability of cells to survive and adapt to low-oxygen conditions is one of the most ancient and complex cellular processes and a critical feature for survival of multicellular organisms.

The HIF-α–HIF-β complex binds to conserved hypoxia-response elements (consensus sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′) in promoters and enhancers of multiple genes and drives the gene expression regulating a wide range of functions including glycolytic metabolism and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 4Choudhry H. Harris A.L. Advances in hypoxia-inducible factor biology.Cell Metab. 2018; 27 (29129785): 281-29810.1016/j.cmet.2017.10.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, the presence of consensus HIF-binding sites in gene promoter regions cannot accurately predict HIF-driven transcriptional responses because they are required but not sufficient for activity (5Wenger R.H.

Endothelial cells (ECs) play important physiological roles in tissue development and disease progression, and these roles critically depend on their ability to sense and adapt to oxygen availability and generate new blood vessels. Thus, understanding the hypoxic controls of ECs and mechanisms of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is important for emerging therapeutics such as specific HIF-2α inhibitors for renal cancer (6Chen W.

Earlier studies uncovered hypoxic transcriptional programs related to glycolysis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 8Dengler V.L. Galbraith M. Espinosa J.M.

Studies more recently showed that regulation of programs, such as glycolysis via the enzyme PFKFB3, can drive angiogenic EC behavior (9Cruys B. Wong B.W. Kuchnio A. Verdegem D. Cantelmo A.R.

Current thinking suggests that these programs are potentially dependent on the suite of active and available transcription factors in ECs, although recent research has also addressed the importance of chromatin remodeling, as defined by H3K4me, H3K27Ac, and RNA polymerase II occupancy, in determining HIF-regulated gene expression (3Xia X.

However, the scope of these studies was limited in the numbers of genes detected, in the resolution and duration of time series, and by the inadequacy of CoCl2 to faithfully recapitulate the hypoxic transcriptional response (15Peters K.

Although it is clear that the HIF-α subunits have redundant roles in regulation of some genes, it has become equally evident that the HIF-α subunits can differentially regulate genes with roles in development, disease, and metabolism (17Huang Y.

Thus, distinguishing HIF-1α from HIF-2α functions is an area of intense interest because these roles have manifested as differential regulation of intravasation/extravasation in tumor metastasis (20Branco-Price C.

The reasons for these differences are complex because HIF-1α and HIF-2α possess numerous differences in post-translational modifications, expression levels, and cofactor binding (reviewed in Ref. 8Dengler V.L. Galbraith M. Espinosa J.M. Transcriptional regulation by hypoxia inducible factors.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Here we describe detailed transcriptional characterization of the hypoxic EC response via RNA-Seq under multiple oxygen levels from 0.1% to normoxic (21%) conditions and from 1 to 48 h duration of hypoxia. We demonstrated that most gene activity is initiated within 8 h of hypoxic exposure by examining the time when individual genes first exhibit changes in expression. However, the point at which genes reach maximum expression varied considerably. Using these comparisons, we uncovered the previously unrecognized early and transient up-regulation of the developmental angiogenesis regulator SRY-related high-mobility-group box gene SOX7 by hypoxia. Gene depletion experiments showed that SOX7 is required for hypoxia angiogenic expression programs. Our broad survey revealed 1,889 up-regulated and 2,142 down-regulated genes that encompassed ∼35% of all detected genes in HUVECs, a larger number than previously observed using CoCl2 to mimic hypoxia (14Hang X.

Lastly, using HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and combined knockdowns in normoxia and hypoxia, we ascribed gene expression changes to HIF-1α, HIF-2α, either HIF isoform, or both HIFs. We identified SOX7 as a rapid HIF-2α–regulated gene and decomposed the hypoxic response into HIF-specific programs that enhance understanding of the complex interplay of HIFs in homeostatically regulating endothelial hypoxic response. A growing body of research showed that signaling initiated by hypoxia is cell type–specific, time-dependent, and exquisitely complex (2Chi J.-T. Wang Z. Nuyten D.S. Rodriguez E.H. Schaner M.E.

To better understand the genetic programs of hypoxia in ECs, we sought to precisely define the hypoxic transcriptional response in the context of a widely used EC model system, primary cultured HUVECs. Briefly, we conducted stranded RNA-Seq of low-passage HUVECs subjected to five different oxygen levels, ranging from 0.1 to 21%, and 10 different time points, from 1 to 48 h of hypoxia (see “Experimental procedures”). We used the normoxic condition (21% O2) at these time points to control for potentially confounded gene expression changes caused by cell cycling, serum, or other time-dependent influences. We sequenced to a depth of 16.7 ± 1.1 million reads, which provided a sufficient balance for gene detection, sampling density, and ability to detect potential PCR biases. We detected expression of 11,469 protein-encoding genes and 1,635 noncoding genes (>30 reads in at least one sample and >100 reads across all samples; human genome version GRCh38.87). We observed that although the feature detection rate correlated with sequencing depth across samples (from 10 to 26 million reads), the average increase was at a rate of approximately three features per additional 1 million reads, suggesting that this design was sufficiently robust to avoid missing transcripts with moderate expression (Fig. S1). We detected expression changes within the first 1–2 h of hypoxia exposure in several genes (Table 1). This included many established HIF target genes such as BHLHE40 (basic helix–loop–helix family member e40), known for its role as a hypoxia-regulated EMT gene; HK2 (hexokinase 2), an initiator role in glucose metabolism; and ADM (adrenomedullin), a potent hypotensive peptide. Activation of genes with less well-known roles in hypoxia was also observed, such as DUSP6 (dual specificity phosphatase 6; but see Ref. 12Manalo D.J. Rowan A. Lavoie T. Natarajan L. Kelly B.D. Ye S.Q. Garcia J.G. Semenza G.L. Transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial cell responses to hypoxia by HIF-1.Blood. 2005; 105 (15374877): 659-66910.1182/blood-2004-07-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), a regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, as well as SOX7 (SRY-box 7), a developmental transcriptional regulator. SOX7 is required for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during development (25Costa G. Mazan A. Gandillet A. Pearson S. Lacaud G. Kouskoff V. SOX7 regulates the expression of VE-cadherin in the haemogenic endothelium at the onset of haematopoietic development.Development. 2012; 139 (22492353): 1587-159810.1242/dev.071282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Lilly A.J.

This analysis also revealed an increase in the hypoxia-responsive long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), MIR210HG, earlier than 24 h as shown (27Voellenkle C. van Rooij J. Guffanti A. Brini E. Fasanaro P. Isaia E. Croft L. David M. Capogrossi M.C. Moles A. Felsani A. Martelli F. Deep-sequencing of endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia reveals the complexity of known and novel microRNAs.RNA. 2012; 18 (22282338): 472-48410.1261/rna.027615.111Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In fact, transcriptional changes for a variety of genes under hypoxia were noticed at the earliest 1-h time point, rivaling the speed of some early cellular responses to hypoxia, including changes in mitochondrial respiratory activity (28Janssens D. Michiels C. Delaive E. Eliaers F. Drieu K. Remacle J. Protection of hypoxia-induced ATP decrease in endothelial cells by ginkgo beloba extract and bilobalide.Biochem.

In contrast, the well-characterized HIF-1α target gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGFA, increased gradually in expression during 48 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Although transcript decay may play a role in gene expression levels during hypoxia, our examination of recent work with HUVECs supports a strong concordance between nascent transcripts (labeled with 4-thiouridine) as compared with total transcripts for genes with large expression changes in hypoxia (29Tiana M. Acosta-Iborra B. Puente-Santamaría L. Hernansanz-Agustin P. Worsley-Hunt R. Masson N. García-Rio F. Mole D. Ratcliffe P. Wasserman W.W. Jimenez B. Del Peso L. The SIN3A histone deacetylase complex is required for a complete transcriptional response to hypoxia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29059365): 120-13310.1093/nar/gkx951Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (GSE89831; Fig. S2). This finding shows that at least for the most differentially expressed transcripts, our approach approximates changes in transcription rather than degradation.Table 1Early hypoxia-responsive genesGeneLog2FCAdjusted P valueADM1.180.035ANKRD372.330.029BHLHE401.91<0.001CBX20.990.032DDIT41.62<0.001DUSP10.970.015DUSP61.35<0.001HK21.040.010PFKFB30.740.028PPP1R3C1.080.032SLC2A31.440.008SOX70.74<0.001MIR210HGalncRNA gene.2.710.034a lncRNA gene. Open table in a new tab We identified 4,023 protein-coding and 284 noncoding genes (35 and 17% of detected genes, respectively) that showed hypoxia-responsive expression changes during 48 h of hypoxia exposure (FDR-adjusted p < 0.01). Based on the most significant changes within two consecutive time points, this corresponded to 1,884 up-regulated and 2,139 down-regulated protein-coding genes along with 176 up-regulated and 108 down-regulated ncRNA transcripts (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table S1). The greater number of differentially regulated genes reported here is greater than those reported for HUVECs or other cell types under hypoxic stress (2Chi J.-T. Wang Z. Nuyten D.S. Rodriguez E.H.

It is likely due to a combination of factors, including the detection of transient changes and transcripts more amenable to stranded library RNA-Seq than microarrays. Although we cannot rule out that apoptotic expression programs may have contributed to this difference, others have shown that HUVECs are minimally apoptotic within 24 h of severe (<1% O2) hypoxia (up to 3% terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling–positive cells) (30Lee C.N. Cheng W.F. Chang M.C. Su Y.N. Chen C.A. Hsieh F.J. Hypoxia-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and embryonic stem cells.Apoptosis. 2005; 10 (16133878): 887-89410.1007/s10495-005-2946-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed neither detached cells within 24 h of hypoxia nor up-regulation of genes in the apoptotic transcriptional signature, HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS (MsigDBv6.2). To resolve domains of expression activity for hypoxia-responsive genes, we compared expression profiles across the entire series of oxygen and time points. Briefly, we used affinity propagation clustering (31Frey B.J. Dueck D. Clustering by passing messages between data points.Science. 2007; 315 (17218491): 972-97610.1126/science.1136800Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar) of gene expression during 0.1% O2 hypoxia to assign genes into groups based on similar changes in expression. We identified 29 clusters using this method, ranging in size from 40 to 291 genes, with a median of 151 genes (Fig. 1C). We conducted enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Molecular Function and Biological Process) for these clusters to better understand the unique domains of transcriptional activity. Given the established link between hypoxia and metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 4Choudhry H. Harris A.L.

Interestingly, some genes with transient increases in expression may be related to developmental and physiological processes, as is evident in the first three gene clusters (GO terms: multicellular organismal process, thyroid gland development, and embryonic morphogenesis). Moreover, a group of genes up-regulated at 48 h included those related to a stress response (GO term: ATF6-mediated unfolded protein response), as well as a metabolic change (GO term: cellular amino acid metabolic process), further supporting distinctions between the cellular response to acute (<24 h) and longer duration (>24 h) hypoxia. Mitochondria play a central role in cellular metabolism, and hypoxia has been shown to ameliorate mitochondrial defects by altering metabolic pathways (32Jain I.H. Zazzeron L. Goli R. Alexa K.

https://openalex.org/W3007305569,"The ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is crucial for the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. ASBT function is rapidly regulated by several posttranslational modifications. One reversible posttranslational modification is S-acylation, involving the covalent attachment of fatty acids to cysteine residues in proteins. However, whether S-acylation affects ASBT function and membrane expression has not been determined. Using the acyl resin-assisted capture method, we found that the majority of ASBT (∼80%) was S-acylated in ileal brush border membrane vesicles from human organ donors, as well as in HEK293 cells stably transfected with ASBT (2BT cells). Metabolic labeling with alkyne-palmitic acid (100 μm for 15 h) also showed that ASBT is S-acylated in 2BT cells. Incubation with the acyltransferase inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (25 μm for 15 h) significantly reduced ASBT S-acylation, function, and levels on the plasma membrane. Treatment of 2BT cells with saturated palmitic acid (100 μm for 15 h) increased ASBT function, whereas treatment with unsaturated oleic acid significantly reduced ASBT function. Metabolic labeling with alkyne-oleic acid (100 μm for 15 h) revealed that oleic acid attaches to ASBT, suggesting that unsaturated fatty acids may decrease ASBT's function via a direct covalent interaction with ASBT. We also identified Cys-314 as a potential S-acylation site. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that S-acylation is involved in the modulation of ASBT function. These findings underscore the potential for unsaturated fatty acids to reduce ASBT function, which may be useful in disorders in which bile acid toxicity is implicated."
https://openalex.org/W3008030167,"In this study, a drug discovery programme that sought to identify novel dual bacterial topoisomerase II inhibitors (NBTIs) led to the selection of six optimized compounds. In enzymatic assays, the molecules showed equivalent dual-targeting activity against the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Consistently, the compounds demonstrated potent activity in susceptibility tests against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative reference species, including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The activity of the compounds against clinical multidrug-resistant isolates of S. aureus, Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. was also confirmed. Two compounds (1 and 2) were tested in time-kill and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) assays. Compound 1 was bactericidal against all tested reference strains and showed higher activity than ciprofloxacin, and compound 2 showed a prolonged PAE, even against the ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus BAA-1720 strain. Spontaneous development of resistance to both compounds was selected for in S. aureus at frequencies comparable to those obtained for quinolones and other NBTIs. S. aureus BAA-1720 mutants resistant to compounds 1 and 2 had single point mutations in gyrA or gyrB outside of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), confirming the distinct site of action of these NBTIs compared to that of quinolones. Overall, the very good antibacterial activity of the compounds and their optimizable in vitro safety and physicochemical profile may have relevant implications for the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3007604690,"The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of tactical and contextual indicators on achieving offensive penetration and scoring opportunities in English Premier League (EPL) soccer matches. A total of 1971 team possessions from 20 random matches were evaluated by means of multidimensional observation. The EPL matches had a great proportion of fast attacks (36.0%) followed by combinative (29.6%), direct attacks (24.1%) and counterattacks (9.5%). Multilevel logistic regression models revealed that counterattacks (OR = 3.428; 95% CI: 2.004–5.864; P<0.001) were more effective to create goal scoring opportunities than combinative attacks, while direct attacks showed to be less effective (OR = 0.472; 95% CI: 0.264–0.845; P<0.05). Playing at home increased the probability (OR = 1.530; 95% CI: 1.097–2.135; P<0.05) of creating goal scoring opportunities compared with playing away. These findings show the multifactorial character of soccer and how different contextual and tactical indicators can influence the creation of offensive penetration and goal scoring opportunities in the English Premier League."
https://openalex.org/W3008649742,"The opportunistic pathogens Burkholderia cepacia and Burkholderia contaminans, both genomovars of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), are frequently cultured from the potable water dispenser (PWD) of the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we sequenced the genomes and conducted phenotypic assays to characterize these Burkholderia isolates. All recovered isolates of the two species fall within monophyletic clades based on phylogenomic trees of conserved single-copy core genes. Within species, the ISS-derived isolates all demonstrate greater than 99% average nucleotide identity (with 95–99% of genomes aligning) and share around 90% of the identified gene clusters from a pangenomic analysis–suggesting that the two groups are each composed of highly similar genomic lineages and their members may have all stemmed from the same two founding populations. The differences that can be observed between the recovered isolates at the pangenomic level are primarily located within putative plasmids. Phenotypically, macrophage intracellularization and lysis occurred at generally similar rates between all ISS-derived isolates, as well as with their respective type-terrestrial strain references. All ISS-derived isolates exhibited antibiotic sensitivity similar to that of the terrestrial reference strains, and minimal differences between isolates were observed. With a few exceptions, biofilm formation rates were generally consistent across each species. And lastly, though isolation date does not necessarily provide any insight into how long a given isolate had been aboard the ISS, none of the assayed physiology correlated with either date of isolation or distances based on nucleotide variation. Overall, we find that while the populations of Burkholderia present in the ISS PWS each maintain virulence, they are likely are not more virulent than those that might be encountered on planet and remain susceptible to clinically used antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W3007580728,"Introduction Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries like Ethiopia. The use of safe drinking water and improved sanitation are important practices to prevent diarrhea. However, limited research has been done to link water supply, sanitation and hygiene practices and childhood diarrhea. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the association between microbial quality of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene practices and childhood diarrhea. Methods Community-based matched case-control study design was applied on 198 paired children from June to July 2019 in Kersa and Omo Nada districts of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Cases are children < 5 years of age with diarrhea during the two weeks before the survey. The controls are children without diarrhea during the two weeks before the survey. Twenty-five percent matched pair samples of water were taken from households of cases and controls. Data were collected using structured questionnaire by interviewing mothers/caregivers. A sample of water was collected in nonreactive borosilicate glass bottles and analyzed by the membrane filtration method to count fecal indicator bacteria. A conditional logistic regression model was used; variables with p-value less than 0.05 were considered as significantly associated with childhood diarrhea. Results A total of 396 (each case matched with control) under-five children with their mothers/caregivers were included in this study. In the analysis, variables like presence of under-five child in their home (AOR = 2.76; 95% CI: 1.33–5.71), wealth status (AOR = 5.39; 95% CI: 1.99–14.55), main sources of drinking water (AOR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.40–11.44), hand washing practice before water collection (AOR = 4.28; 95% CI: 1.46–12.56), treating water at household level (AOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.48–3.09), latrine use all the times of the day and night (AOR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.06–0.78), using pit as method of waste disposal (AOR = 4.91; 95% CI: 1.39–13.29) and use of soap for hand washing (AOR = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.35–6.15) were significantly associated with childhood diarrhea. Moreover, 30% of sampled water from cases and 26% of sampled water from controls families were free from Escherichia coli whereas all sampled water analyzed for Total coliforms were positive. Conclusions We conclude that the main sources of drinking water, hand washing before water drawing from a storage container, domestic waste disposal place and use of soap for hand washing were the most important factors for the prevention of childhood diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W3006693917,"The brain works as a large-scale complex network, known as the connectome. The strength of the connections between two brain regions in the connectome is commonly estimated by calculating the correlations between their patterns of activation. This approach relies on the assumption that the activation of connected regions occurs together and at the same time. However, there are delays between the activation of connected regions due to excitatory and inhibitory connections. Here, we propose a method to harvest this additional information and reconstruct the structural brain connectome using delayed correlations. This delayed-correlation method correctly identifies 70% to 80% of connections of simulated brain networks, compared to only 5% to 25% of connections detected by the standard methods; this result is robust against changes in the network parameters (small-worldness, excitatory vs. inhibitory connection ratio, weight distribution) and network activation dynamics. The delayed-correlation method predicts more accurately both the global network properties (characteristic path length, global efficiency, clustering coefficient, transitivity) and the nodal network properties (nodal degree, nodal clustering, nodal global efficiency), particularly at lower network densities. We obtain similar results in networks derived from animal and human data. These results suggest that the use of delayed correlations improves the reconstruction of the structural brain connectome and open new possibilities for the analysis of the brain connectome, as well as for other types of networks."
https://openalex.org/W3007548923,"The obesity epidemic is dynamic with varying secular trends and differences between countries and ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to describe the age- and sex-specific longitudinal changes in weight and waist circumference in a rural Norwegian population with a high proportion of the indigenous Sami population. Based on two population-based surveys, SAMINOR 1 (2003-2004) and SAMINOR 2 (2012-2014), we present longitudinal changes in weight and waist circumference according to age at baseline in the SAMINOR 1 Survey and sex during the 10-year period. The analyses included 1538 men and 1958 women aged 36 to 69 at baseline (birth year 1934 to 1967). Forty-one percent of the population were Sami. Both weight and waist circumference were measured. The mean weight increased 0.8 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.5, 1.1) in men and 0.3 kg (95% confidence interval: 0, 0.5) in women. In both men and women, younger individuals gained significantly more weight during the 10-year follow-up than older participants (p < 0.001). The mean weight showed a statistically significant increase in men aged 36-54 and women aged 36-49 at baseline and was statistically significantly reduced in men and women aged 60-69. The mean waist circumference increased by 6.3 cm (95% confidence interval: 6.0, 6.6) in men and 8.4 cm (95% confidence interval 8.1, 8.8) in women. The mean waist circumference increased statistically significantly from SAMINOR 1 to SAMINOR 2 in all age groups, and there was an inverse relationship between age at baseline and change in waist circumference (p < 0.001). Waist circumference increased more than can be explained by changes in weight and age during the 10-year period. The inverse relationships between age at baseline in SAMINOR 1 and the 10-year change in weight and waist circumference were found in both Sami and non-Sami participants. The findings underline the need for prevention of obesity, particularly in younger people, as it is difficult to achieve permanent weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W3008634060,"Objectification occurs when a person is perceived and/or treated like an object. With the present work, we overview the available measures of objectification and present a series of studies aimed at investigating the validity of the task of inverted body recognition proposed by Bernard and colleagues (2012), which might potentially be a useful cognitive measure of objectification. We conducted three studies. Study 1 (N = 101) is a direct replication of Bernard et al.’s study: participants were presented with the same photos of sexualized male and female targets used in the original research. Study 2a (N = 100) is a conceptual replication: we used different images of scantily dressed male and female models. Finally, in Study 2b (N = 100), we investigated a boundary condition by presenting to participants photos of the same models as in Study 2a, but fully dressed and non-sexualized. Using mixed-effects models for completely-crossed classified data structures, we investigated the relationship between the inversion effect and the stimulus’ asymmetry, sexualization and attractiveness, and the perceivers’ self-objectification, sexism, and automatic woman-human association. Study 1 replicated the original results, showing a stronger inversion effect for male photos. However, no difference between male and female stimuli emerged in either Study 2a or 2b. Moreover, the impact of the other variables on the inversion effect was highly unstable across the studies. These aspects together indicate that the inversion effect depends on the specific set of stimuli and limits the generalizability of results collected using this method."
https://openalex.org/W3007220615,"Obesity results from excess energy intake over expenditure and is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation involving circulating monocytes (Mo) and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) imbalance. We analyzed circulating Mo subsets and ILC2s percentages and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) expression in lean and obese subjects, and the possible effect of hypocaloric restriction on these innate immune cells.In 139 individuals aged 45 to 57 years, classified in 74 lean individuals (>18.9kg/m2 BMI <24.9kg/m2) and 65 with obesity (n = 65), we collected fasting blood samples to detect Mo subsets, ILC2s number, and β2AR expression by flow cytometry. Lipids, insulin, leptin, and acylated-ghrelin concentrations were quantified. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was estimated by indirect calorimetry. These measurements were repeated in obese subjects after 7-weeks of hypocaloric restriction.Non-classical monocytes (NCM) and β2AR expression on intermediate Mo (IM) were increased in obese individuals (p<0.001, in both cases), whereas the percent of ILC2s was decreased (p<0.0001). Stepwise regression analysis showed significantly negative associations of ILC2s with caloric intake, β2AR expression on IM with REE, but a positive relationship between NCM and HOMA-IR. Caloric restriction allowed a significant diminution of NCM and the β2AR expression on IM, as well as, an increase in the percent of classical Mo (CM), and ILC2s. ΔREE was related to ΔCD16+/CD16- ratio.These findings show that in obesity occur changes in NCM, ILC2s and β2AR expression, which contribute to the low-grade inflammation linked to obesity and might revert with caloric restriction."
https://openalex.org/W3007936363,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a public health problem with a high disease burden and mortality in developing countries. In Brazil, areas with low human development index have the highest incidence rates of Brazil and upward temporal trend for this disease. The Northeast region has the second highest incidence of cervical cancer (20.47 new cases / 100,000 women). In this region, the mortality rates are similar to rates in countries that do not have a health system with a universal access screening program, as in Brazil. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of age, period and birth cohorts on mortality from cervical cancer in the Northeast region of Brazil. Estimable functions predicted the effects of age, period and birth cohort. The average mortality rate was 10.35 deaths per 100,000 women during the period analyzed (1980–2014). The highest mortality rate per 100,000 women was observed in Maranhão (24.39 deaths), and the lowest mortality rate was observed in Bahia (11.24 deaths). According to the period effects, only the state of Rio Grande do Norte showed a reduction in mortality risk in the five years of the 2000s. There was a reduction in mortality risk for birth cohorts of women after the 1950s, except in Maranhão State, which showed an increasing trend in mortality risk for younger generations. We found that the high rates of cervical cancer mortality in the states of northeastern Brazil remain constant over time. Even after an increase in access to health services in the 2000s, associated with increased access to the cancer care network, which includes early detection (Pap Test), cervical cancer treatment and palliative care. However, it is important to note that the decreased risk of death and the mortality rates from CC among women born after the 1960s may be correlated with increased screening coverage, as well as increased access to health services for cancer treatment observed in younger women."
https://openalex.org/W3008119698,"Chronic pain has been associated with alterations in brain structure and function that appear dependent on pain phenotype. Functional connectivity (FC) data on chronic back pain (CBP) is limited and based on heterogeneous pain populations. We hypothesize that failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients being considered for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy have altered resting state (RS) FC cross-network patterns that 1) specifically involve emotion and reward/aversion functions and 2) are related to pain scores.RS functional MRI (fMRI) scans were obtained for 10 FBSS patients who are being considered for but who have not yet undergone implantation of a permanent SCS device and 12 healthy age-matched controls. Seven RS networks were analyzed including the striatum (STM). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test evaluated differences in cross-network FC strength (FCS). Differences in periaqueductal grey (PAG) FC were assessed with seed-based analysis.Cross-network FCS was decreased (p<0.05) between the STM and all other networks in these FBSS patients. There was a negative linear relationship (R2 = 0.76, p<0.0022) between STMFCS index and pain scores. The PAG showed decreased FC with network elements and amygdala but increased FC with the sensorimotor cortex and cingulate gyrus.Decreased FC between STM and other RS networks in FBSS has not been previously reported. This STMFCS index may represent a more objective measure of chronic pain specific to FBSS which may help guide patient selection for SCS and subsequent management."
https://openalex.org/W3007030355,"There is ample evidence that meditation can regulate emotions. It is questionable, however, whether meditation can down-regulate sensitivity to emotional experience in high-level cognitive representations such as words. The present study shows that adept Zen meditators rated the emotional valence of (low-arousal) positive and (high- and low-arousal) negative nouns significantly more neutral after a meditation session, while there was no change of valence ratings after a comparison intervention in the comparison group. Because the Zen group provided greater “openness to experience” and lower „need for achievement and performance” in the “Big Five” personality assessment, we used these scores as covariates for all analyses. We found no differential emotion effects of Zen meditation during lexical decision, but we replicated the slow-down of low-arousal negative words during lexical decision in both groups. Interestingly, Zen meditation elicited a global facilitation of all response times, which we discuss in terms of increased attentional resources after meditation."
https://openalex.org/W3007814812,"Salamanders (Caudata) are one of the three modern groups of amphibians known from the Middle Jurassic. The early stages of evolution of these amphibians are still poorly known, especially for stem taxa of Jurassic age. A new small-sized stem salamander, Egoria malashichevi gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) Itat Formation of the Berezovsk Quarry locality in Western Siberia, Russia, is described on the basis of isolated vertebrae, including an atlas centrum and a fragmentary trunk vertebra centrum previously referred to an undescribed salamander taxon (""Berezovsk salamander A""). The new taxon is diagnosed by the following unique combination of vertebral characters: atlantal anterior cotyles with elliptical anterior outline, located at an angle of approximately 135-137 degrees to each other; wide posterior portion of the atlantal centrum; ossified portion of the intercotylar tubercle represented by dorsal and ventral lips; absence of a deep depression on the ventral surface of the atlantal centrum; absence of pronounced ventrolateral ridges on the atlas; absence of spinal nerve foramina; presence of a pitted texture on the ventral and lateral surfaces of the centra and lateral surfaces neural arch pedicels; presence of a short atlantal neural arch with its anterior border situated behind the level of the anterior cotyles; short trunk vertebrae; and upper transverse process (= diapophysis) larger than lower transverse process (= parapophysis) on the trunk vertebrae; notochordal canal opens in the upper half of the cotyle (= the lower portion of the centrum is more massive and less compact than the upper portion). The microanatomical organization of the atlas and trunk vertebrae is characterized by the presence of inner cancellous endochondral bone. The small body size (about 180-215 mm) of Egoria malashichevi gen. et sp. nov. indicates that that not all stem salamanders were large neotenic forms (up to 550-600 mm in Urupia and Marmorerpeton) and hints at a broader ecological role for stem salamanders."
https://openalex.org/W3008311207,"The late 5th instar caterpillar of the cecropia silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia) spins a silken cocoon with a distinct, multilayered architecture. The cocoon construction program, first described by the seminal work of Van der Kloot and Williams, consists of a highly ordered sequence of events. We perform behavioral experiments to re-evaluate the original cecropia work, which hypothesized that the length of silk that passes through the spinneret controls the orderly execution of each of the discrete events of cocoon spinning. We confirm and extend by three-dimensional scanning and quantitative measurements of silk weights that if cocoon construction is interrupted, upon re-spinning, the caterpillar continues the cocoon program from where it left off. We also confirm and extend by quantitative measurements of silk weights that cecropia caterpillars will not bypass any of the sections of the cocoon during the construction process, even if presented with a pre-spun section of a cocoon spun by another caterpillar. Blocking silk output inhibits caterpillars from performing normal spinning behaviors used for cocoon construction. Surprisingly, unblocking silk output 24-hr later did not restart the cocoon construction program, suggesting the involvement of a temporally-defined interval timer. We confirm with surgical reductions of the silk glands that it is the length of silk itself that matters, rather than the total amount of silk extracted by individuals. We used scanning electron microscopy to directly show that either mono- or dual-filament silk (i.e., equal silk lengths but which vary in their total amount of silk extracted) can be used to construct equivalent cocoons of normal size and that contain the relevant layers. We propose that our findings, taken together with the results of prior studies, strongly support the hypothesis that the caterpillar uses a silk “odometer” to measure the length of silk extracted during cocoon construction but does so in a temporally regulated manner. We further postulate that our examination of the anatomy of the silk spinning apparatus and ablating spinneret sensory output provides evidence that silk length measurement occurs upstream of output from the spinneret."
https://openalex.org/W3008836138,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and methods This population-based nationwide cohort study utilized data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013. The patients were divided into three groups—those who received ADT only (ADT-only group), those who had radiotherapy (RT) only (RT-only group), and those treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) only (RP-only group). The study outcome was newly diagnosed hematologic disorder, including anemia and hematologic malignancy. Propensity score-matched, Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier curve analyses were performed to investigate the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders after ADT. Results Of the 17,168 patients with prostate cancer who were included in the study, 13,318 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching, 1,797, 1,797, and 1,797 patients treated with ADT only, RT only, and RP only, respectively, who had a median follow-up period of 4.32 years were included in the study cohort. Compared with the patients treated with RP only, those who received ADT and RT were significantly at increased risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders (ADT: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29–1.97; RT: aHR, 1.98, 95% CI: 1.62–2.42) according to the Cox regression analysis. Based on the Kaplan–Meier curve analysis, patients with bone metastasis who received ADT only had the lowest cumulative probabilities of not developing hematologic disorders. Moreover, a significantly increased risk of hematologic disorders was observed with the increasing duration of ADT (P for trend < .001). Conclusions The use of ADT in patients with prostate cancer may increase the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders."

Hindlimb length differences were induced by applying an Easyboot Glue-on shoe to one hindlimb. Changes in Pmin and Pmax with induced hindlimb length difference were assessed with a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with trial (straight, lunge with inside limb elevation, lunge with outside limb elevation) and surface (hard, soft) as within-subject factors. Change in Pmin, indicating an impact-type lameness, in the hind limb with the elevation, was significant in both the straight line and while lunging on both hard and soft surfaces. Change in Pmax, indicating pushoff-type lameness, in the opposite, non-elevated hind limb, was significant when trotting in a straight line but not while lunging."
https://openalex.org/W3008150591,"Deubiquitinases deconjugate ubiquitin modifications from target proteins and are involved in many cellular processes in eukaryotes. The functions of deubiquitinases are regulated by post-translational modifications, mainly phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Post-translational modifications can result in subtle changes in structural and dynamic properties, which are difficult to identify but functionally important. In this work, we used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational properties of the human deubiquitinase A (DUBA), a negative regulator of type I interferon. DUBA activity is regulated by phosphorylation at a single serine residue, Ser-177. We found that the catalytic rate constant of DUBA is enhanced by phosphorylation. By comparing NMR and enzyme kinetics data among different forms of DUBA with low and high activities, we concluded that a two-state equilibrium that was present only in phosphorylated DUBA is important for DUBA activity. Our results highlight the importance of defining conformational dynamics in understanding the mechanism of DUBA activation."

To assess the distribution pattern of exposure and infection by Leptospira serogroups in the two main semi-aquatic rodents of Western France, coypus (Myocastor coypus) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), results of micro-agglutination testing and renal tissue PCR were used. In coypus, the apparent prevalence was 11% (n = 524, CI95% = [9% - 14%]), seroprevalence was 42% (n = 590, CI95% = [38% - 46%]), and the predominant serogroup was Australis (84%). In muskrats, the apparent prevalence was 33% (n = 274, CI95% = [27% - 39%]), seroprevalence was 57% (n = 305, CI95% = [52% - 63%]), and the predominant serogroup was Grippotyphosa (47%). Muskrats should therefore be considered an important source of Grippotyphosa infection in humans and domestic animals exposed in this part of France."
https://openalex.org/W3007578387,"The present investigation devices a novel X-type six-high (X-6h) mill. In addition, parametric models of different roll layouts such as the four-high (4-h), I-type six-high (I-6h), and X-6h mills are established. Three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) contact analysis for a strip rolling process is conducted when the mills are subjected to a constant vertical load of 65 kN. Through comparative analysis of von Mises stress, contact stress and elastic deformation displacement in three roll layouts, the rigidity characteristic of each is obtained, and it is found that the proposed X-6h mill has the largest roll gap stiffness. The influence of different roll diameter ratios on the roll gap stiffness of the roll system is investigated, based on which an optimization design model is built. Further, by taking into account the roll gap stiffness of the roll system as the optimization objective, the optimum diameter ratios of backup roll (BUR) to work roll (WR) of the X-6h rolling mill is achieved via the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method, obtaining the optimum structural parameters of BUR and WR as well. The reliability of the proposed design is verified by manufacturing a prototype mill which produced magnesium alloy and aluminum alloy strips of high quality."
https://openalex.org/W3008881805,"Genetically modified swine disease models are becoming increasingly important for studying molecular, physiological and pathological characteristics of human disorders. Given the limited history of these model systems, there remains a great need for proven molecular reagents in swine tissue. Here, to provide a resource for neurological models of disease, we validated antibodies by immunohistochemistry for use in examining central nervous system (CNS) markers in a recently developed miniswine model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder stemming from mutations in NF1, a gene that encodes the Ras-GTPase activating protein neurofibromin. Patients classically present with benign neurofibromas throughout their bodies and can also present with neurological associated symptoms such as chronic pain, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities. As validated antibodies for immunohistochemistry applications are particularly difficult to find for swine models of neurological disease, we present immunostaining validation of antibodies implicated in glial inflammation (CD68), oligodendrocyte development (NG2, O4 and Olig2), and neuron differentiation and neurotransmission (doublecortin, GAD67, and tyrosine hydroxylase) by examining cellular localization and brain region specificity. Additionally, we confirm the utility of anti-GFAP, anti-Iba1, and anti-MBP antibodies, previously validated in swine, by testing their immunoreactivity across multiple brain regions in mutant NF1 samples. These immunostaining protocols for CNS markers provide a useful resource to the scientific community, furthering the utility of genetically modified miniswine for translational and clinical applications."

To explain this effect, we rely on the knowledge-gap theory and show that individuals who were exposed to more attack advertisements were also more likely to independently seek information, become more knowledgeable, and consequently support these subjects. In addition to an observational study, to test our hypotheses on the link between exposure to negative information, curiosity, and shifts in knowledge and support levels, we design and conduct a randomized experiment using a sample of 300 unique individuals. Our multi-methods research contributes to marketing literature by documenting a rare occasion in which exposure to attack advertisements leads to increased demand and unveiling the mechanisms through which this effect takes place."
https://openalex.org/W3006840835,"Activins are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of signaling proteins and were originally identified as components of follicular fluid. The proteins are now known to play critical roles in numerous normal and pathological processes and conditions, but less is clear about the relationships between their gene organization and protein variant expression and structure. The four human and mouse activin (Act) genes, termed INHβA, INHβB, INHβC and INHβE, differ in exon numbers. Human INHβA is the most complex with 7 exons and elicits production of three Act A variants (Act A X1, X2 and X3) differing in their pro-region, as we showed previously. Here we further analyzed the mouse INHβA gene and found that its 4 exons encode for a single open reading frame (mouse Act A), corresponding to the shortest human Act A X3 variant. Activins are synthesized and secreted as large complexes made of a long pro-region and a short mature C- terminal ligand and are known to interact with the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of cell surface and matrix proteoglycans. Human Act A X1 and X2 variants do have a HS-binding domain (HBD) with Cardin/Weintraub traits in their pro-region, while the X3 variant does not as shown previously. We found that the mouse Act A lacks a HBD as well. However, we identified a typical HBD in the pro-region of both mouse and human Act B, and synthetic peptides containing that domain interacted with immobilized HS and cell surface with nanomolar affinity. In sum, human and mouse Act A genes elicit expression of different variant sets, while there is concordance in Act B protein expression, reflecting possible evolutionary diversity in function of, and responses to, these signaling proteins in the two species."
