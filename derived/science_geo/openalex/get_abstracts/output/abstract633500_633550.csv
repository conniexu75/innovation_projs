https://openalex.org/W2946168453,"Activity-dependent myelination is thought to contribute to adaptive neurological function. However, the mechanisms by which activity regulates myelination and the extent to which myelin plasticity contributes to non-motor cognitive functions remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), we recently demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy induces complex glial dysfunction for which microglial activation is central. Here, we demonstrate that remote MTX exposure blocks activity-regulated myelination. MTX decreases cortical Bdnf expression, which is restored by microglial depletion. Bdnf-TrkB signaling is a required component of activity-dependent myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-specific TrkB deletion in chemotherapy-naive mice results in impaired cognitive behavioral performance. A small-molecule TrkB agonist rescues both myelination and cognitive impairment after MTX chemotherapy. This rescue after MTX depends on intact TrkB expression in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism required for adaptive myelination that is aberrant in CRCI due to microglial activation."
https://openalex.org/W2946658992,"Despite robust effects on immature neurons, growth factors minimally promote axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Attempting to improve growth-factor responsiveness in mature neurons by dedifferentiation, we overexpressed Lin28 in the retina. Lin28-treated retinas responded to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) by initiating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration after axotomy. Surprisingly, this effect was cell non-autonomous. Lin28 expression was required only in amacrine cells, inhibitory neurons that innervate RGCs. Ultimately, we found that optic-nerve crush pathologically upregulated activity in amacrine cells, which reduced RGC electrical activity and suppressed growth-factor signaling. Silencing amacrine cells or pharmacologically blocking inhibitory neurotransmission also induced IGF1 competence. Remarkably, RGCs regenerating across these manipulations localized IGF1 receptor to their primary cilia, which maintained their signaling competence and regenerative ability. Thus, our results reveal a circuit-based mechanism that regulates CNS axon regeneration and implicate primary cilia as a regenerative signaling hub."

Scientific evidence is essential to substantiate claims about utility, safety, and efficacy and for informed choice and public trust. The wearable neurotechnology market targets consumers with promises of cognitive benefit and personal wellness. Scientific evidence is essential to substantiate claims about utility, safety, and efficacy and for informed choice and public trust. Technologies that read signals from or stimulate the brain have historically been accessible to only researchers and clinicians. Now, however, they are being sold directly to consumers (DTC) and adapted for use by the general public. Among their many applications, these devices are purported to improve cognitive functions such as memory and attention, optimize brain fitness, and control games and objects, including those that may enhance autonomy among people with injuries of the brain and spinal cord. Ethics discourse around DTC health-related tests and products is not new; ethicists have seen it for CT imaging marketed to the healthy wealthy (Illes et al., 2003Illes J. Fan E.

Despite this history, the tremendous projected growth of the DTC neuro-related industry, and calls for better engagement around responsible innovation (Wexler and Thibault, 2018Wexler A. Thibault R.

Neurol. 2016; 80: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), empirically driven knowledge about the ethical realities of commercializing these devices in the open marketplace is limited. We were interested in further closing this gap by focusing an ethics lens on the marketing claims made about both recording and stimulating wearable neurotechnology. To identify websites offering wearable neurodevices and claims about them, we conducted extensive searches (Google.com, Yahoo!, and AltaVista) using key words such as neurodevices (any wearable device that directly performs its function by interacting with, recording from, or manipulating the central nervous system) and direct-to-consumer (available for purchase on the open marketplace without physician involvement or a license for use). We included all those available for purchase either through online retailers (i.e., Amazon), crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indigogo, and manufacturer websites or available for purchase in stores. We used conventional qualitative methods to develop an initial code book using descriptive content analysis and identified 26 major domains of coding a priori for type of device, explicitly (text) and implicitly (image) targeted consumer groups, and explicit (verbatim) and implicit (image-based) claims. Authors C.L. and N.M. individually identified the verbatim claims for a 20% subset of the sample for reproducibility and then jointly generated the final code book and performed the analysis. Main webpages, as well as subpages with links accessible from the homepage, were included. Hyperlinks that led to a website with a root website address different from the official device website were not. A charting method enabled the creation and management of database of devices and related claims for thematic coding. The results are based on website content at the time of analysis and writing. We identified 41 DTC wearable neurodevices available for purchase. Of these, 22 were recording devices (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG]) and 19 were stimulating devices (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]). We found 20 unique claims for the neurodevices (171 total claims across the 41 devices in the sample) (Table 1) that we clustered into four main categories: wellness, enhancement, practical applications, and health. We note that themes such as enhancement, wellness, and health represent a conceptual continuum with blurred boundaries, and we relied therefore on the verbatim claims about them – for example, enhancement as augmented performance beyond the user’s standard level of functioning. In order to be considered a health claim the manufacturers had to refer to a named medical condition.Table 1Claims by CategoryCategoryClaimFrequencyPercent of totalExampleWellnessRelieve stress/anxiety1710%“myBrain Technologies built a new drug-free, easy-to-use, and perfectly safe solution to stress” (MyBrain Technologies MeloMind)Improve sleep quality1710%“Because the Sleep Shepherd lets you directly control your brain rate, you can naturally build a better, healthier sleep cycle that allows you to fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and have more energy during the day” (Sleep Shepherd Blue)Improve general wellness169%“Versus provides a path to wellness through brain exercises” (Versus)Augment meditation/relaxation116%“Muse: the brain sensing headband will elevate your meditation experience.

For one device, the claim pertained to the slowing of cognitive decline. In addition to symptom improvement, some claims also suggested improved autonomy for individuals with cognitive and motor disabilities. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was cited for only one device, which was promoted for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Claims of practical utility were made for four EEG-controlled devices that could move a target around, two for creative art, seven for research, and one to promote safety by detecting fatigue. Mostly the general public. However, we could identify 1 or more of 11 specific consumer groups for 32 of the 41 devices: older adults, athletes/trainers, children, researchers, health care providers/professionals, people with medical conditions, employees/employers, students, marketers, musicians, and gamers. We identified a link to research or a resource to support associated claims for 33 of the 41 devices, but we only found a link to one or more relevant peer-reviewed research papers for 8 of the device claims overall. Of the remainder, 29 had links to citations to general science research and scientific concepts. For example, one website discussed how tDCS may, in general, improve cognitive functioning but did not explicitly say their device did so. Other links were to user testimonials, gray literature, company/in-house research, or peer-reviewed literature that was irrelevant to the device or claim at hand. Largely not. Risks and warnings associated with the devices were neither stated on company websites nor discernable without purchase in more than half of the sample (21/41). Websites that did have risk and warning statements referenced a wide range of potential side effects: topical discomfort, redness, skin irritation, overheating, tiredness, headaches, dry throat, dizziness, tingling, burns, pain, changes in sleep or energy, heightened emotionality, and nausea. When safety profiles were outlined, they took the form of suggestions and directions for use, such as not to use tDCS on pregnant women, children, and others with implanted medical devices, only running tDCS stimulation at intensity levels that are not uncomfortable, and to disconnect the device if the sensors feel hot during charging or use. Few companies explicitly claimed that their device was safe with statements such as “The headset safely measures brainwave signals and monitors the attention levels” (NeuroSky MindWave). We recognize that first-line and expanded safety information may come with a device once purchased. We note that two companies did make user materials available without purchase, but neither provided consumers with any safety profiles or guidelines for safe use. The claims that producers make about brain wearables and strategies for communicating them are of central interest to neuroethics as they touch upon core issues of transparency, rights, and responsibility. In our view, two sets of core ethical concerns posed by the DTC wearable neurotechnology market arise from the present analysis: (1) concerns about unsubstantiated claims and (2) unease about substantiated claims. Good business ethics in biomedicine—neuroscience or otherwise—requires stringent in-house research that validates company claims about their devices, grounds honest marketing practices, and ensures adherence to robust regulatory oversight (Bubela and McCabe, 2013Bubela T. McCabe C. Value-engineered translation for regenerative medicine: meeting the needs of health systems.Stem Cells Dev. 2013; 22: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Unsubstantiated claims and ethically questionable strategies may arise when a claim is based generally on the performance of a given technology over that of a specific device. For example, one company website states, “tDCS or Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is an incredibly promising, noninvasive way of improving brain function.” What is missing, to our knowledge, however, is that the specific tDCS device itself has not actually been proven to do so. This is a particularly salient consideration given how these devices vary widely in terms of the number and placement of electrodes used and the fact that DTC devices will be used in naturalistic settings rather than a controlled laboratory environment. While the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has begun cracking down on brain-training computer programs or applications that claim enhancement or improvement in cognitive functioning (Robbins, 2016Robbins R. U.S. Cracking Down on “Brain Training” Games.https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-cracking-down-on-brain-training-games/Date: 2016Google Scholar), at the time of this writing we are unaware of any complaints brought against a neurowearable company making the same claims. Public trust is at risk when a product purported to be based on science is not. Moreover, patients’ lives are at risk if conventional medical interventions are circumvented in favor of unproven benefits of neurowearables. Ordinarily, medical devices fall under FDA regulatory purview based on the health claims made about them rather than about their mechanism of action. It is unclear then how eight DTC devices that claim medical benefit appear to have escaped the requirement to provide FDA confirmation of the safety and efficacy of their stated function. In addition to the neurodevices for which health claims are made without proof of FDA approval, many others evade regulatory control by referencing disease but not articulating that the device can ameliorate that condition. For example, a tDCS company claims “Our non-invasive, bioelectronic platform effectively targets autonomic nerve pathways important in a number of disease processes while providing superior safety relative to pharmaceutical interventions.” While the company mentions that the device aims to influence nerve pathways that are important in disease processes, they stop at the point of directly saying that their product alters disease course. Nonetheless, this could be interpreted as a legitimate health claim, leading to uninformed medical decisions. In our view, relevant current regulation is either lacking or insufficiently enforced. Finally, some devices may avoid regulatory scrutiny with claims about wellness and enhancement rather than health, e.g., “...giving your clients access to the latest technological innovations, taken out of neuroscientific research laboratories to deeply improve their wellbeing” and “...a path to wellness through brain exercises.” While there is no suggestion that a user should supplant use of this device over a conventional therapeutic for a brain or mental health conditions, there is also no warning to not do so. Potential harms remain even if these devices perform as advertised, not the least of which involve safety (Wurzman et al., 2016Wurzman R. Hamilton R.H. Pascual-Leone A. Fox M.D. An open letter concerning do-it-yourself users of transcranial direct current stimulation.Ann. Neurol. 2016; 80: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If, in fact, DTC tDCS devices can improve cognition, then surely that is a benefit people will seek as they have historically over time. However, DTC devices are, by definition, unsupervised, and there is little to stop a user from wearing a device continuously with unknown effects on neuroplasticity. Many of the tDCS devices allow the wearer to control the level of stimulation delivered. It is not unreasonable to imagine that many users will equate longer and more intense stimulation with increased improvement and effect. There is very little research on the long-term impact of tDCS use, especially when that use is long term and frequent. This is a particular concern given our findings of absent risks and warnings information and protocols for safe use and possible interactional or adverse effects of exchanging a known, effective intervention for a condition with the use of a device. Furthermore, while claims about supported autonomy after serious disability involving the brain or spinal cord might eventually be borne out, it is likely that the extent of such improvement would be limited. As such, the technology should not be expected to supplant human interaction or aid, and claims should not be interpreted as a justification for reduction or redirection of resources. Scientific evidence is essential to legitimize claims about utility, safety, and efficacy and for informed choice and public trust. Continued vigilance to the claims landscape for brain technologies is especially important as this market captures the imagination of a neuro-obsessed world. It is vital that regulation and oversight of neurodevices keep apace with, or at least remains relevant to, the evolution of the fast-paced neurotechnology landscape in order to ensure that the benefits of this market are realized, harms avoided, and good practices motivate industry to own the ethics of their innovation.

https://openalex.org/W2946739461,"Understanding the causality between energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic growth is helpful for policymakers to formulate energy, environmental and economic policies. For the first time, based on nonlinear dynamics, this paper employs multispatial convergent cross mapping (CCM) to revisit the energy-carbon-economy causation for China, India and the G7 countries using both aggregate data and per capita data. The findings indicate that there are significant differences between developing countries and developed countries. A bidirectional nexus between energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic growth is found in China and India, but various causal relationships are identified in the G7 countries, including bidirectional, unidirectional and neutral nexus. The results confirm that the decoupling phenomenon is common in most G7 countries. By leveraging a variety of samples and a new approach, this study provides new evidence for policy authorities to formulate country-specific policies to obtain better environmental quality while achieving sustainable economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2946104102,"Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is amongst motivational frameworks the most popular and contemporary approach to human motivation, being applied in the last decades in several domains, including sport, exercise and physical education (PE). Additionally, Achievement Goal Theory (AGT) has presented evidence of how contextual factors may influence student's behavior in this particular context. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the motivational climate created by the teacher in the classroom, students' satisfaction of Basic Psychological Needs (BPN), and how their behavioral regulation could explain PE grades and intention to practice sports in the future.A total of 618 students (290 female; 328 male) from the 6th to the 9th school level, aged between 10 and 18 years (M = 13.3; SD = 1.7) participated in this study. The following surveys were used for the proposed variables: Learning and Performance Orientations in Physical Education Classes Questionnaire (LAPOPECQ); the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale (BPNESp); and the Perceived Locus of Causality (PLOCp). Intentions to practice sport/physical activity in the future were assessed through a single item. Students' PE grade was obtained through his/her teacher final assessment. Structural Equation Analysis was performed via AMOS 23.0.After analyzing modification indices and model adjustment, the final model emerged: learning climate > BPN > autonomous motivation > intentions/PE grade. Results interpretation seems to indicate that i) the satisfaction of BPN are influenced by motivational climate (i.e., learning climate), ii) the individuals' motivation is influenced by the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs (i.e., particularly competence), and iii) the motivational regulations have direct and significant effects with intention to practice sports outside school in the future and PE grades.The main results showed that a climate oriented for learning has a positive impact on basic psychological needs satisfaction of students. However, only competence satisfaction had a significant positive relationship with students' autonomous motivation, which in turn had a significant positive relation with PE grade, as well as for intentions for leisure-time sport/physical activity practice."
https://openalex.org/W2946370991,"Major non-legume crops can form beneficial associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Azospirillum brasilense. Our current understanding of the molecular aspects and signaling that occur between important crops like rice and these nitrogen-fixing bacteria is limited. In this study, we used an experimental system where the bacteria could colonize the plant roots and promote plant growth in wild type rice and symbiotic mutants (dmi3 and pollux) in rice. Our data suggest that plant growth promotion and root penetration is not dependent on these genes. We then used this colonization model to identify regulation of gene expression at two different time points during this interaction: at 1day post inoculation (dpi), we identified 1622 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in rice roots, and at 14dpi, we identified 1995 DEGs. We performed a comprehensive data mining to classify the DEGs into the categories of transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases (PKs), and transporters (TRs). Several of these DEGs encode proteins that are involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, defense, and hormone signaling pathways. We identified genes that are involved in nitrate and sugar transport and are also implicated to play a role in other plant-microbe interactions. Overall, findings from this study will serve as an excellent resource to characterize the host genetic pathway controlling the interactions between non-legumes and beneficial bacteria which can have long-term implications towards sustainably improving agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2944895479,"Research on awe has grown exponentially in recent decades; however, few studies have considered whether awe-inspiring experiences also inspire other emotions. In two studies, we explored whether interventions targeting awe also evoke other discrete emotions. Additionally, we considered two constructs that may be associated with increases in each emotion-self-relevant thoughts and connectedness. In Study 1, we manipulated awe in virtual reality and examined the potential effects of a prototypical awe experience-a spacewalk accompanied by an audio clip of Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot. In Study 2, we manipulated awe with a video depicting scenes of Earth from outer space paired with the same audio clip. Across both studies, a prototypical awe experience was associated not only with awe, but with compassion, gratitude, love, and optimism, along with connectedness and self-relevant thoughts. Furthermore, we found that increases in self-relevant thoughts and connectedness in response to the awe induction predicted increases in each emotion evoked and vice-versa. These findings suggest that experiences that are commonly considered awe-inspiring-such as viewing a picturesque landscape-may be more appropriately conceptualized more broadly as self-transcendent. More work is needed to determine whether the documented benefits of awe may be more appropriately interpreted as the benefits of self-transcendent emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2945142866,"Background Hospital stays are associated with high levels of sedentary behavior and physical inactivity. To objectively investigate physical behavior of hospitalized patients, these is a need for valid measurement instruments. The aim of this study was to assess the criterion validity of three accelerometers to measure lying, sitting, standing and walking. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed in a university hospital. Participants carried out several mobility tasks according to a structured protocol while wearing three accelerometers (ActiGraph GT9X Link, Activ8 Professional and Dynaport MoveMonitor). The participants were guided through the protocol by a test leader and were recorded on video to serve as reference. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were determined for the categories lying, sitting, standing and walking. Results In total 12 subjects were included with a mean age of 49.5 (SD 21.5) years and a mean body mass index of 23.8 kg/m2 (SD 2.4). The ActiGraph GT9X Link showed an excellent sensitivity (90%) and PPV (98%) for walking, but a poor sensitivity for sitting and standing (57% and 53%), and a poor PPV (43%) for sitting. The Activ8 Professional showed an excellent sensitivity for sitting and walking (95% and 93%), excellent PPV (98%) for walking, but no sensitivity (0%) and PPV (0%) for lying. The Dynaport MoveMonitor showed an excellent sensitivity for sitting (94%), excellent PPV for lying and walking (100% and 99%), but a poor sensitivity (13%) and PPV (19%) for standing. Conclusions The validity outcomes for the categories lying, sitting, standing and walking vary between the investigated accelerometers. All three accelerometers scored good to excellent in identifying walking. None of the accelerometers were able to identify all categories validly."
https://openalex.org/W2946281636,"Cryopreservation is key for delivery of cellular therapies, however the key physical and biological events during cryopreservation are poorly understood. This study explored the entire cooling range, from membrane phase transitions above 0°C to the extracellular glass transition at -123°C, including an endothermic event occurring at -47°C that we attributed to the glass transition of the intracellular compartment. An immortalised, human suspension cell line (Jurkat) was studied, using the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine membrane phase transitions and differential scanning calorimetry to analyse glass transition events. Jurkat cells were exposed to controlled cooling followed by rapid, uncontrolled cooling to examine biological implications of the events, with post-thaw viable cell number and functionality assessed up to 72 h post-thaw. The intracellular glass transition observed at -47°C corresponded to a sharp discontinuity in biological recovery following rapid cooling. No other physical events were seen which could be related to post-thaw viability or performance significantly. Controlled cooling to at least -47°C during the cryopreservation of Jurkat cells, in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, will ensure an optimal post-thaw viability. Below -47°C, rapid cooling can be used. This provides an enhanced physical and biological understanding of the key events during cryopreservation and should accelerate the development of optimised cryobiological cooling protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2945651166,"As important regulators, miRNAs could play pivotal roles in regulation of fruit coloring. Actinidia arguta is a newly emerged fruit tree with extensively application prospects. However, miRNAs involved in A. arguta fruit coloring are unknown. In this study, A. arguta fruit were investigated at three developmental stages by small RNAs high-throughput sequencing. A total of 482 conserved miRNAs corresponding to 526 pre-miRNAs and 581 novel miRNAs corresponding to 619 pre-miRNAs were grouped into 46 miRNA families. Target gene prediction and analysis revealed that miR858, a strongly candidate miRNA, was involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in which contributes to fruit coloring. The anthocyanin level was determined in three A. arguta cultivars by UPLC-MS/MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry). In addition, qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR), cluster analysis were conducted as well as correlation analysis. All results were combined to propose a model in which describes an association of miRNA and anthocyanin biosynthesis in A. arguta. The data presented herein is the first report on miRNA profile analysis in A. arguta, which can provide valuable information for further research into the regulation of the miRNAs in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloring."
https://openalex.org/W2945749121,"Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an alternatively spliced variant, which mediates the conversion of glucose to lactate in cancer cells under normoxic conditions, known as the Warburg effect. Previously, we demonstrated that PKM2 is one of 97 genes that are overexpressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Herein, we demonstrate a novel role of subcellular PKM2 expression as a biomarker of therapeutic response after targeting this gene by shRNA or small molecule inhibitor (SMI) of PKM2 enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo. We examined two established lung cancer cell lines, nine patients derived NSCLC and three normal lung fibroblast cell lines for PKM2 mRNA, protein and enzyme activity by RT-qPCR, immunocytochemistry (ICC), and Western blot analysis. All eleven NSCLC cell lines showed upregulated PKM2 enzymatic activity and protein expression mainly in their cytoplasm. Targeting PKM2 by shRNA or SMI, NSCLC cells showed significantly reduced mRNA, enzyme activity, cell viability, and colony formation, which also downregulated cytosolic PKM2 and upregulated nuclear enzyme activities. Normal lung fibroblast cell lines did not express PKM2, which served as negative controls. PKM2 targeting by SMI slowed tumor growth while gene-silencing significantly reduced growth of human NSCLC xenografts. Tumor sections from responding mice showed >70% reduction in cytoplasmic PKM2 with low or undetectable nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In sharp contrast, non-responding tumors showed a >38% increase in PKM2 nuclear staining with low or undetectable cytoplasmic staining. In conclusion, these results confirmed PKM2 as a target for cancer therapy and an unique function of subcellular PKM2, which may characterize therapeutic response to anti-PKM2 therapy in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2945137706,"Background The Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire’07 (DCDQ’07) is a parent-report measure to identify children at risk for Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). We developed a French version of the DCDQ’07 (DCDQ-FE) that has shown excellent inter-language reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.91) and is culturally relevant for use in European countries. The aims of this study were to examine the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity of the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire-French European (DCDQ-FE), as well as establish a cut-off score. Methods The psychometric properties of the DCDQ-FE were examined with a clinical group of 30 children (mean age: 9.4 years, SD = 2.6) and a control group of 43 children (mean age: 9.1 years, SD = 2.4). Their parents (n = 73) filled out the DCDQ-FE at a first sitting and 70 of them filled it out 38 days later in average for test-retest reliability. The children were assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) so as to measure the convergent validity of the DCDQ-FE. The cut-off score was determined with an additional sample of 42 children according to scores on the MABC-2 (≥ 16th percentile) (n = 115). Results and implications Internal consistency of the DCDQ-FE was excellent (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96) and test-retest reliability was good (ICC = 0.956) with no differences between scores obtained at the two sittings (p > 0.05). Differences in scores between children in the clinical and control groups (Z = -6.58, p < 0.001) provide evidence of construct validity. The correlation obtained between DCDQ-FE and MABC-2 scores (Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient = 0.802, p < 0.001) supports convergent validity. Using a cut-off of 56, overall sensitivity and specificity were 85.0% and 81.6% respectively (area under the curve = 0.896). The DCDQ-FE is a reliable and valid questionnaire for detecting children who are at risk for DCD in a European-French population of children aged 5 to 15 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2945645315,"Background/Aims The MELD score was developed to predict survival after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. Given changes in practice patterns and development of new prognostic tools in cirrhosis, we aimed to evaluate common models to predict mortality after TIPS placement. Methods Analysis of consecutive patients who underwent TIPS placement for ascites or bleeding. Performance to predict 90-day mortality was assessed by C statistic for six models (MELD, MELD-Na, CLIF-C ACLF, Child-Pugh, Platelet-Albumin-Bilirubin, and Emory score). Added predictive value to MELD score was assessed for univariate predictors of 90-day mortality. Stratified analysis by TIPS indication, emergent placement status, and TIPS stent type was performed. Results 413 patients were analyzed (248 with variceal bleeding, 165 with refractory ascites). 90-day mortality was 27% (113/413). Mean MELD score was 15 ± 7.9. MELD score best predicted mortality for all patients (c = 0.779), for variceal bleeding (c = 0.844), and for emergent TIPS (c = 0.817). CLIF-C ACLF score best predicted mortality for refractory ascites (c = 0.707). Addition of sodium to the MELD score did not improve predictive value across multiple strata. Addition of hemoglobin improved MELD score’s predictive value in variceal bleeding. Addition of age improved MELD score’s predictive value in refractory ascites. Conclusions MELD score best predicted 90-day mortality. Addition of sodium to the MELD score did not improve its performance, though mortality prediction was improved using Age-MELD for ascites and Hemoglobin-MELD for bleeding. An individualized risk stratification approach may be best when considering candidates for TIPS placement."
https://openalex.org/W2946274634,"Background DAR-901 is an inactivated whole cell tuberculosis booster vaccine, prepared using a new scalable, broth-grown method from the master cell bank of SRL172, a vaccine previously shown to prevent tuberculosis. This study examined whether DAR-901 (a) induces CD4+ T cell cytokine profiles previously proposed as correlates of protection and (b) has a specific vaccine-induced immunological signature compared to BCG or placebo. Methods We analysed CD4+ T cell cytokine immune responses from 10 DAR-901 recipients, 9 BCG recipients and 9 placebo recipients from the Phase I DAR-901 MDES trial. In that study, HIV-negative, IGRA-negative participants with prior BCG immunization were randomized (double-blind) to receive three intradermal injections of DAR-901 or saline placebo or two injections of saline placebo followed by an intradermal injection of BCG. Antigen-specific functional and phenotypic CD4+ T cell responses along with effector phenotype of responder cells were measured by intracellular cytokine staining. Results DAR-901 recipients exhibited increased DAR-901 antigen-specific polyfunctional or bifunctional T cell responses compared to baseline. Vaccine specific CD4+ IFNγ, IL2, TNFα and any cytokine responses peaked at 7 days post-dose 3. Th1 responses predominated, with most responder cells exhibiting a polyfunctional effector memory phenotype. BCG induced greater CD4+ T cell responses than placebo while the more modest DAR-901 responses did not differ from placebo. Neither DAR-901 nor BCG induced substantial or sustained Th17 /Th22 cytokine responses. Conclusion DAR-901, a TB booster vaccine grown from the master cell bank of SRL 172 which was shown to prevent TB, induced low magnitude polyfunctional effector memory CD4+ T cell responses. DAR-901 responses were lower than those induced by BCG, a vaccine that has been shown ineffective as a booster to prevent tuberculosis disease. These results suggest that induction of higher levels of CD4+ cytokine stimulation may not be a critical or pre-requisite characteristic for candidate TB vaccine boosters.

Here, we report an original approach to measure and characterize the forces exerted by proliferating multicellular spheroids. As force sensors, we used high aspect ratio PDMS pillars arranged as a ring that supports a growing breast tumour cell spheroid. After optical imaging and determination of the force application zones, we combined 3D reconstruction of the shape of each deformed PDMS pillar with the finite element method to extract the forces responsible for the experimental observation. We found that the force exerted by growing spheroids ranges between 100nN and 300nN. Moreover, the exerted force was dependent on the pillar stiffness and increased over time with spheroid growth."
https://openalex.org/W2946607409,"The study aimed to evaluate the histopathological characteristics of renal lesions in chronically infected sheep and with low titers of anti-Leptospira antibodies from a slaughterhouse. In the serological analysis, 24.74% (48/194) presented seroreactivity with a titer equal to or greater than 100. Among these seroreactive sheep, titers of 100 were predominant (58.33%, 28/48), with the highest titer being 1,600 (2.08%, 1/48). Serogroup Sejroe (sv. Hardjo) was the most frequent at 35.42% (17/48). Leptospiral DNA was verified in 4.12% (8/194) of the kidney samples tested, and no urine sample was positive. All the samples corresponded to the pathogenic species L. interrogans. The eight amplicons with 202-nucleotides were identical with two mismatches (presented 100% of identity) using the PCR targeting to secY gene. Histological sections of PCR-positive kidneys were submitted to direct detection by the anti-LipL32 immunohistochemistry (IHC) technique. The Leptospira spp. antigen was evident in 62.5% (5/8) of the kidneys. Positive staining was observed in the cytoplasm of tubular cells and in the form of brownish aggregates that adhered to tubular epithelial cells and projected into the lumen. Inflammatory lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, ranging from mild to moderate, with multifocal distribution, was the predominant finding in seroreactive animals (33.33%, 16/48). The demonstration of the leptospiral antigen lining the renal tubules through IHC of naturally infected sheep confirmed by PCR characterizes renal colonization in a species with the presence of histological changes compatible with leptospirosis."
https://openalex.org/W2946468781,"Macrophages play an important role in the host immune response to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, however, MAP is able to disrupt normal macrophage functions to avoid destruction. It is unclear whether the phenotypes of macrophages present in the target tissue play a role in the inability to clear MAP infection. The aim of this study was to identify macrophage phenotypes (host defense or resolution and repair) present within the bovine ileum of naturally infected cattle, as well as to ascertain abundance of each macrophage phenotype present during different stages of MAP infection. Immunofluorescent (IF) labeling was performed on frozen bovine mid-ileal tissue sections collected from 28 Holstein dairy cows. Comprehensive IF staining for cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-1Ra, IL-1β, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α, and uNOS, along with markers such as CD163, CD206, and TLR4, served to define the macrophage phenotypes. Overall, cows in the clinical stage of disease demonstrated significantly higher numbers of resolution and repair macrophages and lower numbers of host defense macrophages in the ileal tissue. Interestingly, subclinically affected cows with asymptomatic disease had a nearly equal ratio of host defense and resolution and repair macrophage phenotypes, whereas macrophage phenotype was skewed to a host defense macrophage in the tissues of the control noninfected cows. The preponderance of M2-like resolution and repair phenotype for macrophages in the tissues of cows with clinical disease would explain why the host fails to control and/or clear the infection, leading to a higher MAP burden. The results of the current study offer insight into the disparate macrophage phenotypes present in the bovine ileum during different stages of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2946471051,"Objectives Risk stratification has so far been evaluated under the assumption that women fully adhere to screening recommendations. However, the participation in German cancer screening programs remains low at 54%. The question arises whether risk-stratified screening is economically efficient under the assumption that adherence is not perfect. Method We have adapted a micro-simulation Markov model to the German context. Annual, biennial, and triennial routine screening are compared with five risk-adapted strategies using thresholds of relative risk to stratify screening frequencies. We used three outcome variables (mortality reduction, quality-adjusted life years, and false-positive results) under the assumption of full adherence vs. an adherence rate of 54%. Strategies are evaluated using efficiency frontiers and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Results The reduced adherence rate affects both performance and cost; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remain constant. The results of PSA show that risk-stratified screening strategies are more efficient than biennial routine screening under certain conditions. At any willingness-to-pay (WTP), there is a risk-stratified alternative with a higher likelihood of being the best choice. However, without explicit decision criteria and WTP, risk-stratified screening is not more efficient than biennial routine screening. Potential improvements in the adherence rates have significant health gains and budgetary implications. Conclusion If the participation rate for mammographic screening is as low as in Germany, stratified screening is not clearly more efficient than routine screening but dependent on the WTP. A more promising design for future stratified strategies is the combination of risk stratification mechanisms with interventions to improve the low adherence in selected high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2946133381,"Understanding which tobacco products adolescents use first can lead to insights for tobacco prevention interventions and policies. We used cross-sectional data from high school students who reported ever using a tobacco product from the 2017 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 1,053). In multivariable regressions, we examined how demographic and psychosocial factors were associated with adolescents’ first product tried and how first product tried was associated with current tobacco use (i.e., no use, use of a single product, use of multiple products) and frequency of tobacco use. Cigarettes (34.8%) and e-cigarettes (33.7%) were the most frequently reported first products tried, followed by cigars (15.6%), smokeless tobacco (10.7%), waterpipe (4.0%), and other tobacco products (i.e., pipe tobacco or some other tobacco product) (1.2%). Demographic differences in adolescents’ first product tried existed, with Black adolescents having higher odds of initiating tobacco use via cigars (aOR: 6.17, 95% CI: 3.75, 10.14). Adolescents who initiated tobacco use via cigars (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.13) or smokeless tobacco (aOR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.18, 5.04) had higher odds of being a multiple current tobacco product user, whereas adolescents who initiated tobacco use via e-cigarettes (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.93) had lower odds of being a multiple current tobacco product user. Additionally, adolescents who initiated tobacco use via smokeless tobacco had higher odds of currently using at least one tobacco product frequently (aOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.48), while adolescents who initiated tobacco use via e-cigarettes had lower odds of currently using at least one tobacco product frequently (aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.70). These findings suggest that most adolescents reported initiating tobacco use via cigarettes or e-cigarettes and that trying certain products first (e.g., cigars, smokeless tobacco) was associated with higher odds of multiple current tobacco product use."
https://openalex.org/W2946664165,"CD99 has been reported to be involved in T cell regulation. CD99 ligand involvement in the regulation of T cell activation has been postulated. In this study, recombinant CD99 proteins were produced and used as a tool for determining the role of CD99 and its ligand interaction. Recombinant CD99 proteins induced the upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-α expression, but not IFN-γ, in anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody activated T cells. The cytokine alteration was not observed in unstimulated T cells indicating the cytokine upregulation required the signal from T cell activation. The upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-α was, in addition, observed in CD3- mononuclear cell population including monocytes and NK cells. The recombinant CD99 proteins, however, did not affect either CD25, CD69 or MHC class II expression or T cell proliferation, upon T cell activation. The CD99 ligands were demonstrated to be expressed on monocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells, but not on B and T cells. Our results indicated the presence of CD99 ligands on leukocyte surface. Interaction between CD99 and its ligands involves the regulation of cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2945041920,"Unintended pregnancy in adolescence and early adulthood is stigmatized in the United States because it deviates from social norms that consider young people’s sexuality as a social problem. While limited, prior research has found that this stigma prevents young people from telling people in their lives about their pregnancies, for fear of judgment or negative reactions. We hypothesized that this selective disclosure of unintended pregnancy due to stigma would reduce the social support available to young pregnant people at a particularly vulnerable time—social support that we know is important for optimal physical and mental health of the young person, and the pregnancy (should they choose to carry to term). To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a qualitative study among young people to understand if and how they experienced stigma in relation to an unintended pregnancy, how this stigma shaped patterns of pregnancy disclosure, the implications for received social support, and participant thoughts on how to alleviate the influence of this stigma on their lives. In in-depth interviews with 25 young people in the San Francisco Bay area who had experienced at least one unintended pregnancy, using a thematic analysis approach, we found that the stigma of unintended pregnancy led participants to selectively disclose the pregnancy to limited people, which in turn cut them off from needed sources of social support. Black and Hispanic women disproportionately described this experience. Participants expressed a desire for programs that would connect young people who had experienced unplanned pregnancy to each other–either via the internet, organized groups through clinical care sites, college or high school campuses, or other forums—as a way to alleviate stigma, share perspectives and lessons learned, and otherwise build emotional and informational support networks for themselves where their usual support had fallen away."

The enclosed expressway network system like toll gates system in China can collect mounts of trip records which can be gathered for OD prediction. The paper develops a novel neural network, which is named Expressway OD Prediction Neural Network (EODPNN) for toll data-based prediction. The network consists of the following three modules: The Feature Extension Module, the Memory Module, and the Prediction Module. In the process, the attributes data which can reflect the city attribute such as GDP, population, and the number of vehicles are considered to embeded into the notwork to increase the accuracy of the model. For the applicability improvment of the model, we categorize the cities in multiple classes based on their economy and population scales in this paper, which can provide a higher accurate prediction of OD by EODPNN. The results shows that, comparing to the traditional model like ARIMA and SVM, or typical neural networks like Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory, the EODPNN delivers a better prediction performance. The method proposed in this paper has been fully verified and has a potential to transplant to the other OD data-based management systems for a more accurate and flexible prediction."

Endogenous vitamin D synthesis is affected by seasonal factors including sunlight exposure, raising the question whether seasonality determines the risk of vitamin D deficiency and may mask other clinical risk factors.Univariable and multiple regression analyses were performed in a retrospective cohort of 384 patients to determine risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Since the observed 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations followed a sinusoidal pattern over the year, all 25(OH)D concentrations were normalized for the predicted variability of the respective day of analysis based on a sinusoidal regression analysis of 25(OH)D test results obtained in more than 86,000 control serum samples.Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (63% and 55%, respectively) and associated with winter/spring seasons. After normalization of 25(OH)D concentrations for the day of analysis, vitamin D deficiency was associated with histories of complications related to inflammatory bowel disease, surgery, smoking and ongoing diarrhea while initial disease manifestation during adulthood, ongoing vitamin D supplementation and diagnosis of ulcerative colitis vs. Crohn's disease appeared to be protective. Multiple regression analyses revealed that vitamin D deficiency was associated with disease activity in Crohn's disease and anemia in ulcerative colitis patients. Only few deficient patients achieved sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations over time. However, increasing 25(OH)D concentrations correlated with improved Crohn's disease activity.Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and dependent on the season of the year. Following normalization for seasonality by sinusoidal regression analysis, vitamin D deficiency was found to be associated with parameters of complicated disease course while increasing 25(OH)D concentrations over time correlated with reduced activity of Crohn's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2946635271,"Raw transcriptomic data contain numerous RNA reads whose homology with template DNA doesn’t match canonical transcription. Transcriptome analyses usually ignore such noncanonical RNA reads. Here, analyses search for noncanonical mitochondrial RNAs systematically deleting 1 to 12 nucleotides after each transcribed nucleotide triplet, producing deletion-RNAs (delRNAs). We detected delRNAs in the human whole cell and purified mitochondrial transcriptomes, and in Genbank's human EST database corresponding to systematic deletions of 1 to 12 nucleotides after each transcribed trinucleotide. DelRNAs detected in both transcriptomes mapped along with 55.63% of the EST delRNAs. A bias exists for delRNAs covering identical mitogenomic regions in both transcriptomic and EST datasets. Among 227 delRNAs detected in these 3 datasets, 81.1% and 8.4% of delRNAs were mapped on mitochondrial coding and hypervariable region 2 of dloop. Del-transcription analyses of GenBank's EST database confirm observations from whole cell and purified mitochondrial transcriptomes, eliminating the possibility that detected delRNAs are false positives matches, cytosolic DNA/RNA nuclear contamination or sequencing artefacts. These detected delRNAs are enriched in frameshift-inducing homopolymers and are poor in frameshift-preventing circular code codons (a set of 20 codons which regulate reading frame detection, over- and underrepresented in coding and other frames of genes, respectively) suggesting a motif-based regulation of non-canonical transcription. These findings show that rare non-canonical transcripts exist. Such non canonical del-transcription does increases mitochondrial coding potential and non-coding regulation of intracellular mechanisms, and could explain the dark DNA conundrum."

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) with CVD in rural residents of Henan province of China. Basic information and medical history were gathered through face-to-face surveys from July 2013 to August 2015, and biochemical indicators were gathered in a laboratory setting. Logistic and restricted cubic splines regression analyses were used to estimate odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of CVD. A total of 1078 participants were included, the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was determined to be 25 ± 18 ng/ml, with 54.45% of the participants presenting vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL]. Moreover, the prevalence of CVD was 59.28% in the vitamin D deficient group, which was higher than in the insufficient (48.55%) and sufficient groups (52.78%). After adjusting for potential confounders, compared with the deficient group, the ORs (95%CI) of CVDs were 0.68 (0.50, 0.91) in the insufficient group and 0.81 (0.56, 1.16) in the sufficient group. A nonlinear (U-shaped) association was observed between the risk of CVD and 25(OH)D concentration. Further research suggested that the risk of CVD was higher in males than in females. In conclusion, a U-shape association between serum levels of 25(OH)D and the risk of CVD was identified in our study, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between vitamin D with the prevalence of CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2945556736,"Objectives To examine differences in growth trajectories of fetal brain fissures in the growth restricted fetus (FGR) compared to controls. Methods We selected a subgroup of 227 women with a singleton pregnancy from the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort. Participants received three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) examinations of the fetal brain at 22, 26 and 32 weeks of gestational age (GA). The left and right Sylvian, insula and parieto-occipital fissures (POF) were measured in standardized planes. Linear mixed models with adjustment for potential confounders were applied to estimate differences between the trajectories of brain fissure depth measurements of FGR and controls. Results 22 FGR and 172 controls provided 31 and 504 3D-US respectively for longitudinal brain fissure depth measurements. Success rates for the Sylvian and insula depth measurements were over 80% and for POF over 62% at all GA. In FGR compared to controls, the trajectory of the right Sylvian fissure depth was significantly decreased (ß = -4.30, 95%CI = -8.03;-0.56, p = 0.024) while its growth rate was slightly increased (ß = 0.02, 95%CI = 0.00;0.04, p = 0.04), after adjustment for GA, head circumference, gender, educational level and parity. Conclusions The small differences in brain fissure measurements between 22 and 32 weeks GA in FGR warrant further investigation in larger cohorts with postnatal follow-up."

Meanwhile, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) has been described as a protective molecule against the deleterious effects of uncontrolled inflammation. In this study, we compared the expression levels of TNFAIP3 in blood and psoriatic skin biopsies from psoriatic patients versus those in normal individuals. Additionally, the levels of TNFAIP3 protein in psoriatic skin biopsies were compared to those in normal individuals. Thirty psoriatic patients and 30 healthy participants (control group) were enrolled. The expression levels of TNFAIP3 in blood and skin were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, while the skin levels of TNFAIP3 protein were measured by western blot. Psoriatic patients showed significantly lower expression levels of TNFAIP3 in psoriatic skin and blood (P< 0.001) as well as of TNFAIP3 protein in psoriatic skin (P< 0.001) compared to controls. A significant lower expression of TNFAIP3 and TNFAIP3 protein in psoriatic skin was detected in moderate/severe cases compared to mild cases (P = 0.004 and 0.003 respectively). Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between TNFAIP3 mRNA in psoriatic tissue and psoriasis area severity index values (rs = -0.382, P-value = 0.037). In conclusion, TNFAIP3 may serve as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in psoriatic patients. Enhancing the expression and/or function of TNFAIP3 in the affected cell type may be a promising therapeutic strategy."

The need for arthroscopic application of the cells to simultaneously treat intra-articular pathologies of knee osteoarthritis is increasingly urgent. The purpose of this study was to optimize TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes for arthroscopic application. The optimal composition of chondrocytes and thrombin was initially determined by measuring the consolidation time of a diverse ratio of chondrocytes and thrombin mixed with 1 ml of fibrinogen. The consolidation time of the diverse ratio of fibrinogen and atelocollagen mixed with the determined optimal ratio of chondrocytes and thrombin was evaluated. The mixture of the determined optimal ratio of TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes, atelocollagen, fibrinogen, and thrombin was applied to the cartilage defect of the 3D printed knee joint model arthroscopically. The status of the mixture in the defect was then evaluated. Chondrogenic activities of TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes mixed with atelocollagen were evaluated. The determined ratio of TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes to thrombin was 8:2 and that of fibrin to atelocollagen was also 8:2. Excellent maintenance of conformation of the mixture of TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes, atelocollagen, fibrinogen, and thrombin in the cartilage defect of the 3D printed knee joint model was observed arthroscopically. Increased chondrogenic activities were observed in the group of TGF-β1-transduced chondrocytes mixed with atelocollagen.

Such beliefs are likely affected by people's intuitive theories of the real world. In three studies, people judged the effort required to cast spells that cause physical violations. People ranked the actions of spells congruently with intuitive physics. For example, people judge that it requires more effort to conjure up a frog than to levitate it one foot off the ground. A second study manipulated the target and extent of the spells, and demonstrated with a continuous measure that people are sensitive to this manipulation even between participants.

https://openalex.org/W2946091272,"The sea lamprey (Petromzons marinus) is a devastating invasive species that represents a significant impediment to restoration of the Laurentian Great Lakes. There is substantial interest in developing environmentally benign control strategies for sea lamprey, and many other aquatic invasive species, that employ the manipulation of semiochemical information (pheromones and chemical cues) to guide the movements of invaders into control opportunities (e.g. traps, locations for safe pesticide application, etc.). A necessary precursor to the use of semiochemicals in conservation activities is the identification of the chemical constituents that compose the odors. Here, we characterize the major nitrogenous substances from the water-soluble fraction of a skin extract that contains the sea lamprey alarm cue, a powerful repellent that has proven effective in guiding the movements of migrating sea lamprey in rivers. Nitrogenous compounds are suspected components of fish alarm cues as the olfactory sensory neurons that mediate alarm responses transduce amino acids and related compounds. A laboratory assay confirmed the behavioral activity contained in the alarm cue resides in the water-soluble fraction of the skin extract. This water-soluble fraction consisted primarily of creatine (70%), heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds (4.3%) and free amino acids (18.4%), respectively. Among the free amino acids characterized in our study, essential amino acids constituted 13% of the water-soluble fraction. Free amino acids isolated from the water-soluble fraction composed of arginine, phenylalanine, threonine, and asparagine 3.9, 2.7, 2.6 and 2.4% of the water-soluble fraction, respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the nature and use of the sea lamprey alarm cue in conservation activities."
https://openalex.org/W2945594121,"This research was undertaken to investigate the global role of the plant inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (IPCS), a non-mammalian enzyme previously shown to be associated with the pathogen response. RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that over-expression of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase isoforms AtIPCS1, 2 or 3 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in plant response to pathogens. In addition, genes associated with the abiotic stress response to salinity, cold and drought were found to be similarly down-regulated. Detailed analyses of transgenic lines over-expressing AtIPCS1-3 at various levels revealed that the degree of down-regulation is specifically correlated with the level of IPCS expression. Singular enrichment analysis of these down-regulated genes showed that AtIPCS1-3 expression affects biological signaling pathways involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. The up-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and lipid localization was also observed in the over-expressing lines."

Several meta-analyses using different methods have assessed the effectiveness of DOT compared to self-administered therapy (SAT). The results of these meta-analyses often conflict with some concluding DOT is superior and others that there is little or no difference. Meta-analyses can guide policymaking, but such analyses must be reliable. To assess the validity of a previous meta-analysis, we tried to reproduce it. We encountered problems with the previous analysis that did not allow for a meaningful reproduction. We describe the issues we encountered here. We then performed a new meta-analysis comparing the treatment outcomes of adults given treatment with SAT versus DOT. Outcomes in the new analysis are loss to follow-up, treatment failure, cure, treatment completed, and all-cause mortality. All data, documentation, and code used to generate our results is provided. Our new analysis included four randomized and three observational studies with 1603 and 1626 individuals respectively. The pooled relative risks (RR) are as follows: Lost to follow-up (RR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.7), Treatment Failure (RR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6, 2), Cure (RR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.8, 1.1), Treatment Completion (RR = 1, 95% CI 0.9, 1.1), Mortality (RR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6, 1.3). Based on data from our new meta-analysis, the magnitude of the difference between DOT and SAT for all reported outcomes is small, and none of the differences are statistically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2946068539,"Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of pneumonic plague, a disease involving uncontrolled bacterial growth and host immunopathology. Secondary septicemic plague commonly occurs as a consequence of the host inflammatory response that causes vasodilation and vascular leakage, which facilitates systemic spread of the bacteria and the colonization of secondary tissues. The mortality rates of pneumonic and septicemic plague are high even when antibiotics are administered. In this work, we show that primary pneumonic or secondary septicemic plague can be preferentially modeled in mice by varying the volume used for intranasal delivery of Y. pestis. Low volume intranasal challenge (10μL) of wild type Y. pestis resulted in a high frequency of lethal secondary septicemic plague, with a low degree of primary lung infection and rapid development of sepsis. In contrast, high volume intranasal challenge (30μL) yielded uniform early lung infection and primary disease and a significant increase in lethality. In a commonly used BSL2 model, high volume challenge with Y. pestis lacking the pigmentation locus (pgm-) gave 105-fold greater deposition compared to low volume challenge, yet moribund mice did not develop severe lung disease and there was no detectable difference in lethality. These data indicate the primary cause of death of mice in the BSL2 model is sepsis regardless of intranasal dosing method. Overall, these findings allow for the preferential modeling of pneumonic or septicemic plague by intranasal dosing of mice with Y. pestis."
https://openalex.org/W2946708292,"Purpose Obesity in adolescence has been shown to be related to cardiac geometric and functional changes. Cardiac dysfunction in adults with obesity could be attributed to chronic low-grade inflammation, apoptosis of cardiomyocyte, and glucose metabolic disorder. The aforementioned association in adolescents with obesity have never been well studied. Our aim was to determine the types of cardiac dysfunction in adolescents with obesity and survey the association between cardiac dysfunction and chronic low-grade inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose dysregulation in adolescents with obesity. Methods Adolescents aged between 10 and 20 years were enrolled in this study. Body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), and apoptosis marker M30 levels were measured. Echocardiographic indices were also measured. The association between serum biomarkers and echocardiographic function parameters was analyzed. Results Diastolic dysfunction was the major finding in the cardiac functional assessment. The main changes in glucose metabolism were elevated C-peptide level and insulin resistance. Hs-CRP, IL-6, and M30 levels also increased with adolescent obesity. M30 was the major biomarker that was highly correlated to diastolic dysfunction indices in adolescents with obesity. Conclusions Diastolic dysfunction was the main change in adolescent obesity. Insulin resistance, apoptotic marker M30, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were all elevated in adolescents with obesity. Only M30 was related to indices of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction among adolescents with obesity, rather than inflammation or insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2944995184,"The classic concept that GPCRs function as monomers has been challenged by the emerging evidence of GPCR dimerization and oligomerization. Rhodopsin (Rh) is the only GPCR whose native oligomeric arrangement was revealed by atomic force microscopy demonstrating that Rh exists as a dimer. However, the role of Rh dimerization in retinal physiology is currently unknown. In this study, we identified econazole and sulconazole, two small molecules that disrupt Rh dimer contacts, by implementing a cell-based high-throughput screening assay. Racemic mixtures of identified lead compounds were separated and tested for their stereospecific binding to Rh using UV-visible spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (Trp) 265 after illumination. By following the changes in UV-visible spectra and Trp265 fluorescence in vitro, we found that binding of R-econazole modulates the formation of Meta III and quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp265. In addition, electrophysiological ex vivo recording revealed that R-econazole slows photoresponse kinetics, whereas S-econazole decreased the sensitivity of rods without effecting the kinetics. Thus, this study contributes new methodology to identify compounds that disrupt the dimerization of GPCRs in general and validates the first active compounds that disrupt the Rh dimer specifically.-Getter, T., Gulati, S., Zimmerman, R., Chen, Y., Vinberg, F., Palczewski, K.

https://openalex.org/W2945146510,"Ulmus macrocarpa Hance as an oriental medicinal plant has shown enormous potential for the treatment of several metabolic disorders in Korea. Hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by the excess accumulation of lipid contents in the bloodstream, may lead to several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in this study, anti-hyperlipidemic potential of U. macrocarpa water extract (UME) was examined in vitro and in vivo using HepG2 cells and experimental rats, respectively. The hyperlipidemia in experimental rats was induced by the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) followed by oral administration of various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of UME for 6 weeks. As a result, the UME significantly improved the biochemical parameters such as increased the level of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCD-fed rats. In addition, UME also prevented lipid accumulation through regulating AMPK activity and lipid metabolism proteins (ACC, SREBP1 and HMGCR) in the HCD-fed rats as compared to the controls. Moreover, similar pattern of gene expression levels was confirmed in oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that UME prevents hyperlipidemia via activating the AMPK pathway and regulates lipid metabolism. Thus, based on the above findings, it is estimated that UME could be a potential therapeutic agent for preventing the hyperlipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2945610862,"Introduction It remains unclear whether trauma centers are effective for the treatment of injured pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate children’s mortality before and after the establishment a trauma center by using standard mortality ratios (SMR) and a modified observed-expected chart. Methods This was a single center, retrospective chart review study that included injured pediatric patients (age <16 years) who were transported to our trauma center by the emergency medical services from 2012 to 2016 in Japan. Results Our study included 143 subjects: 45 (31%) were preschoolers aged < 6 years, and 43 (30%) had an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16. After the trauma centers established, the number of patients increased (70% increase per month), as did the number of the patients with an ISS of 41–75. The percentage of indirect transportations was significantly higher in the trauma center than in the non-trauma center (49% vs. 28%; p < 0.05). The SMR was significantly lower in the trauma-center than in the non-trauma center (0.461 vs. 0.589; p < 0.05). The mean value of the modified observed-expected chart was significantly higher in the trauma-center than in the non-trauma center (4.6 vs. 2.3; p < 0.05). For the patients who were directly transferred to our center, the transfer distance was greater in the trauma-center than in the non-trauma center (6.8 vs. 6.2 km; p < 0.05). The time interval from hospital admission to initiation of computed tomography (15.5 vs. 33 minutes; p < 0.05) and to definitive care (44 vs. 64.5 minutes; p < 0.05) decreased in the after group compared to the non-trauma center. Conclusions The results of our study revealed that the centralization of pediatric injured pediatric patients in trauma centers improved the mortality rate in this population in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2946366892,"Sudangrass, Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf, is a vigorous forage crop that has also been used for biogas, paper, and electricity production. Due to the large biomass yields achieved by sudangrass and the large area of potential growth in Argentina seven sudangrass accessions from a collection of S. sudanense were analyzed to evaluate their potential as feedstocks for lignocellulosic bioethanol production, and to assess whether there is an association between the response to biotic and abiotic stresses and the composition of the biomass. The biomass composition was analyzed for major cell wall polymers, monosaccharides, and elemental composition. On average, 68% of stem lignocellulosic biomass was comprised of matrix polysaccharides and crystalline cellulose, representing a potential source of sugars for bioethanol production. Xylose was the predominant matrix polysaccharide monosaccharide comprising, on average, 45% of the total sugars, followed by arabinose, glucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, mannose, glucuronic acid, and fucose. Rhamnose was not detected in any of the biomasses analyzed. Silica was the most abundant element in sudangrass stem, followed by chloride, calcium, phosphorus and sulfur. We performed saccharification analyses after pretreatments. Alkaline pretreatment was more effective than water pretreatment. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment exposed different levels of recalcitrance among sudangrass accessions, whereas the water pretreatment did not. Phenological traits were also evaluated, showing significant variability among accessions. The comparison of major cell wall polymers and monosaccharide composition between tolerant and susceptible accessions to abiotic and biotic stresses suggests an association between the composition of the biomass and the response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2946710044,"Background Postcoital bleeding (PCB) is a common gynecological symptom that may cause concern among both patients and physicians. Current literature is inconclusive regarding management recommendations. Objective To identify risk-factors for dysplasia/cancer among patients presenting post-coital bleeding (PCB). Methods Using large health maintenance organization (HMO) database, all women reporting PCB in 2012–2015 were identified. PCB patient records in a single colposcopy center were reviewed. Age, marital status, ethnicity, gravidity, parity, BMI, smoking, PAP smear result (within 1 year of PCB presentation), colposcopy and biopsy results were recorded. Cases were matched by age and socio-economic enumeration area to controls accessing primary care clinics for routine care. Results Yearly incidence of PCB ranged from 400 to 900 per 100,000 women; highest among patients aged 26–30 years. Among the sample of 411 PCB cases with colposcopy, 201 (48.9%) had directed biopsy. Biopsy results included 68 cervicitis (33.8%), 61 koilocytosis/CIN 1/condyloma (30.3%), 44 normal tissue (21.9%), 25 cervical polyp (12.4%), 2 CIN 2/3 (1%) and 1 carcinoma (0.5%). Positive predictive value for koilocytosis/CIN 1 or higher pathology was 15.6% (64/411) and 0.7% for CIN 2 or higher grade pathology (3/411). In conditional logistic regression, multiparty was a protective factor: OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.22–0.88, P = 0.02), while pathological PAP smear was a related risk-factor: OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.31–8.35, P = 0.01). When compared to controls, PCB patients were significantly (P = 0.04) more likely to present CIN 1 or higher grade pathology (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.02–3.33). Conclusions Study results indicate that PCB may require colposcopy, especially for nulliparous women with an abnormal PAP smear."
https://openalex.org/W2945646284,"C/EBPα plays a key role in specifying myeloid lineage development. HoxA9 is expressed in myeloid progenitors, with its level diminishing during myeloid maturation, and HOXA9 is over-expressed in a majority of acute myeloid leukemia cases, including those expressing NUP98-HOXD13. The objective of this study was to determine whether HoxA9 directly represses Cebpa gene expression. We find 4-fold increased HoxA9 and 5-fold reduced Cebpa in marrow common myeloid and LSK progenitors from Vav-NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice. Conversely, HoxA9 decreases 5-fold while Cebpa increases during granulocytic differentiation of 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. Activation of exogenous HoxA9-ER in 32Dcl3 cells reduces Cebpa mRNA even in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting direct repression. Cebpa transcription in murine myeloid cells is regulated by a hematopoietic-specific +37 kb enhancer and by a more widely active +8 kb enhancer. ChIP-Seq analysis of primary myeloid progenitor cells expressing exogenous HoxA9 or HoxA9-ER demonstrates that HoxA9 localizes to both the +8 kb and +37 kb Cebpa enhancers. Gel shift analysis demonstrates HoxA9 binding to three consensus sites in the +8 kb enhancer, but no affinity for the single near-consensus site present in the +37 kb enhancer. Activity of a Cebpa +8 kb enhancer/promoter-luciferase reporter in 32Dcl3 or MOLM14 myeloid cells is increased ~2-fold by mutation of its three HOXA9-binding sites, suggesting that endogenous HoxA9 represses +8 kb Cebpa enhancer activity. In contrast, mutation of five C/EBPα-binding sites in the +8 kb enhancer reduces activity 3-fold. Finally, expression of a +37 kb enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene reporter is reduced ~2-fold in marrow common myeloid progenitors when the Vav-NUP98-HOXD13 transgene is introduced. Overall, these data support the conclusion that HoxA9 represses Cebpa expression, at least in part via inhibition of its +8 kb enhancer, potentially allowing normal myeloid progenitors to maintain immaturity and contributing to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia associated with increased HOXA9."
https://openalex.org/W2946277025,"This study aimed at estimating gastroenteritis (GE) incidence in all age groups of the Netherlands’ general population, with special emphasis on the role of children in GE burden, and the associated costs. Monthly from November 2014 to November 2016, a random sample of 2000 residents in the Netherlands was invited to complete a questionnaire on household characteristics and health complaints. We calculated GE incidence rates standardized to the Dutch population and used multivariable logistic regression models to identify potential risk factors. We calculated the costs related to resources used within the healthcare sector, the resources used by patients and their families, and productivity losses (paid worktime) due to GE. The overall standardized incidence rate was 0.81 GE episodes/person-year, with the highest rate in children ≤4 years (1.96 episodes/person-year). GE was observed more often in households with children (≤17 years), especially if children attended out-of-home childcare services, and among individuals with non-native Dutch ethnic background. Less GE was observed among employed persons aged 25–64 years, compared with those unemployed, but the opposite was observed in persons ≥65 years. The average costs per GE episode was €191, resulting in €945 million annual total costs for GE in the Netherlands (€55 per inhabitant). The majority of costs (55%) were attributable to productivity losses of the ill or their caregivers. In conclusion, GE still poses a significant burden, particularly in preschool children and adults living in households with children. Similar to other industrialized countries, the major factor driving the costs due to GE was the loss of productivity. This study also provides up-to-date baseline GE incidence rates and associated societal costs to better contextualize the burden of the disease in support of policy making."

https://openalex.org/W2945127716,"The simplified nervous system of Aplysia californica (Aplysia) allows for detailed studies of physiological and molecular changes in small sets of neurons. Sensory neurons of the biting and tail withdrawal reflexes are glutamatergic and show reduced L-Glutamate current density in aged animals, making them a good candidate to study age-related changes in glutamatergic responses. To examine if changes in ionotropic L-Glu receptor (iGluR) transcription underlie reduced physiology, mRNA expression of iGluR was quantified in two sensory neuron clusters of two cohorts of Aplysia at both sexual maturity (~8 months) and advanced age (~12 months). Sensory neuron aging resulted in a significant overall decrease in expression of iGluR subunits in both sensory neuron clusters and cohorts. Although the individual subunits differentially expressed varied between sensory neuron clusters and different cohorts of animals, all differentially expressed subunits were downregulated, with no subunits showing significantly increased expression with age. Overall declines in transcript expression suggest that age-related declines in L-Glu responsiveness in Aplysia sensory neurons could be linked to overall declines in iGluR expression, rather than dysregulation of specific subunits. In both sensory neuron clusters tested the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype was expressed at significantly greater levels than other iGluR subtypes, suggesting an in vivo role for NMDAR-like receptors in Aplysia sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2945506228,"Sex chromosomes stop recombining and accumulate differences over time. In particular, genes on the chromosome restricted to the heterogametic sex degenerate and become non-functional. Here, we investigated whether or not the degeneration of a plant Y chromosome was sufficient to cause ovules containing a Y to fail to develop, thereby eliminating the possibility of YY individuals. We used two genotypic assays to determine the genotype—XX, XY, or YY—of offspring from a single fruit of an otherwise normal male XY plant of Silene latifolia. The fruit contained fewer ovules than normal pistillate flowers, produced an equal offspring sex ratio, and generated no YY offspring. The results indicate that ovaries must contain an X chromosome to develop properly. While haploid selection has slowed down Y-chromosome degeneration in S. latifolia, we find that it has progressed sufficiently to prevent the proper development of ovules, and hence prevent the presence of YY individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2945995136,"Objective The aim of this study was to compare in vivo vs ex vivo liver stiffness in rats with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography using the histological findings as the gold standard. Methods Eighteen male Wistar rats aged 16–18 months were divided into a control group (n = 6) and obese group (n = 12). Liver stiffness was measured with shear wave velocity (SWV) using the ARFI technique both in vivo and ex vivo. The degree of fibrosis, steatosis and liver inflammation was evaluated in the histological findings. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was applied to relate the SWV values to the histological parameters. Results The SWV values acquired in the ex vivo study were significantly lower than those obtained in vivo (P < 0.004). A significantly higher correlation value between the degree of liver fibrosis and the ARFI elastography assessment was observed in the ex vivo study (r = 0.706, P < 0.002), than the in vivo study (r = 0.623, P < 0.05). Conclusion Assessment of liver stiffness using ARFI elastography yielded a significant correlation between SWV and liver fibrosis in both the in vivo and ex vivo experiments. We consider that by minimising the influence of possible sources of artefact we could improve the accuracy of the measurements acquired with ARFI."
https://openalex.org/W2946355023,"Human interpersonal communications drive political, technological, and economic systems, placing importance on network link prediction as a fundamental problem of the sciences. These systems are often described at the network-level by degree counts —the number of communication links associated with individuals in the network—that often follow approximate Pareto distributions, a divergence from Poisson-distributed counts associated with random chance. A defining challenge is to understand the inter-personal dynamics that give rise to such heavy-tailed degree distributions at the network-level; primarily, these distributions are explained by preferential attachment, which, under certain conditions, can create power law distributions; preferential attachment’s prediction of these distributions breaks down, however, in conditions with no network growth. Analysis of an organization’s email network suggests that these degree distributions may be caused by the existence of individual participation-shift dynamics that are necessary for coherent communication between humans. We find that the email network’s degree distribution is best explained by turn-taking and turn-continuing norms present in most social network communication. We thus describe a mechanism to explain a long-tailed degree distribution in conditions with no network growth."

Somewhat paradoxically, it is embedded in a relationship, and employees’ independence also hinges on their leaders’ willingness to grant it. Analyzing this resource as part of the leader-follower relationship can be useful in exploring its beneficial, ambivalent, or detrimental reciprocal effects. We present two Actor-Partner Interdependence Models (APIM) which analyze leaders’ and followers’ independence as antecedents, and work engagement and emotional exhaustion as outcomes. We test our models on 112 pairs of UK workers, finding a significant partner effect between leaders’ independence and followers’ exhaustion. Our findings confirm the utility of a dyadic perspective for investigating leadership and well-being at work, and suggest improvements for leadership training and measures fostering job well-being."
