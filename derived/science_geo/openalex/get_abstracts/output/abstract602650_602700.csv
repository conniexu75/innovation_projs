https://openalex.org/W2783065878,"The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity."
https://openalex.org/W2783204408,"The circadian clock imposes daily rhythms in cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and DNA damage response. Perturbations of these processes are hallmarks of cancer and chronic circadian rhythm disruption predisposes individuals to tumour development. This raises the hypothesis that pharmacological modulation of the circadian machinery may be an effective therapeutic strategy for combating cancer. REV-ERBs, the nuclear hormone receptors REV-ERBα (also known as NR1D1) and REV-ERBβ (also known as NR1D2), are essential components of the circadian clock. Here we show that two agonists of REV-ERBs-SR9009 and SR9011-are specifically lethal to cancer cells and oncogene-induced senescent cells, including melanocytic naevi, and have no effect on the viability of normal cells or tissues. The anticancer activity of SR9009 and SR9011 affects a number of oncogenic drivers (such as HRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and others) and persists in the absence of p53 and under hypoxic conditions. The regulation of autophagy and de novo lipogenesis by SR9009 and SR9011 has a critical role in evoking an apoptotic response in malignant cells. Notably, the selective anticancer properties of these REV-ERB agonists impair glioblastoma growth in vivo and improve survival without causing overt toxicity in mice. These results indicate that pharmacological modulation of circadian regulators is an effective antitumour strategy, identifying a class of anticancer agents with a wide therapeutic window. We propose that REV-ERB agonists are inhibitors of autophagy and de novo lipogenesis, with selective activity towards malignant and benign neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2784063247,"Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents produces a high response rate in patients with desmoplastic melanoma. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare subtype of skin cancer, characterized by dense stroma and a lack of targetable mutations, but a high mutational load related to UV exposure. The authors conduct a retrospective pathology review of 1,058 melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. They identify 60 cases of DM and find that around 70% of these respond to PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade. DM shows high infiltration of CD8 cells and high expression of PD-L1, with specific patterns associated with response to immunotherapy. The analysis suggests that DM has one of the highest rates of response to immunotherapy, and that this rate is not related to mutational load but correlates with immune cell infiltration. Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma characterized by dense fibrous stroma, resistance to chemotherapy and a lack of actionable driver mutations, and is highly associated with ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage1. We analysed sixty patients with advanced desmoplastic melanoma who had been treated with antibodies to block programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). Objective tumour responses were observed in forty-two of the sixty patients (70%; 95% confidence interval 57–81%), including nineteen patients (32%) with a complete response. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a high mutational load and frequent NF1 mutations (fourteen out of seventeen cases) in these tumours. Immunohistochemistry analysis from nineteen desmoplastic melanomas and thirteen non-desmoplastic melanomas revealed a higher percentage of PD-L1-positive cells in the tumour parenchyma in desmoplastic melanomas (P = 0.04); these cells were highly associated with increased CD8 density and PD-L1 expression in the tumour invasive margin. Therefore, patients with advanced desmoplastic melanoma derive substantial clinical benefit from PD-1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy, even though desmoplastic melanoma is defined by its dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. The benefit is likely to result from the high mutational burden and a frequent pre-existing adaptive immune response limited by PD-L1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2784037295,"The cells of multicellular organisms receive extracellular signals using surface receptors. The extracellular domains (ECDs) of cell surface receptors function as interaction platforms, and as regulatory modules of receptor activation. Understanding how interactions between ECDs produce signal-competent receptor complexes is challenging because of their low biochemical tractability. In plants, the discovery of ECD interactions is complicated by the massive expansion of receptor families, which creates tremendous potential for changeover in receptor interactions. The largest of these families in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of 225 evolutionarily related leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs), which function in the sensing of microorganisms, cell expansion, stomata development and stem-cell maintenance. Although the principles that govern LRR-RK signalling activation are emerging, the systems-level organization of this family of proteins is unknown. Here, to address this, we investigated 40,000 potential ECD interactions using a sensitized high-throughput interaction assay, and produced an LRR-based cell surface interaction network (CSILRR) that consists of 567 interactions. To demonstrate the power of CSILRR for detecting biologically relevant interactions, we predicted and validated the functions of uncharacterized LRR-RKs in plant growth and immunity. In addition, we show that CSILRR operates as a unified regulatory network in which the LRR-RKs most crucial for its overall structure are required to prevent the aberrant signalling of receptors that are several network-steps away. Thus, plants have evolved LRR-RK networks to process extracellular signals into carefully balanced responses."

https://openalex.org/W2784057214,"Precision oncology applies genomic and other molecular analyses of tumor biopsies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. In addition to identifying therapeutic options, precision oncology tracks the response of a tumor to an intervention at the molecular level and detects drug resistance and the mechanisms by which it occurs. Integrative genomics can include sequencing specific panels of genes, exomes, or the entire triad of the patient's germline, tumor exome, and tumor transcriptome. Although the capabilities of sequencing technologies continue to improve, widespread adoption of genomics-driven precision oncology in the clinic has been held back by logistical, regulatory, financial, and ethical considerations. Nevertheless, integrative clinical sequencing programs applied at the point of care have the potential to improve the clinical management of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2783535000,"O-antigens are cell surface polysaccharides of many Gram-negative pathogens that aid in escaping innate immune responses. A widespread O-antigen biosynthesis mechanism involves the synthesis of the lipid-anchored polymer on the cytosolic face of the inner membrane, followed by transport to the periplasmic side where it is ligated to the lipid A core to complete a lipopolysaccharide molecule. In this pathway, transport to the periplasm is mediated by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, called Wzm-Wzt. Here we present the crystal structure of the Wzm-Wzt homologue from Aquifex aeolicus in an open conformation. The transporter forms a transmembrane channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a linear polysaccharide. Its nucleotide-binding domain and a periplasmic extension form 'gate helices' at the cytosolic and periplasmic membrane interfaces that probably serve as substrate entry and exit points. Site-directed mutagenesis of the gates impairs in vivo O-antigen secretion in the Escherichia coli prototype. Combined with a closed structure of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains, our structural and functional analyses suggest a processive O-antigen translocation mechanism, which stands in contrast to the classical alternating access mechanism of ABC transporters."

However, the differing propensity for citrullinated/non-citrullinated self-peptides to bind given HLA-DR allomorphs remains unclear. Here, we used a fluorescence polarization assay to determine a hierarchy of binding affinities of 34 self-peptides implicated in RA against three HLA-DRB1 allomorphs (HLA-DRB1*04:01/*04:04/*04:05) each possessing the SE motif. For all three HLA-DRB1 allomorphs, we observed a strong correlation between binding affinity and citrullination at P4 of the bound peptide ligand. A differing hierarchy of peptide-binding affinities across the three HLA-DRB1 allomorphs was attributable to the β-chain polymorphisms that resided outside the SE motif and were consistent with sequences of naturally presented peptide ligands. Structural determination of eight HLA–DR4–self-epitope complexes revealed strict conformational convergence of the P4-Cit and surrounding HLA β-chain residues. Polymorphic residues that form part of the P1 and P9 pockets of the HLA-DR molecules provided a structural basis for the preferential binding of the citrullinated self-peptides to the HLA-DR4 allomorphs.

This SE motif defines the P4 pocket of the high-risk HLA-DRB1 RA-associated allomorphs. Subsequent genome-wide association studies have shown that two polymorphisms encoding β-chain residues at positions 11 and 13 at the base of the P4 pocket are also strongly associated with RA susceptibility (16Raychaudhuri S.

We have previously reported the structural basis for the association of the SE, citrullination, and RA by showing the size and charge of the P4 pocket accommodate antigens with a citrulline residue in the P4 position but prevents the binding of peptide ligands with the natively-encoded positively-charged P4-Arg (24Scally S.W.

Although citrullinated peptides have generally shown enhanced affinity to several SE HLA-DRB1 allomorphs relative to native peptides (25Hill J.A. Southwood S. Sette A. Jevnikar A.M. Bell D.A.

Here, we show the affinity of citrullinated peptides across three different HLA-DRB1 allomorphs and reveal the key interactions between RA-associated antigens with RA-susceptible HLA-SE allomorphs. The crystals structures of eight citrullinated peptides bound to HLA-DRB1*04:01/*04:04/*04:05 demonstrate the close convergence of the binding modes of the P4-Cit, with polymorphisms outside this pocket accounting for the hierarchy of binding of citrullinated self-peptides to the three HLA-DR4 allomorphs. These specificities were also revealed in the natural repertoire of bound peptides, suggesting similar selective pressure operates on the self-peptide repertoire (immunopeptidome). Accordingly, we provide a molecular understanding of the interplay between the citrullination of self-antigens and HLA polymorphism that shape peptide-HLA binding affinity in RA. The extent to which polymorphisms outside the P4 pocket contribute to the natural selection of peptides was established using monoallelic HLA-DR4+ antigen-presenting cells. For this purpose, we generated transfectants of the T2 cell line (class II-deficient) that expressed HLA-DM and either HLA DRB1*04:01, 04:04, or 04:05. We have previously reported the immunopeptidomes of the HLA-DRB1*04:01+ and 04:04+ cells (24Scally S.W. Petersen J. Law S.C. Dudek N.L. Nel H.J. Loh K.L. Wijeyewickrema L.C. Eckle S.B. van Heemst J.

Each of these datasets contained over 1000–3000 unique and high confidence peptides, and although earlier reports have identified some HLA-DRB1*04:05 peptide ligands (26Rammensee H. Bachmann J.

These endogenous peptide sequences determined from multiple peptide elution experiments were identified with high confidence using strict bioinformatic criteria that includes the removal of common contaminants (27Dudek N.L. Tan C.T. Gorasia D.G. Croft N.P. Illing P.T. Purcell A.W.

The motif for HLA-DRB1*04:05 generated using this approach (Fig. 1A) was in general agreement with previously determined motifs (28Friede T. Gnau V. Jung G. Keilholz W. Stevanovič S. Rammensee H.G.

To compare these preferences to the other SE+ HLA-DR4 allomorphs examined in this study, we generated a heat map of difference matrices to highlight differences in their naturally selected ligands (Fig. 1B). These heat maps show the difference in amino acid usage at each position of the core 9-mer of peptides bound to HLA-DRB1*04:05 compared with HLA-DRB1*04:01 or HLA-DRB1*04:04. Of note, HLA-DRB1*04:05 selected peptides with similar P1 usage to HLA-DR*04:01 but a quite different selection of peptides with acidic P9 residues. In contrast, P1 and P9 differences were observed when HLA-DR*04:05-bound peptides were compared with HLA-DR*04:04-bound peptides, with an increase in aromatic amino acid selection at P1 and increased acidic residue selection at P9. Given the peptide preferences for the given HLA-DR4 allomorphs identified by mass spectrometry analyses, we next aimed to determine the propensity of self-antigens implicated in RA to bind to HLA-DRB1 molecules possessing the SE motif. To establish this, we modified and undertook a fluorescence polarization assay across 34 peptides (Table 1 and Fig. 2) to measure the IC50 of each peptide bound to HLA-SE+ allomorphs, namely HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*04:04, and HLA-DRB1*04:05. The HLA-DRB1*04:04 molecule varies from HLA-DRB1*04:01 at two polymorphic positions, K71R and G86V, whereas HLA-DRB1*04:05 also differs from HLA-DRB1*04:01 at two positions, namely K71R and D57S within the antigen-binding cleft (Fig. 3A). The predicted core (P1–P9) registers for the HLA–peptide interaction are underlined in Table 1, generally with a hydrophobic P1-anchor residue and a P4-Arg or P4-Cit. Arginine residues located outside the P4 pocket were also modified to citrulline and assayed for binding to the HLA-DRB1 allomorphs. The 34 peptides are predicted to place the citrulline in the P4 pocket, with the exception of the following: aggrecan-93Cit(89–103) and collagen type II-1240Cit(1237–1249) with a P2-Cit; histone-2B-73,80Cit(68–82) with a P3-Cit; and CILP-305Cit(297–309) with a P7-Cit. Four peptides possessed more than one citrullinated residue, namely aggrecan-93,95Cit(89–103), CILP-988,991,994Cit(983–995), vimentin-64,69,71Cit(59–71), and fibrinogen β-72,74Cit(69–81).Table 1IC50 values in (μm) candidate RA associated autoantigens bound to HLA-SE alleles: DRB1*04:01, DRB1*04:04 and DRB1*04:05 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Titration curve of self-peptide binding reflected by displacement of reporter fluorescent peptide in HLA-DRB1*04:01 (A), HLA-DRB1*04:04 (B), and HLA-DRB1:04:05 (C).

https://openalex.org/W2760353728,"We aimed to assess which factors correlate with collaborative behavior and whether such behavior associates with scientific impact (citations and becoming a principal investigator). We used the R index which is defined for each author as log(Np)/log(I1), where I1 is the number of co-authors who appear in at least I1 papers written by that author and Np are his/her total papers. Higher R means lower collaborative behavior, i.e. not working much with others, or not collaborating repeatedly with the same co-authors. Across 249,054 researchers who had published ≥30 papers in 2000-2015 but had not published anything before 2000, R varied across scientific fields. Lower values of R (more collaboration) were seen in physics, medicine, infectious disease and brain sciences and higher values of R were seen for social science, computer science and engineering. Among the 9,314 most productive researchers already reaching Np ≥ 30 and I1 ≥ 4 by the end of 2006, R mostly remained stable for most fields from 2006 to 2015 with small increases seen in physics, chemistry, and medicine. Both US-based authorship and male gender were associated with higher values of R (lower collaboration), although the effect was small. Lower values of R (more collaboration) were associated with higher citation impact (h-index), and the effect was stronger in certain fields (physics, medicine, engineering, health sciences) than in others (brain sciences, computer science, infectious disease, chemistry). Finally, for a subset of 400 U.S. researchers in medicine, infectious disease and brain sciences, higher R (lower collaboration) was associated with a higher chance of being a principal investigator by 2016. Our analysis maps the patterns and evolution of collaborative behavior across scientific disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2782577235,"Hybridization of eggs and sperm from closely related species can give rise to genetic diversity, or can lead to embryo inviability owing to incompatibility. Although central to evolution, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying post-zygotic barriers that drive reproductive isolation and speciation remain largely unknown. Species of the African clawed frog Xenopus provide an ideal system to study hybridization and genome evolution. Xenopus laevis is an allotetraploid with 36 chromosomes that arose through interspecific hybridization of diploid progenitors, whereas Xenopus tropicalis is a diploid with 20 chromosomes that diverged from a common ancestor approximately 48 million years ago. Differences in genome size between the two species are accompanied by organism size differences, and size scaling of the egg and subcellular structures such as nuclei and spindles formed in egg extracts. Nevertheless, early development transcriptional programs, gene expression patterns, and protein sequences are generally conserved. Whereas the hybrid produced when X. laevis eggs are fertilized by X. tropicalis sperm is viable, the reverse hybrid dies before gastrulation. Here we apply cell biological tools and high-throughput methods to study the mechanisms underlying hybrid inviability. We reveal that two specific X. laevis chromosomes are incompatible with the X. tropicalis cytoplasm and are mis-segregated during mitosis, leading to unbalanced gene expression at the maternal to zygotic transition, followed by cell-autonomous catastrophic embryo death. These results reveal a cellular mechanism underlying hybrid incompatibility that is driven by genome evolution and contributes to the process by which biological populations become distinct species."
https://openalex.org/W2783006353,"Mirror-self recognition (MSR) is a behavioral indicator of self-awareness in young children and only a few other species, including the great apes, dolphins, elephants and magpies. The emergence of self-awareness in children typically occurs during the second year and has been correlated with sensorimotor development and growing social and self-awareness. Comparative studies of MSR in chimpanzees report that the onset of this ability occurs between 2 years 4 months and 3 years 9 months of age. Studies of wild and captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have reported precocious sensorimotor and social awareness during the first weeks of life, but no comparative MSR research has been conducted with this species. We exposed two young bottlenose dolphins to an underwater mirror and analyzed video recordings of their behavioral responses over a 3-year period. Here we report that both dolphins exhibited MSR, indicated by self-directed behavior at the mirror, at ages earlier than generally reported for children and at ages much earlier than reported for chimpanzees. The early onset of MSR in young dolphins occurs in parallel with their advanced sensorimotor development, complex and reciprocal social interactions, and growing social awareness. Both dolphins passed subsequent mark tests at ages comparable with children. Thus, our findings indicate that dolphins exhibit self-awareness at a mirror at a younger age than previously reported for children or other species tested."

Two concentric circles of diameters 1.95mm (inner) and 3.45mm (outer) were manually placed on images centered on the optic nerve head, producing an annular region-of-interest. Image analysis with major vessel removal was performed using a custom program. Whole-image, whole-annulus, and sectoral PCDs were measured.Whole-image and whole-annulus PCDs in NAION and moderate and severe POAG eyes were significantly decreased compared to unaffected fellow eyes and control eyes (all P<0.001). Superior and temporal PCD values were affected more than other sectors in both NAION and POAG groups compared to control group. Whole-image and whole-annulus PCDs were not statistically different between NAION and POAG eyes (both P = 0.99). However, of all peripapillary sectors, the inferior sector PCD value was less affected in POAG eyes compared to NAION eyes (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis results also revealed a significant positive correlation between superior and inferior PCDs and corresponding RNFL thicknesses. The inferior sector correlation was greater in POAG than NAION eyes.While the whole PCD values were not different in chronic NAION and POAG, the greater correlation of inferior PCD with corresponding RNFL sectors in POAG compared to NAION suggests greater susceptibility of the inferior radial peripapillary capillary in the pathogenesis of POAG."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of HPV and cervical dysplasia in women of 60 years and above. Patients and methods From September 2013 until June 2015, 1051 women aged 60–89 years (mean 68 years) were sampled for an HPV test when attending an outpatient gynecology clinic. Women with positive results had a second HPV test and liquid based cytology (LBC), after 3.5 months on average. Those with a positive second HPV test were examined by colposcopy, and biopsy and a sample for LBC was obtained. Results The prevalence of HPV was 4.1%, (95%CI 3.0–5.5, n = 43) at the first test, and at the second test 2.6% remained positive (95%CI 1.7–3.8, n = 27). The majority of women positive in both HPV tests, had dysplasia in histology, 81.5% (22/27) (4 CIN 2–0.4%, 18 CIN 1–1.7%). HPV-related dysplasia was found in 2.1%, (95%CI 1.3–3.2, n = 22) of the 1051 women. Four of the 22 women with positive HPV tests also had abnormal cytology, one ASCUS and three CIN 1. No cancer or glandular dysplasia was detected. Conclusion A significant proportion of elderly women were found to have a persistent cervical HPV infection. Among them there was a high prevalence of CIN diagnosed by histology. The HPV test showed high sensitivity and specificity in detecting CIN in elderly women, while cytology showed extremely low sensitivity."

The performance of convective heat transfer is elevated in boundary layer flow region via nanoparticles. Magnetic dipole in presence of ferrites nanoparticles plays a vital role in controlling the thermal and momentum boundary layers. In perspective of this, the impacts of magnetic dipole on the nano boundary layer, steady, and laminar flow of incompressible ferromagnetic nanofluids are analyzed in the present study. Flow is caused by linear stretching of the surface. Fourier’s law of heat conduction is used in the evaluation of heat flux. Impacts of emerging parameters on the magneto—thermomechanical coupling are analyzed numerically. Further, it is evident that Newtonian heating has increasing behavior on the rate of heat transfer in the boundary layer.

https://openalex.org/W2784237649,"Background Opportunities for HIV testing could be enhanced by offering HIV self-testing (HIVST) in populations that fear stigma and discrimination when accessing conventional HIV counselling and testing in health care facilities. Field experience with HIVST has not yet been reported in French-speaking African countries. Methods The practicability of HIVST was assessed using the prototype the Exacto® Test HIV (Biosynex, Strasbourg, France) self-test in 322 adults living in Kisangani and Bunia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to World Health Organization’s recommendations. Simplified and easy-to-read leaflet was translated in French, Lingala and Swahili. Results Forty-nine percent of participants read the instructions for use in French, while 17.1% and 33.9% read the instructions in Lingala and Swahili, respectively. The instructions for use were correctly understood in 79.5% of cases. The majority (98.4%) correctly performed the HIV self-test; however, 20.8% asked for oral assistance. Most of the participants (95.3%) found that performing the self-test was easy, while 4.7% found it difficult. Overall, the results were correctly interpreted in 90.2% of cases. Among the positive, negative, and invalid self-tests, misinterpretation occurred in 6.5%, 11.2%, and 16.0% of cases, respectively (P<0.0001). The Cohen’s κ coefficient was 0.84. The main obstacle for HIVST was educational level, with execution and interpretation difficulties occurring among poorly educated people. The Exacto® Test HIV self-test showed 100.0% (95% CI; 98.8–100.0) sensitivity and 99.2% (95% CI; 97.5–99.8) specificity. Conclusions Our field observations demonstrate: (i) the need to adapt the instructions for use to the Congolese general public, including adding educational pictograms as well as instructions for use in the local vernacular language(s); (ii) frequent difficulties understanding the instructions for use in addition to frequent misinterpretation of test results; and (iii) the generally good practicability of the HIV self-test despite some limitations. Supervised use of HIVST is recommended among poorly-educated people."
https://openalex.org/W2783209833,"The gut microbiome contributes to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in which bacteria can be present within the epithelium. Epithelial barrier function is decreased in IBD, and dysfunctional epithelial mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been individually associated with IBD. We therefore hypothesized that the combination of ER and mitochondrial stresses significantly disrupt epithelial barrier function. Here, we treated human colonic biopsies, epithelial colonoids, and epithelial cells with an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, dinitrophenol (DNP), with or without the ER stressor tunicamycin and assessed epithelial barrier function by monitoring internalization and translocation of commensal bacteria. We also examined barrier function and colitis in mice exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or DNP and co-treated with DAPK6, an inhibitor of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). Contrary to our hypothesis, induction of ER stress (i.e. the unfolded protein response) protected against decreased barrier function caused by the disruption of mitochondrial function. ER stress did not prevent DNP-driven uptake of bacteria; rather, specific mobilization of the ATF6 arm of ER stress and recruitment of DAPK1 resulted in enhanced autophagic killing (xenophagy) of bacteria. Of note, epithelia with a Crohn's disease–susceptibility mutation in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 exhibited less xenophagy. Systemic delivery of the DAPK1 inhibitor DAPK6 increased bacterial translocation in DSS- or DNP-treated mice. We conclude that promoting ER stress–ATF6–DAPK1 signaling in transporting enterocytes counters the transcellular passage of bacteria evoked by dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby reducing the potential for metabolic stress to reactivate or perpetuate inflammation. The gut microbiome contributes to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in which bacteria can be present within the epithelium. Epithelial barrier function is decreased in IBD, and dysfunctional epithelial mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been individually associated with IBD. We therefore hypothesized that the combination of ER and mitochondrial stresses significantly disrupt epithelial barrier function. Here, we treated human colonic biopsies, epithelial colonoids, and epithelial cells with an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, dinitrophenol (DNP), with or without the ER stressor tunicamycin and assessed epithelial barrier function by monitoring internalization and translocation of commensal bacteria. We also examined barrier function and colitis in mice exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or DNP and co-treated with DAPK6, an inhibitor of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). Contrary to our hypothesis, induction of ER stress (i.e. the unfolded protein response) protected against decreased barrier function caused by the disruption of mitochondrial function. ER stress did not prevent DNP-driven uptake of bacteria; rather, specific mobilization of the ATF6 arm of ER stress and recruitment of DAPK1 resulted in enhanced autophagic killing (xenophagy) of bacteria. Of note, epithelia with a Crohn's disease–susceptibility mutation in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 exhibited less xenophagy. Systemic delivery of the DAPK1 inhibitor DAPK6 increased bacterial translocation in DSS- or DNP-treated mice. We conclude that promoting ER stress–ATF6–DAPK1 signaling in transporting enterocytes counters the transcellular passage of bacteria evoked by dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby reducing the potential for metabolic stress to reactivate or perpetuate inflammation. Bacteria within the epithelium are a pro-inflammatory threat.

Moreover, deranged mitochondrial ultrastructure, loss of mitochondrial proteins, lower levels of ATP, and increased susceptibility to uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation occur in some patients with IBD (6Schoultz I.

Similarly, suspected triggers of IBD reactivation can perturb mitochondrial function. For instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can cause relapses in IBD (7Klein A. Eliakim R.

A defect in epithelial barrier function is implied in this hypothesis. With the exceptions of uptake by microfold cells or dendritic cell pseudopodia, material in the gut lumen enters the submucosa via the epithelial tight junctions (paracellular) or by crossing the enterocyte (transcellular) (12Odenwald M.A. Turner J.R.

With that, it can be proposed that perturbed epithelial mitochondrial function would increase gut permeability to initiate disease or to precipitate relapses in IBD. Accordingly, mitochondrial damage induced by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation with the H+ ionophore, dinitrophenol (DNP), to model the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in IBD resulted in increased internalization into and transcytosis of Escherichia coli across epithelial monolayers (13Nazli A.

When improperly folded proteins accumulate in the ER, an ER stress program (or unfolded protein response (UPR)) occurs.

DNP promoted E. coli uptake; however, tunicamycin reduced this barrier defect (Fig. 1A). DNP treatment of colonic enteroid monolayers resulted in increased transcytosis of E. coli that was reduced by tunicamycin (Fig. 1B). Similarly, DNP-evoked increases in bacterial internalization into and translocation across the T84 (Fig. 1, C and D), Caco-2 (Fig. S1A), and HCT116 (Fig. S1B) human epithelial cell lines was significantly reduced by tunicamycin co-treatment. (Tunicamycin induction of ER stress was confirmed by GRP78 expression (Fig. S1C). Tunicamycin did not increase intracellular E. coli (Fig. S1D).) The NSAID indomethacin increased intracellularly viable E. coli in T84 cells (9Schoultz I. McKay C.M. Graepel R. Phan V.C. Wang A. Söderholm J. McKay D.M.

Epithelia treated with DNP display decreased TER (Fig. 1G) and increased FITC-dextran flux (Fig. 1H), and tunicamycin did not affect the increased paracellular permeability (Fig. 1, G and H). Respiratory rate (basal respiration, maximal respiration, and respiratory capacity) and ATP synthesis were reduced by DNP, and these bioenergetic parameters were not restored in tunicamycin co-treated cells (Fig. S3, A–C) (glycolysis was unaffected by DNP ± tunicamycin (Fig. S3D)). Analysis of the 16 h post-DNP + E. coli ± tunicamycin exposure revealed no significant increase in T84 cell apoptosis; however, there was an ∼50% decrease in viability by 36 h post-DNP + E. coli treatment that was significantly reduced by tunicamycin (Fig. S4). Reduced numbers of intracellular bacteria could reflect a reduction in extracellular bacteria; analysis at the end of each experiment revealed no significant differences in the extracellular bacteria numbers between the groups. The reduced number of viable intracellular E. coli in DNP + tunicamycin co-treated epithelia could be due to uptake inhibition. Immunolocalization (Fig. 2A) and flow cytometry (Fig. 2B) revealed tunicamycin did not affect the DNP-induced internalization of inert fluorescent beads, suggesting that inhibition of the rate of E. coli internalization is not the cause of the reduced viable bacteria in DNP + tunicamycin-treated T84 epithelia. However, the DNP-induced increase in inert E. coli (K-12) fluorescent bioparticles was abrogated by co-treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 2C), suggestive of degradation and loss of fluorescence. E. coli + DNP + tunicamycin-treated epithelia displayed enhanced autophagy as gauged by increased expression of LC3-II and beclin-1 and LC3 immunostaining (Fig. 2, D and E). Postulating that autophagy would target the internalized bacteria (i.e. xenophagy), co-localization of autophagosomes and internalized bacteria was observed in DNP + tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, tunicamycin antagonism of DNP-induced E. coli internalization was lost in cells lacking the autophagy protein ATG16L1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, tunicamycin inhibition of the DNP-induced increased viable intracellular E. coli was not apparent in colonoids from mice expressing the knocked-in variant of Atg16l1T316A (homologous to the IBD susceptibility trait ATG16L1T300A) (Fig. 3, C and D). These findings suggest that ER stress ablated the DNP effect by mobilizing autophagy to kill the bacteria. In accordance, rapamycin (induces autophagy (23Drion C.M. Borm L.E. Kooijman L. Aronica E.

Autophagy inhibition with 3-MA increased numbers of viable bacteria in tunicamycin-treated wildtype T84 cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, rapamycin prevented the DNP-induced increase in live E. coli HS transcytosis across human colonic biopsies (Fig. 4D). Like tunicamycin, rapamycin did not affect the DNP-induced drop in TER or FITC-dextran flux across T84 epithelia (Fig. 4, E and F). Although the ability of tunicamycin to induce xenophagy was lost in ATG16L1 transgenic cells, tunicamycin reduced the number of viable bacteria in DNP-treated NOD2−/− T84 cells (Fig. 4G).Figure 4Induction of autophagy prevents DNP-induced barrier defect.

ER stress triggers three major pathways: IRE1 that activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK, and splicing of XBP1 transcription factor; PERK that leads to eIF2α phosphorylation, which acts as a transcription factor, and ATF4 mobilization, another transcription factor; and ATF6 that when truncated serves as a transcription factor (25Grootjans J.

Tunicamycin resulted in subtle but significant increase in spliced XBP1, ATF4, and ATF6α in T84 cells (Fig. 5A). Transient siRNA knockdown of ATF6α, PERK, or IRE1 in T84 cells revealed that only the former blocked tunicamycin inhibition of DNP-evoked increases in viable intracellular E. coli (Fig. 5B). Selective pharmacological inhibitors of JNK (p-JNK increased in the cells) (Fig. 5C), IRE1, and PERK did not affect tunicamycin abrogation of the DNP effect (Fig. 5, D and E), focusing attention on ATF6. The increase in autophagy (i.e. LC3-II protein expression) evoked by tunicamycin was absent in ATF6α siRNA-treated T84 cells (Fig. 5F). DAPK1 is mobilized downstream of ATF6 to regulate autophagy and apoptosis (26Gade P. Kimball A.S. DiNardo A.C. Gangwal P. Ross D.D. Boswell H.S. Keay S.K. Kalvakolanu D.V.

T84 epithelia exposed to E. coli + DNP + tunicamycin displayed increased DAPK1 expression compared with cells treated with ATF6 siRNA (Fig. 6A) (PERK and IRE1 siRNA did not inhibit DAPK1 protein expression (Fig. S5)). Use of a selective DAPK1 inhibitor, designated DAPK6, blocked tunicamycin's ability to reduce DNP-evoked increases in viable intracellular E. coli by T84 cells (Fig. 6B) and the mobilization of autophagy (Fig. 6, C and D). Moreover, bacteria–autophagosome co-localization was completely lost in DAPK6 co-treated cells (Fig. 6D). Likewise, knockdown of DAPK1 in T84 cells resulted in inhibition of the tunicamycin effect and increased viable intracellular E. coli numbers (Fig. 7A). Although the activation of ATF6 was not affected by DAPK1 siRNA in DNP + E. coli + tunicamycin-treated epithelia, the increased autophagy was lost, showing that the signal needed to up-regulate autophagy by ER stress was interrupted in the absence of DAPK1 (Fig. 7B). Co-treatment with DAPK1 siRNA and DAPK6 prevented the ability of tunicamycin to block the effects of DNP, but to a degree that was not statistically different from either DAPK6 or DAPK1 siRNA alone (Fig. 7C). These data also support the specificity of DAPK6 in targeting DAPK1, an important observation in the context of the murine in vivo experiments presented below. Mice treated with DAPK6 were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis as gauged by disease activity score (Fig. 8A), colon length (Fig. 8B), and weight loss (Fig. 8C). DAPK6 treatment resulted in increased translocation of aerobic bacteria into the colonic mucosal, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and the spleen (Fig. 8, D–F). Furthermore, intra-rectal delivery of DNP resulted in small increases in bacterial translocation that were aggravated by DAPK6 and alleviated by tunicamycin co-treatment (Fig. 8, G–I). Increased numbers of bacteria, including E. coli, in the mucosa and gut epithelium can characterize IBD (1Elliott T.R. Hudspith B.N. Wu G. Cooley M. Parkes G. Quiñones B. Randall L. Mandrell R.E.

Continuing our efforts to understand the glycobiology of E. gracilis, we identified a candidate phosphorylase sequence, designated EgP1, by proteomic analysis of an enriched cellular protein lysate. We expressed recombinant EgP1 in Escherichia coli and characterized it in vitro as a β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase. BLASTP identified several hundred EgP1 orthologs, most of which were from Gram-negative bacteria and had 37–91% sequence identity to EgP1. We heterologously expressed a bacterial metagenomic sequence, Pro_7066 in E. coli and confirmed it as a β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase, albeit with kinetics parameters distinct from those of EgP1. EgP1, Pro_7066, and their orthologs are classified as a new glycoside hydrolase (GH) family, designated GH149. Comparisons between GH94, EgP1, and Pro_7066 sequences revealed conservation of key amino acids required for the phosphorylase activity, suggesting a phosphorylase mechanism that is conserved between GH94 and GH149. We found bacterial GH149 genes in gene clusters containing sugar transporter and several other GH family genes, suggesting that bacterial GH149 proteins have roles in the degradation of complex carbohydrates.

Here, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel LRIG1-interacting proteins and mined data from the BioPlex (biophysical interactions of ORFeome-based complexes) protein interaction data repository. The putative LRIG1 interactors identified in the screen were functionally evaluated using a triple co-transfection system in which HEK293 cells were co-transfected with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, LRIG1, and shRNAs against the identified LRIG1 interactors. The effects of the shRNAs on the ability of LRIG1 to down-regulate platelet-derived growth factor receptor α expression were evaluated. On the basis of these results, we present an LRIG1 protein interaction network with many newly identified components.

https://openalex.org/W2782581179,"Multiple factors introduce uncertainty into projections of species distributions under climate change. The uncertainty introduced by the choice of baseline climate information used to calibrate a species distribution model and to downscale global climate model (GCM) simulations to a finer spatial resolution is a particular concern for mountainous regions, as the spatial resolution of climate observing networks is often insufficient to detect the steep climatic gradients in these areas. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling framework together with occurrence data on 21 understory bamboo species distributed across the mountainous geographic range of the Giant Panda, we examined the differences in projected species distributions obtained from two contrasting sources of baseline climate information, one derived from spatial interpolation of coarse-scale station observations and the other derived from fine-spatial resolution satellite measurements. For each bamboo species, the MaxEnt model was calibrated separately for the two datasets and applied to 17 GCM simulations downscaled using the delta method. Greater differences in the projected spatial distributions of the bamboo species were observed for the models calibrated using the different baseline datasets than between the different downscaled GCM simulations for the same calibration. In terms of the projected future climatically-suitable area by species, quantification using a multi-factor analysis of variance suggested that the sum of the variance explained by the baseline climate dataset used for model calibration and the interaction between the baseline climate data and the GCM simulation via downscaling accounted for, on average, 40% of the total variation among the future projections. Our analyses illustrate that the combined use of gridded datasets developed from station observations and satellite measurements can help estimate the uncertainty introduced by the choice of baseline climate information to the projected changes in species distribution."

However, the substrate diversity of currently identified phosphorylases is relatively small, limiting their practical applications. To address this limitation, we developed a high-throughput screening approach using the activated substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-glucoside (DNPGlc) and inorganic phosphate for identifying glycoside phosphorylase activity and used it to screen a large insert metagenomic library. The initial screen, based on release of 2,4-dinitrophenyl from DNPGlc in the presence of phosphate, identified the gene bglP, encoding a retaining β-glycoside phosphorylase from the CAZy GH3 family. Kinetic and mechanistic analysis of the gene product, BglP, confirmed a double displacement ping-pong mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl–enzyme intermediate. X-ray crystallographic analysis provided insights into the phosphate-binding mode and identified a key glutamine residue in the active site important for substrate recognition. Substituting this glutamine for a serine swapped the substrate specificity from glucoside to N-acetylglucosaminide. In summary, we present a high-throughput screening approach for identifying β-glycoside phosphorylases, which was robust, simple to implement, and useful in identifying active clones within a metagenomics library.

These enzymes ordinarily carry out phosphorolysis by transferring a glycosyl moiety from the non-reducing end of a di- or polysaccharide substrate onto inorganic phosphate, thereby generating a sugar 1-phosphate (Fig. 1A) (10Kitaoka M.

GPs distinguish themselves from most CAZymes in that the hydrolytic free energy associated with the glycosidic ester linkage of the sugar 1-phosphate product is roughly equivalent to that of the glycosidic linkage in the glycan substrate. Accordingly, the equilibrium constants for the reactions catalyzed by most GPs is close to 1; thus the equilibrium position can be tipped in favor of glycoside synthesis by manipulation of reaction conditions (11Zhang Y.-H.

However, given the vast number of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) known, it seems likely that 30 is a significant underestimate of the actual number of GP activities present in nature, especially because the use of phosphorolysis to metabolize glycans is inherently more energetically favorable for a cell than hydrolysis because the released sugar 1-phosphates feed directly into the glycolysis pathway without the need for expenditure of ATP (16Zhang Y.-H.

Given this metabolic efficiency advantage, and considering the wide range of diverse glycans that are metabolized by microbes, it is probable that glycoside phosphorylases are more widespread than previously thought. Indeed, it seems likely that numerous forms of carbohydrates are metabolized through phosphorolysis, suggesting an abundance of GPs to discover in nature.

However, to our knowledge no function-based metagenomics screening approach has yet been developed that targets GP-encoded genes. A central challenge in designing the needed screen is that of distinguishing phosphorylase activity from the related hydrolase activity in a high-throughput manner (Fig. 1A). We report here the development and implementation of such a high-throughput screening approach to identify GP activity. By screening of a library derived from a passive mine tailings biochemical reactor system (BCR) fed with lignocellulosic biomass (25Mewis K. Armstrong Z. Song Y.C. Baldwin S.A. Withers S.G. Hallam S.J. Biomining active cellulases from a mining bioremediation system.J. Biotechnol. 2013; 167 (23906845): 462-471https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we identified a previously unknown β-retaining GP from CAZy family GH3, and we report on its structural and mechanistic characterization. Our screening approach is based on the use of activated aryl glycosides as easily monitored substrates for glycoside phosphorylases when deployed in the presence of phosphate. The BCR library is a large insert (fosmid) library with an average insert size of 40 kilobases first described by Mewis et al. (25Mewis K. Armstrong Z. Song Y.C. Baldwin S.A. Withers S.G. Hallam S.J. Biomining active cellulases from a mining bioremediation system.J. Biotechnol. 2013; 167 (23906845): 462-471https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The authors used the BCR library to search for novel cellulose-degrading enzymes. Therefore, in testing the parallel screening approach to identify GPs, we focused in this case on identifying fosmid clones encoding enzymes with the capacity of phosphorolyzing the β1,4-glucosidic linkages of cellulose and cello-oligosaccharides. The design of the screen was based upon the notion that, because many GPs are members of CAZy GH families, they might accept an activated aryl glycoside substrate, transferring the glycosyl moiety to added phosphate. This concept has not been tested previously, to our knowledge, apart from one demonstration with a nucleotide phosphorylase (26Mazzella J.L. Parkin D.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Mechanistic diagnoses of N-ribohydrolases and purine nucleoside phosphorylase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2111-2112https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar), although the concept has parallels with previous work on nucleotide-dependent glycosyltransferases (27Lairson L.L. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Alternative donor substrates for inverting and retaining glycosyltransferases.Chem. Commun. 2007; 2007 (17220972): 365-367Crossref Google Scholar). 2,4-Dinitrophenyl glucoside (DNPGlc) was used to test this idea because it is highly activated (pKa of 2,4-dinitrophenol = 4.0) (28Pearce P.J. Simkins R.J. Acid strengths of some substituted picric acids.Can. J. Chem. 1968; 46: 241-248https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and has proved to be a near-universal substrate for glucosidases. Furthermore, the low pKa value of the phenol allows direct, continuous assays to be performed at pH values down to below 4 without the need to add base in a stopped manner. The choice of a glucoside was based on the cellulolytic origin of the library to be screened, which thus might contain cello-oligosaccharide-degrading phosphorylases, especially because a number of cellulases and β-glucosidases had already been identified within this library (25Mewis K. Armstrong Z. Song Y.C. Baldwin S.A. Withers S.G. Hallam S.J. Biomining active cellulases from a mining bioremediation system.J.

To test whether glycoside phosphorylases can accept DNPGlc as a substrate in the presence of phosphate and to catalyze glucosyl transfer to generate glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P), three known GPs that cleave cellobiose or cellodextrins were cloned and expressed. Two of these GPs, cellobiose phosphorylase (29Sih C.J. Nelson N.M. McBee R. Biological synthesis of cellobiose.Science. 1957; 126 (13486068): 1116-1117https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (RtCBP) and cellodextrin phosphorylase (30Sheth K.

These enzymes use a β-inverting mechanism in which phosphate attacks directly on the sugar anomeric center, forming α-glucose 1-phosphate (αGlc-1-P) (Fig. 1B). The third enzyme, the β-glucosidase/N-acetylglucosaminidase Nag3 from Cellulomonas fimi (31Mayer C. Vocadlo D.J. Mah M. Rupitz K. Stoll D. Warren R.A. Withers S.G.

As shown in Fig. 2A all three enzymes cleave DNPGlc in the presence of phosphate, as can be observed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 400 nm. Importantly, all three enzymes are only minimally active in the absence of phosphate. Confirmation that the rate stimulation is due to phosphorylase action was provided by TLC analysis of reaction mixtures, which revealed that all three catalyzed the transfer of the glucosyl moiety of DNPGlc to inorganic phosphate thereby forming Glc-1-P (Fig. 2B). These findings therefore validate the concept of the screen. 1) Lysed extracts from metagenomic clones are initially assayed using DNPGlc in the presence of phosphate to detect both GHs and GPs. 2) Those clones that show activity are then rescreened in the absence of phosphate to weed out the glycosidases. 3) It is also possible that phosphate could stimulate GH activity through a specific binding effect of some sort, or simply activation at a higher ionic strength, leading to false positives. 4) TLC analysis of this much smaller number of reaction mixtures is used to confirm the presence of the sugar phosphate product. Fosmid clones capable of producing Glc-1-P are sequenced and analyzed to identify the open reading frames (ORFs) responsible for the observed GP activity. An overview of the screening process is provided in Fig. 3.Figure 3Overview of the GP functional metagenomic screening method. Whole library, metagenomic library in 384-well plate format was screened in the presence of DNPGlc and phosphate. Clones that gave an A400 value greater than mean + 4 S.D. were consolidated and re-arrayed into a master library. Consolidation, the Master library was screened with DNPGlc in the presence (×3) and absence (×3) of phosphate. Analysis, a Student's t test was performed between the averages of the A400 values of each clone in the absence and presence of phosphate. Clones possessing a significantly (p < 0.05) higher activity with phosphate present were analyzed for the production of glucose 1-phosphate using TLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The BCR fosmid library was constructed using Escherichia coli EPI300 as an expression host and contained 18,048 clones in 47 × 384-well plates (25Mewis K.

Following replication of the BCR master library, a total of 880 clones failed to grow, leaving 17,168 clones to be screened. Functional screening using DNPGlc in the presence of phosphate yielded 54 active clones with activity greater than the mean + 4 S.D., a hit rate of 0.31% (Fig. 4B). To distinguish clones with GP activity from those that are GHs, the 54 hits were re-arrayed into a 96-well master plate and rescreened both in the presence and absence of phosphate (Fig. 4C). Each assay condition was run in triplicate, and positive phosphate dependence was determined by performing a t test between a clone's A400 values in 0 and 50 mm phosphate. A confidence level of 95% (p value < 0.05) was set as a threshold to determine whether to further validate the clone. Of the 54 clones from the master library, 12 displayed activity in the presence of phosphate exceeding the set threshold. The reaction products of these 12 clones were then examined by TLC analysis (Fig. 4D). Of the 12 clones so analyzed, two were found to produce Glc-1-P in the presence of phosphate (29K06 and 31P01). Complete sequencing of the two fosmid clones revealed they were contiguous with one another, overlapping with 23,247 bp at 100% identity (Fig. S1A). Thirty one open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted from the 29K06 clone and 32 from 31P01. BLASTX query of these against the CAZy database revealed a novel GH3 ORF (hereafter referred to as bglP) located within the overlapping region of the two fosmids. Based on amino acid sequence analysis (Fig. 5), bglP was predicted to encode a β-glucosidase/N-acetylglucosaminidase (NagZ) from a hexosaminidase sub-group of GH3 characterized by the sequence motif (33Vocadlo D.J.

However, the motif found in bglP had substitutions at two residues: KH(FI)PGDGX4DQH (underlined residues correspond to Asp-193 and Gln-200 in Nag3 and boldface residues correspond to the His-Asp catalytic dyad). This modified motif is also present in the only other known glycoside phosphorylase in the GH3 family, Nag3 (31Mayer C. Vocadlo D.J. Mah M. Rupitz K. Stoll D. Warren R.A. Withers S.G.

To confirm that the activity detected was indeed associated with this gene, it was subcloned into a pET expression vector and heterologously expressed and purified. Indeed, activity assays of purified enzyme confirmed that BglP catalyzes the phosphate-dependent cleavage of DNPGlc seen from the 29K06 and 31P01 source clones (Fig. S1B). The other known GP in the GH3 family, C. fimi Nag3, has been subjected to mechanistic characterization to probe its proposed two-step double-displacement mechanism and has been confirmed to produce βGlc-1-P and βGlcNAc1P, although no 3D structure has been obtained. In fact, Nag3 was the first retaining β-glycoside phosphorylase described and, like BglP, was shown to also catalyze hydrolysis, but at a reduced rate relative to phosphorolysis (32Macdonald S.S. Blaukopf M. Withers S.G. N-Acetylglucosaminidases from CAZy family GH3 are really glycoside phosphorylases, thereby explaining their use of histidine as an acid/base catalyst in place of glutamic acid.J. Biol.

Comparison of their amino acid sequences (Fig. 5) reveals a high degree of sequence similarity between BglP and Nag3 (55% similarity and 39% identity), making it probable that the two enzymes follow the same mechanism involving a covalent α-glucosyl enzyme intermediate (Fig. 1C). To confirm this and to allow comparison of the two enzymes, a kinetic and mechanistic analysis of BglP was performed. Kinetic parameters were determined for cleavage of three different substrates, para-nitrophenyl β-glucoside (pNPGlc), 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-glucoside (DNPGlc), and para-nitrophenyl β-N-acetylglucosaminide (pNPGlcNAc), both in the absence of phosphate and in the presence of increasing concentrations (Fig. 6, A–C). Based upon both kcat/Km and kcat values (Table 1), it is apparent that BglP prefers glucoside substrates over N-acetylglucosaminides, kcat/Km values for pNPGlc being ∼10-fold higher and kcat values being ∼100-fold higher than those of the hexosaminide. A second distinction of the two substrate classes is that kcat for the two glucoside substrates increases over 10-fold as phosphate concentrations are raised, whereas increases for pNPGlcNAc are much more modest at 1.5–2-fold. Km values also increase with phosphate, by up to 20–30-fold for the glucosides, with the net consequence being that kcat/Km values remain approximately constant. These observations for the glucosides reflect classic kinetic behavior for a ping-pong mechanism with substrates for which the second step (cleavage of the glycosyl enzyme) is rate-limiting (Fig. 1C) (34Ulusu N.N. Evolution of enzyme kinetic mechanisms.J. Mol. Evol. 2015; 80 (25987355): 251-257https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of an alternative, better, nucleophile (phosphate) into the reaction accelerates the decomposition of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate through provision of a second pathway (k3P). The net effect is to not only raise kcat values but a"

To investigate this, we established a NAD+-intermediate specific reporter system to identify factors required for salvage of metabolically linked nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinic acid (NA). Mutants lacking components of the NatB complex, NAT3 and MDM20, appeared as hits in this screen. NatB is an Nα-terminal acetyltransferase responsible for acetylation of the N terminus of specific Met-retained peptides. In NatB mutants, increased NA/NAM levels were concomitant with decreased NAD+. We identified the vacuolar pool of nicotinamide riboside (NR) as the source of this increased NA/NAM. This NR pool is increased by nitrogen starvation, suggesting NAD+ and related metabolites may be trafficked to the vacuole for recycling. Supporting this, increased NA/NAM release in NatB mutants was abolished by deleting the autophagy protein ATG14. We next examined Tpm1 (tropomyosin), whose function is regulated by NatB-mediated acetylation, and Tpm1 overexpression (TPM1-oe) was shown to restore some NatB mutant defects. Interestingly, although TPM1-oe largely suppressed NA/NAM release in NatB mutants, it did not restore NAD+ levels. We showed that decreased nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nma1/Nma2) levels probably caused the NAD+ defects, and NMA1-oe was sufficient to restore NAD+. NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of Nma1 and Nma2 appears essential for maintaining NAD+ levels. In summary, our results support a connection between NatB-mediated protein acetylation and NAD+ homeostasis.

NAD+ biosynthesis is highly conserved between yeast and vertebrates. In yeast, NAD+ is synthesized de novo from tryptophan or salvaged from intermediates, such as NA, NAM, and NR (Fig. 1A). The NAD+ levels maintained by these pathways converge at several different points and share cellular pools of ATP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, and glutamine, while adding to total pools of ribose, AMP, phosphate, formate, alanine, glutamate, and others. NAD+ is a NADP+ precursor, which, like NAD+, is carefully balanced with its reduced form to maintain a favorable redox state. Some of these molecules contribute to other biosynthesis pathways or have signaling functions. Therefore, the cell must maintain these metabolites and their flux in a controlled manner. We do not fully understand all of the mechanisms by which the cell can sense and tune these metabolites, but some known NAD+ homeostasis-regulatory mechanisms include transcriptional control, feedback inhibition, and enzyme or metabolite compartmentalization (1Kato M.

The complex and dynamic flexibility of NAD+ precursors makes studying NAD+ metabolism complicated. For example, NAM can both replenish NAD+ pools and inhibit the activity of NAD+-consuming enzymes. In addition, little is known about the signaling pathways that regulate NAD+ precursor homeostasis, in part due to the lack of sensitive and specific genetic screening systems to identify these NAD+ homeostasis factors. We have previously shown that NR-mediated NAD+ synthesis plays important roles in the maintenance of NAD+ pools and calorie restriction-induced life span (19Lu S.P. Kato M. Lin S.J.

In this study, we developed a reporter system targeting the NA/NAM branch of NAD+ metabolism. The hypothesis is that cells defective in NA/NAM salvage (Fig. 1A) would show altered NA/NAM release.

Hole K. Arnesen T. Molecular, cellular, and physiological significance of N-terminal acetylation.Int. Rev. Cell Mol.

N-terminal acetylation plays important roles in regulating protein stability, complex formation, and subcellular localization and has been implicated in various cellular processes and human diseases (27Aksnes H. Hole K. Arnesen T. Molecular, cellular, and physiological significance of N-terminal acetylation.Int. Rev. Cell Mol.

Here, we characterized the NatB mutants as well as the NatB downstream targets to provide a molecular basis underlying NatB-mediated regulation of NAD+ homeostasis. We first determined whether cells indeed release more NA and/or NAM when NA/NAM salvage is blocked. A cross-feeding assay is established using bna6Δnrk1Δnrt1Δ mutants as “recipient cells” (depend on NA or NAM for growth) and mutants of interest as “feeder cells.” In this system, recipient cells cannot grow on niacin-free SD (NA/NAM-free), but when feeder cells are placed in proximity, feeder cell–released NA or NAM supports recipient cell growth by “cross-feeding.” As a result, this assay determines relative levels of total NA and NAM released by feeder cells. As shown in Fig. 1B (top), recipient cells were spread onto niacin-free SD plates as a lawn. Next, npt1Δ (blocks NA salvage) and pnc1Δ (blocks NAM salvage) feeder cells were spotted on top of the lawn and allowed to grow. Recipient cells near the npt1Δ and pnc1Δ feeder spots appeared as satellite colonies after 3 days, and the number and size of the satellite colonies positively correlate with the amount of NA/NAM released from the feeders. To separate NAM release from NA/NAM release, PNC1 was deleted in the recipient cell strain to block its ability to utilize NAM. Based on the biochemical function of Npt1 and Pnc1 (Fig. 1A), we expect that npt1Δ cells release more NA (and perhaps NAM) and pnc1Δ cells release more NAM. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1B (bottom), pnc1Δ feeder cells failed to support the growth of the new recipient strain (bna6Δnrk1Δnrt1Δpnc1Δ, which cannot utilize NAM). In contrast, npt1Δ cells still supported the growth of bna6Δnrk1Δnrt1Δpnc1Δ. These results confirmed that mutants with altered NA/NAM homeostasis could be identified using this system. Next, we used the haploid yeast deletion collection as feeder cells to identify mutants with increased NA/NAM release (Fig. 1C). Mutants were assigned a score of 2–5 (WT = 1). A higher score represents more NA/NAM release. To eliminate false-positives, mutants with a score of ≥3 (81 mutants) were reexamined. A total of ∼70 mutants passed the secondary screen (Table S1). Known NAD+ homeostasis factors were identified, including npt1Δ and pnc1Δ. The mdm20Δ and nat3Δ mutants were among the top hits. Nat3 and Mdm20 are subunits of NatB, a member of the NATs that adds an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the α-amino group on the first amino acid of a protein (23Polevoda B. Cardillo T.S. Doyle T.C.

To verify that observed phenotypes are due to the featured mutations and not to secondary cryptic mutations in the deletion collection, we reconstructed all deletion mutants used in this study. We confirmed both nat3Δ and mdm20Δ indeed released more NA/NAM (Fig. 1D, top). Similar to pnc1Δ mutant (Fig. 1B), both nat3Δ and mdm20Δ released mostly NAM, not NA (Fig. 1D, bottom). Fig. 1E showed that increased NA/NAM release in nat3Δ and mdm20Δ cells correlates with increased intracellular NA/NAM levels determined by a quantitative liquid assay. To understand how NatB complex affects NAM/NAD+ homeostasis, we first tested whether Pnc1 level or activity was reduced in NatB mutants because Pnc1 is a major NAM metabolic factor (nicotinamidase), and the pnc1Δ mutant showed strong NAM release (Fig. 1B). Although Pnc1 is not a predicted NatB substrate, Pnc1 may be indirectly regulated by NatB. Our results showed that Pnc1 activity (Fig. 2B) and protein expression (Fig. 2A) were only slightly decreased in nat3Δ cells. Interestingly, although pnc1Δ cells show WT level of NAD+ under normal (NA-rich) growth conditions (19Lu S.P. Kato M. Lin S.J. Assimilation of endogenous nicotinamide riboside is essential for calorie restriction-mediated life span extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

These studies suggest that additional factors probably contribute to the altered NAM/NAD+ homeostasis observed in NatB mutants. Increased production of NR has been associated with increased activity of the Pi-sensing PHO signaling pathway (17Lu S.P. Lin S.J. Phosphate-responsive signaling pathway is a novel component of NAD+ metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21349851): 14271-1428110.1074/jbc.M110.217885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether NatB mutants showed altered PHO activity by measuring the activity of rAPase (Pho5, a periplasmic phosphatase activated by PHO signaling). As shown in Fig. 2D (left), PHO activity was moderately increased in the nat3Δ mutant. As controls, deleting PHO5 largely blocked the increase of rATPase activity. The residual rATPase activity observed in nat3Δpho5Δ cells probably came from Pho5-like phosphatases Pho11 and Pho12. Interestingly, observed PHO activation in nat3Δ cells appeared independent of the conventional PHO transcription factor Pho4-Pho2 complex, because deleting PHO4 did not significantly reduce the PHO activation in nat3Δ cells (Fig. 2D, left). Consistent with this result, deleting PHO4 did not prevent NA/NAM release in nat3Δ cells (Fig. 2D, right panel). Next, we determined whether and how NR contributes to increased NAM in NatB mutants. Intracellular NAM may come from NR via the reactions of cytoplasmic nucleosidases Urh1 and Pnp1 (Fig. 2E, top) (30Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L.

As shown in Fig. 2E (bottom), deleting URH1 and PNP1 largely diminished NA/NAM release in NatB mutants. Moreover, deleting the vacuolar phosphatase PHO8 (Fig. 2E, top) (17Lu S.P. Lin S.J. Phosphate-responsive signaling pathway is a novel component of NAD+ metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

These results suggest that increased NAM in NatB mutants probably results from vacuolar NR, which is converted to NAM by cytoplasmic nucleosidases Urh1 and Pnp1. Vacuolar NR may exit the vacuole through the Fun26 transporter (human lysosomal hENT homolog) into the cytoplasm (17Lu S.P. Lin S.J. Phosphate-responsive signaling pathway is a novel component of NAD+ metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Supporting this, deleting FUN26 indeed blocked NAM release in the NatB mutant (Fig. 2E, bottom). Moreover, nat3Δ cells carrying deletions of URH1 and PNP1 (which converts NR to NAM) showed increased intracellular NR levels (Fig. 2F, middle left) and reduced NA/NAM levels (Fig. 2F, middle right). Deleting PHO8 (which produces NR in the vacuole) blocked the increase of both NR and NA/NAM in nat3Δ cells (Fig. 2F, bottom panels). All of these results support vacuolar NR as the main source of increased NA/NAM in nat3Δ cells. So far, our results suggest that in NatB mutants, increased NA/NAM release is probably due to increased NAM production, which originates from vacuolar NR. It remains unclear how NAD+ and its intermediates are transported into the vacuole for turnover and storage. Because most cellular NAD+ and NADH are bound to proteins, NAD+ intermediates may enter the vacuole via vesicular trafficking and/or autophagy. Because autophagy is a critical regulator of organelle homeostasis and recycling of macromolecules (31Delorme-Axford E. Guimaraes R.S. Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J.

By use of a spring B. napus mapping population carrying the genome content of B. oleracea and testing this population under 10 to 18 h photoperiod and 18 to 20 0C (day) temperature conditions, we identified a major QTL on the chromosome C1 affecting flowering time without being influenced by photoperiod and temperature, and a major QTL on C9 affecting flowering time under a short photoperiod (10 h); in both cases, the QTL alleles reducing the number of days to flowering in B. napus were introgressed from the late flowering species B. oleracea. Additive effect of the C1 QTL allele at 14 to18 h photoperiod was 1.1 to 2.9 days; however, the same QTL allele exerted an additive effect of 6.2 days at 10 h photoperiod. Additive effect of the C9 QTL at 10 h photoperiod was 2.8 days. These two QTL also showed significant interaction in the control of flowering only under a short-day (10 h photoperiod) condition with an effect of 2.3 days. A few additional QTL were also detected on the chromosomes C2 and C8; however, none of these QTL could be detected under all photoperiod and temperature conditions. BLASTn search identified several putative flowering time genes on the chromosomes C1 and C9 and located the physical position of the QTL markers in the Brassica genome; however, only a few of these genes were found within the QTL region. Thus, the molecular markers and the genomic regions identified in this research could potentially be used in breeding for the development of early flowering photoinsensitive B. napus canola cultivars, as well as for identification of candidate genes involved in flowering time variation and photosensitivity."

In a recent study, conducted in a semi-urban area (Franceville, Gabon), HBV infection was found to be more prevalent among HIV infected individuals. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus infection among HIV infected individuals, predominantly under antiretroviral therapy, living in fully urbanized area: Libreville, capital of Gabon. Serological and molecular tests were performed to detect HBV infection among patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). We used Monolisa HBsAg ULTRA, Anti-HBc Plus and Anti-HBs Plus EIA kits for serological analyses. HBV DNA viral load (HBV DNA VL) was determined by real time PCR and molecular characterization of HBV strains was performed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial HBV surface and core genes. At all, 70.2% of patients were under antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of HBsAg was 8.8% (43/487). Detectable HBV DNA was found in 69.7% (30/43) of HBsAg positive patients and in 17.5% (24/137) HBsAg negative patients. HBV DNA VL was significantly higher among patient with CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3 than those with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells/mm3 (p = 0.008). We confirmed the presence of HBV sub-genotypes QS-A3 (40%), and A4 (20%) and HBV-E genotype (40%). The percentage of resistance to Lamivudine was high (40%) and varied according to the M204V/I motif. Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) was found in patients with isolated HBcAb and among patients who had completed their HBsAg seroconversion. We detected HBV DNA for one patient without any HBV serological marker. This study provides a new landmark for the comprehension of HBV infection in PLHA in urban areas. OBI enhances HBV DNA prevalence and should be investigated in all HBsAg negative individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2784121738,"Development of unconventional shale gas reservoirs (SGRs) has been boosted by the advancements in two key technologies: horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. A large number of multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (MsFHW) have been drilled to enhance reservoir production performance. Gas flow in SGRs is a multi-mechanism process, including: desorption, diffusion, and non-Darcy flow. The productivity of the SGRs with MsFHW is influenced by both reservoir conditions and hydraulic fracture properties. However, rare simulation work has been conducted for multi-stage hydraulic fractured SGRs. Most of them use well testing methods, which have too many unrealistic simplifications and assumptions. Also, no systematical work has been conducted considering all reasonable transport mechanisms. And there are very few works on sensitivity studies of uncertain parameters using real parameter ranges. Hence, a detailed and systematic study of reservoir simulation with MsFHW is still necessary. In this paper, a dual porosity model was constructed to estimate the effect of parameters on shale gas production with MsFHW. The simulation model was verified with the available field data from the Barnett Shale. The following mechanisms have been considered in this model: viscous flow, slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, and gas desorption. Langmuir isotherm was used to simulate the gas desorption process. Sensitivity analysis on SGRs’ production performance with MsFHW has been conducted. Parameters influencing shale gas production were classified into two categories: reservoir parameters including matrix permeability, matrix porosity; and hydraulic fracture parameters including hydraulic fracture spacing, and fracture half-length. Typical ranges of matrix parameters have been reviewed. Sensitivity analysis have been conducted to analyze the effect of the above factors on the production performance of SGRs. Through comparison, it can be found that hydraulic fracture parameters are more sensitive compared with reservoir parameters. And reservoirs parameters mainly affect the later production period. However, the hydraulic fracture parameters have a significant effect on gas production from the early period. The results of this study can be used to improve the efficiency of history matching process. Also, it can contribute to the design and optimization of hydraulic fracture treatment design in unconventional SGRs."

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a key direct activator of ion channels, including Kir channels. The gasotransmitter carbon monoxide has been shown to regulate Kir channel activity by altering channel–PIP2 interactions. Here, we tested in two cellular models the effects and mechanism of action of another gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), thought to play a key role in cellular responses under ischemic conditions. Direct administration of sodium hydrogen sulfide as an exogenous H2S source and expression of cystathionine γ-lyase, a key enzyme that produces endogenous H2S in specific brain tissues, resulted in comparable current inhibition of several Kir2 and Kir3 channels. This effect resulted from changes in channel-gating kinetics rather than in conductance or cell-surface localization. The extent of H2S regulation depended on the strength of the channel–PIP2 interactions. H2S regulation was attenuated when channel–PIP2 interactions were strengthened and was increased when channel–PIP2 interactions were weakened by depleting PIP2 levels. These H2S effects required specific cytoplasmic cysteine residues in Kir3.2 channels. Mutation of these residues abolished H2S inhibition, and reintroduction of specific cysteine residues back into the background of the cytoplasmic cysteine-lacking mutant rescued H2S inhibition.

The PTS is initiated by phosphorylation of enzyme I (EI) by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The EI phosphorylation state determines the phosphorylation states of all other PTS components and is thought to play a central role in the regulation of several metabolic pathways and to control the biology of bacterial cells at multiple levels, for example, affecting virulence and biofilm formation. Given the pivotal role of EI in bacterial metabolism, an improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling its activity could inform future strategies for bioengineering and antimicrobial design.

We show that at experimental conditions favoring the monomeric form of EI, αKG promotes dimerization and acts as an allosteric stimulator of the enzyme.

Phosphorylated EI transfers the phosphoryl group to the phosphocarrier protein HPr. Thereafter, the phosphoryl group is transferred to a sugar-specific enzyme II and finally to the incoming sugar (Fig. 1a). Recently, the small-molecule metabolite α-ketoglutarate (αKG) was shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of EI (inhibition constant, KI = ˜2.2 mm) (4Doucette C.D. Schwab D.J. Wingreen N.S.

Here, we develop a flexible enzymatic assay to investigate the effect of perturbations of the monomer–dimer equilibrium of Escherichia coli EI on the activity of αKG against the enzyme. We show that at physiological concentrations of EI and PEP that promote dimerization of EI ([EI] > KD, [PEP] > Km), αKG acts as a competitive inhibitor of EI. In contrast, at physiological conditions favoring the monomeric form of the enzyme ([EI] < KD, [PEP] < Km), αKG allosterically stimulates EI autophosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is one of the few examples of a small molecule metabolite being reported to both inhibit and stimulate the activity of the same enzyme depending on the experimental conditions (the other known case is ATP that can be a substrate or an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase) (17Cabrera R.

The effect of the EI ligands, PEP and αKG, on the monomer–dimer equilibrium of the enzyme was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). The sedimentation velocity data indicate that the monomer–dimer equilibrium of EI is shifted toward the monomeric species at concentrations of the enzyme of <1 μm (Fig. 2a) and that addition of PEP or αKG results in a substantial stabilization of the dimeric state (Fig. 2, b and c). Our results are consistent with the more than 10-fold decrease in dimerization KD reported previously for EI upon addition of PEP or αKG (5Venditti V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M.

The addition of 10 mm PEP to a NMR sample containing 1 mm 15N-labeled E. coli HPr and ˜0.05 μm E. coli EI (unlabeled) results in substantial chemical shift perturbations for the 1H–15N transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) (18Pervushin K.

As previously noted, HPr does not interact directly with PEP, nor can it be phosphorylated in the absence of EI (19Weigel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. Sugar transport by the bacterial phosphotransferase system: primary structure and active site of a general phosphocarrier protein (HPr) from Salmonella typhimurium.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257 (6754732): 14499-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed spectral changes are attributed to HPr phosphorylation via EI. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the HPr spectrum relaxes back to the unphosphorylated form (Fig. 3a), which is consistent with the low thermodynamic stability of phosphorylated histidine residues (20Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of histidine residues in proteins.Eur. J.

SOFAST-HMQC experiments for recording two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation spectra of proteins within a few seconds.J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33 (16341750): 199-21110.1007/s10858-005-4425-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) to monitor the time evolution of the phosphoryl transfer reaction from PEP to HPr via EI. SOFAST NMR experiments are ideally suited for real-time investigations on reaction kinetics, because they allow acquisition of 2D NMR spectra within seconds (21Schanda P. Kupce E. Brutscher B. SOFAST-HMQC experiments for recording two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation spectra of proteins within a few seconds.J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33 (16341750): 199-21110.1007/s10858-005-4425-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For this particular case, ˜0.05 μm unlabeled EI and 1 mm 15N-labeled HPr are mixed in 500 μl of reaction buffer (see “Experimental procedures”) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a conventional 5-mm NMR tube. Thereafter, the reaction is started by addition of the desired amount of PEP (note that the PEP stock solution is preincubated at 37 °C). The sample is mixed in the NMR tube and equilibrated at 37 °C for 1 min in the NMR magnet. The reaction is then monitored for 20 min by running a series of 2D 1H-15N SOFAST-TROSY spectra (1 min each). The phosphoryl transfer reaction is slow on the chemical-shift time scale, and distinct NMR peaks are observed for the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated species (Fig. 3b). To monitor the evolution of the phosphoryl transfer reaction, we have used the NMR peak intensities of residues Ala10, Gly13, and Gly54 because they are characterized by high signal-to-noise ratio and are well resolved throughout the experiment (Fig. 3b). Because the early time points are more important in determining the initial rate of the reaction, we limited our analysis to the disappearance of the unphosphorylated species, for which NMR peaks with high signal-to-noise ratios are obtained at the beginning of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (note the phosphorylated HPr peaks are not present at time zero; Fig. 3b). Signal intensities are plotted versus time, and the linear portion of the decay is fit to obtain the initial rate of change (Fig. 3d). To convert the reaction rate from change in signal intensity over time to change in concentration of unphosphorylated HPr over time, the NMR signal intensities at time zero for Ala10, Gly13, and Gly54 were obtained by extrapolation (Fig. 3d) and considered to correspond to the expected signal intensity for a 1 mm HPr sample. Unphosphorylated HPr concentration at any time point is reported as the average over the three analyzed peaks (Fig. 3e). To evaluate the effect of an increased concentration of dimeric EI on the activity of the enzyme, enzyme kinetic data were collected at a fixed concentration of EI (˜0.05 μm), PEP (1 mm), and HPr (1 mm), and with increasing concentration of the inactive EI mutant H189Q (EIQ). His189 is located within the N-terminal domain of the enzyme and does not participate in the dimer interface or in PEP/αKG binding to EIC. Indeed, EIQ has been recently reported to have the same equilibrium dissociation constant for dimerization and to form an identical EIC dimer as the wildtype EI (11Venditti V. Tugarinov V. Schwieters C.D. Grishaev A. Clore G.M. Large interdomain rearrangement triggered by suppression of micro- to millisecond dynamics in bacterial enzyme I.Nat.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133 (21162528): 424-42710.1021/ja109866wCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, EIQ cannot receive the phosphoryl group from PEP but can still interact with the wildtype protein (EIWT) to form an active EI dimer. As expected, increasing the concentration of EIQ from 0 to 10 μm doubles the HPr phosphorylation rate measured by our NMR assay (Fig. 4a). It is worth noticing that EIQ is inactive in the absence of EIWT (Fig. 4a). Therefore, the increased enzymatic activity observed by adding EIQ to a sample with a low concentration of EIWT (˜0.05 μm) is due to an increased population of dimeric EI (which goes from 8% in the absence of EIQ to 80% in the presence of 10 μm EIQ) and not to the eventual presence of EIWT contaminations in purified EIQ. The dependence of the HPr phosphorylation rate on the total concentration of EI ([EITOT] = [EIWT] + [EIQ]) can be fit considering that (i) only dimeric EI can catalyze the phosphoryl transfer reaction (13Seok Y.J. Zhu P.P. Koo B.M. Peterkofsky A. Autophosphorylation of enzyme I of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system requires dimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250 (9753638): 381-38410.1006/bbrc.1998.9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), (ii) binding of PEP to both monomeric subunits results in stabilization of the EI dimer, and (iii) binding of PEP to one monomeric subunit affects the KD for EI dimerization to a minor extent. To reduce the number of fitted parameters, we have assumed that the dimer KD is not affected by binding of a single molecule of PEP to EI (see Equations 1–12 under “Experimental procedures”). The fit was performed in DynaFit 4.0 (23Kuzmic P. DynaFit: a software package for enzymology.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 467 (19897096): 247-28010.1016/S0076-6879(09)67010-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) by keeping Km and KD for the free enzyme (KD,free) to their measured values (300 and 1 μm, respectively; note that the 5 μm value for KD,free reported in Fig. 1b was measured in the absence of Mg2+) (5Venditti V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. Structural basis for enzyme I inhibition by α-ketoglutarate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23506042): 1232-124010.1021/cb400027qCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and by optimizing the dissociation constant for the EI dimer saturated with PEP (KD,bound) and the catalytic rate constant for phosphoryl transfer (kphosp). The results of the fitting are shown in Fig. 4a and are consistent with the pronounced stabilization of the EI dimer induced by PEP binding observed by AUC experiments (fitted KD,bound < 10−7 m). A similar kinetic model (Equations 13–20 under “Experimental procedures”) and the same equilibrium constants were used to fit the dependence of the rate of HPr phosphorylation on the concentration of PEP at a fixed concentration of enzyme (˜0.05 μm; Fig. 4b). It is worth noticing that increasing the concentration of PEP beyond 1.3 mm makes the phosphoryl transfer reaction too fast to be monitored by our method at our experimental conditions (37 °C and ˜0.05 μm enzyme). Therefore, kphosp cannot be accurately determined by the available data. However, our fitted results (kphosp > 10,000 s−1) are in good agreement with the fast conversion rates previously reported for the EI autophosphorylation reaction (24Meadow N.D. Mattoo R.L. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. Transient state kinetics of enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli: equilibrium and second-order rate constants for the phosphotransfer reactions with phosphoenolpyruvate and HPr.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16171394): 12790-1279610.1021/bi0502846Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data reported in the previous sections indicate that dimerization stimulates the phosphoryl transfer activity of EI (Fig. 4a) and that increasing the concentration of αKG from 0 to 20 mm shifts the monomer–dimer equilibrium toward the enzymatically active EI dimer (Fig. 2). In this section, we evaluate the effect of αKG on the phosphoryl transfer activity of EI at experimental conditions that promote the monomeric or dimeric form of the enzyme. At low concentration of enzyme (<KD,free) and substrate (<Km), we expect EI to exist predominantly as a monomer. In this case, the addition of small concentrations of αKG (<KI) will act synergistically with PEP in saturating the binding sites on EI (Fig. 5a). The increased population of EI-ligand adducts will result in stabilization of the enzymatically active EI dimer and allosteric stimulation of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (Fig. 5a). In contrast, increasing the concentration of αKG to values larger than KI will result in oversaturation of the binding sites on EI and consequential competitive inhibition of enzymatic activity (Fig. 5a). Indeed, enzyme kinetic data collected at ˜0.05 μm EI, 200 μm PEP, and increasing concentrations of αKG (0–10 mm) show an initial stimulation of enzymatic activity followed by a decrease in the rate of phosphoryl transfer at high concentration of αKG (> 2 mm; Fig. 6a). At concentrations of EI > KD,free and/or concentrations of PEP > Km, we expect EI to exists predominantly as a dimer, and αKG to act exclusively as an inhibitor of the enzyme (Fig. 5b–d). Experimental data collected at ˜0.05 μm EI and 1000 μm PEP (Fig. 6b), at 10 μm EI and 200 μm PEP (Fig. 6c), and at 10 μm EI and 1000 μm PEP (Fig. 6d) confirm the expected behavior. Interestingly all kinetic data reported in Fig. 6 can be fit considering that (i) only dimeric EI can catalyze the phosphoryl transfer reaction (13Seok Y.J. Zhu P.P. Koo B.M. Peterkofsky A. Autophosphorylation of enzyme I of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system requires dimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250 (9753638): 381-38410.1006/bbrc.1998.9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), (ii) saturation of the EI dimer-binding sites with PEP and/or αKG (dissociation constants Km and KI, respectively) decreases the KD for EI dimerization, and (iii) binding of PEP or αKG to one monomeric subunit affects the KD for EI dimerization to a minor extent. As done in the previous section when fitting the dependence of the phosphoryl transfer reaction on the concentration of enzyme, the model has been simplified by setting the dissociation constant of the EI dimer occupied by a single ligand molecule to KD,free (see Equations 21–37 under “Experimental procedures”). Fits were performed by keeping Km, KI, and KD,free to their measured values (300, 2200, and 1 μm, respectively) (5Venditti V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M.

Two studies explored whether sharing and helping by 7-to 8-year olds (N = 180) could be influenced by priming children's attention on themselves or their friends through a semi-structured interview. Results revealed that self-priming led to reductions in both sharing and helping compared to friendship-priming or a control condition. These findings are considered as indicative of the fragile state of prosocial behaviours at this age that can be easily shifted towards more selfish biases by simple priming."

This paper introduced a customized bus routing problem in which trips for each depot are given, and each bus stop has a fixed time window within which trips should be completed. Treating a trip as a virtual stop was the first consideration in solving the school bus routing problem (SBRP). Then, the mixed load custom bus routing model was established with a time window that satisfies its requirement and the result were solved by Cplex software. Finally, a simple network diagram with three depots, four pickup stops, and five delivery stops was structured to verify the correctness of the model, and based on the actual example, the result is that all the buses ran 124.42 kilometers, the sum of kilometers was 10.35 kilometers less than before. The paths and departure times of the different busses that were provided by the model were evaluated to meet the needs of the given conditions, thus providing valuable information for actual work."

We examined the rate of knowledge production as well as changes in authors, journals, and collaborators, showing a steady growth of ALD research. The study of the collaboration network of ALD scientists over time points out that the ALD research community is becoming larger and more interconnected, with a largest connected component that spans 90% of the authors in 2015. In addition, the evolution of network centrality measures (degree and betweenness centrality) and author productivity revealed the central figures in ALD over time, including new ""stars"" appearing in the last decade. Finally, the study of the title words in our dataset is consistent with a shift in focus on research topics towards energy applications and nanotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2782640036,"In animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is one of the most widely used agents that damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. However, brain structural changes in response to MPTP remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate in vivo longitudinal changes in gray matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) microstructure in primate models administered with MPTP. In six cynomolgus monkeys, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were acquired 7 times over 32 weeks, and assessments of motor symptoms were conducted over 15 months, before and after the MPTP injection. Changes in GM volume and WM microstructure were estimated on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the trajectories of these structural changes. GM volume initially increased after the MPTP injection and gradually decreased in the striatum, midbrain, and other dopaminergic areas. The cerebellar volume temporarily decreased and returned to its baseline level. The rate of midbrain volume increase was positively correlated with the increase rate of motor symptom severity (Spearman rho = 0.93, p = 0.008). Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the striatum and frontal areas demonstrated initial increases and subsequent decreases. The current multi-modal imaging study of MPTP-administered monkeys revealed widespread and dynamic structural changes not only in the nigrostriatal pathway but also in other cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas. Our findings may suggest the need to further investigate the roles of inflammatory reactions and glial activation as potential underlying mechanisms of these structural changes."
https://openalex.org/W2784170705,"Individuals exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may be infected and remain for the entire life in this condition defined as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or develop active tuberculosis (TB). Among the multiple factors governing the outcome of the infection, dendritic cells (DCs) play a major role in dictating antibacterial immunity. However, current knowledge on the role of the diverse components of human DCs in shaping specific T-cell response during Mtb infection is limited. In this study, we performed a comparative evaluation of peripheral blood circulating DC subsets as well as of monocyte-derived Interferon-α DCs (IFN-DCs) from patients with active TB, subjects with LTBI and healthy donors (HD). The proportion of circulating myeloid BDCA3+ DCs (mDC2) and plasmacytoid CD123+ DCs (pDCs) declined significantly in active TB patients compared to HD, whereas the same subsets displayed a remarkable activation in LTBI subjects. Simultaneously, the differentiation of IFN-DCs from active TB patients resulted profoundly impaired compared to those from LTBI and HD individuals. Importantly, the altered developmental trait of IFN-DCs from active TB patients was associated with down-modulation of IFN-linked genes, marked changes in molecular signaling conveying antigen (Ag) presentation and full inability to induce Ag-specific T cell response. Thus, these data reveal an important role of IFN-α in determining the induction of Mtb-specific immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2784156416,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine released by human lung epithelium in response to external insult. Considered as a master switch in T helper 2 lymphocyte (Th2) mediated responses, TSLP is believed to play a key role in allergic diseases including asthma. The aim of this study was to use a phenotypic approach to identify new biological and chemical starting points for inhibition of TSLP production in human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), with the objective of reducing Th2-mediated airway inflammation. To this end, a phenotypic screen was performed using poly I:C / IL-4 stimulated NHBE cells interrogated with a 44,974 compound library. As a result, 85 hits which downregulated TSLP protein and mRNA levels were identified and a representative subset of 7 hits was selected for further characterization. These molecules inhibited the activity of several members of the MAPK, PI3K and tyrosine kinase families and some of them have been reported as modulators of cellular phenotypic endpoints like cell-cell contacts, microtubule polymerization and caspase activation. Characterization of the biological profile of the hits suggested that mTOR could be a key activity involved in the regulation of TSLP production in NHBE cells. Among other targeted kinases, inhibition of p38 MAPK and JAK kinases showed different degrees of correlation with TSLP downregulation, while Syk kinase did not seem to be related. Overall, inhibition of TSLP production by the selected hits, rather than resulting from inhibition of single isolated targets, appeared to be due to a combination of activities with different levels of relevance. Finally, a hit expansion exercise yielded additional active compounds that could be amenable to further optimization, providing an opportunity to dissociate TSLP inhibition from other non-desired activities. This study illustrates the potential of phenotypic drug discovery to complement target based approaches by providing new chemistry and biology leads."
