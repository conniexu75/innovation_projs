https://openalex.org/W2073276461,"Since the discovery of the first potent mutagens over 20 years ago, progress in mutation research has been rapid. Many new mutagens, belonging to a variety of chemical classes, have been discovered, and for some of them the reaction with DNA in vitro has been established. It seems that the findings of these chemical investigations usually also apply to viruses which are treated outside the cell. This has made chemical mutagens into an important tool for the analysis of the genetic code. When DNA is treated inside the cell, its reactions would not be expected to be always identical with those observed in vitro; in one case they have, indeed, been found to be different."

https://openalex.org/W2002554838,"Abstract The histopathological examination of the myocardial tissues of animals dead of experimental yellow fever has demonstrated the existence of well-marked degenerative changes, presenting protean characters, in the musculature of sino-atrial node, auricle, auriculo-ventricular bundle, and ventricle. The impression has not been obtained that the degree of degeneration is greater in one part of the myocardium than in another part; nevertheless, the advantages of considering each part separately from the pathological standpoint are as obvious as those of considering the various portions individually as anatomical and physiological entities. Fatty degeneration of the muscular fibers of the heart, varying in degree and patchy and irregular in distribution, has been a constant finding in experimental yellow fever. Granular degeneration of the myocardium has been of equally common occurrence. In other instances, but in most cases in lesser degrees, hyaline and vacuolar types of muscle degeneration have been encountered. A characteristic but not a constant finding, recalling a similar one observed in diphtheritic hearts, has been a patchy myolysis of isolated muscle-fiber groups. Occasional small petechial hemorrhages have been observed scattered through the myocardium. Only rarely have cellular infiltrations been met with as small numbers of lymphocytes and endothelial leucocytes clustered about the smaller blood vessels. In the rarer instances, when these inflammatory cells have been observed, it is thought that the degenerating tissue has afforded the chemotactic stimulus for their response. The lesions of the myocardium, like those in the parenchymal tissues of other organs, are primarily degenerative in character. The degenerative lesions of the myocardium in yellow fever represent a well-marked structural basis for the occurrence of functional disturbances in its various parts."
