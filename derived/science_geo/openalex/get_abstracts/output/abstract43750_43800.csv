https://openalex.org/W1493047535,"We have determined the amino acid sequence of rat bone sialoprotein (BSP). The sequence deduced from a 1974-base pair cDNA encodes a protein of 320 residues, including a 16-residues long signal peptide. The mature BSP has a molecular mass of 33,600 and contains predominantly glutamic acid and glycine residues, which constitute 32% of all residues. The glutamic acid residues are typically distributed in clusters of up to 10 consecutive residues. The tissue distribution of BSP mRNA suggests that the protein may be a unique product of cells in bone tissue. BSP contains an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, which presumably is responsible for its cell binding properties (Oldberg, A., Franzen, A., Heinegard, D., Pierschbacher, M., and Ruoslahti, E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19433-19436)."
https://openalex.org/W1538887755,"A 49-residue protein, echistatin, which inhibits platelet aggregation, was purified from the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus. The purification procedure included gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, cation-exchange chromatography on Mono S, and C18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified protein was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Echistatin is a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 5400 and a native isoelectric point of 8.3. The most abundant amino acid, cysteine, accounts for 8 of the 49 residues in the protein. A 10-residue segment of echistatin shows 90% identity to a portion of the sequence of trigramin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor from the green tree viper Trimereserus gramineus (Huang, T.-F., Holt, J. C., Lukasiewicz, H., and Niewiarowski, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16157-16163). Echistatin contains the sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid, which is common to proteins which bind to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. It also contains the sequence proline-arginine-asparagine-proline, which is found in the A alpha chain of human fibrinogen at position 267-270. The purified protein inhibits fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation initiated by ADP with an IC50 of 3 x 10(-8) M and also prevents aggregation initiated by thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, or platelet-activating factor. Reduction of echistatin abolished its inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1594568151,"The oxidative hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes induced by free radicals and its inhibition by chain-breaking antioxidants have been studied. The free radicals were generated from either a water-soluble or a lipid-soluble azo compound which, upon its thermal decomposition, gave carbon radicals that reacted with oxygen immediately to give peroxyl radicals. The radicals generated in the aqueous phase from a water-soluble azo compound induced hemolysis in air, but little hemolysis was observed in the absence of oxygen. Water-soluble chain-breaking antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, and water-soluble chromanol, suppressed the hemolysis dose dependently. Vitamin E in the erythrocyte membranes was also effective in suppressing the hemolysis. 2,2,5,7,8-Pentamethyl-6-chromanol, a vitamin E analogue without phytyl side chain, incorporated into dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes, suppressed the above hemolysis, but alpha-tocopherol did not suppress the hemolysis. Soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes also induced hemolysis, and a lipid-soluble azo initiator incorporated into the soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes accelerated the hemolysis. The chain-breaking antioxidants incorporated into the liposomes were also effective in suppressing this hemolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1568231313,"Cleavage of specific peptide bonds occurs with aging in the alpha A subunit of bovine alpha-crystallin. One of the breaks occurs at residue Asn-101. This same residue undergoes in vivo deamidation, isomerization, and racemization. Deamidation and isomerization are known to occur via succinimide ring formation of labile asparagine residues. Model studies on peptides have shown that imide formation can also lead to peptide bond cleavage (Geiger, T., and Clarke, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 785-794). In that case, both asparagine and aspartic acid amide would be expected as C termini of the truncated polypeptide, and this is indeed the case in the alpha A-(1-101)-chain. This thus represents a first example of nonenzymatic in vivo peptide bond cleavage in an aging protein through the formation of a succinimide intermediate. In addition, we found that in bovine lens no detectable conversion (through the action of protein-carboxyl methyltransferase) of isoaspartyl to normal aspartyl residues occurs in vivo after deamidation of Asn-101."
https://openalex.org/W1522328415,"Nucleoside transport was examined in freshly isolated mouse intestinal epithelial cells. The uptake of formycin B, the C nucleoside analog of inosine, was concentrative and required extracellular sodium. The initial rate of sodium-dependent formycin B transport was saturable with a Km of 45 +/- 3 microM. The purine nucleosides adenosine, inosine, guanosine, and deoxyadenosine were all good inhibitors of sodium-dependent formycin B transport with 50% inhibition (IC50) observed at concentrations less than 30 microM. Of the pyrimidine nucleosides examined, only uridine (IC50, 41 +/- 9 microM) was a good inhibitor. Thymidine and cytidine were poor inhibitors with IC50 values greater than 300 microM. Direct measurements of [3H]thymidine transport revealed, however, that the uptake of this nucleoside was also mediated by a sodium-dependent mechanism. Thymidine transport was inhibited by low concentrations of cytidine, uridine, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine (IC50 values less than 25 microM), but not by formycin B, inosine, or guanosine (IC50 values greater than 600 microM). These data indicate that there are two sodium-dependent mechanisms for nucleoside transport in mouse intestinal epithelial cells, and that formycin B and thymidine may serve as model substrates to distinguish between these transporters. Neither of these sodium-dependent transport mechanisms was inhibited by nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (10 microM), a potent inhibitor of one of the equilibrative (facilitated diffusion) nucleoside transporters found in many cells."
https://openalex.org/W1510608582,"Early in neonatal development, differentiated myocardial cells lose their ability to proliferate, and further enlargement of the heart occurs through hypertrophy of existing cardiac muscle cells. To study the process of myocardial growth and hypertrophy we have recently utilized a neonatal rat myocardial cell model (Lee, H. R., Henderson, S. A., Reynolds, R., Dunnmon, P., Yuan, D., and Chien, K. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7352-7538). The present study was designed to determine if the expression of SV40 large T antigen would be capable of restoring the proliferative capacity of terminally differentiated neonatal rat myocardial cells. Utilizing a replication-defective recombinant human adenovirus which contains an SV40 early T antigen insert, maximal expression of T antigen was achieved at 24-48 h postinfection, with over 85-90% of the cells displaying positive T antigen staining. Furthermore, the expression of the T antigen-induced proliferation of the myocardial cells without the loss of expression of certain differentiated properties, including myosin light chain expression and assembly into organized myofibrils, spontaneous contractile activity, and a chronotropic response to adrenergic agonists. These results demonstrate the utility of recombinant human adenoviruses to achieve high efficiency transient expression of foreign genes in differentiated myocardial cells and suggest that the expression of T antigen may provide a suitable model to study the biochemical events which are required to maintain the proliferative capacity of myocardial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1672840578,"In previous work (Vogel, B. E., Minor, R. R., Freund, M., and Prockop, D. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14737-14744), we identified a single-base mutation that converted the glycine at position 748 of the alpha 1 chain of type I procollagen to a cysteine in a proband with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition to posttranslational overmodification, the abnormal molecules displayed decreased thermal stability and a decreased rate of secretion. An unexplained finding was that procollagen was poorly processed to pCcollagen in postconfluent cultures of skin fibroblasts. Here, we show that the procollagen synthesized by the proband's cells is resistant to cleavage by procollagen N-proteinase, a conformation-sensitive enzyme. Since the only detectable defect in the molecule was the cysteine for glycine substitution, we assembled several space-filling models to try to explain how the structure of the N-proteinase cleavage site can be affected by an amino acid substitution over 700 amino acid residues or 225 nm away. The models incorporated a phase shift of a tripeptide unit in one or both of the alpha 1 chains. The most satisfactory models produced a flexible kink of 30 degrees or 60 degrees at the site of the cysteine substitution. Therefore, we examined the procollagen by electron microscopy. About 25% of the molecules had a kink not seen in control samples, and the kink was at the site of the cysteine substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1545004296,"We have used digitonin permeabilization to study the mechanism of bombesin-induced activation of protein kinase C in Swiss 3T3 cells. Protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylations in permeabilized cells were identified using phorbol esters and diacylglycerols. Addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and digitonin caused a marked and rapid time- and dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of an Mr 80,000 cellular protein (maximum stimulation = 12.6 +/- 1.6-fold after 1 min, EC50 = 27 nM). 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol substituted for PDBu in stimulating the phosphorylation of Mr 80,000 protein (EC50 = 13 microM). Bombesin also caused a striking increase in the phosphorylation of Mr 80,000 protein with a time course similar to that observed with PDBu. This phosphorylation was mimicked by mammalian bombesin-like peptides and blocked by the bombesin antagonists [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P and [Leu13 psi (CH2NH)Leu14]bombesin. Down-regulation of protein kinase C in intact cells by prolonged exposure to PDBu prevented Mr 80,000 protein phosphorylation upon subsequent bombesin addition in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Comigration on one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and phosphopeptide mapping confirmed that the Mr 80,000 protein phosphorylated in permeabilized cells was indistinguishable from the Mr 80,000 protein which is the major protein kinase C substrate in intact cells. The GDP analogue guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) caused a 70% inhibition of the bombesin-induced phosphorylation of Mr 80,000 protein but had no effect on the phosphorylation induced by PDBu. Bombesin stimulated Mr 80,000 protein phosphorylation in permeabilized cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 4 nM), and GDP beta S shifted the bombesin dose response curve to higher bombesin concentrations (EC50 = 14 nM). These results demonstrate for the first time a growth factor receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C in permeabilized cells and provide functional evidence for the involvement of a G protein in the transmembrane signaling pathway that mediates the stimulation of protein kinase C by bombesin in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509626394,"Purified smooth muscle myosin light chain can be phosphorylated at multiple sites by myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C. We have determined the sites phosphorylated on myosin light chain in intact bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Stimulation with 10 microM carbachol resulted in 66 +/- 5% monophosphorylated and 11 +/- 2% diphosphorylated myosin light chain after 1 min, and 47 +/- 4% monophosphorylated and 5 +/- 2% diphosphorylated myosin light chain after 30 min. Myosin heavy chain contained 0.06 +/- 0.01 mol of phosphate/mol of protein which did not change with carbachol. At both 1 and 30 min the monophosphorylated myosin light chain contained only phosphoserine whereas the diphosphorylated myosin light chain contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of tryptic digests of monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated myosin light chain obtained from carbachol-stimulated tissue was similar to the peptide maps of purified light chain monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated, respectively, by myosin light chain kinase; these maps were distinct from the map obtained with tracheal light chain phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of tracheal smooth muscle myosin light chain by myosin light chain kinase yields the tryptic phosphopeptide ATSNVFAMFDQSQIQEFK with S the phosphoserine in the monophosphorylated myosin light chain and TS the phosphotreonine and phosphoserine in the diphosphorylated myosin light chain. Thus, stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle with a high concentration of carbachol results in formation of both monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated myosin light chain although the amount of diphosphorylated light chain is substantially less than monophosphorylated light chain. In the intact muscle, myosin light chain is phosphorylated at sites corresponding to myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1603120363,"Tissue-cultured chicken embryo muscle cells synthesize several molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which differ in oligomeric structure and fate as membrane-bound or secreted molecules. Using irreversible inhibitors to inactivate AChE molecules we show that muscle cells rapidly synthesize and assemble catalytically active oligomers which transit an obligatory pathway through the Golgi apparatus. These oligomers acquire complex oligosaccharides and are ultimately localized on the cell surface or secreted into the medium. Immunoprecipitation of isotopically labeled AChE shows that the oligomers are assembled shortly after synthesis from two allelic polypeptide chains. About two-thirds of the newly synthesized molecules are assembled into dimers and tetramers, and once assembled these forms do not interconvert. Comparison of newly synthesized catalytically active AChE molecules with isotopically labeled ones indicates that a large fraction of the immature molecules are catalytically inactive. Pulse-chase studies measuring both catalytic activity and isotopic labeling indicate that only the catalytically active oligomers are further processed by the cell, whereas inactive molecules are rapidly degraded intracellularly by an as yet unknown mechanism. Approximately 70-80% of the newly synthesized AChE molecules are degraded in this manner and do not transit the Golgi apparatus. These studies indicate that muscle cells synthesize an excess of this important synaptic component over that which is necessary for maintaining normal levels of this protein. In addition, these studies indicate the existence of an intracellular route of protein degradation which may function as a post-translational regulatory step in the control of exportable proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1636023765,"Calmodulin is encoded in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by a single gene that 1) has multiple intervening sequences, 2) has 5' structural motifs that are phylogenetically conserved, 3) contains 5' sequences that are similar to those found in genes of some transforming, cytoskeletal, and stress-response proteins, and 4) produces at both life cycle stages, a single size class of mRNA and proteins that are identical in amino acid sequence. Based on the amino acid sequence of calmodulin from the vegetative phase of the life cycle, synthetic oligonucleotide probes, containing inosine in order to reduce codon redundancy, were used to detect and isolate cloned cDNAs coding for the gametic phase calmodulin. The complete DNA sequence was elucidated and shown to code for a protein identical to the vegetative phase protein. Analysis of the production of calmodulin mRNA indicates that protein production is under quantitative regulation and possibly coupled with the synthesis of other proteins in the flagellar apparatus. The full length cDNA was used to isolate overlapping genomic clones that include the entire calmodulin transcriptional unit and 5' regulatory sequences. The complete DNA sequence of the gene, including all intron sequences, was elucidated. The DNA sequence of the coding regions shows some phylogenetic conservation. Finally, there are regions of 5' sequence reminiscent of sequence motifs recently identified as binding sites of transcriptional regulatory proteins. Overall, these studies suggest possible molecular genetic relationships between calmodulin, a transducer of intracellular calcium signals, and other proteins involved in eukaryotic cell structure, motility, and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1516501648,"Heat shock protein (hsp) genes are typically silent and are activated by various stresses including heat. As a first step toward understanding this activation event, a human factor, referred to here as human heat shock transcription factor (human HTF), has been purified approximately 14,000-fold from extracts of heat-treated HeLa cells by means of sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. The most highly purified fraction of human HTF binds specifically to the known regulatory sequence element (HSE) of hsp genes as shown by footprinting experiments. Purified human HTF has an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa. Human HTF is specifically required for activation of an hsp gene promoter in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system from human cells. Activation is dependent on the presence of the HSEs in the transcription template."
https://openalex.org/W1522654056,"Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGA2 and delta 12-PGJ2 act specifically on cells in the G1 phase and induce block of cell cycle progression (Ohno, K., Sakai, T., Fukushima, M., Narumiya, S., and Fujiwara, M. (1988) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 245, 294-298). In this study, we characterized proteins induced by these PGs in HeLa S3 cells of synchronized growth and examined its association with the cell cycle block. HeLa S3 cells transiently expressed two 68-kDa proteins of isoelectric points of 5.5 and 5.6 in the G1 phase of cell cycle. When G1-enriched cells were incubated with either PGA2 or delta 12-PGJ2, synthesis of these proteins was markedly enhanced. Enhancement by delta 12-PGJ2 was persistent and irreversible, whereas that by PGA2 was reversible. delta 12-PGJ2 also enhanced the synthesis of two additional 68-kDa proteins with isoelectric points of 5.8 and 5.9. On two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, these proteins overlapped exactly with the 68-kDa heat shock proteins induced in cells treated at 43 degrees C for 90 min. They were also indistinguishable from the heat shock proteins in limited proteolysis. When delta 12-PGJ2 was incubated with G2/M phase cells, it induced only a small and transient increase in the 68-kDa proteins. These results suggest that cyclopentenone PGs extensively induce 68-kDa heat shock proteins in the G1 phase HeLa S3 cells and this induction is closely associated with the G1 block of cell cycle progression caused by these PGs."
https://openalex.org/W1500109801,"Marked changes in the intracellular localization of brain protein kinase C are evident after global ischemia generated by the restriction of the placental blood flow in the near-term rat embryo. A rapid (5 min) ischemia-dependent translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the particulate membrane fraction, which is completely reversible upon reperfusion, is observed. After 30 min of ischemia, substantial losses in protein kinase C activity and content as measured by [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding are apparent. This is accompanied by a marked increase of a Ca2+-phosphatidylserine-independent kinase activity, already evident after 5 min of ischemia. By 15 or 30 min the total activity of the latter enzyme is equally distributed between the particulate and the cytosol fractions and is more than 3-fold higher in ischemic in comparison to naive animals. Activation and possible deregulation of protein kinase C are proposed to represent an initial step in the pathophysiology of brain ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1527505565,"The major NaCl-stimulated protein-tyrosine kinase activity found in soluble thymus extracts, as measured by the phosphorylation of angiotensin I, is a 40-kDa enzyme known as p40 (Zioncheck, T. F., Harrison, M. L., and Geahlen, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15637-15643). Antibodies prepared against p40 cross-react with a 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase (p72) from spleen or thymus that is closely related to p40 by peptide-mapping experiments. The recovery of p40 from spleen homogenates is reduced while the recovery of p72 is enhanced by the addition of high concentrations of leupeptin or soybean trypsin inhibitor to the homogenization media. The generation of p40 in spleen homogenates occurs with a concomitant increase in protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Activated catalytic fragments of 38-43 kDa can be generated by the treatment of partially purified p72 with trypsin or papain. The p72 protein-tyrosine kinase is found at the highest levels in spleen, thymus, and lung, tissues that also have high protein-tyrosine kinase activity and generate high levels of p40 following homogenization. p72 is also found in certain T and B cell-derived cell lines and in NIH3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1590966547,"Ferritin, a cytoplasmic protein critical in iron metabolism, displays iron-dependent regulation of its biosynthetic rate with no corresponding changes in mRNA levels. An iron-responsive element (IRE) has been identified in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the human ferritin heavy chain mRNA which, when placed in the 5′-UTR of heterologous reporter genes, confers iron-dependent translational regulation to the hybrid mRNAs. However, whereas the biosynthetic rate of ferritin in response to changes in iron status exhibits a 30-80-fold range, the apparent ranges observed for reporter gene constructs utilizing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays or human growth hormone radioimmunoassays have been much less. A deletion and reconstitution study was undertaken to address the possibility that regions of the ferritin gene and mRNA other than the IRE may be necessary for the production of the full range of iron regulation. Data are presented that demonstrate that the IRE alone is capable of conferring iron-dependent translational regulation of biosynthesis to downstream encoded proteins that is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed with expression of ferritin itself. Thus, the complete range of iron-dependent translational regulation conferred by the IRE occurs independently of the presence of the ferritin promoter, other regions of the ferritin 5′-UTR, the ferritin coding region, and the ferritin 3′-UTR. Additionally, experiments addressing the translatability in vivo of various ferritin construct mRNAs support the theory that the IRE functions as the binding site for a translational repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1539060386,"Abstract The Sindbis virus glycoproteins, E1 and E2, comprise a useful model system for evaluating the effects of local protein structure on the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides by Golgi enzymes. The conversion of oligomannose to N-acetyllactosamine (complex) oligosaccharides is hindered to different extents at the four glycosylation sites, so that the complex/oligomannose ratio decreases in the order E1-Asn139 greater than E2-Asn196 greater than E1-Asn245 greater than E2-Asn318. The processing steps most susceptible to interference were deduced from the oligosaccharide compositions at hindered sites in virus from baby hamster kidney cells (BHK), chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), and normal and hamster sarcoma virus (HSV)-transformed hamster fibroblasts (Nil-8). Persistence of Man6-9GlcNAc2 was taken to indicate interference with alpha 2-mannosidase(s) I (alpha-mannosidase I), Man5GlcNAc2, with UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta 1----2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc transferase I), and unbisected hybrid glycans, with GlcNAc transferase I-dependent alpha 3(alpha 6)-mannosidase (alpha-mannosidase II). Taken together, the results indicate that all four sites acquire a precursor oligosaccharide with equally high efficiency, but alpha-mannosidase I, GlcNAc transferase I, and alpha-mannosidase II are all impeded at E2-Asn318 and, to a lesser extent, at E1-Asn245. In contrast, sialic acid and galactose transfer to hybrid glycans (in BHK cells) is virtually quantitative even at E2-Asn318. E2-Asn318 carried no complex oligosaccharides, but the structures of those at E1-Asn245 indicate almost complete GlcNAc transfer by UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta 1----2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GlcNAc transferase II), galactosylation, and sialylation. Because the E2-Asn318 and E1-Asn245 glycans have previously been shown to be less accessible to a steric probe than those at E2-Asn196 or E1-Asn139, a simple explanation for these results would be that alpha-mannosidase I, GlcNAc transferase I, and alpha-mannosidase II are more susceptible to steric hindrance than are the later processing steps examined. Finally, in addition to these site-specific effects, the overall extent of viral oligosaccharide processing varied with host and cellular growth status. For example, alpha-mannosidase I processing is more complete in BHK cells compared to CEF, and in confluent Nil-8 cells compared to subconfluent or HSV-transformed Nil-8 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487654384,"The binding, incorporation, and release of iron by ferritin were investigated in K562 cells using both pulse-chase and long term decay studies with 59Fe-transferrin as the labeled iron source. After a 20-min pulse of labeled transferrin, 60% of the 59Fe was bound by ferritin with the proportion increasing to 70% by 4 h. This initial binding was reduced to 35% when the cells were exposed to the chelator desferrioxamine (5 mM) for an additional 30 min. By 4 h the association of 59Fe with ferritin was unaffected by the presence of the chelator, and levels of 59Fe-ferritin were identical to those in control cells (70%). Between 4-10h there was a parallel decline in 59Fe-ferritin in both control and desferrioxamine-treated cells. When incoming iron was bound by ferritin it was, therefore, initially chelatable but with time progressed to a further, nonchelatable compartment. In turnover studies where ferritin was preloaded with 59Fe by overnight incubation, 50% of the label was released from the protein by 18 h, contrasting with a t 1/2 for cellular iron release of approximately 70 h. The half-time of 59Fe release from ferritin was accelerated to 11 h by the presence of desferrioxamine. The half-time for ferritin protein turnover determined by [35S]methionine labeling was approximately 12 h in the presence or absence of the chelator. Thus, when the reassociation of iron with ferritin was prevented by the exogenous chelator there was a concordant decay of both protein and iron moieties. The direct involvement of lysosomes in this turnover was demonstrated by the use of the inhibitors leupeptin and methylamine which stabilized both 59Fe (t 1/2 = 24 h) and 35S (t 1/2 = 25.6 h) labels. We conclude that in this cell type the predominant mechanism by which iron is released from ferritin is through the constitutive degradation of the protein by lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1483367645,"Abstract The gene encoding the rat brain facilitated glucose transporter protein was cloned and partially sequenced. The transcribed regions encode 10 exons that span about 30 kilobases of genomic DNA. The intron size is markedly biased, the first two significantly greater in length than the seven others. All of the introns are predicted to occur in regions that encode putative extramembranous domains of the protein, consistent with the proposed topology of 12 alpha-helical membrane-spanning segments. In brain, transcription of the glucose transporter gene initiates at two adjacent adenosine residues located about 30 base pairs 3' to a TATA sequence. In addition, there is at least one minor upstream start site. Both transformation of fibroblasts by the oncogenic retrovirus Fujinami sarcoma virus and stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with serum increase transcription of the glucose transporter gene from identical initiation sites, which are the same as the predominant start sites in brain. The use of the same promoter for increased transcription under both conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that the regulation of gene expression by normal growth and by oncogenesis is mediated by similar or identical pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1647295914,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent modulator of cell growth in many systems. In normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts, TGF-beta synergizes with epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate growth in soft agar, a characteristic of the transformed phenotype. Many biochemical effects of TGF-beta occur at the cell surface. Increased binding of EGF and synthesis of extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen are primary responses of NRK cells to TGF-beta. Although specific membrane receptors for TGF-beta have been identified, the mechanism of action of this factor is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that TGF-beta enhances the expression of the EGF receptor in NRK cells through an increase in the level of EGF receptor gene transcripts. Analysis of nuclear run-off transcription levels and mRNA half-lives indicate that the elevation in EGF-receptor mRNA results from an increase in the rate of transcription. Dose-response and kinetic studies suggest that the EGF receptor response to TGF-beta is biphasic, possibly resulting from the action of multiple TGF-beta receptors. TGF-beta also elevates the levels of fibronectin and tubulin transcripts in NRK cells; however, the mechanism differs for each gene. The increase in fibronectin mRNA in response to TGF-beta results from an increased rate of gene transcription. Tubulin mRNA levels, in contrast, appear to be post-transcriptionally regulated. These results implicate TGF-beta as a transcriptional activator of the genes for both the EGF receptor and fibronectin and suggest the two genes may be regulated through a common pathway in this cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1583090965,"Abstract Acetylcholinesterase exists predominantly as a secreted enzyme which remains cell-associated at specific extracellular locations. Its extensive structural diversity appears responsible for the unique cellular disposition of the enzyme. To examine the molecular basis of the structural divergence of acetylcholinesterase species, we hybridized total RNA from Torpedo californica electric organ with restriction fragments from a cDNA encoding the catalytic subunits of asymmetric species of acetylcholinesterase. Multiple RNA species up to 14 kilobases in length can be detected on Northern blots using a full-length cDNA for hybridization. Each of these RNA species also hybridizes with smaller restriction fragments within the open reading frame and 3'-untranslated region of the cDNA. This indicates that the entire open reading frame plus the 3'-untranslated region is contained in the large RNA species. RNase protection experiments revealed at least three points of divergence for the message species. One occurs within the COOH-terminal portion of the open reading frame at a position just 5' to the TGA stop codon. This divergence accounts for the two classes of acetylcholinesterase found in abundance in Torpedo. The site of splicing has been further defined by isolating a genomic clone containing the exon serving as the potential splice donor. We find a divergence between the cDNA and genomic DNA at the position estimated by the protection experiments. A less abundant divergence in mRNA can also be detected in the 3'-untranslated region. Another divergence occurs as a deleted sequence within the 5'-noncoding region and may be important for controlling translation efficiency. Since it is hypothesized that a single gene encodes acetylcholinesterase, the divergences in the very 3' region of the open reading frame and the 5'-noncoding region correspond to presumed splice junction boundaries where alternative RNA splicing occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1523282979,"The functional structure of assimilatory NADH-nitrate reductase from spinach leaves was studied by limited proteolysis experiments. After incubation of purified nitrate reductase with trypsin, two stable products of 59 and 45 kDa were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fragment of 45 kDa was purified by Blue Sepharose chromatography. NADH-ferricyanide reductase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities were associated with this 45-kDa fragment which contains FAD, heme, and NADH binding fragment. After incubation of purified nitrate reductase with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, two major peaks were observed by high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion gel filtration. FMNH2-nitrate reductase and reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase activities were associated with the first peak of 170 kDa which consists of two noncovalently associated (75-90-kDa) fragments. NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity, however, was associated with the second peak which consisted of FAD and NADH binding sites. Incubation of the 45-kDa fragment with S. aureus V8 protease produced two major fragments of 28 and 14 kDa which contained FAD and heme, respectively. These results indicate that the molybdenum, heme, and FAD components of spinach nitrate reductase are contained in distinct domains which are covalently linked by exposed hinge regions. The molybdenum domain appears to be important in the maintenance of subunit interactions in the enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1554278549,"Abstract Both 1,2-diacyl- and 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerols are released during stimulation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). 1,2-Diacylglycerols have received intense interest as intracellular second messengers due to their ability to activate protein kinase C (Ca2+ phospholipid-dependent enzyme). However, little is known about bioactivities of the alkylacylglycerols. This study compared the ability of 1,2-diacyl- and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols to modulate the respiratory burst of stimulated PMNL, a response which depends on the activation of an NADPH oxidase to generate bactericidal species of reduced oxygen. Direct stimulation by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe caused an abrupt release of H2O2 which ceased within 2.5 min. Preincubation with diacylglycerols (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol,5-30 microM, and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol,2-5 microM) caused a decrease in lag time, 3-fold increase in initial rate of H2O2 release, and marked prolongation of the response to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (features characteristic of a priming effect). Preincubation with alkylacylglycerols (1-O-delta 9-octadecenyl-2-acetylglycerol, 5-30 microM, and 1-O-octyl-2-octanoylglycerol, 20-50 microM) primed initiation (shortened lag time and increased velocity) but, in contrast to diacylglycerols, did not alter duration of H2O2 release. While low concentrations of diacylglycerols (5-30 microM) primed PMNL, higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 70 microM) stimulated the cells directly. In contrast, higher (70-100 microM) concentrations of alkylacylglycerols did not prime the responses but, in fact, inhibited priming (especially of duration) induced by diacylglycerol. The high concentrations of alkylacylglycerol also inhibited direct stimulation induced by high concentrations of diacylglycerol. Direct stimulation by high concentrations of diacylglycerol probably involves activation of protein kinase C, whereas alkylacylglycerol was found to inhibit activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol in vitro. Thus, diacylglycerols are complete priming agonists, altering both rate and duration of the response. In contrast, alkylacylglycerols may have biphasic, concentration-related effects in modulation of functions of PMNL. At low concentrations, they may facilitate initiation of functional events; however, as their concentration increases, they may serve to terminate responses. The distinct priming effects of these diglycerides also reveal that priming can involve at least two distinct events: 1) initiation and 2) prolongation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1520872674,"Spermine penetrates the mitochondrial matrix at significant rates which increase sharply and non-ohmically with membrane potential. In this respect, spermine uptake is qualitatively similar to that of other cations whose electrophoretic transport has been studied in mitochondria. At 200 mV and 1 mM spermine, the observed rate of spermine uptake was about 7 nmol x mg-1 x min-1, and the rate constant was about 8 times greater than that of tetraethylammonium cation. These rates are remarkably rapid considering that spermine is largely tetravalent at the pH of the experiment. The fluxes of spermine and tetraethylammonium are log-linear with membrane potential. The slope of the tetraethylammonium plot is consistent with leakage of this ion across a sharp Eyring barrier located in the middle of the membrane. The slope of the spermine plot is half that predicted by such a leak pathway, raising the possibility that spermine may cross the inner membrane by means of a channel. Whatever its mechanism of penetration, if comparable rates of uptake obtain in vivo and if spermine is not metabolized within the mitochondrial matrix, then a separate efflux mechanism would appear to be required to prevent unlimited spermine loading."
https://openalex.org/W1593282819,"The function of amino-terminal pro-specific peptides (propeptides), sequences often found on intermediate precursor forms of secreted proteins, is poorly understood. Human preproparathyroid hormone (prepro-PTH), a precursor protein containing such a propeptide, is initially synthesized as a precursor containing a 25-amino acid signal sequence, a 6-amino acid propeptide, and the 84-amino acid mature secreted peptide. Cloned cDNA encoding prepro-PTH and synthetic oligonucleotides were used to generate a mutant missing precisely the pro-specific sequences. The effects of this deletion on signal sequence function and on secretion per se were assessed after expression of the mutant cDNA in intact cells and in a cell-free translation system using synthetic mRNA in the presence of microsomal membranes. The mutant precursor protein was inefficiently translocated and cleaved, and cleavage occurred both at the normal site and within the signal sequence. Thus, for the eukaryotic protein prepro-PTH, sequences immediately downstream and separate from the classically defined signal sequence facilitate accurate and efficient signal function."
https://openalex.org/W1600335679,"Interactions between type IV collagen and heparin were examined under equilibrium conditions with rotary shadowing, solid-phase binding assays, and affinity chromatography. With the technique of rotary shadowing and electron microscopy, heparin appeared as thin, short strands and bound to the following three sites: the NC1 domain, and in the helix, at 100 and 300 nm from the NC1 domain. By solid-phase binding assays the binding of [3H]heparin in solution to type IV collagen immobilized on a solid surface was found to be specific, since it was saturable and could be displaced by an excess of unlabeled heparin. Scatchard analysis indicated three classes of binding sites for heparin-type IV collagen interactions with dissociation constants of 3, 30, and 100 nM, respectively. Furthermore, by the solid-phase binding assays, the binding of tritiated heparin could be competed almost to the same extent by unlabeled heparin and chondroitin sulfate side chains. This finding indicates that chondroitin sulfate should also bind to type IV collagen. By affinity chromatography, [3H]heparin bound to a type IV collagen affinity column and was eluted with a linear salt gradient, with a profile exhibiting three distinct peaks at 0.18, 0.22, and 0.24 M KCl, respectively. This suggested that heparin-type IV collagen binding was of an electrostatic nature. Finally, the effect of the binding of heparin to type IV collagen on the process of self-assembly of this basement membrane glycoprotein was studied by turbidimetry and rotary shadowing. In turbidity experiments, the presence of heparin, even in small concentrations, drastically reduced maximal aggregation of type IV collagen which was prewarmed to 37 degrees C. By using the morphological approach of rotary shadowing, lateral associations and network formation by prewarmed type IV collagen were inhibited in the presence of heparin. Thus, the binding of heparin resulted in hindrance of assembly of type IV collagen, a process previously described for interactions between various glycosaminoglycans and interstitial collagens. Such regulation may influence the assembly of basement membranes and possibly modify functions. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative changes of proteoglycans which occur in certain pathological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, may alter molecular assembly and possibly permeability functions of several basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1601822568,"beta-Glucosidase activator (SAP-2) is a family of heat-stable, acidic glycoproteins which stimulate enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosylceramide. In this study, we improved the purification method and found that SAP-2 is highly heterogeneous. A hot water extract of frozen guinea pig liver was fractionated by ammonium sulfate sedimentation, then chromatographed with DEAE-Sephacel, Sephadex G-75, and concanavalin A-Sepharose. A fraction binding to concanavalin A-Sepharose was purified further with a C4 high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase column. This yielded several peaks, the main one of which was studied. The specific activity of the purified SAP-2 was 35 units/micrograms (1 unit produces 50% stimulation of a basal glucosidase preparation). N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that this preparation is a mixture of polypeptides differing in the presence or absence of one or two of the end amino acids. The complete amino acid sequence of the 81 residues in SAP-2 has been determined. Comparison of the sequence of guinea pig SAP-2 with the sequence of human sphingomyelinase activator revealed 58% homology and quite similar hydropathy profiles. Both proteins possess a highly hydrophilic region around Asn-22, which is glycosylated, and 6 cysteine residues, in oxidized form, located in the same positions. Comparison with the published nucleotide sequence for the precursor form of the human activator protein for sulfatide sulfatase (SAP-1) suggested that this activator also has a possibly glycosylated Asn and 6 Cys residues at similar positions, although the remainder of the molecule is somewhat different. Examination of another region of the precursor's nucleotide sequence, assuming a few changes in the identifications, revealed the presence of the sphingomyelinase activator. It appears that two or more activators are derived from a single precursor protein. Marked homologies were seen also with a lung surfactant protein and a sulfated glycoprotein from Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548936220,"The gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, is transcribed at a relatively high level when cellular sterols are depleted and is repressed when sterols accumulate. We have previously reported that the regulatory region of the hamster reductase gene contains eight different sequences that bind nuclear proteins as determined by DNase I footprinting assays. We here report the purification of a single activity that accounts for six of these footprints. This activity was found in a doublet of proteins (designated reductase promoter factor 1, RPF-1) that have apparent molecular weights of 33,000 and 35,000. They were isolated by DNA affinity chromatography using oligonucleotides corresponding to either of two footprinted sequences. The 33- and 35-kDa species were present as monomers, as indicated by gel filtration and gradient ultracentrifugation. Oligonucleotides corresponding to any one of the six footprinted sequences prevented the binding of RPF-1 to all of the other sequences, indicating that all six bind to a single site in RPF-1. The only sequence shared by all six footprinted sequences is the trinucleotide, TGG, both of whose guanosines made contact with RPF-1, as determined by methylation interference assays. The footprinted sequence that binds RPF-1 with highest affinity contains the palindrome, TGG(N7)CCA, which conforms to the consensus sequence for binding NF-1, a nuclear protein that stimulates replication of adeno-virus-2. Purified RPF-1 was shown to bind to the adenovirus NF-1 binding site with high affinity. Although the apparent molecular weight of the RPF-1 doublet was lower than the molecular weight range for NF-1 proteins (52,000-66,000), it is likely that the 33-35-kDa doublet is derived from a larger NF-1-like protein as a result of proteolysis. We conclude that RPF-1 belongs to a group of TGG-binding proteins that includes NF-1 and other proteins previously described as CCAAT binding proteins. This protein binds to six sites in the promoter region for hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, where its function remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1482400728,"A novel glutathione peroxidase, which is active toward hydroperoxides of phospholipid in the presence of a detergent, has been purified to homogeneity from a rat liver postmicrosomal supernatant fraction by ammonium sulfate fractionation and three different column chromatographies. From a DE52 column, glutathione peroxidase active toward phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl hydroperoxides was eluted in one major and two minor peaks. The enzyme in the major peak was found to be separated from the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferases and further purified by Sephacryl S-200 and Mono Q column chromatographies. The purified enzyme was found to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions as well as that in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 22,000, and that by gel filtration was comparable, indicating that the enzyme protein is a single polypeptide. The purified enzyme was found to catalyze the reduction of phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy derivatives. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was found at pH 6.2, and the optimum pH for the enzyme activity was 8.0. The enzyme was active toward cumene hydroperoxide, H2O2, and 1-monolinolein hydroperoxides in the absence of a detergent. The enzyme activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides was minute in the absence of a detergent but was remarkably enhanced by the addition of a detergent. From these results, the presently purified enzyme is obviously different from the classic glutathione peroxidase and also from phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase purified from pig heart (Ursini, F., Maiorino, M., and Gregolin, C. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 839, 62-70), though considerably similar to the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1573262794,"Three glucuronic acid-rich dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (DS-PGs) have been isolated by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques from cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells and characterized structurally. The smallest of the DS-PGs (DS-II) has an apparent Mr of approximately 100,000 and glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr approximately 29,000. Core glycoprotein samples prepared by chondroitin ABC lyase digestion run as doublets of Mr = 45,000 and 48,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A decrease in core size is apparent after N-glycanase digestion, or when DS-PG is isolated from tunicamycin-treated cultures, providing evidence that the core protein is N-glycosylated. Isolated DS-II shows evidence of self-association when subjected to liquid chromatography under conditions of reduced ionic strength, but not during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, DS-II, but not other endothelial cell DS-PG subclasses, is bound by an antibody against human skin fibroblast DS-PG, indicating that this DS-PG belongs to a family of widely distributed small DS-PGs, previously isolated from various connective tissues. A slightly larger (Mr approximately 220,000) DS-PG (DS-I) can be separated from DS-II by preparative electrophoresis. Despite similarities in core size and extent of N-glycosylation between DS-I and DS-II, DS-I shows only limited ability to self-associate, and does not interact with the anti-fibroblast DS-PG antibody. DS-I glycosaminoglycan chains are also smaller (Mr approximately 18,000) than those from DS-II, similar in size to the chains borne by the DS-PG subclass of largest size (high molecular weight (HMW)-DS). HMW-DS, which predominated in cell layer extracts, runs with a Kav of 0.45 on Sepharose CL-2B and is estimated to have an Mr greater than 700,000. Reduction and alkylation of HMW-DS indicates that it forms disulfide-bonded aggregates with other matrical proteins within the cell layer. HMW-DS displayed multiple protein cores (Mr greater than 200,000) upon chondroitin ABC lyase treatment. Despite some similarity in size to the family of large, aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and DS-PGs, immunological evidence suggests that it lacks a hyaluronic acid binding region."
https://openalex.org/W1588672534,"The biochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating cellular platelet-derived growth factor expression are incompletely understood. Our previous studies have shown that platelet-derived growth factor B/c-sis mRNA levels are induced in human renal microvascular endothelial cells by either thrombin or transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), while exposure to agents which elevate cAMP levels blocks the induction responses. The current studies use combined transcription run-off and message decay rate experiments to show greater than 3-fold increases in rate of transcription after stimulation with either thrombin or TGF-beta. c-sis message has a 70-90-min half-life under basal conditions that is effectively unaltered by thrombin or TGF-beta. Forskolin does not decrease the stability of c-sis mRNA, although it attenuates transcription increases seen with inducing agents. TGF-beta induction of c-sis transcription is mediated independent of the protein kinase C (Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme)-mediated responses to phorbol ester, as it remains intact following down-regulation of protein kinase C response; TGF-beta and phorbol elicit additive induction. Inhibitory effects of cAMP upon transcription act distal to early thrombin-receptor-coupled increases in phosphatidylinositol turnover and are capable of turning off TGF-beta-activated transcription after activation has been established. Both inducing and suppressing agents alter endothelial platelet-derived growth factor B/c-sis mRNA expression dominantly through effects upon rates of transcription, cAMP suppression of transcription is dominant, and TGF-beta and phorbol esters mediate induction of transcription through distinct pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1621574529,"A number of N-linked membrane glycoproteins are induced during chick oviduct differentiation. We have purified a major estrogen-inducible glycoprotein (Mr = 91,000) to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparison of partial NH2-terminal sequence data with membrane glycoproteins having similar Mr showed a limited homology with human and murine transferrin receptors. We observed that oviduct membranes contain estrogen-inducible transferrin receptor activity (Kd = 2-8 x 10(-8) M). Analytical purification of the putative receptor on an ovotransferrin-Affi-Gel affinity column and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis reveals a protein of Mr, 180,000, which contains two disulfide-linked subunits of Mr 91,000. The receptor reacts very strongly with antibodies prepared against the 91-kDa glycoprotein on Western blots. Western blot analysis confirms that the 91-kDa glycoprotein is induced by estrogen. The protein has 2% total carbohydrate with Man, GlcNAc, Gal, GalNAc, and NeuAc in a molar ratio of 6:4:2:1:1. The protein contains at least one O-linked moiety. Analysis of the O-linked moiety by glycosidase digestions and gel filtration indicates there are sialo tetra- and trisaccharides and a neutral disaccharide(s). Labeled N-linked glycopeptides were prepared by pronase digestion, beta-elimination, and 3H-acetylation. The N-linked oligosaccharides include high mannose and complex neutral nonbisected biantennary types in an approximate ratio of 3:1 as determined by serial lectin affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1616286433,The genes for the two dissimilar subunits of type IV collagen are organized in a head-to-head manner with their translation initiation codons within 874 base pairs. Murine genomic clones which contain portions of both genes have been isolated and characterized. These clones contain the first exon of the alpha 1(IV) chain and the first 3 exons for the alpha 2(IV) chain within a 1.7-kilobase HindIII fragment. The intergenic region appears not to resemble previously described bidirectional promoters. The HindIII fragment is present as a single copy in the mouse genome ruling out the presence of one of these gene fragments as a pseudogene. These findings agree with linkage studies of these two genes and differ from the known organization of human fibrillar collagen genes which have been found to be dispersed within the human genome.
https://openalex.org/W1537070289,"We have compared sequence and structural features of 35 proteins to their metabolic stabilities in HeLa cells. No relationship was observed between the half-life of an injected protein and its subunit molecular weight, isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, thermostability, surface charge density, or N-terminal residue. Other properties, including susceptibility to oxidation, specific combinations of amino acids, secondary structure composition, and solvent exposed residues, also failed to correlate with protein stability. Although a weak inverse correlation was obtained when stability was compared to asparagine and glutamine content, we conclude that the degradation of an injected protein is unlikely to be related to any single structural parameter. Rather, we hypothesize that it results from an interplay between subcellular location and still poorly defined surface features of the injected proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1483523530,"One or more of the five acidic amino-terminal residues of skeletal muscle actin have been implicated as being important in a number of actin-related processes. We have constructed a series of actins containing mutations at Asp3 and Asp11 and tested these mutant proteins for their ability to bind to DNase I-agarose, polymerize with rabbit skeletal muscle actin, undergo amino-terminal processing, and bind to the myosin-S1 subfragment. The mutant actins were expressed in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system which involves the synthesis of mutant RNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase followed by their translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. When Asp3 was changed to Ala, His, or Asn there was no difference in the tested properties as compared to wild type actin. These results suggest that an acidic residue at position 3 is not critical for the actin functions measured. When Asp11 was changed to Glu, Asn, or His or if the conserved Asp-Asn sequence at positions 11 and 12 was reversed, the mutants were able to copolymerize with rabbit skeletal muscle actin and be cross-linked to myosin-S1 to nearly the same extent as wild type actin. However, the amount of in vitro-synthesized actin capable of binding to DNase I-agarose with high affinity or undergoing amino-terminal processing was reduced significantly relative to the wild type actin synthesized in vitro. The Asp11 mutants ran anomalously on native polyacrylamide gels suggestive of a conformational change induced in the actin. Together, these results suggest that Asp11 may be important in proper actin folding and function."
https://openalex.org/W1516953053,"Protein candidates for the attachment of DNA within eukaryotic cell nuclei were identified by isolating nuclear matrix proteins and determining which of those proteins co-sedimented with DNA within a 5.7 M CsCl gradient. The presence of attached nucleic acid was detected after the proteins were subjected to the denaturing conditions of isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The attached nucleic acid was detected with silver staining, ethidium bromide, and Amido Black binding. The nucleic acid was identified as DNA based on its ability to be labeled in vitro by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and DNA polymerase I (Klenow). Three proteins were identified as containing attached DNA, one of which was vimentin. The proteins had apparent Mr and pI values of 70,000, 4.3; 70,000, 5.3; and 57,000, 4.8, respectively. We propose that these proteins are within a class of nuclear proteins containing firmly attached DNA and have referred to them as DNA attachment proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1555645733,"Hepatic plasma membrane lactate transport was studied in isolated hepatocytes prepared from fed, starved, and streptozotocin diabetic rats. Carrier-mediated lactate entry was determined using the lactate transport inhibitors alpha-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate and was significantly greater in hepatocytes from starved compared to fed rats and in hepatocytes from diabetic fed compared to fed rats. The saturable component of lactate entry which corresponds to carrier-mediated transport was higher in the starved than in the fed state with results from diabetic fed being intermediate between the two. Insulin treatment prevented the increment in carrier-mediated lactate transport observed in hepatocytes from diabetic fed rats. The data indicate that hepatic plasma membrane lactate transport is increased under conditions of starvation and diabetes mellitus. This may partly explain the increased gluconeogenic flux under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1602910899,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) acts on pituitary cells to raise the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and causes simultaneously a transient hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. The combination of the microfluorimetric monitoring of [Ca2+]i with electrophysiological recordings obtained using the patch clamp technique in its whole cell configuration, allows the analysis of the correlation between changes in [Ca2+]i and the alterations in ionic currents at the plasma membrane. It was shown that in the absence of hormone stimulation, a depolarization-induced change in steady state [Ca2+]i, as well as the internal perfusion with Ca2+ at microM levels at constant membrane potential led to the activation of outward K+ current. TRH stimulation resulted in a marked but transient rise in [Ca2+]i; concomitantly, there was an increase in membrane conductance and an enhancement of outward current. During the time course of an individual response, an excellent correlation between the changes in [Ca2+]i and those in conductance or current was observed. The relative changes of current and conductance during the TRH response were consistent with the activation of a single type of ionic current, the apparent reversal potential of which coincided with the equilibrium potential for K+. A strong correlation between the TRH-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and K+, conductance was demonstrated in a large number of cells with varied kinetic features: significant correlation coefficients were found both for the transition time from basal to maximal values (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001) as well as for the total duration of the responses (r = 0.68, p less than 0.002). It is concluded that during the early phase of TRH action, the hormone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is the principal cause of enhanced K+ channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W1548906313,"A highly purified nucleolar associated endoribonuclease was tested for possible involvement in the processing of precursor ribosomal RNA at a primary cleavage site approximately 650 nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation site. Preribosomal RNA sequences containing the +650 region were synthesized in vitro and subsequently digested over a range of concentrations of the nucleolar endoribonuclease. Cleavages generated by the nucleolar endoribonuclease were localized both by S1 nuclease protection analysis and primer extension analysis. A more precise determination of the specificity of cleavage was achieved by chemical cleavage DNA sequence analysis. These data demonstrated that the purified nucleolar endoribonuclease specifically cleaved the precursor ribosomal RNA transcript at the +650 site. Additional enzyme-dependent cleavages were observed upstream to the +650 site in a region which is rapidly degraded following processing at the +650 site in vivo. No major cleavages were observed for a distance of approximately 250 nucleotides downstream from the +650 site in a conserved region of sequence previously shown to be important in specifying processing at the +650 site. As a control, pancreatic ribonuclease, a single strand-specific endoribonuclease, was shown not to produce similar cleavages in the +650 region, indicating that cleavage by the nucleolar RNase was not simply due to accessibility of the RNA at the +650 site. Taken together, these results suggest that the nucleolar endoribonuclease may be necessary and sufficient to catalyze one of the initial endonucleolytic cleavages in preribosomal RNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1924599666,"Thirty-five proteins of known x-ray structure were radioiodinated and injected into HeLa cells. The cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of the lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride and chloroquine. These compounds did not inhibit the degradation of an injected protein unless its half-life was greater than 45 h. Among the more stable proteins the extent of inhibition was proportional to their half-lives. These results indicate that all injected proteins are transferred to lysosomes at comparable rates such that the fraction of a specific protein degraded in lysosomes depends upon its rate of degradation in the cytosol. That is, basal autophagy is nonselective in HeLa cells. The intracellular location of each injected protein was measured by homogenization of injected cells in sucrose and differential sedimentation or by extraction in buffers containing Triton X-100. Solubilities of the injected proteins ranged from 6 to 89%, and stabilities of 10 proteins, originally extracellular in function, were inversely proportional to their solubility. These results illustrate the potential importance of subcellular location on protein stability in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1834262258,"We previously showed that radioactive N-ethylmaleimide injected intramuscularly reacts with actomyosin and other muscle proteins and that a transfer of these modified proteins to lysosome-rich large granules was associated with their degradation (Gerard, K. W., and Schneider, D. L., (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11798-11805). We now show that muscle cells, when challenged by an increase in proteins modified with N-ethylmaleimide, can increase degradation by increasing the activities of enzymes involved in protein turnover. Cathepsin B activity increased 2-fold 36 h after injection of N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast, non-lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, calcium-dependent protease, and leucine aminopeptidase, did not significantly increase. Lysosomes are also involved in the degradation of normal muscle proteins labeled with [3H]leucine. Treatment with chloroquine, a known inhibitor of lysosome function, resulted in an inhibition of protein degradation, in an increase of the muscle protein content, and in the accumulation of radioactive proteins in lysosomal fractions. Chloroquine treatment for 2 days led to a 270% increase in cathepsin B and a 160% increase in lysosomal ATPase activities, but only a 30% increase in neutral proteinase activities. These results indicate a role for lysosomes in regulation of protein turnover in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1762051151,"The beta-crystallin basic principal polypeptide (beta Bp) appears to be altered in the lens of the Philly mouse and may be the main defect in this hereditary cataract. Northern blot analysis showed that an mRNA encoding for beta Bp is present in the Philly mouse lens, but normal beta Bp could not be detected. Instead, a different protein related to beta Bp has been observed. Western blot analysis with antibodies against specific beta Bp peptide sequences showed that the Philly protein shares the same amino-terminal residue as beta Bp but lacks a part of the carboxyl-terminal half of normal beta Bp. The altered protein is slightly smaller than beta Bp and has a more acidic isoelectric point by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. It also lacks the property of heat stability characteristic of normal beta Bp. The mapping of the alteration in beta Bp may give insight into the nature of the heat stability of this protein as well as some indication of the structural components that are necessary to maintain optical clarity in the lens."
https://openalex.org/W1590780628,"In a monensin-resistant mutant (Monr-31) of Chinese hamster ovary cells, the O-linked sugar chains of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor are altered, suggesting a mutation at a Golgi apparatus gene. In a compactin-resistant mutant (MF-2) of Chinese hamster V79 cells, the mature LDL receptor is apparently 5000 daltons smaller; the difference is due to altered glycosylation of O-linked sugar chains. Hybrids between MF-2 and Monr-31 still produced LDL receptor molecules with aberrant sugar chains; thus both mutants are in the same complementation group. Krieger and his colleagues (Krieger, M., Kingsley, D., Sege, R., Hobbie, L., and Kozarsky, K. (1985) Trends. Biochem. Sci. 10, 447-452) have classified Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants with altered LDL receptor structure into four groups: ldlA, ldlB, ldlC, and ldlD. Cell-cell hybrids between their ldl mutants and Monr-31 produced wild type mature LDL receptors with normal molecular sizes, suggesting that these compactin- and monensin-resistant mutants define a new class of LDL receptor mutant. Since both of our mutants are defective in internalization of LDL, we assign them as int mutants. This may imply a further etiology for hypercholesterolemia, and cases can now be examined for such a class."
https://openalex.org/W1537990460,"Tryptic digestion of the fully phosphorylated Ascaris suum pyruvate dehydrogenase complex yielded a single tetradecapeptide containing 2 phosphorylated serine residues. Its amino acid sequence was Tyr-Ser-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Thr-Ser(P)-Tyr-Arg and was very similar to one of the tryptic phosphopeptides isolated from mammalian and yeast pyruvate dehydrogenases. At partial phosphorylation, three peptides were isolated which corresponded to the monophosphorylated (sites 1 and 2) and diphosphorylated tetradecapeptides. In contrast to results reported from mammalian complexes, phosphorylation of the ascarid complex paralleled inactivation, and no additional phosphorylation occurred after inactivation was complete. Complete inactivation of the complex was associated with the incorporation of 1.7-1.9 mol of phosphoryl groups/mol of alpha-pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit, and the strict preference of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase for site 1 was not observed. Whereas site 1 was initially phosphorylated more rapidly than site 2, at 50% inactivation, 41% of the incorporated phosphoryl groups were incorporated into site 2. In addition, substantial amounts of peptide monophosphorylated at site 2 also accumulated, suggesting that prior phosphorylation at site 1 was not necessary for phosphorylation at site 2. Phosphorylation also caused a marked decrease in the mobility of the alpha-pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and the apparent separation of mono- and diphosphorylated forms of the enzyme. The significance of these observations in the regulation of the unique anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism of A. suum is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1625766862,"We have recently described the occurrence of integral membrane glycoproteins in rat liver smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum with O-N-acetylglucosamine facing the cytosolic and luminal sides of the membrane (Abeijon, C., and Hirschberg, C. B. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 1010-1014). We now report that integral membrane glycoproteins with cytosolic facing O-N-acetylglucosamine also occur in membranes of rat liver Golgi apparatus. This was determined following incubation of vesicles from the Golgi apparatus, which were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo, with UDP-[14C]galactose and saturating amounts of bovine milk galactosyltransferase. This enzyme does not enter the lumen of the vesicles and specifically catalyzes the addition of galactose, in a beta 1-4 linkage, to terminal N-acetylglucosamine. Under these conditions, galactose was transferred to a glycoprotein of molecular mass of 92 kDa. This protein was insoluble in sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, conditions under which integral membrane proteins remain membrane bound and was insensitive to treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F. beta Elimination and chromatography showed that radiolabeled galactose was part of a disaccharide which was characterized as Gal beta 1-4GlcNAcitol. This glycoprotein is specific of the Golgi apparatus membrane. Intrinsic membrane glycoproteins with this unusual carbohydrate membrane orientation thus occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1597935690,"Yolk proteins purified from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, from the frog Xenopus laevis, and from chicken eggs all have the unexpected property of binding strongly and preferentially to a left-handed Z-DNA probe, brominated poly(dG-dC). We estimate that the nematode proteins bind to Z-DNA with an association constant of at least 10(4) (M-1) and that this association constant is at least 40-50-fold higher than the association constant to B-DNA. Thus, yolk proteins have a higher Z-DNA specificity than most of the Z-DNA binding proteins previously isolated from other sources. Although yolk protein binding to Z-DNA is poorly competed by a wide variety of nucleic acids, the interaction is strongly competed by the phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid (500-1000-fold better than by the same mass of B-DNA). We suggest that Z-DNA interacts with the yolk protein phospholipid binding site. In general, our results emphasize the danger of using physical properties to infer biological function. In particular, our results should raise serious questions about the biological relevance of previously isolated Z-DNA binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1586423937,"Synthetic 32P-labeled oligonucleotides have been used to identify the prostatic proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) mRNA which has partially been characterized. The 14-mer d(G-G-T-T-C-T-G-C-A-T-A-A-T-G) complementary to the coding sequence for His-Tyr-Ala-Glu-Pro, a sequence element occurring in all 38-residue PRP variants, hybridizes specifically with a 12.5-kilobase mRNA which is clearly androgen-controlled. This oligonucleotide was used as an efficient primer for the construction of a PRP-specific lambda gt10 cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts from several recombinant clones has been determined. This structural analysis revealed a PRP mRNA encoding a large precursor containing a number of tandemly repeated units. Each repeat codes for a sequence of 100 amino acids in which the highly conserved PRP sequence is embedded. From this polyprotein the large number of PRP variants must be generated by a post-translational processing mechanism which is still unknown. The high degree of conservation of both nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the entire unit also indicates that the PRP gene(s) likely evolved by multiplication of a 300-base pair ancestral DNA sequence. This has resulted in a noninterrupted repetitive DNA coding segment which is detected at the genomic level."
https://openalex.org/W1555865862,"A protein doublet (Mr = 135,000/130,000) was found to coprecipitate with an unglycosylated form of the transferrin receptor in tunicamycin-treated A431 cells. This doublet is not detected with either a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor on Western blots indicating that these proteins do not interact directly with transferrin receptor antibody. Proteolytic digestion patterns of the individual proteins of the Mr = 135,000/130,000 doublet suggest that they are related to one another and are distinct from the transferrin receptor. Further characterization of these proteins indicates that they form a high molecular weight complex with the unglycosylated but not the glycosylated form of the transferrin receptor. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the proteins post-translationally associate with the receptor."
