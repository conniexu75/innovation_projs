https://openalex.org/W1986832558,"WHILE making a systematic investigation into the role of individual amino-acids on the nutritional requirements of Leishmania donovani, a protozoal parasite causing the disease kala-azar, strong transaminase activities were detected in the cell-free extracts of this organism. L. donovani, strain 81, cultured on Ray's medium1 at 22–24° C. was used for this investigation. After growth for three days on this medium the organism was scraped from the surface of the agar, washed once with isotonic saline, and then ground with sand, with gradual additions of distilled water. The crushed suspension was centrifuged at 2,500 r.p.m. for 10 min. and the supernate was used as the crude enzyme extract."

https://openalex.org/W2091011883,"THE liberation of histamine from cells damaged by ionizing radiations is considered to play an important part in certain radiation changes, particularly in skin erythema and in certain aspects of the acute radiation syndrome1. While some elevation of plasma histamine is said to occur after total-body irradiation2, estimations of tissue histamine following irradiation have been reported unchanged3 or lowered4. The administration of histamine at the time of irradiation, to animals subjected to lethal doses of total-body irradiation, has been found to afford a weak but variable protective effect5."

https://openalex.org/W1974995807,"MOST of the data accumulated in the past thirty-two years1 has led to the conclusion that parathyroid hormone is a protein. In 1954, Handler, Cohn and Dratz2 attempted to purify this hormone by means of ion-exchange chromatography, but found hormonal activity associated with a number of protein peaks. On the basis of their results, they suggested that the hormonal activity might reside in a smaller molecule, presumably not necessarily nitrogenous, which readily absorbs on proteins. Raoul, Mornay and Prelot3 have recently claimed to have prepared, by two different lipid extraction methods, a highly active material which did not contain nitrogen. On the basis of unreported evidence, they suggested that this active substance was steroidal in nature. Since the D vitamins, which are steroid, closely mimic, in some respects, the action of parathyroid hormone on bone and kidney, the possibility that this hormone is a steroid merits consideration."

https://openalex.org/W2066074473,"A FEW crystals of vitamin K (2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) and of cysteine (chorhydrate) are added to a solution containing 7–20 µgm./ml. of vitamin E (sodium phosphate of alpha-tocopherol). The solution is heated up to boiling point. About one minute after boiling the solution takes a blue tint. The intensity of colour is proportional to the content of vitamin E and increases during the following three minutes, finally rendering the solution opaque."

During the period of acute disturbance the predominating symptoms are fatigue, headache and nausea and some people vomit and have colonic evacuation1,2. The duration of the latent period, that is, the time from the commencement of irradiation until the onset of symptoms, not the onset of vomiting, is dependent on the surface-dose, body-size and anatomical site of irradiation3,4. Also a significant inverse relationship between dose-rate and the length of the latent period has been reported during the therapeutic administration of radioiodine5."

https://openalex.org/W1983698123,"INVESTIGATION of the relationships between population size and gene frequency in laboratory studies of Drosophila have been limited to small breeding groups (usually of less than one thousand individuals) because of the difficulty of estimating population number. Direct counts can be made when units of the types described by Reed and Reed1 and Buzzati-Traverso2 are in use, but the environment in these systems lacks constancy. The former has been modified3,4 for work on larger populations; but with this design there remains the possibility that migration between sections of the cage might be somewhat restricted. For that reason it was felt that the following technique might be of interest to other workers in this field."

https://openalex.org/W4235911811,"VISIBLE local modification of the cellular nuclear membrane is usually considered a phenomenon associated with the discharge of nucleic acid from nucleus to cytoplasm. Barr and Bertram1 have noted thin ‘nuclear caps’ in nerve cells concomitant with the reproduction of Nissl substance during recovery from antidromic stimulation. Such ‘nuclear caps’ appear as distinctive dense or thickened local areas of the nuclear membrane which stain with basic dyes, give positive histochemical reactions for nucleic acid, and absorb heavily at 2600 A. with ultra-violet light methods. Electron studies also indicate that the membrane may be thickened and modified during regeneration after axonic severance2."
