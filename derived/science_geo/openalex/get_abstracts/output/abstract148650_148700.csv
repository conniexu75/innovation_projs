https://openalex.org/W1545301666,"Electrical actuators were made from films of dielectric elastomers (such as silicones) coated on both sides with compliant electrode material. When voltage was applied, the resulting electrostatic forces compressed the film in thickness and expanded it in area, producing strains up to 30 to 40%. It is now shown that prestraining the film further improves the performance of these devices. Actuated strains up to 117% were demonstrated with silicone elastomers, and up to 215% with acrylic elastomers using biaxially and uniaxially prestrained films. The strain, pressure, and response time of silicone exceeded those of natural muscle; specific energy densities greatly exceeded those of other field-actuated materials. Because the actuation mechanism is faster than in other high-strain electroactive polymers, this technology may be suitable for diverse applications."

The most common tumor site is the carotid body (CB), a chemoreceptive organ that senses oxygen levels in the blood. Analysis of families carrying the PGL1 gene, described here, revealed germ line mutations in the SDHD gene on chromosome 11q23. SDHD encodes a mitochondrial respiratory chain protein—the small subunit of cytochrome b in succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (cybS). In contrast to expectations based on the inheritance pattern of PGL, the SDHD gene showed no evidence of imprinting. These findings indicate that mitochondria play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain tumors and that cybS plays a role in normal CB physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2170349574,"Brain function requires precisely orchestrated connectivity between neurons. Establishment of these connections is believed to require signals secreted from outgrowing axons, followed by synapse formation between selected neurons. Deletion of a single protein, Munc18-1, in mice leads to a complete loss of neurotransmitter secretion from synaptic vesicles throughout development. However, this does not prevent normal brain assembly, including formation of layered structures, fiber pathways, and morphologically defined synapses. After assembly is completed, neurons undergo apoptosis, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. Thus, synaptic connectivity does not depend on neurotransmitter secretion, but its maintenance does. Neurotransmitter secretion probably functions to validate already established synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W2006877529,"Cell-mediated (type-1) immunity is necessary for immune protection against most intracellular pathogens and, when excessive, can mediate organ-specific autoimmune destruction. Mice deficient in Eta-1 (also called osteopontin) gene expression have severely impaired type-1 immunity to viral infection [herpes simplex virus-type 1 (KOS strain)] and bacterial infection (Listeria monocytogenes) and do not develop sarcoid-type granulomas. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma production is diminished, and IL-10 production is increased. A phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the amino-terminal portion of Eta-1 and its integrin receptor stimulated IL-12 expression, whereas a phosphorylation-independent interaction with CD44 inhibited IL-10 expression. These findings identify Eta-1 as a key cytokine that sets the stage for efficient type-1 immune responses through differential regulation of macrophage IL-12 and IL-10 cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W2028232676,"Most marine populations are thought to be well connected via long-distance dispersal of larval stages. Eulerian and Lagrangian flow models, coupled with linear mortality estimates, were used to examine this assumption. The findings show that when simple advection models are used, larval exchange rates may be overestimated; such simplistic models fail to account for a decrease of up to nine orders of magnitude in larval concentrations resulting from diffusion and mortality. The alternative process of larval retention near local populations is shown to exist and may be of great importance in the maintenance of marine population structure and management of coastal marine resources."
https://openalex.org/W2165054897,"Genome-wide transcript profiling was used to monitor signal transduction during yeast pheromone response. Genetic manipulations allowed analysis of changes in gene expression underlying pheromone signaling, cell cycle control, and polarized morphogenesis. A two-dimensional hierarchical clustered matrix, covering 383 of the most highly regulated genes, was constructed from 46 diverse experimental conditions. Diagnostic subsets of coexpressed genes reflected signaling activity, cross talk, and overlap of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Analysis of the profiles specified by two different MAPKs—Fus3p and Kss1p—revealed functional overlap of the filamentous growth and mating responses. Global transcript analysis reflects biological responses associated with the activation and perturbation of signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1992028426,"Several spectroscopic methods were applied to study the characteristic properties of the electronic excitations in thin films of regioregular and regiorandom polythiophene polymers. In the regioregular polymers, which form two-dimensional lamellar structures, increased interchain coupling strongly influences the traditional one-dimensional electronic properties of the polymer chains. The photogenerated charge excitations (polarons) show two-dimensional delocalization that results in a relatively small polaronic energy, multiple absorption bands in the gap where the lowest energy band becomes dominant, and associated infrared active vibrations with reverse absorption bands caused by electron-vibration interferences. The relatively weak absorption bands of the delocalized polaron in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges may help to achieve laser action in nanocrystalline polymer devices using current injection."
https://openalex.org/W2113279188,"DNA damage is considered of paramount importance in aging. Among causes of this damage, free radical attack, particularly from mitochondrial origin, is receiving special attention. If oxidative damage to DNA is involved in aging, long-lived animals (which age slowly) should show lower levels of markers of this kind of damage than short-lived ones. However, this possibility has not heretofore been investigated. In this study, steady-state levels of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) referred to deoxyguanosine (dG) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) DNA from the heart of eight and the brain of six mammalian species ranging in maximum life span (MLSP) from 3.5 to 46 years. Exactly the same digestion of DNA to deoxynucleosides and HPLC protocols was used for mtDNA and nDNA. Significantly higher (three- to ninefold) 8-oxodG/dG values were found in mtDNA than in nDNA in all the species studied in both tissues. 8-oxodG/dG in nDNA did not correlate with MLSP across species either in the heart (r=-0.68; P<0.06) or brain (r = 0.53; P<0.27). However, 8-oxodG/dG in mtDNA was inversely correlated with MLSP both in heart (r=-0.92; P<0.001) and brain (r=-0.88; P<0.016) tissues following the power function y = a(.)x(b), where y is 8-oxodG/dG and x is the MLSP. This agrees with the consistent observation that mitochondrial free radical generation is also lower in long-lived than in short-lived species. The results obtained agree with the notion that oxygen radicals of mitochondrial origin oxidatively damage mtDNA in a way related to the aging rate of each species.-Barja, G., Herrero, A. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA is inversely related to maximum life span in the heart and brain of mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2113267766,A system for direct pharmacologic control of protein secretion was developed to allow rapid and pulsatile delivery of therapeutic proteins. A protein was engineered so that it accumulated as aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Secretion was then stimulated by a synthetic small-molecule drug that induces protein disaggregation. Rapid and transient secretion of growth hormone and insulin was achieved in vitro and in vivo. A regulated pulse of insulin secretion resulted in a transient correction of serum glucose concentrations in a mouse model of hyperglycemia. This approach may make gene therapy a viable method for delivery of polypeptides that require rapid and regulated delivery.
https://openalex.org/W2073703754,"Predicting the effects of an expected climatic change requires estimates and modeling of stochastic factors as well as density-dependent effects in the population dynamics. In a population of a small songbird, the dipper ( Cinclus cinclus ), environmental stochasticity and density dependence both influenced the population growth rate. About half of the environmental variance was explained by variation in mean winter temperature. Including these results in a stochastic model shows that an expected change in climate will strongly affect the dynamics of the population, leading to a nonlinear increase in the carrying capacity and in the expected mean population size."

Gravitational potential energy differences control the large fault-normal compression on the California coast. Deformation in the Basin and Range is driven, in part, by gravitational potential energy differences, but extension directions there are modified by plate interaction stresses. The California shear zone has relatively low vertically averaged viscosity of about 10 21 pascal·seconds, whereas the Basin and Range has a higher vertically averaged viscosity of 10 22 pascal·seconds."

https://openalex.org/W1904408604,"Angiotensin II (ANG II) is a well-established participant in many cardiovascular disorders, but the mechanisms involved are not clear. Vascular cell experiments suggest that ANG II is a potent stimulator of free radicals such as superoxide anion, an agent known to inactivate nitric oxide and promote the formation of peroxynitrite. Here we hypothesized that ANG II reduces the efficacy of NO-mediated vascular relaxation and promotes vascular peroxynitrite formation in vivo. ANG II was infused in rats at sub-pressor doses for 3 days. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged on day 3 despite significant reductions in plasma renin activity. Thoracic aorta was isolated for functional and immunohistochemical evaluations. No difference in isolated vascular contractile responses to KCI (125 mM), phenylephrine, or ANG II was observed between groups. In contrast, relaxant response to acetylcholine (ACh) was decreased sixfold without a change in relaxant response to sodium nitroprusside. Extensive prevalence of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT, a stable biomarker of tissue peroxynitrite formation) immunoreactivity was observed in ANG II-treated vascular tissues and was specifically confined to the endothelium. Digital image analysis demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between ACh relaxant response and 3-NT immunoreactivity. These data demonstrate that ANG II selectively modifies vascular NO control at sub-pressor exposures in vivo. Thus, endothelial dysfunction apparently precedes other established ANG II-induced vascular pathologies, and this may be mediated by peroxynitrite formation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1985973563,"Concentrations of atmospheric noble gases (neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) dissolved in groundwaters from northern Oman indicate that the average ground temperature during the Late Pleistocene (15,000 to 24,000 years before present) was 6.5 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C lower than that of today. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic groundwater data show that the origin of atmospheric water vapor changed from a primarily southern, Indian Ocean source during the Late Pleistocene to a dominantly northern, Mediterranean source today. The reduced northern water vapor source is consistent with a drier Last Glacial Maximum through much of northern Africa and Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W1510509865,"Reperfusion of ischemic tissue results in the generation of reactive oxygen species that contribute to tissue injury. The sources of reactive oxygen species in reperfused tissue are not fully characterized. We hypothesized that the small GTPase Rac1 mediates the oxidative burst in reperfused tissue and thereby contributes to reperfusion injury. In an in vivo model of mouse hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, recombinant adenoviral expression of a dominant negative Rac1 (Rac1N17) completely suppressed the ischemia/reperfusion-induced production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and resulted in a significant reduction of acute liver necrosis. Expression of Rac1N17 also suppressed ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute apoptosis. The protection offered by Rac1N17 was also evident in knockout mice deficient for the gp91phox component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This work demonstrates the crucial role of a Rac1-regulated oxidase in mediating the production of injurious reactive oxygen species, which contribute to acute necrotic and apoptotic cell death induced by ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. Targeted inhibition of this oxidase, which is distinct from the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, should provide a new avenue for in vivo therapy aimed at protecting organs at risk from ischemia/reperfusion injury.-Ozaki, M., Deshpande, S. S., Angkeow, P., Bellan, J., Lowenstein, C. J., Dinauer, M. C., Goldschmidt-Clermont, P. J., Irani, K.

https://openalex.org/W1812245576,"HGF/SF and its receptor (Met) are principal mediators of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in several different systems and have recently been implicated in the control of hair follicle (HF) growth. We have studied their expression patterns during HF morphogenesis and cycling in C57BL/6 mice, whereas functional hair growth effects of HGF/SF were assessed in vivo by analysis of transgenic mice and in skin organ culture. In normal mouse skin, follicular expression of HGF/SF and Met was strikingly localized: HGF/SF was found only in the HF mesenchyme (dermal papilla fibroblasts) and Met in the neighboring hair bulb keratinocytes. Both HGF/SF and Met expression peaked during the initial phases of HF morphogenesis, the stage of active hair growth (early and mid anagen), and during the apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Met+ cells in the regressing epithelial strand appeared to be protected from undergoing apoptosis. Compared to wild-type controls, transgenic mice overexpressing HGF/SF under the control of the MT-1 promoter had twice as many developing HF and displayed accelerated HF development on postnatal day 3. They also showed significant catagen retardation on P17. In organ culture and in vivo, HGF/SF i.c. resulted in a significant catagen retardation. These results demonstrate an important role of HGF/SF and Met in murine hair growth control and suggest that Met-mediated signaling might be exploited for therapeutic manipulation of human hair growth disorders.-Lindner, G., Menrad, A., Gherardi, E., Merlino, G., Welker, P., Handjiski, B., Roloff, B., Paus, R.

https://openalex.org/W1607177619,"Viruses used for gene therapy are usually genetically modified to deliver therapeutic transgenes and prevent viral replication. In contrast, replication-competent viruses may be used for cancer therapy because replication of some viruses within cancer cells can result in their destruction (oncolysis). Viral ribonucleotide reductase expression is defective in the HSV1 mutant hrR3. Cellular ribonucleotide reductase, which is scarce in normal liver and abundant in liver metastases, can substitute for its viral counterpart to allow hrR3 replication in infected cells. Two or three log orders more of hrR3 virions are produced from infection of colon carcinoma cells than from infection of normal hepatocytes in viral replication assays. This viral replication is oncolytic. A single intravascular administration of hrR3 into immune-competent mice bearing diffuse liver metastases dramatically reduces tumor burden. hrR3-mediated tumor inhibition is equivalent in immune-competent and immune-incompetent mice, suggesting that viral oncolysis and not the host immune response is the primary mechanism of tumor destruction. HSV1-mediated oncolysis of diffuse liver metastases is effective in mice preimmunized against HSV1. These results indicate that replication-competent HSV1 mutants hold significant promise as cancer therapeutic agents.—Yoon, S. S., Nakamura, H., Carroll, N. M., Bode, B. P., Chiocca, E. A., Tanabe, K. K. An oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 selectively destroys diffuse liver metastases from colon carcinoma. FASEB J. 14, 301–311 (2000)"
https://openalex.org/W1540295714,"Using a novel vessel culture technique in combination with antisense oligonucleotide transfection, we tested whether the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is a cytochrome P450 (CYP)-related compound. Isolated resistance arteries from hamster gracilis muscle (n=19) were perfused and exposed to antisense (As), sense (S), or scrambled (Scr) oligonucleotides against the coding region of CYP2C8/9, an isoform expressed in endothelial cells. Thereafter, NO- and prostaglandin-independent, EDHF-mediated vascular responses associated with hyperpolarization [i.e., decrease in smooth muscle calcium (Fura 2) and vasodilation] were studied after the application of acetylcholine (ACh). These EDHF-mediated responses were markedly attenuated (by 70%) by As- but not by S- or Scr-oligonucleotide treatment. However, the responses to norepinephrine (0.3 µmol/l), the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (1 µmol/l), and the KCa channel activator NS1619 (100 µmol/l) were unaltered. As treatment, which specifically targeted the endothelial layer (as assessed by confocal microscopy), had no inhibitory effect on increases in endothelial calcium to ACh. It is concluded that a CYP2C8/9-related isoform functions as an EDHF synthase in hamster resistance arteries and that a product of this enzyme is an EDHF, or at least an integral part of the signaling cascade leading to EDHF-mediated responses.—Bolz, S.-S., Fisslthaler, B., Pieperhoff, S., de Wit, C., Fleming, I., Busse, R., Pohl, U.

https://openalex.org/W2095187370,"Small guanosine triphosphatases, typified by the mammalian Ras proteins, play major roles in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways. A subclass of evolutionarily conserved Ras-like proteins was identified, members of which differ from other Ras proteins in containing amino acids at positions 12 and 61 that are similar to those present in the oncogenic forms of Ras. These proteins, kappaB-Ras1 and kappaB-Ras2, interact with the PEST domains of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta [inhibitors of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)] and decrease their rate of degradation. In cells, kappaB-Ras proteins are associated only with NF-kappaB:IkappaBbeta complexes and therefore may provide an explanation for the slower rate of degradation of IkappaBbeta compared with IkappaBalpha."

https://openalex.org/W2097217313,"Calcium signaling critical to neural functions is mediated through Ca(2+) channels localized on both the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum. Whereas Ca(2+) influx occurs via the voltage- or/and ligand-sensitive Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores that amplifies further the Ca(2+) signal is thought to be involved in more profound and lasting changes in neurons. The ryanodine receptor, one of the two major intracellular Ca(2+) channels, has been an important target for studying Ca(2+) signaling in brain functions, including learning and memory, due to its characteristic Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. In this study, we report regional and cellular distributions of the type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mRNA in the rat brain, and effects of spatial learning on RyR2 gene expression at mRNA and protein levels in the rat hippocampus. Using in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and ribonuclease protection assays, significant increases in RyR2 mRNA were found in the hippocampus of rats trained in an intensive water maze task. With immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, protein levels of RyR2 were also demonstrated to be increased in the microsomal fractions prepared from hippocampi of trained rats. These results suggest that RyR2, and hence the RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) signals, may be involved in memory processing after spatial learning. The increases in RyR2 mRNA and protein at 12 and 24 h after training could contribute to more permanent changes such as structural modifications during long-term memory storage.

https://openalex.org/W1547279429,"Intercellular calcium signals are propagated in multicellular hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The stimulation of connected hepatocytes by glycogenolytic agonists induces reproducible sequences of intracellular calcium concentration increases, resulting in unidirectional intercellular calcium waves. Hepatocytes are characterized by a gradient of vasopressin binding sites from the periportal to perivenous areas of the cell plate in hepatic lobules. Also, coordination of calcium signals between neighboring cells requires the presence of the agonist at each cell surface as well as gap junction permeability. We present a model based on the junctional coupling of several hepatocytes differing in sensitivity to the agonist and thus in the intrinsic period of calcium oscillations. In this model, each hepatocyte displays repetitive calcium spikes with a slight phase shift with respect to neighboring cells, giving rise to a phase wave. The orientation of the apparent calcium wave is imposed by the direction of the gradient of hormonal sensitivity. Calcium spikes are coordinated by the diffusion across junctions of small amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphos phate (InsP3). Theoretical predictions from this model are confirmed experimentally. Thus, major physiological insights may be gained from this model for coordination and spatial orientation of intercellular signals.—Dupont, G., Tordjmann, T., Clair, C., Swillens, S., Claret, M., Combettes, L.

https://openalex.org/W1787791892,"FGF-2 exerts its pleiotropic effects on cell growth and differentiation by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. In addition, exogenously added FGF-2 is translocated from outside the cell to the nucleus during G1-S transition. In this study, we show that a single point mutation in FGF-2 (substitution of residue serine 117 by alanine) is sufficient to drastically reduce its mitogenic activity without affecting its differentiation properties. The FGF-2(S117A) mutant binds to and activates tyrosine kinase receptors and induces MAPK and p70S6K activation as strongly as the wild-type FGF-2. We demonstrate that this mutant enters NIH3T3 cells, is translocated to the nucleus, and is phosphorylated similar to the wild-type growth factor. This suggests that FGF-2 mitogenic activity may require, in addition to signaling through cell surface receptors and nuclear translocation, activation of nuclear targets. We have previously shown that, in vitro, FGF-2 directly stimulates the activity of the casein kinase 2 (CK2), a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase involved in the control of cell proliferation. We report that, in vivo, FGF-2(WT) transiently interacts with CK2 and stimulates its activity in the nucleus during G1-S transition in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, the FGF-2(S117A) mutant fails to interact with CK2. Thus, our results show that FGF-2 mitogenic and differentiation activities can be dissociated by a single point mutation and that CK2 may be a new nuclear effector involved in FGF-2 mitogenic activity.

https://openalex.org/W1595724240,"Regulation of transcriptional responses in growth-arrested human cells under conditions that promote potentially lethal damage repair after ionizing radiation (IR) is poorly understood. Sp1/retinoblastoma control protein (RCP) DNA binding increased within 30 min and peaked at 2-4 h after IR (450-600 cGy) in confluent radioresistant human malignant melanoma (U1-Mel) cells. Increased phosphorylation of Sp1 directly corresponded to Sp1/RCP binding and immediate-early gene induction, whereas pRb remained hypophosphorylated. Transfection of U1-Mel cells with the human papillomavirus E7 gene abrogated Sp1/RCP induction and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle checkpoint arrest responses, increased apoptosis and radiosensitivity, and augmented genetic instability (i.e., increased polyploidy cells) after IR. Increased NF-kappaB DNA binding in U1-Mel cells after IR treatment lasted much longer (i.e., >20 h). U1-Mel cells overexpressing dominant-negative IkappaBalpha S32/36A mutant protein were significantly more resistant to IR exposure and retained both G(2)/M and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle checkpoint responses without significant genetic instability (i.e., polyploid cell populations were not observed). Nuclear p53 protein levels and DNA binding activity increased only after high doses of IR (>1200 cGy). Disruption of p53 responses in U1-Mel cells by E6 transfection also abrogated G(0)/G(1) cell cycle checkpoint arrest responses and increased polyploidy after IR, but did not alter radiosensitivity. These data suggest that abrogation of individual components of this coordinate IR-activated transcription factor response may lead to divergent alterations in cell cycle checkpoints, genomic instability, apoptosis, and survival. Such coordinate transcription factor activation in human cancer cells is reminiscent of prokaryotic SOS responses, and further elucidation of these events should shed light on the initial molecular events in the chromosome instability phenotype.-Yang, C.-R., Wilson-Van Patten, C., Planchon, S.

https://openalex.org/W1807269668,"Aspartylglycosaminuria (AGU), the most common lysosomal disorder of glycoprotein degradation, is caused by deficient activity of glycosylasparaginase (AGA). AGA-deficient mice share most of the clinical, biochemical and histopathologic characteristics of human AGU disease. In the current study, recombinant human AGA administered i.v. to adult AGU mice disappeared from the systemic circulation of the animals in two phases predominantly into non-neuronal tissues, which were rapidly cleared from storage compound aspartylglucosamine. Even a single AGA injection reduced the amount of aspartylglucosamine in the liver and spleen of AGU mice by 90% and 80%, respectively. Quantitative biochemical analyses along with histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the pathophysiologic characteristics of AGU were effectively corrected in non-neuronal tissues of AGU mice during 2 wk of AGA therapy. At the same time, AGA activity increased to 10% of that in normal brain tissue and the accumulation of aspartylglucosamine was reduced by 20% in total brain of the treated animals. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the corrective enzyme was widely distributed within the brain tissue. These findings suggest that AGU may be correctable by enzyme therapy.-Dunder, U., Kaartinen, V., Valtonen, P., Väänänen, E., Kosma, V.-M., Heisterkamp, N., Groffen, J., Mononen, I.

https://openalex.org/W1603236469,"Sulfation is a major modification of many molecules in eukaryotes that is dependent on the enzymatic synthesis of an activated sulfate donor, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). While sulfate activation has long been assumed to occur in the cytosol, we show in this study that human PAPS synthetase 1 (PAPSS1), a bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase enzyme sufficient for PAPS synthesis, accumulates in the nucleus of mammalian cells. Nuclear targeting of the enzyme is mediated by its APS kinase domain and requires a catalytically dispensable 21 amino acid sequence at the amino terminus. Human PAPSS1 and Drosophila melanogaster PAPSS localize to the nucleus in yeast and relieve the methionine auxotrophy of ATP sulfurylase- or APS kinase-deficient strains, suggesting that PAPSS1 is fully functional in vivo when targeted to the nucleus. A second PAPS synthetase gene, designated PAPSS2, has recently been described, mutations of which are responsible for abnormal skeletal development in human spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia and murine brachymorphism. We found that PAPSS2, which localizes to the cytoplasm when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, is relocated to the nucleus when coexpressed with PAPSS1. Taken together, these results indicate that a sulfation pathway might exist in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.—Besset, S., Vincourt, J.-B., Amalric, F., Girard, J.-P.

Oxidative stress was induced by occluding both common carotid arteries for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Escherichia coli exonuclease III (Exo III) removes apyrimidinic or apurinic (AP) sites and 3'-phosphate termini in single-strand breaks, and converts these lesions to 3'OH termini. These ExoIII-sensitive sites (EXOSS) can then be postlabeled using digoxigenin-11-dUTP and Klenow DNA polymerase-I, and detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-IgG against digoxigenin. Compared with the non-ischemia controls, the density of EXOSS-positive cells was elevated at least 20-fold (P < 0.01) at 15 min of reperfusion, and remained elevated for another 30 min. EXOSS mainly occurred in the cell nuclei of the astrocytes and neurons. Signs of cell death were detected at 24 h of reperfusion and occurred mostly in the neurons. Both DNA damage and cell death in the cerebral cortical neurons were abolished by treatment with 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), which specifically inhibited nNOS. Our results suggest that nNOS, its activator (calcium), and peroxynitrite exacerbate oxidative DNA damage after brain ischemia.—Huang, D., Shenoy, A., Cui, J., Huang, W., Liu, P.

https://openalex.org/W1517455532,"CD44 is a multifunctional cell adhesion molecule that participates in pathological states such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. CD44 is induced on vascular smooth muscle cells after arterial wall injury and may mediate their proliferation and migration into the neointima during arteriosclerosis. We have demonstrated elsewhere that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β up-regulates CD44 mRNA and protein expression in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) by increasing gene transcription. By transient transfection of 5'-deletion constructs into RASMC, we show in the present study that a conserved AP-1 site 110 base pairs from the transcription start site of the mouse CD44 promoter is important for basal activity. Mutation of the AP-1 site significantly reduced induction of promoter activity by IL-1β, and electro-phoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Fos and c-Jun were present in the CD44 AP-1 binding complex after IL-1β stimulation. In addition, cotransfection of the architectural transcription factor high mobility group (HMG)-I(Y) protein with c-Fos and c-Jun markedly increased trans-activation of the CD44 promoter. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that AP-1 proteins are a central regulatory component used by IL-1β to modulate expression of CD44 during an inflammatory response in vascular smooth muscle cells and that transcription of CD44 by AP-1 proteins is enhanced by HMG-I(Y).—Foster, L.

https://openalex.org/W1588138231,"In this work, we have devised an intracellular immunization strategy for the expression in high amounts of ATF-saporin, a targeted chimeric toxin constituted by the ATF receptor binding domain of human urokinase and the plant ribosome-inactivating protein saporin, which has been shown to be highly cytotoxic to target cells. This strategy may allow the production of highly toxic secretory proteins in eukaryotic cells, avoiding cell suicide caused by autointoxication. The procedure consists of equipping host cells with cytosolic neutralizing antibodies directed toward the toxic domain of the heterologous polypeptide. We show that this intracellular immunization is essential for the synthesis of correctly folded, biologically active ATF-SAP in the high amounts needed to investigate its in vivo anti-metastatic potential. Such a strategy should be generally useful for the production of toxic molecules of therapeutic value whose folding and maturation require transit through the eukaryotic secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1678410420,The quantum world will always tend towards the classical world through a process known as decoherence. This is a major barrier to the success of quantum computers and quantum communication. New experiments that engineer decoherence in the laboratory throw light on what happens when a quantum system evolves into a classical system.
