https://openalex.org/W2014476086,"The temperature at which ""clean"" supercooled water freezes has been determined as a function of pressure up to 3 kilobars, using a differential thermal analysis technique on subdivided water samples. The supercooling limit of such samples, -38°C at normal pressure, is lowered by initial increase of pressure, reaching a minimum value of -92°C at 2.00 kilobars."
https://openalex.org/W2078627602,"The basic concepts for direct and catalyzed photodissociation of water have been summarized. Water dissociation in closed-cycle processes based on endothermic photochemical reactions offers a potential solution to the solar energy conversion problem. Transition metal complexes, whose excited state chemistry is extremely rich (23, 24) although mostly unexplored, are, in principle, suitable ""catalysts"" for cycles of this type. The most interesting cycles are those involving metal hydrido complexes or binuclear complexes in which the two metal atoms are bound into a macrocyclic ligand. Systematic investigations of the photochemistry of transition metal complexes with the aim of designing suitable systems for solar energy conversion have long-range promise and merit further consideration."

Transmission of this determinant affects the virulence of the fungus to the extent that host invasion by previously virulent isolates is limited.

https://openalex.org/W2015096727,"The conversion of wood into chemicals for the production of most of our synthetic plastics, fibers, and rubbers is technically feasible. With refinements in technology a large integrated plant utilizing all components of the wood for production of ethanol (to be further processed to ethylene and butadiene), phenols and furfural would be approaching economic feasibility as well at current petrochemical prices. If crude oil prices continue to climb at a faster rate than wood costs, the economic feasibility of chemicals for polymers from wood would become certain. Although technical feasibility has not been established, synthetic oils from liquefaction of wood might serve as feedstocks for cracking to chemicals in the same way that crude oil is presently used. The fulfillment of all our polymer needs from wood as a raw material should not place an impossible burden on our wood supply, but might actually improve the availability of wood for lumber, plywood and pulp by providing a use for less valuable wood which would allow reforestation and improved forest management."

Saya de Malha Bank, also on the Mascarene Ridge, appears to be composed of volcanic rocks capped by coral. It is suggested that the two areas are structurally independent."

https://openalex.org/W2087020366,"The AAU universities, a prime recruiting ground for new faculty members in selective colleges and research-oriented universities, are significantly increasing the number of doctorates awarded to women and minority members and are decreasing the numbers awarded to majority males. Between 1969-72 and 1972-75, doctorates awarded by AAU universities to majority men declined by 9 percent; to majority women increased by 34 percent; to minority men increased by 61 percent; and to minority women increased by 133 percent. The field distribution is very uneven. In some fields women with doctorates are fairly numerous, but most of these fields are ones in which women have for long constituted a significant portion of the total. In other fields, notably engineering and some of the physical sciences, it is still difficult to find women with doctorates from the universities in which large numbers of new faculty members receive their graduate education. Increasing numbers of minority students are earning doctorates in some fields, but in many fields the number is still very low. The several minority groups show quite different patterns of distribution among fields of specialization. The two smaller groups-American Indian and Spanish-origin-are most like the white majority in distribution by fields. Black doctorates are concentrated in education, with relatively few in the sciences. Students of Asian ancestry are heavily concentrated in engineering and the natural sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2093032517,"The atmospheric temperature-pressure profiles derived from the Pioneer 10-Pioneer 11 radio occultation experiment are mutually consistent but differ markedly from the results of other investigations. Current studies indicate that the occultation interpretation contains errors that were made very large by an inherent magnification effect, and that these errors have both geometrical and equipment sources. The apparent consistency between the Pioneer 10 and the Pioneer 11 results must be considered fortuitous. Despite these difficulties, the occultation technique, when optimally instrumented and carefully interpreted, retains its potential for atmospheric profile measurements of high accuracy and resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2008269935,"Molecular hybridization techniques have been used to estimate the degree of DNA base sequence homology between some members of the fern genus Osmunda. Under conditions permitting extensive reassociation, measurements of the extent of interspecific reaction and the thermal stability of the hybrid molecules indicated that O. claytoniana L. (interrupted fern) shares more DNA homology with O. cinnamomea L. (cinnamon fern) than it does with O. regalis L. (royal fern). These findings are in conflict with predictions from a recent analysis of living and fossil specimens by numerical techniques. However, they are consistent with the earlier, more traditional, taxonomic assignments."
https://openalex.org/W2064010067,"A method for dating geological samples which uses fission product xenon in a manner similar to the use of radiogenic argon in the 40Ar-39Ar technique has been developed. The results of stepwise heating experiments for a zircon from the Ahaggar region in the Sahara are compared to the geochronology determined by the rubidiumstrontium, uranium-thorium-lead, and potassium-argon dating methods."

The pigment was extracted with alkali and analyzed by chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods. The results indicate that the pigment is astacene (3,3',4,4'-tetra-keto-beta-carotene), the oxidation product of astaxanthin."
https://openalex.org/W2033153404,"Models for the Helium Atom.---(1) Bohr's model is unsatisfactory because it gives too great a value for the ionizing potential and is not in accord with the optical and magnetic properties of helium. Now the chemical evidence suggests that each electron in an atom has its own separate orbit, and that these orbits are closely interrelated. Accordingly two new models are considered. (2) In the double circle model the two electrons are assumed to move in two separate, parallel, circular orbits. The model, however, is unstable, for the ionizing potential, computed by applying the quantum theory, comes out negative. Another objection is that the magnetic moment is not zero. (3) In the semi-circular model each electron is assumed to oscillate back and forth along an approximately semi-circular path in accord with classical mechanics, each being brought to rest at the end of its path by the repulsion of the other. Assuming the maximum angular momentum of each equal to $\frac{h}{2\ensuremath{\pi}}$, the absolute dimensions of the model were computed. The total energy comes out less than for the Bohr model, and the ionizing potential, 25.62 volts, agrees closely with the experimental value. The magnetic moment is zero.Application of the Quantum Theory to Coupled Electrons.---The success of the semi-circular model in giving the correct value for the ionizing potential of helium suggests that in the case of coupled electrons the quantum theory should be applied not to the momentum of the individual electrons according to the relation $\ensuremath{\int}\mathrm{pdq}=\frac{h}{2\ensuremath{\pi}}$, but rather to the momentum which, by being relayed from one electron to another, passes in each direction around the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2052806242,"A geophysical traverse across the Sierra Madera ""Dome"" indicates a negative gravity anomaly of 1½ milligals over the zone of brecciation in the center and a residual positive anomaly of ½ milligal associated with a positive magnetic anomaly of 25 × 10-5 oersted to the southeast of the zone of brecciation. Areal surveys are needed before any definite conclusions can be drawn concerning the origin of Sierra Madera. However, gravity and magnetic data can be extremely valuable in establishing criteria for classifying terrestrial and lunar features according to meteoritic and cryptovolcanic origin."

The original chemical composition has been greatly modified by corrosion, calcification, and chlorination. The source and diffusion of various elements detected were traced to study the original composition."
