https://openalex.org/W2083206813,"Interleukin 33 (IL-33), a member of the Interleukin 1 cytokine family, is implicated in numerous human inflammatory diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite its pathophysiologic importance, fundamental questions regarding the basic biology of IL-33 remain. Nuclear localization and lack of an export signal sequence are consistent with the view of IL-33 as a nuclear factor with the ability to repress RNA transcription. However, signaling via the transmembrane receptor ST2 and documented caspase-dependent inactivation have suggested IL-33 is liberated during cellular necrosis to effect paracrine signaling. We determined the subcellular localization of IL-33 and tracked its intracellular mobility and extracellular release. In contrast to published data, IL-33 localized simultaneously to nuclear euchromatin and membrane-bound cytoplasmic vesicles. Fluorescent pulse-chase fate-tracking documented dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic flux, which was dependent on nuclear pore complex function. In murine fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, mechanical strain induced IL-33 secretion in the absence of cellular necrosis. These data document IL-33 dynamic inter-organelle trafficking and release during biomechanical overload. As such we recharacterize IL-33 as both an inflammatory as well as mechanically responsive cytokine secreted by living cells.

For instance, IL-33 has been shown to be heterochromatin associated, functioning as a transcriptional repressor in living cells (2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-33 is known to signal via a transmembrane receptor complex of ST2 and Interelukin-1 receptor accessory protein, activating downstream tyrosine kinases and modulating NF-κB activity (3.Lingel A. Weiss T.M. Niebuhr M. Pan B. Appleton B.A. Wiesmann C. Bazan J.F. Fairbrother W.J.

As IL-33 is cleaved at its receptor binding site by caspase 3 in the context of cellular apoptosis,(5.Cayrol C. Girard J.P. The IL-1-like cytokine IL-33 is inactivated after maturation by caspase-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) it has been suggested that IL-33 is released from the nuclear space only during necrosis, whereby it is free to bind its cell surface receptor and affect paracrine inflammatory signaling. The lack of a nuclear export sequence, and like other alarmins such as high-mobility group protein B1 and members of the Interleukin 1 family such as Interleukin-1 α and β, the lack of a canonical secretory signal sequence have been taken as support for the alarmin hypothesis of IL-33. Interestingly however, IL-33 expression is stimulated in the context of non-fatal cellular stretch, particularly in mechano-sensitive cells such as fibroblasts (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Thus an alterative hypothesis to resolve this inconsistency is that IL-33 is trafficked for release from living cells via non-classical mechanisms upon sublethal biomechanical strain. To address this possibility, we sought to clarify the subcellular location and inter-organelle flux of IL-33 in resting and mechanically stimulated cells, and explored IL-33 release both in vitro and in vivo. interleukin N-terminally tetracysteine-tagged IL-33 hemagglutinin epitope tag rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts human skin fibroblasts human coronary endothelial cells anti-IL-33 antibody (Nessy-1 clone) anti-IL-33 antibody (a11 clone) euchromatin heterochromatin chromatin nuclear pore complex dextran wheat germ agglutinin transaortic constriction.

Fluoroproteins were similarly subcloned with engineered restriction enzyme sites. HA and tetracysteine tags were engineered into PCR primers with sequences 5′-TGTTGTCCCGGGTGTTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-TACCCTTACGATGTACCGGATTACG-CACTCGACGCA-3′, respectively. pCR-Blunt II Topo vector was used as intermediate vector. Fluoroprotein and epitope tags were cloned at the 5′- or 3′-end of IL-33 in the pCDH-EF1-MCS-T2A-Puro lentiviral vector for cell line creation or in pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP for in vivo gene transfer. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Lentiviral constructs were introduced with psPAX and pMD2.G packaging and envelope vectors into 293TN cells using PureFection reagent per manufacturer's protocol. 72 h later, culture media were harvested and lentiviral particles concentrated by ultracentrifugation (if destined for in vivo delivery) or Peg-IT reagent (if destined for cell line creation). Stable cell lines were created by transducing NIH3T3 cells with concentrated lentivirus plus polybrene and subjecting them to subsequent puromycin selection. Expression was confirmed via Western blotting for IL-33 and/or HA as appropriate. For in vivo lentiviral delivery, virus was titered by transducing NIH3T3 cells. MOI was calculated by flow cytometric counting of the percent of cells displaying copGFP reporter fluorescence. Lentivirus was delivered at an MOI of 950–1000. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines published in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Harvard Medical School Standing Committee on Animals. C57BL/6L male mice between the ages of 8–10 weeks under pentobarbital anesthesia and with ventilator assist were used as described (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). For myocardial gene transfer, ten microliters of lentivirus with polybrene was directly injected into left ventricular myocardial tissue under visualization via thoracotomy. For pulmonary gene transfer, forty microliters of lentivirus with polybrene was instilled into the trachea. Postoperative care was conducted as described (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). On post-operative day seven, mice were either anesthetized with pentobarbital and ventricular or pulmonary tissue harvested or mice underwent transaortic constriction versus sham surgery as described (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). After surgery, mice were maintained in post-operative recovery for 2 h prior to sacrifice and tissue harvest. All tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to 70% ethanol dehydration, paraffin embedding, and sectioning. Cells were plated at subconfluence on fibronectin-coated strain dishes as described (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Cyclic strain was conducted at 1 Hertz, 8% biaxial stretch in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferring, and selenium. Media was collected at end-strain and passed through a 0.2-micron filter. Cellular lysates from independent unstrained samples were collected in RIPA buffer and diluted in an equal volume of serum-free medium. Samples were interrogated via anti-IL-33 ELISA. Optical density was converted to absolute IL-33 concentration via standard curve utilizing recombinant human IL-33 serially diluted in DMEM. Stable cell lines expressing a tetracysteine-tagged IL-33 were pulsed with a tetracysteine-avid fluorescein dye and washed with British anti-lewisite in PBS (FlAsH reagent, Invitrogen) per manufacturer's instructions. Cells were either fixed, or allowed a chase period prior to fixation prior to further immunohistochemical processing and microscopy. For cytoskeleton disruption experiments, cells were pre-treated with either latrunculin B (1 μm in DMEM) or nocodazole (5 μm in DMEM) 2 h prior to pulse initiation. For ATP depletion experiments, cells were switched from high-glucose DMEM growth medium to glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 25 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 6 mm sodium azide 2 h prior to pulse initiation. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X. Tissues sections were processed via citrate-buffer antigen retrieval. Samples were then blocked with 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated in AlexaFluor secondary antibodies for one hour at room temperature. Hoescht dye was used for nucleic acid counterstaining. For HA-tag immunofluorescence in tissue sections, the signal was resolved via biotinylated secondary antibody followed by tyrimide amplification prior to fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin tertiary antibody application. For immunohistochemistry of pulmonary tissue sections, samples were processed as above. Mouse-on-mouse and streptavidin-biotin blocking kits were utilized prior to incubation in primary antibody. Samples were imaged via confocal or epifluorescent microscopy as indicated. For epifluorescence, images were captured on an Olympus IX-70 microscope via Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For time-lapse microscopy, images were captured on an Olympus IX-70 microscope with an automated, motorized stage controlled via IP Lab software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For confocal microscopy, images were captured on a Carl Zeiss LSM-710 microscope via LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss, Germany). For tetracysteine-based electron microscopy, cells were grown on fibronectin-coated Aclar membranes (Honeywell International, Canton, MA, USA) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Resorufin derivative treatment and photoconversion of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine were performed as described (7.Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Specific covalent labeling of recombinant protein molecules inside live cells.Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Standard transmission electron microscopy techniques were then utilized as described (8.Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R. Bouwer J. Tour O. Laird D.W. Sosinsky G.E. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Multicolor and electron microscopic imaging of connexin trafficking.Science. 2002; 296: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). All images were post-processed in ImageJ (NIH) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Statistical analyses were performed with PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). For two sample comparisons, a two-tailed t test was employed. For time-course experiments, significance was assessed via one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Multiple Comparison post-test. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. p values less than 0.05 are considered significant. Previously published data suggest that IL-33 fused to a fluoroprotein occupies a nuclear position (2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 9.Moussion C. Ortega N. Girard J.P. The IL-1-like cytokine IL-33 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of endothelial cells and epithelial cells in vivo: a novel ‘alarmin‘?.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 10.Küchler A.M. Pollheimer J. Balogh J. Sponheim J. Manley L. Sorensen D.R. De Angelis P.M. Scott H. Haraldsen G. Nuclear interleukin-33 is generally expressed in resting endothelium but rapidly lost upon angiogenic or proinflammatory activation.Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 1229-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly in our hands, fibroblasts stably expressing fluoroprotein-tagged IL-33 displayed restricted nuclear localization. When these cells were subjected to cyclic biaxial stretch, nuclear localization of the fusion protein was unaltered (supplemental Fig. S1). Because IL-33 is a 32 kilodalton protein, fusion to a fluoroprotein roughly doubles its molecular weight; it is therefore possible that our current understanding of IL-33 behavior is biased by an artificial restriction of cellular mobility induced by fluoroprotein fusion. Consistent with this supposition, immunofluorescent interrogation of wild type IL-33 in primary endothelial cells and fibroblasts in culture revealed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1A). This localization was also seen in a fibroblast cell line stably expressing IL-33 fused to a small epitope tag (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, overexpression of this HA epitope-tagged IL-33 in cardiac ventricular tissue and respiratory epithelium in vivo revealed an identical nucleo-cytoplasmic staining pattern (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that when IL-33 mobility is not restricted by fusion to a fluoroprotein, it simultaneously occupies both nuclear and cytoplasmic positions. Because IL-33 contains a nuclear localization sequence and chromatin-binding domain in its N terminus,(2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that IL-33 exhibits dynamic inter-organelle flux between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Utilizing fluorescent dyes engineered for avidity to a four-cysteine epitope (7.Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Specific covalent labeling of recombinant protein molecules inside live cells.Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) we found that fibroblasts stably expressing tetracysteine-tagged IL-33 (TC-IL-33) exhibited nuclear and cytoplasmic localization mimicking the native expression pattern in primary cells (Fig. 2A). As these tetracysteine-avid dyes are compatible with electron microscopy, we defined the sub-cellular geography of IL-33 in resting fibroblasts expressing TC-IL-33. Nuclear IL-33 molecules were clustered in areas of euchromatin, in distinction to the association of fluoroprotein-tagged IL-33 with heterochromatin as described previously (2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasmic space, amalgams of electron density could be seen within membrane-bound vesicles, explaining the speculated pattern of cytoplasmic IL-33 staining seen by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that in resting cells, IL-33 associates with nuclear euchromatin and simultaneously resides in the vesicular compartment of the cytoplasm. It was unclear whether the cytoplasmic residence of IL-33 occurs just after molecular synthesis or if newly synthesized molecules are first transported to the nucleus, from where they then efflux into the cytoplasmic space for vesicular packaging. To investigate this, we imaged live cells stably expressing TC-IL-33 via epifluorescent time-lapse microscopy after a pulse of tetracysteine-avid dye. Beginning at 20 min post-pulse and proceeding over the course of 2 h, uniformly stained cells gradually lost their nuclear fluorescence to exhibit a predominantly cytoplasmic pattern, suggesting translocation of nuclear IL-33 to membrane-bound cytoplasmic vesicles over time (Fig. 2C and supplemental video). When these cells were treated with an acidophilic fluorophore at the end of the chase period, colocalization of IL-33 and acidic cytoplasmic granules was noted, suggesting cytoplasmic IL-33 is packaged into secretory vesicles or late endosomes (data not shown). To confirm that newly synthesized molecules are indeed initially trafficked to the nuclear space, we performed a pulse-chase-pulse experiment whereby fibroblasts stably expressing TC-IL-33 were treated with tetracysteine-avid fluorescein dye, rendering all existent TC-IL-33 molecules fluorescent in the green spectral range. Subsequently, the dye was withdrawn and the live cells were allowed a chase period. At the end of the chase, a pulse of tetracysteine-avid resorufin dye was administered, rendering all newly synthesized IL-33 molecules fluorescent in the red spectral range. When no chase period is permitted, all nuclear and cytoplasmic TC-IL-33 molecules appeared fluorescein-bound without evidence of resorufin fluorescence. When a 40-min chase period was permitted, fluorescein fluorescence was relegated to the cytoplasmic space, with resorufin fluorescence evident solely in the nucleus (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that newly synthesized IL-33 molecules are initially imported into the nucleus for euchromatin association, from where they gradually efflux into the cytoplasmic space to be packaged into secretory vesicles. The cellular machinery involved in nuclear efflux of IL-33 was suggested by the finding that increasing the molecular weight of IL-33 via fluoroprotein fusion restricted its localization to the nucleus. As nuclear pore complexes are known to be unbiased in their transport of proteins with molecular weight under 40 kilodaltons (11.Weis K. Regulating access to the genome: nucleocytoplasmic transport throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). IL-33 may utilize the pore complex as a means of inter-organelle transit. To investigate this possible relationship between the nuclear pore complex and IL-33, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was performed. On nuclear membrane cross-section, electron densities of TC-IL-33 highlighted the nuclear pore complexes. When nuclear pores were sectioned en face, IL-33 molecules could be seen within the central core of the complex itself (Fig. 3A). To document the functional necessity of pore complexes for IL-33 nuclear efflux, we inhibited pore complex molecular transport via wheat germ agglutinin microinjection prior to tetracysteine-avid dye pulse-chase. After a 60 min chase period, control cells revealed the expected loss of nuclear fluorescence and retained a spiculated cytoplasmic fluorescence, consistent with trans-organelle movement of IL-33 from nucleus to cytoplasmic vesicles. However, in wheat germ agglutinin-injected cells, nuclear efflux of TC-IL-33 was abrogated, documented by retention of labeled IL-33 in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). These data suggest IL-33 utilizes the nuclear pore complex in its gradual efflux from the nuclear to cytoplasmic vesicular space in resting cells. To better understand possible mechanisms underlying the observed nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of IL-33, pulse-chase experiments were conducted in the context of cytoskeletal disruption or under conditions of cellular ATP depletion. When cells stably expressing TC-IL-33 were pretreated with latrunculin B (to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton) prior to tetracysteine-avid fluorescein derivative pulse-chase, the pattern and timing of nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of IL-33 was similar to control (Fig. 4B). However, when similar experiments were conducted in the presence of nocodazole (to disrupt the microtubule network), cytoplasmic vesicular IL-33 localization was seen at time 0 (immediately after tetracysteine-avid fluorescein derivative pulse), suggesting that an intact microtubule network retards nuclear efflux of IL-33 (Fig. 4C). When pulse-chase experiments were conducted in under glucose-free conductions and in the presence of sodium azide (to poison mitochondrial ATP production), cytoplasmic vesicular IL-33 staining was seen at end-chase, but the vesicles appeared perinuclear in their location, rather than distributed throughout the cytoplasm as was seen in controls. This observation may suggest that cytoplasmic distribution of vesicular IL-33 may be an ATP-dependent process (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these findings suggest that the kinetics of IL-33 nucleo-cytoplasmic flux is affected by the microtubule network, and ATP is required for normal cytoplasmic transit. The observed localization of IL-33 to cytoplasmic vesicles, and IL-33's known up-regulation in the context of sublethal biomechanical strain (6.Sanada S. Hakuno D. Higgins L.J. Schreiter E.R. McKenzie A.N. Lee R.T. IL-33 and ST2 comprise a critical biomechanically induced and cardioprotective signaling system.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1538-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) ideally positions this cytokine for release from mechanically stressed cells whereby it could carry out its extracellular functions as a danger signal to neighboring cells without the need for cellular necrosis. To investigate this possibility, fibroblasts stably expressing TC-IL-33 were subjected to cyclic biaxial stretch for pre-specified time periods. Over the first 4 h of stimulus, a gradual and significant increase in extracellular IL-33 concentration could be detected. A subsequent decline in the extracellular concentration of IL-33 by 8 h of strain suggested rapid degradation of the protein when it is removed from its intracellular locale (Fig. 5A). Given that fragmentation of IL-33 by proteases is a known phenomenon (5.Cayrol C. Girard J.P. The IL-1-like cytokine IL-33 is inactivated after maturation by caspase-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 12.Hayakawa M. Hayakawa H. Matsuyama Y. Tamemoto H. Okazaki H. Tominaga S. Mature interleukin-33 is produced by calpain-mediated cleavage in vivo.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 387: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) we constructed a fluorescent immunoassay which simultaneously interrogated the N and C termini of TC-IL-33 to ascertain if the full-length protein is released in the context of mechanical deformation. By this method, after 4 h of cyclic biaxial strain, an increase in extracellular IL-33 concentration was detected in comparison to unstrained control (Fig. 5B), suggesting IL-33 was indeed secreted as a fully intact molecule. To confirm that the application of mechanical deformation was not causing cell loss or death, we verified cellular viability by assessing cell density immediately before, immediately after, and 1 day after the application of 4 h of biomechanical strain, and by assessing membrane-impermeant nucleic acid dye uptake and propidium idodide uptake after the application of 4 h of cyclic strain. Preservation of cellular viability was revealed by all three methods (p value non-significant versus control, data not shown). Together these data document the time-dependent release of uncleaved, full-length IL-33 from living cells under conditions of sublethal biomechanical strain. We verified that the phenomenon of IL-33 release from living, mechanically stressed cells was not a feature of cell lines but also a property of primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Primary human skin fibroblasts in culture subjected to cyclic biaxial strain secreted IL-33 into the extracellular space measurable after 4 h of stimulus (Fig. 5C). To extend this finding of IL-33 release to in vivo conditions, mice co-expressing HA-tagged IL-33 and a non-fusion GFP reporter in myocardial tissue via viral gene transfer were subjected to acute transaortic constriction, which induces acute pressure overload of the left ventricle and causes an abrupt mechanical stress at the cellular level. Immunofluorescent analysis of tissue sections documented co-localization of the HA and GFP signals in sham-operated hearts. In hearts subjected to 2 h of pressure overload however, HA-IL-33 was absent from GFP-positive cells, suggesting the release of IL-33 from healthy ventricular myocytes when subjected to mechanical stress (Fig. 5D). These data therefore document the secretion of IL-33 from living cells subjected to acute biomechanical strain both in culture and in vivo. In this work, we describe IL-33 as a multi-organelle protein released from mechanically stressed cells. Fluorescent molecular fate-tracking revealed that newly synthesized molecules are initially shuttled into the nucleus to associate with euchromatin, from where IL-33 utilizes the nuclear pore complex to transit into the cytoplasmic space and reside in membrane-bound vesicles. Euchromatic localization of IL-33 is consistent with published data suggesting IL-33 may serve as a repressor of transcription (2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Although gene silencing is generally associated with facultative or constitutive heterochromatin, evidence suggests that expression of genes within transcriptionally active euchromatin may be modulated by various factors (e.g. protein-based transcriptional modifiers). Whether IL-33 acts as an “insulator” protein, what its binding partners may be, and what its precise function is within euchromatic regions of the nucleus remains to be investigated (13.Vogelmann J. Valeri A. Guillou E. Cuvier O. Nollmann M. Roles of chromatin insulator proteins in higher-order chromatin organization and transcription regulation.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The evidence for nucleo-cytoplasmic flux of IL-33 and the protein's residence in cytoplasmic vesicles ideally positions IL-33 for release in response to physical cellular strain. Consistent with this notion, we documented secretion of uncleaved IL-33 from living cells upon the application of biomechanical stress. The finding that microtubule disruption enhances the kinetics of IL-33 efflux was surprising. Traditionally, an interaction between microtubules and nuclear pore complexes has been studied in the context of non-canoncial nuclear import (14.Wagstaff K.M. Jans D.A. Importins and beyond: non-conventional nuclear transport mechanisms.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Whether and in precisely what fashion nuclear pore complexes and the perinuclear microtubule network interact with IL-33 to modulate efflux kinetics remains to be explored in more detail. The current understanding of IL-33 biology classifies this molecule as a heterochromatin-associated nuclear transcription factor (2.Carriere V. Roussel L. Ortega N. Lacorre D.A. Americh L. Aguilar L. Bouche G. Girard J.P. IL-33, the IL-1-like cytokine ligand for ST2 receptor, is a chromatin-associated nuclear factor in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Because the receptor for IL-33 exists as a transmembrane protein complex, and given IL-33 is cleaved in its receptor-binding domain during apoptosis by caspase 3, it has been suggested that IL-33 is liberated only upon cellular necrosis (5.Cayrol C. Girard J.P. The IL-1-like cytokine IL-33 is inactivated after maturation by caspase-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). IL-33 has therefore been grouped with Interleukin-1 beta and High-mobility group protein B1 as an “alarmin.” The data presented here articulates a behavior of IL-33 in living biomechanically responsive cells both at rest and under conditions of physical deformation. Therefore IL-33 may be recharacterized as not only an inflammatory cytokine, but also a mechano-sensitive paracrine factor. Based on this, we propose functional grouping of IL-33 with Interleukin-1 alpha, which exhibits similar properties as an inflammatory and stress-responsive factor (15.Lee R.T. Briggs W.H. Cheng G.C. Rossiter H.B. Libby P. Kupper T. Mechanical deformation promotes secretion of IL-1α and IL-1 receptor antagonist.J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5084-5088PubMed Google Scholar). In aggregate then, these molecules comprise a novel class of cytokines which not only function as signals in an activated innate immune system but also respond to mechanical stimuli via rapid secretion from structural and supporting cells of physically stressed mammalian tissues. It is possible that IL-33 behaves differently, with differing subcellular localization and secretory characteristics, depending on the cell type and stimulus applied. Data published to date has focused on cells of the innate immune system, particularly mast cells, basophils, and other granulocytes. Our seemingly contradictory data in fibroblasts may reflect the specific conditions of a physical stimulus on a mechano-sensitive cell type. Furthermore, although in vitro strain experiments are relatively pure in the sense that the controlled stimulus is exclusively physical in nature, it has been shown that cardiac pressure overload results not only in mechanical strain on cardiac cells, but also activates numerous inflammatory cytokine loops such as those involving interleukin-18 (16.Colston J.T.

Whether the observed release of IL-33 from living ventricular cells in vivo represents a correlate to the in vitro mechanical strain condition or is more attributable to these paracrine systems is unclear. In our system, the short duration (2 h) of transaortic constriction needed to elicit IL-33 release would suggest that mechanical stimulus rather than paracrine systems involved in cardiac hypertrophy are at play. In conclusion, while IL-33 is typically regarded as an inflammatory cytokine with extracellular function prompted by necrosis-mediated release, we recharacterize IL-33 as a mechanically responsive molecule secreted from living cells subjected to biomechanical overload and place it within a restricted class of such interleukins with active in both inflammatory and biomechanically stressed conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2096345656,"The jasmonate hormonal pathway regulates important defensive and developmental processes in plants. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has been identified as a specific ligand binding the COI1-JAZ co-receptor to relieve repression of jasmonate responses. Two JA-Ile derivatives, 12OH-JA-Ile and 12COOH-JA-Ile, accumulate in wounded Arabidopsis leaves in a COI1- and JAR1-dependent manner and reflect catabolic turnover of the hormone. Here we report the biochemical and genetic characterization of two wound-inducible cytochromes P450, CYP94C1 and CYP94B3, that are involved in JA-Ile oxidation. Both enzymes expressed in yeast catalyze two successive oxidation steps of JA-Ile with distinct characteristics. CYP94B3 performed efficiently the initial hydroxylation of JA-Ile to 12OH-JA-Ile, with little conversion to 12COOH-JA-Ile, whereas CYP94C1 catalyzed preferentially carboxy-derivative formation. Metabolic analysis of loss- and gain-of-function plant lines were consistent with in vitro enzymatic properties. cyp94b3 mutants were largely impaired in 12OH-JA-Ile levels upon wounding and to a lesser extent in 12COOH-JA-Ile levels. In contrast, cyp94c1 plants showed wild-type 12OH-JA-Ile accumulation but lost about 60% 12COOH-JA-Ile. cyp94b3cyp94c1 double mutants hyperaccumulated JA-Ile with near abolition of 12COOH-JA-Ile. Distinct JA-Ile oxidation patterns in different plant genotypes were correlated with specific JA-responsive transcript profiles, indicating that JA-Ile oxidation status affects signaling. Interestingly, exaggerated JA-Ile levels were associated with JAZ repressor hyperinduction but did not enhance durably defense gene induction, revealing a novel negative feedback signaling loop. Finally, interfering with CYP94 gene expression affected root growth sensitivity to exogenous jasmonic acid. These results identify CYP94B3/C1-mediated oxidation as a major catabolic route for turning over the JA-Ile hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2063272225,"Numerous receptors for ATP, ADP, and adenosine exist; however, it is currently unknown whether a receptor for the related nucleotide adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) exists. Using a novel cell-based assay to visualize adenosine receptor activation in real time, we found that AMP and a non-hydrolyzable AMP analog (deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphonate, ACP) directly activated the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R). In contrast, AMP only activated the adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B)R) after hydrolysis to adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E, CD73) or prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP, ACPP). Adenosine and AMP were equipotent human A(1)R agonists in our real-time assay and in a cAMP accumulation assay. ACP also depressed cAMP levels in mouse cortical neurons through activation of endogenous A(1)R. Non-selective purinergic receptor antagonists (pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid and suramin) did not block adenosine- or AMP-evoked activation. Moreover, mutation of His-251 in the human A(1)R ligand binding pocket reduced AMP potency without affecting adenosine potency. In contrast, mutation of a different binding pocket residue (His-278) eliminated responses to AMP and to adenosine. Taken together, our study indicates that the physiologically relevant nucleotide AMP is a full agonist of A(1)R. In addition, our study suggests that some of the physiological effects of AMP may be direct, and not indirect through ectonucleotidases that hydrolyze this nucleotide to adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W2050469523,"Phytochrome is a multidomain dimeric red light photoreceptor that utilizes a chromophore-binding domain (CBD), a PHY domain, and an output module to induce cellular changes in response to light. A promising biotechnology tool emerged when a structure-based substitution at Asp-207 was shown to be an infrared fluorophore that uses a biologically available tetrapyrrole chromophore. We report multiple crystal structures of this D207H variant of the Deinococcus radiodurans CBD, in which His-207 is observed to form a hydrogen bond with either the tetrapyrrole A-ring oxygen or the Tyr-263 hydroxyl. Based on the implications of this duality for fluorescence properties, Y263F was introduced and shown to have stronger fluorescence than the original D207H template. Our structures are consistent with the model that the Y263F change prevents a red light-induced far-red light absorbing phytochrome chromophore configuration. With the goal of decreasing size and thereby facilitating use as a fluorescent tag in vivo, we also engineered a monomeric form of the CBD. Unexpectedly, photoconversion was observed in the monomer despite the lack of a PHY domain. This observation underscores an interplay between dimerization and the photochemical properties of phytochrome and suggests that the monomeric CBD could be used for further studies of the photocycle. The D207H substitution on its own in the monomer did not result in fluorescence, whereas Y263F did. Combined, the D207H and Y263F substitutions in the monomeric CBD lead to the brightest of our variants, designated Wisconsin infrared phytofluor (Wi-Phy)."
https://openalex.org/W2065450489,"Increased nutrient intake leads to excessive adipose tissue accumulation, obesity, and the development of associated metabolic disorders. How the intestine signals to adipose tissue to adapt to increased nutrient intake, however, is still not completely understood. We show here, that the gut peptide GLP-1 or its long-lasting analog liraglutide, function as intestinally derived signals to induce adipocyte formation, both in vitro and in vivo. GLP-1 and liraglutide activate the GLP-1R, thereby promoting pre-adipocyte proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. This is achieved at least partly through activation of ERK, PKC, and AKT signaling pathways. In contrast, loss of GLP-1R expression causes reduction in adipogenesis, through induction of apoptosis in pre-adipocytes, by inhibition of the above mentioned pathways. Because GLP-1 and liraglutide are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, these findings implicate GLP-1 as a regulator of adipogenesis, which could be an alternate pathway leading to improved lipid homeostasis and controlled downstream insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1976733080,"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathologies of photoreceptor cells, and the protective role of antioxidant enzymes for photoreceptor cells have been well understood. However, their essentiality has remained unknown. In this study we generated photoreceptor-specific conditional knock-out (CKO) mice of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and showed the critical role of GPx4 for photoreceptor cells. In the wild-type retina the dominant GPx4 expression was in the mitochondria, indicating the mitochondrial variant was the major GPx4 in the retina. In the GPx4-CKO mice, although photoreceptor cells developed and differentiated into rod and cone cells by P12, they rapidly underwent drastic degeneration and completely disappeared by P21. The photoreceptor cell death in the GPx4-CKO mice was associated with the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and TUNEL-positive cells. Photoreceptor cells before undergoing apoptosis (P11) exhibited decreased mitochondrial biomass, decreased number of connecting cilia, as well as disorganized structure of outer segments. These findings indicate that GPx4 is a critical antioxidant enzyme for the maturation and survival of photoreceptor cells."

RNA profile of bacterial spores is dynamic at a time when they are considered dormant ? The RNA content of aging spores incubated at high temperatures is degraded ? Transcription is evident several days post-sporulation in spores kept at low temperature ? Germination is affected by spore age, incubation temperature, and RNA state In response to nutrient limitation, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and its relatives enter a process of cellular differentiation called sporulation, culminating in the formation of a highly resilient spore. Bacterial spores can survive long periods of time and withstand extremes of heat, radiation, and chemical assault via mechanisms that are not yet fully understood (Errington, 2003Errington J. Regulation of endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Piggot and Hilbert, 2004Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W.

Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30 (297–41)Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). During the course of sporulation, a polar septum forms, dividing the cell into two unequal-sized progenies: a smaller forespore compartment that becomes the mature spore and a larger mother cell, which nurtures the developing spore. Subsequently, the forespore is engulfed by the mother cell, and its cytoplasm becomes the spore core (Piggot and Hilbert, 2004Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, Stragier and Losick, 1996Stragier P. Losick R. Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30 (297–41)Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A thick cell wall material called the cortex is synthesized around the core, followed by a dense multilayered proteinaceous coat that is assembled by the mother cell onto the forespore surface. Recently, a new additional outermost layer of the spore, named the crust, was identified (McKenney et al., 2010McKenney P.T. Driks A. Eskandarian H.A. Grabowski P. Guberman J. Wang K.H. Gitai Z. Eichenberger P. A distance-weighted interaction map reveals a previously uncharacterized layer of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 934-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These outer layers of cortex, coat, and crust provide the spore with mechanical protection while excluding most molecules (Driks, 2002Driks A.

Spore germination.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Eventually, after approximately 8 hr of development, when sporulation is complete, the mature spore is liberated by lysis of the mother cell (Piggot and Hilbert, 2004Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, Stragier and Losick, 1996Stragier P. Losick R. Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30 (297–41)Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The spore can convert within minutes to an actively growing cell via a process called germination, which is induced by a variety of molecules including amino acids, sugars, and cell wall muropeptides. These germinant molecules bind to receptors in the inner spore membrane, signaling the spore to resume a vegetative life form (Dworkin and Shah, 2010Dworkin J. Shah I.M.

During germination, the spore undergoes rehydration, cortex hydrolysis, and coat disassembly. In addition, many of the spore-specific proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids, probably in order to provide precursors for protein synthesis (Setlow, 1995Setlow P. Mechanisms for the prevention of damage to DNA in spores of Bacillus species.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Following germination, in a process called outgrowth, the new cell starts to emerge from the disintegrating coat, elongates, synthesizes macromolecules, and progresses toward cell division (Moir, 2006Moir A.

Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30 (297–41)Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), little is known about the characteristics and complexity of the dormant spore. The spore is protected by thick layers and has unusual biochemical and biophysical properties that make it a challenging biological system to investigate (Setlow, 1995Setlow P. Mechanisms for the prevention of damage to DNA in spores of Bacillus species.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Driks, 2002Driks A. Maximum shields: the assembly and function of the bacterial spore coat.Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 251-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Spores are considered metabolically inert, as they contain high levels of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid) and a low amount of water (Gerhardt and Marquis, 1989Gerhardt P. Marquis R.E. Regulation of Procaryotic Development, 1 edn. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1989Google Scholar). It is believed that spore dehydration results in the formation of an insolubly gelled-core with reversible bonds between macromolecules (Black and Gerhardt, 1962Black S.H. Gerhardt P.

Such interactions could form an immobile matrix that keeps the spore stable and metabolically inert (Black and Gerhardt, 1962Black S.H. Gerhardt P. Permeability of bacterial spores. IV.

Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar). It is still disputed whether the spore is entirely dormant or whether it maintains some metabolic processes. In fact, it has been shown that bacterial spores do contain certain enzymatic activities; full maturation of coat proteins was found to be dependent on enzymatic reactions taking place subsequently to release of the spore from the mother cell (Zilhão et al., 2005Zilhão R. Isticato R. Martins L.O. Steil L. Völker U. Ricca E. Moran Jr., C.P. Henriques A.O. Assembly and function of a spore coat-associated transglutaminase of Bacillus subtilis.J.

Microbiol. 2011; 77: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, spores of Bacilli species isolated from coastal marine sediments have been shown to enzymatically oxidize manganese, an activity that was found to be associated with the spore outer layers (Francis and Tebo, 2002Francis C.A. Tebo B.M. Enzymatic manganese(II) oxidation by metabolically dormant spores of diverse Bacillus species.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some evidence for molecular dynamics within the spore core have also been obtained; spores of Clostridium botulinum were found to repair single-strand DNA breaks during their dormant state (Durban et al., 1974Durban E. Grecz N. Farkas J. Direct enzymatic repair of deoxyribonucleic acid single-strand breaks in dormant spores.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of B. subtilis spores revealed molecular mobility of phosphorous compounds within the spore core (Leuschner and Lillford, 2000Leuschner R.G. Lillford P.J. Effects of hydration on molecular mobility in phase-bright Bacillus subtilis spores.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that B. subtilis spores display changes in their RNA content a few days post-sporulation, at a time they are considered dormant. In mature spores, incubated at high temperatures, the RNA underwent global degradation, but when kept at low temperature, transcription was evident. Our data indicate that entering quiescence is a process that lasts a few days. During this period spores are responsive to environmental cues and undergo molecular changes affecting their exit from dormancy. To explore whether spore macromolecules are subjected to dynamic changes, we surveyed the content of spore RNA for several days post-sporulation. For this purpose, we established procedures that enable the immediate extraction of RNA solely from intact spores (Figures S1A and S1B available online and Experimental Procedures). Cells were induced to sporulate at 37°C for 24 hr, and these day-old spores were incubated for an additional week at the same temperature. During this period of incubation, RNA was extracted from the aging spores, and samples were analyzed using a microfluidic gel, in which the detected molecules were mainly ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Surprisingly, the rRNA profile readily monitored displayed an age-specific pattern (Figures 1A and S1D). The rRNA was degraded continuously over time, with the 23S rRNA species exhibiting pronounced degradation, and the 16S rRNA displaying a more gradual decrease. Similar profiles were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1D), confirming the observed patterns.Figure 1rRNA Dynamics in Aging SporesShow full caption(A–C) RNA was extracted from decoated B. subtilis (PY79) spores at the indicated age and temperature and analyzed in a microfluidic gel (see Experimental Procedures).

We then tested whether the observed RNA degradation reflects bona fide processes occurring in vivo within mature spores and is not generated in vitro by activating ribonucleases during RNA extraction. To this end, RNA was purified from spores mixed with either pre-obtained vegetative RNA or whole vegetative cells, serving as indicators for any in vitro effect. In both mixtures the vegetative RNA remained intact (Figure 1E), excluding the possibility of in vitro degradation of RNA. Thus, we conclude that spore rRNA content undergoes active changes in vivo at a time the spore is believed to be dormant. The rRNA decay monitored in aging spores suggested that degradation is executed by RNases active within spores. To test this possibility, we investigated the effect of various RNases on the decay of spore rRNA. For this purpose, strains mutated or depleted for different RNases (Table S1), known and putative, were induced to sporulate, and their rRNA profiles followed for 5 days post-sporulation and compared with that of wild-type (WT) spores. Out of 20 different examined strains, only the strain depleted of RNaseY exhibited reduced rRNA degradation (Figures 2A and S2A). The extent of RNaseY depletion was estimated by following sporulating cells harboring RNaseY-GFP encoded under the same inducible promoter (Figure S2B ). RNaseY is encoded by a single gene operon (rny) and is a key component of a protein complex comprising the B. subtilis RNA degradosome involved in mRNA processing (Commichau et al., 2009Commichau F.M.

Initiation of decay of Bacillus subtilis rpsO mRNA by endoribonuclease RNase Y.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed that sporulating cells depleted of RNaseY produced spores with less 23S and 16S rRNAs compared with WT cells. However, the rRNA of the depleted cells remained stable, as clear rRNA bands were visible throughout the course of the experiment (Figures 2A and 2B). We then verified that ectopic expression of the rny allele restores the WT phenotype (Figure 2A) and were able to detect RNaseY-YFP fluorescence within spores (Figure 2D), thereby substantiating that the observed phenotype is indeed dependent on RNaseY. Taken together, it seems that an active mechanism exists to degrade rRNA within aging spores and that RNaseY plays a major role in this process.Figure S2Analysis of Spores Mutated for Different RNases, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Bioanalyzer pseudogel of RNA extracted from decoated aging WT (PY79) and different RNase mutant spores (Table S1, tested strains with double mutations are not shown), at day 1 (upper panel) and day 5 (lower panel) (see Experimental Procedures).

Scale bar represents 1 μm. Having discovered that the rRNA reservoir is influenced by spore age, we examined whether the spore mRNA also exhibits dynamic behavior. We first determined the transcriptome of a day-old spore and then followed the fate of the identified transcripts for several days. Microarray analysis revealed the spore to contain 369 transcripts encoded by genes of various functional groups (Table S2). Previously, only 25 transcripts were identified in B. subtilis dormant spores (Keijser et al., 2007Keijser B.J.F. Ter Beek A. Rauwerda H. Schuren F. Montijn R. van der Spek H. Brul S. Analysis of temporal gene expression during Bacillus subtilis spore germination and outgrowth.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3624-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 17 of which were detected here. The spore transcripts are encoded by genes mainly involved in basic cellular processes such as DNA metabolism (6 genes), transcription (20 genes), translation (28 genes), and several metabolic pathways (48 genes). The spore also harbors mRNA from genes required for sporulation and germination (70 genes), those required for adaptation to atypical conditions (20 genes), and a large group of genes with unknown function (143 genes). Unexpectedly, the sporulation group included many mother cell-specific genes particularly involved in coat assembly (40 out of 68 genes). The detection of coat transcripts in the spore was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Figure S3A ). These transcripts may have been actively translocated from the mother cell into the forespore via the recently identified “feeding tube” connecting the two chambers (Camp and Losick, 2009Camp A.H.

USA. 2008; 105: 15100-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the coat transcripts could have been trapped in the coat during its construction, a possibility that is supported by the recent observation that bacterial mRNAs are targeted to the future destination of their encoded proteins (Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011Nevo-Dinur K. Nussbaum-Shochat A. Ben-Yehuda S. Amster-Choder O. Translation-independent localization of mRNA in E. coli.Science. 2011; 331: 1081-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the latter case, however, these coat transcripts may not be accessible for processes occurring in the core. Taken together, a day-old spore encases mRNAs transcribed during sporulation, including mother cell-specific molecules, along with transcripts required for fundamental cellular activities. Next, we followed the destiny of the identified mRNAs for a period of 1 week post-sporulation. As observed for rRNAs, the majority of spore transcripts exhibited decreasing mRNA levels over time. This drop took place mainly between days 1 and 5, whereas relatively little variation was observed between days 5 and 8 (Figures 3A and S3B; Table S2), suggesting that the spore reaches a steady state or halts its activity. qRT-PCR examination of several transcripts was consistent with this degradative pattern (Figures 3D and S3E). In addition, a few transcripts that exhibited a nonsignificant decrease in the microarray analysis showed decreasing profiles using the more sensitive qRT-PCR method (e.g., ribT in Figures 3A and 3D). The degradation profile was largely dependent on RNaseY, as the level of several examined transcripts was nearly constant in the absence of this protein (Figure 2C; data not shown). The global degradation of spore RNA might be a strategy to facilitate spore dormancy by shutting off essential cellular activities. The detection of active RNA degradation in aging spores prompted us to explore whether environmental conditions, such as temperature, can influence this process. We therefore induced cells to sporulate at 37°C for 24 hr and then shifted the day-old spores to 50°C for an additional week of incubation. RNA was extracted from the aging spores, and samples were analyzed. The RNA obtained from spores incubated at 50°C evidenced similar rRNA patterns to those observed for 37°C-incubated spores, yet degradation occurred more rapidly (Figures 1B, 1D, and S1D). We confirmed again the in vivo origin of the observed degradation profiles and found them to be genuine (Figure S1C). Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses showed that the mRNA levels of 50°C-incubated spores dropped mainly between days 1 and 3 and then reached a steady state (Figures 3B, 3D, S3C, and S3E; Table S2). These transcriptome dynamics preceded those observed at 37°C and resembled the accelerated rate of rRNA degradation observed at 50°C. Our results suggest that spores incubated at high temperatures speed up their progression toward dormancy. Next, we wished to examine the effect of low temperature on spore RNA dynamics. As before, cells were induced to sporulate at 37°C for 24 hr and then shifted to 4°C for an additional week of incubation. Markedly, the spores maintained a relatively constant level of rRNA molecules with almost no visible degradation in the course of 8 days (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1D). To follow the mRNA fate at this temperature, we monitored the levels of the identified transcripts present in a day-old spore (Table S2) during additional incubation at 4°C. At day 3 a significant portion (35%) of the examined mRNAs exhibited decreased levels, similar to the pattern observed in 37°C- and 50°C-kept spores (Figures 3C, 4A, S3D, and S3F). However, a large fraction of the examined transcripts maintained constant levels (53%), whereas the remaining transcripts (12%) surprisingly exhibited increased levels (Figures 3C and 4A). Thus, spore RNA experiences various fates at 4°C, unlike the unidirectional decreasing trend observed at high temperatures. Further investigation of the upregulated spore transcripts revealed a group of 250 mRNAs, poorly rep"

Ten disparate mutations were identified in 14 patients (38.9% of the cohort), including p.N71Y in AARS (2.8%), p.T164A in HSPB1 (2.8%), and p.[H256R]+[R282H] in GDAP1 (2.8%) in one patient each, three NEFL mutations in six patients (16.7%) and four MFN2 mutations in five patients (13.9%). The following six mutations were novel: the individual AARS, HSPB1 and GDAP1 mutations and c.475-1G>T, p.L233V and p.E744M mutations in MFN2. An in vitro splicing assay revealed that the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation causes a 4 amino acid deletion (p.T159_Q162del). Despite an extensive survey, the genetic causes of CMT2 remained elusive in the remaining 22 CMT2 patients (61.1%).This study illustrates the spectrum of CMT2 mutations in a Taiwanese CMT2 cohort and expands the number of CMT2-associated mutations. The relevance of the AARS and HSPB1 mutations in the pathogenesis of CMT2 is further highlighted. Moreover, the frequency of the NEFL mutations in this study cohort was unexpectedly high. Genetic testing for NEFL and MFN2 mutations should, therefore, be the first step in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 in ethnic Chinese."

Here, we present a comprehensive mass spectrometry investigation of the in vivo disulfide bonding conformation and in vitro reactivity of 30 of the 31 cysteine residues in the TRPA1 ion channel. Four disulfide bonds were detected in the in vivo TRPA1 structure: Cys-666—Cys-622, Cys-666–Cys-463, Cys-622–Cys-609, and Cys-666–Cys-193. All of the cysteines detected were reactive to N-methylmaleimide (NMM) in vitro, with varying degrees of labeling efficiency. Comparison of the ratio of the labeling efficiency at 300 μm versus 2 mm NMM identified a number of cysteine residues that were outliers from the mean labeling ratio, suggesting that protein conformation changes rendered these cysteines either more or less protected from labeling at the higher NMM concentrations.

Covalent modification of the cysteine residues by electrophilic compounds has been proposed as the mode of activation for at least some of the activators, such as allyl isothiocyanate, IA, and NMM, although other modes of action, such as disulfide bond formation, have also been proposed (6.Takahashi N.

To provide a deeper understanding of the TRPA1 channel activation mechanism by these compounds, determination of the structure and dynamics of all cysteine residues is required. In our recently resolved EM structure of the TRPA1 channel, we placed I-TASSER (iterative threading assembly refinement)-generated models of the N terminus of the channel and observed a pocket of cysteines proposed to be important for electrophilic activation (12.Cvetkov T.L. Huynh K.W. Cohen M.R. Moiseenkova-Bell V.Y. Molecular architecture and subunit organization of TRPA1 ion channel revealed by electron microscopy.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38168-38176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The proximity of these cysteines to one another led us to hypothesize that crosstalk or disulfide interactions could be occurring as part of the channel activation mechanism. To follow up on these results, we present here a comprehensive mass spectrometry study revealing the in vivo disulfide bonding status and the in vitro reactivity of each cysteine residue in mouse TRPA1. We detected four disulfide bonds in the TRPA1 structure: Cys-666–Cys-622, Cys-666–Cys-463, Cys-622–Cys-609, and Cys-666–Cys-193. Because Cys-666 and Cys-622 have previously been reported to be involved in electrophilic activation of the channel and have multiple disulfide partners, this disulfide bonding pattern could correspond to a variety of TRPA1 intermediate states in an activating or desensitizing channel. We also present evidence for ligand-induced conformational changes that alter the susceptibility of portions of the channel's N terminus to covalent modification. These results provide a structural and regulatory framework for understanding the activation of the TRPA1 channel in response to electrophilic and oxidizing agonists. Mouse TRPA1 tagged with a 1D4 epitope was overexpressed in a 30-liter culture of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as described previously (12.Cvetkov T.L. Huynh K.W. Cohen M.R. Moiseenkova-Bell V.Y.

The resulting 105 g of cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF, and 1 ml of yeast protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added. NMM (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and one-half the total volume of 0.5-mm glass beads (BioSpec Products) was added. Cells were disrupted by five cycles of 5 min of vortexing alternated with 5 min on ice. After centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min, 15 mm Fos-Choline-12 was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was solubilized by stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. After ultracentrifugation (45 min at 100,000 × g), TRPA1 was purified by 1D4 chromatography as described previously (12.Cvetkov T.L. Huynh K.W. Cohen M.R. Moiseenkova-Bell V.Y.

Following purification, TRPA1 was concentrated, denatured in 8 m urea, and labeled with 100 mm IA (Sigma). Samples were electrophoresed on 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) in the absence of DTT (Sigma) or any reducing agents. 1D4-tagged mouse TRPA1 protein was overexpressed and purified using 1D4 chromatography and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (12.Cvetkov T.L. Huynh K.W. Cohen M.R. Moiseenkova-Bell V.Y. Molecular architecture and subunit organization of TRPA1 ion channel revealed by electron microscopy.J. Biol.

Purified TRPA1 was modified by incubation with 0, 300 μm, or 2 mm NMM at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched with 30 mm DTT, and gel electrophoresis on a 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) was used to separate TRPA1/NMM from detergent and other small molecules. SDS-polyacrylamide gels from the in vivo and in vitro labeling studies were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein gel bands and washed in distilled water to remove excess background stain. Protein bands were excised and destained with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile solution for 2–8 h. Acetonitrile and 100 mm NH4HCO3 were then used alternatively to dehydrate and rehydrate the gel pieces three times. For the in vitro cysteine reactivity test, 10 mm DTT was added to reduce disulfide bonds, and free cysteines were alkylated with 55 mm IA. 50 μl of freshly prepared 20 ng/μl trypsin (Promega sequencing grade modified) or chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science sequencing grade) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the samples and digested at room temperature overnight. For disulfide bond detection, no DTT or IA was added to the gel bands. Following the dehydration/rehydration cycles, 50 μl of freshly prepared 20 ng/μl trypsin (Promega sequencing grade modified), chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science sequencing grade), or a combination of trypsin and Glu-C (Roche Applied Science sequencing grade) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the samples and digested at room temperature overnight. Digested peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, dried, and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid solution for MS analysis. MS experiments were carried out using a Velos LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). Nano-reverse phase liquid chromatography separations were performed on a nanoACQUITY Ultra high pressure LC-MS/MS system (Waters) with a BEH130 C18 column (2.5 cm × 75 μm; Waters) directly connected to a 10-μm nanospray emitter (New Objectives). Chromatography was performed using mobile phases A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (80% acetonitrile and 0.04% formic acid in water) with a linear gradient of 1%/min, starting with 100% of mobile phase A at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. All data were acquired in positive-ion mode. Collision-induced dissociation was used to fragment peptides in Fourier transform (FT)-MS. In these experiments, full MS scans (m/z 300–2000) were followed by eight subsequent MS/MS scans on the top five most abundant peptide ions from full MS scan or inclusion mass lists using a normalized collision energy of 35%. For the cysteine reactivity test, high mass accuracy FT-MS was performed only for detecting precursor ions (resolution, 60,000; mass accuracy, 5 ppm); product ions were detected in ion trap with relative low mass accuracy (1 Da). For disulfide bond detection, high mass accuracy FT-MS was performed for detecting both precursor ions (resolution, 60,000; mass accuracy, 5 ppm) and product ions (resolution, 15,000; mass accuracy, 0.02 Da). MS/MS data were analyzed with MassMatrix software (14.Xu H. Zhang L.

TRPA1 MS/MS data were searched against a protein database containing the TRPA1 sequence and a decoy database of the reversed TRPA1 sequence. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine, NMM labeling of cysteine, sulfonation of cysteine, and oxidation of methionine were selected as variable modifications. For the cysteine reactivity test, one missed cleavage was allowed for trypsin digestion, and five missed cleavages were selected for chymotrypsin digestion. The mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for the precursor ion search and 1 Da for the product ion. The maximum length for matched peptides was 55 amino acids. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were chosen as the enzymes for digestion. For disulfide bond detection, disulfide bond was selected as a crosslink mode for searching the data. Four to five missed cleavages were allowed for searching the disulfide bond data. The mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm for the precursor ion search and 0.02 Da for the product ion. The maximum length for matched peptides was 55 amino acids. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, or trypsin and Glu-C were chosen as the enzymes for digestion. A manual check was performed for identified peptides with modifications or containing disulfide bonds. To identify the ground-state conformation of critical TRPA1 cysteines in vivo, we used an S. cerevisiae expression system proven to produce functional TRP channels for biophysical and structural analysis (13.Moiseenkova V.Y.

To determine the in vivo disulfide bonding pattern of the cysteine residues, functional TRPA1 protein was overexpressed in yeast and treated before cell lysis with excessive amounts of NMM to label surface-accessible reduced cysteines and to prevent oxidation or disulfide bond interchange during processing (14.Xu H. Zhang L. Freitas M.A. Identification and characterization of disulfide bonds in proteins and peptides from tandem MS data by use of the MassMatrix MS/MS search engine.J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following purification, buried cysteines were labeled with IA under denaturing conditions, and the TRPA1 proteins were separated from detergents and other small molecules by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing reagents. TRPA1 migrated on the nonreducing gel in a single band at a molecular weight expected for a monomer, ruling out the possibility of intersubunit disulfide bonds. In-gel proteolytic digestions using trypsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin/Glu-C were performed in parallel, and the digests were separated by nano-LC and analyzed using a high mass accuracy FT-ion cyclotron resonance/ion-trap hybrid mass spectrometer. A total sequence coverage of 95.0% was obtained by combining data from the three digestion methods, allowing us to detect all of the 31 cysteines except Cys-1118. Specifically, the trypsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin/Glu-C digestions yielded 79 peptides (72.5% sequence coverage), 222 peptides (84.2% sequence coverage), and 129 peptides (72.7% sequence coverage), respectively (supplemental Fig. 1A). Peptides with intact disulfide bonds are often difficult to identify by MS/MS for two main reasons. 1) regions inaccessible to proteolytic cleavage or ionization in peptides with intrachain disulfide bonds can create blind spots that prevent detection of a complete set of signature products, and 2) peptides with interchain disulfide bonds can have product ions clustered at both low and high m/z regions, which complicates MS data analysis. To overcome these challenges, we combined cleavage with multiple proteases and high mass accuracy FT-MS to detect both precursor ions (within 5 ppm) and product ions (within 0.02 Da). By improving the mass accuracy of fragment ions, we have dramatically increased the detection sensitivity for true positive identification of disulfide bonds. After manually verifying possible hits from MassMatrix MS database search results, we identified four intrachain disulfide bonds with high confidence (MassMatrix pp score of >30): Cys-666–Cys-622, Cys-666–Cys-463, Cys-666–Cys-193, and Cys-622–Cys-609 (Table 1). MS/MS was used to sequence the peptides forming disulfide bonds, and the high accuracy FT mass spectrum of the precursor ions allows unambiguous assignment (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2, A–C).TABLE 1In vivo disulfide bonds identified in TRPA1DisulfidePeptide sequencem/z (charge state)Mass accuracyppmTrypsin/Glu-C digestsCys-666–Cys-622663YLQCPLSMoxTK672602.2715 (+3)0.61622CPIMoxE626Cys-666–Cys-463663YLQCPLSMoxTK672483.4848 (+4)0.52460INTCQR465Cys-666–Cys-193663YLQCPLSMoxTK672520.5925 (+3)< 0.01192LCK194Cys-622–Cys-609622CPIMoxE626527.7394 (+3)0.47609CLQVFTHNSPSNR621Trypsin digestsCys-666–Cys-193663YLQCPLSMoxTK672520.5917 (+3)1.6192LCK194Cys-666–Cys-463663YLQCPLSMoxTK672483.4851 (+4)0.16460INTCQR465 Open table in a new tab To gain a better understanding of the activation-dependent conformational changes in TRPA1, the reactivity of each cysteine was quantified.

https://openalex.org/W2062030505,"Akt plays a major role in insulin regulation of metabolism in muscle, fat, and liver. Here, we show that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Akt operates optimally over a limited dynamic range. This indicates that Akt is a highly sensitive amplification step in the pathway. With robust insulin stimulation, substantial changes in Akt phosphorylation using either pharmacologic or genetic manipulations had relatively little effect on Akt activity. By integrating these data we observed that half-maximal Akt activity was achieved at a threshold level of Akt phosphorylation corresponding to 5-22% of its full dynamic range. This behavior was also associated with lack of concordance or demultiplexing in the behavior of downstream components. Most notably, FoxO1 phosphorylation was more sensitive to insulin and did not exhibit a change in its rate of phosphorylation between 1 and 100 nm insulin compared with other substrates (AS160, TSC2, GSK3). Similar differences were observed between various insulin-regulated pathways such as GLUT4 translocation and protein synthesis. These data indicate that Akt itself is a major amplification switch in the insulin signaling pathway and that features of the pathway enable the insulin signal to be split or demultiplexed into discrete outputs. This has important implications for the role of this pathway in disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990690264,"Amylosucrases are sucrose-utilizing α-transglucosidases that naturally catalyze the synthesis of α-glucans, linked exclusively through α1,4-linkages. Side products and in particular sucrose isomers such as turanose and trehalulose are also produced by these enzymes. Here, we report the first structural and biophysical characterization of the most thermostable amylosucrase identified so far, the amylosucrase from Deinoccocus geothermalis (DgAS). The three-dimensional structure revealed a homodimeric quaternary organization, never reported before for other amylosucrases. A sequence signature of dimerization was identified from the analysis of the dimer interface and sequence alignments. By rigidifying the DgAS structure, the quaternary organization is likely to participate in the enhanced thermal stability of the protein. Amylosucrase specificity with respect to sucrose isomer formation (turanose or trehalulose) was also investigated. We report the first structures of the amylosucrases from Deinococcus geothermalis and Neisseria polysaccharea in complex with turanose. In the amylosucrase from N. polysaccharea (NpAS), key residues were found to force the fructosyl moiety to bind in an open state with the O3' ideally positioned to explain the preferential formation of turanose by NpAS. Such residues are either not present or not similarly placed in DgAS. As a consequence, DgAS binds the furanoid tautomers of fructose through a weak network of interactions to enable turanose formation. Such topology at subsite +1 is likely favoring other possible fructose binding modes in agreement with the higher amount of trehalulose formed by DgAS. Our findings help to understand the inter-relationships between amylosucrase structure, flexibility, function, and stability and provide new insight for amylosucrase design."
https://openalex.org/W2168299245,"The mechanisms that lead from obesity to atherosclerotic disease are not fully understood. Obesity involves angiogenesis in which vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays a key role. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) plays a pivotal role in lymphangiogenesis. Circulating levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C are elevated in sera from obese subjects. However, relationships of VEGF-C with atherosclerotic risk factors and atherosclerosis are unknown. We determined circulating levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in 423 consecutive subjects not receiving any drugs at the Health Evaluation Center. After adjusting for age and gender, VEGF-A levels were significantly and more strongly correlated with the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference than VEGF-C. Conversely, VEGF-C levels were significantly and more closely correlated with metabolic (e.g., fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, immunoreactive insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and lipid parameters (e.g., triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C)) than VEGF-A. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that independent determinants of VEGF-A were the BMI and age, whereas strong independent determinants of VEGF-C were age, triglycerides, and non-HDL-C. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a high-fat-diet (HFD) or normal chow (NC) for 16 weeks, levels of VEGF-A were not significantly different between the two groups. However, levels of VEGF-C were significantly higher in HFD mice with advanced atherosclerosis and marked hypercholesterolemia than NC mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of VEGF-C in atheromatous plaque of the aortic sinus was significantly intensified by feeding HFD compared to NC, while that of VEGF-A was not. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that VEGF-C, rather than VEGF-A, is closely related to dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2018848368,"All enzymatic activities required for genomic replication and transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses (or Mononegavirales) are believed to be concentrated in the viral polymerase (L) protein. However, our insight into the organization of these different enzymatic activities into a bioactive tertiary structure remains rudimentary. Fragments of Mononegavirales polymerases analyzed to date cannot restore bioactivity through trans-complementation, unlike the related L proteins of segmented NSVs. We investigated the domain organization of phylogenetically diverse Paramyxovirus L proteins derived from measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Through a comprehensive in silico and experimental analysis of domain intersections, we defined MeV L position 615 as an interdomain candidate in addition to the previously reported residue 1708. Only position 1708 of MeV and the homologous positions in NiV and RSV L also tolerated the insertion of epitope tags. Splitting of MeV L at residue 1708 created fragments that were unable to physically interact and trans-complement, but strikingly, these activities were reconstituted by the addition of dimerization tags to the fragments. Equivalently split fragments of NiV, RSV, and MeV L oligomerized with comparable efficiency in all homo- and heterotypic combinations, but only the homotypic pairs were able to trans-complement. These results demonstrate that synthesis as a single polypeptide is not required for the Mononegavirales polymerases to adopt a proper tertiary conformation. Paramyxovirus polymerases are composed of at least two truly independent folding domains that lack a traditional interface but require molecular compatibility for bioactivity. The functional probing of the L domain architecture through trans-complementation is anticipated to be applicable to all Mononegavirales polymerases."

https://openalex.org/W2135225397,"Impairments in executive functioning are frequently observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, executive functioning needed in daily life is difficult to measure. Considering this difficulty the Cognitive Effort Test (CET) was recently developed. In this multi-task test the goals are specified but participants are free in their approach. This study applies the CET in PD patients and investigates whether initiative, planning and multi-tasking are associated with aspects of executive functions and psychomotor speed. Thirty-six PD patients with a mild to moderate disease severity and thirty-four healthy participants were included in this study. PD patients planned and demonstrated more sequential task execution, which was associated with a decreased psychomotor speed. Furthermore, patients with a moderate PD planned to execute fewer tasks at the same time than patients with a mild PD. No differences were found between these groups for multi-tasking. In conclusion, PD patients planned and executed the tasks of the CET sequentially rather than in parallel presumably reflecting a compensation strategy for a decreased psychomotor speed. Furthermore, patients with moderate PD appeared to take their impairments into consideration when planning how to engage the tasks of the test. This compensation could not be detected in patients with mild PD."
https://openalex.org/W2080641533,"Many neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in prevalence and cannot be prevented or cured. If they shared common pathogenic mechanisms, treatments targeting such mechanisms might be of benefit in multiple conditions. The tau protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Tau reduction prevents cognitive deficits, behavioral abnormalities and other pathological changes in multiple AD mouse models. Here we examined whether tau reduction also prevents motor deficits and pathological alterations in two mouse models of PD, generated by unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or transgene-mediated neuronal expression of human wildtype α-synuclein. Both models were evaluated on Tau+/+, Tau+/– and Tau–/– backgrounds in a variety of motor tests. Tau reduction did not prevent motor deficits caused by 6-OHDA and slightly worsened one of them. Tau reduction also did not prevent 6-OHDA-induced loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Similarly, tau reduction did not prevent motor deficits in α-synuclein transgenic mice. Our results suggest that tau has distinct roles in the pathogeneses of AD and PD and that tau reduction may not be of benefit in the latter condition."
https://openalex.org/W2023865340,"The functions of different G-protein αβγ subunit combinations are traditionally ascribed to their various α components. However, the discovery of similarly diverse γ subtypes raises the possibility that they may also contribute to specificity. To test this possibility, we used a gene targeting approach to determine whether the closely related γ(3) and γ(7) subunits can perform functionally interchangeable roles in mice. In contrast to single knock-out mice that show normal survival, Gng3(-/-)Gng7(-/-) double knock-out mice display a progressive seizure disorder that dramatically reduces their median life span to only 75 days. Biochemical analyses reveal that the severe phenotype is not due to redundant roles for the two γ subunits in the same signaling pathway but rather is attributed to their unique actions in different signaling pathways. The results suggest that the γ(3) subunit is a component of a G(i/o) protein that is required for γ-aminobutyric acid, type B, receptor-regulated neuronal excitability, whereas the γ(7) subunit is a component of a G(olf) protein that is responsible for A(2A) adenosine or D(1) dopamine receptor-induced neuro-protective response. The development of this mouse model offers a novel experimental framework for exploring how signaling pathways integrate to produce normal brain function and how their combined dysfunction leads to spontaneous seizures and premature death. The results underscore the critical role of the γ subunit in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2054905900,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant component of lipid bilayers and exists in various molecular forms, through combinations of two acylated fatty acids. Arachidonic acid (AA)-containing PC (AA-PC) can be a source of AA, which is a crucial mediator of synaptic transmission and intracellular signaling. However, the distribution of AA-PC within neurons has not been indicated. In the present study, we used imaging mass spectrometry to characterize the distribution of PC species in cultured neurons of superior cervical ganglia. Intriguingly, PC species exhibited a unique distribution that was dependent on the acyl chains at the sn-2 position. In particular, we found that AA-PC is enriched within the axon and is distributed across a proximal-to-distal gradient.

Mice harboring a glycine to cysteine substitution in the collagenous domain were phenotypically normal when heterozygote and displayed a mild disruption of growth plate architecture in the homozygous state. Mice expressing an 87 amino acid deletion in the collagenous domain of collagen XXVII were phenotypically normal as heterozygotes whereas homozygotes exhibited a severe chondrodysplasia and died perinatally from a lung defect. Animals expressing the 87 amino acid deletion targeted specifically to cartilage were viable but severely dwarfed. The pericellular matrix of proliferative chondrocytes was disrupted and the proliferative cells exhibited a decreased tendency to flatten and form vertical columns. Collagen XXVII plays an important structural role in the pericellular extracellular matrix of the growth plate and is required for the organisation of the proliferative zone."
https://openalex.org/W1994676170,"Pupylation is a bacterial post-translational modification of target proteins on lysine residues with prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup. Pup-tagged substrates are recognized by a proteasome-interacting ATPase termed Mpa in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mpa unfolds pupylated substrates and threads them into the proteasome core particle for degradation. Interestingly, Mpa itself is also a pupylation target. Here, we show that the Pup ligase PafA predominantly produces monopupylated Mpa modified homogeneously on a single lysine residue within its C-terminal region. We demonstrate that this modification renders Mpa functionally inactive. Pupylated Mpa can no longer support Pup-mediated proteasomal degradation due to its inability to associate with the proteasome core. Mpa is further inactivated by rapid Pup- and ATPase-driven deoligomerization of the hexameric Mpa ring. We show that pupylation of Mpa is chemically and functionally reversible. Mpa regains its enzymatic activity upon depupylation by the depupylase Dop, affording a rapid and reversible activity control over Mpa function.

https://openalex.org/W2079894711,"Background Valproic acid (VPA) is a potent anticonvulsant that inhibits histone deacetylases. Because of this inhibitory action, we investigated whether VPA would affect chromatin supraorganization, mitotic indices and the frequency of chromosome abnormalities and cell death in HeLa cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Image analysis was performed by scanning microspectrophotometry for cells cultivated for 24 h, treated with 0.05, 0.5 or 1.0 mM VPA for 1–24 h, and subjected to the Feulgen reaction. TSA-treated cells were used as a predictable positive control. DNA fragmentation was investigated with the TUNEL assay. Chromatin decondensation was demonstrated under TSA and all VPA treatments, but no changes in chromosome abnormalities, mitotic indices or morphologically identified cell death were found with the VPA treatment conditions mentioned above, although decreased mitotic indices were detected under higher VPA concentration and longer exposure time. The frequency of DNA fragmentation identified with the TUNEL assay in HeLa cells increased after a 24-h VPA treatment, although this fragmentation occurred much earlier after treatment with TSA. Conclusions/Significance The inhibition of histone deacetylases by VPA induces chromatin remodeling in HeLa cells, which suggests an association to altered gene expression. Under VPA doses close to the therapeutic antiepileptic plasma range no changes in cell proliferation or chromosome abnormalities are elicited. The DNA fragmentation results indicate that a longer exposure to VPA or a higher VPA concentration is required for the induction of cell death."

To identify genes involved in muscle regeneration, we used a microarray analysis; there was a significant increase in the expression of a group of integrin genes. To verify these results, we used RT-PCR and Western blotting and found that 12 integrins were up-regulated from 3 h to 15 days following injury. Following muscle injury, integrin-β3 was initially expressed, mainly in macrophages. In integrin-β3 global KO mice, the expression of myogenic genes was decreased and muscle regeneration was impaired, whereas fibrosis was enhanced versus events in wild type (WT) mice. The mechanism for these responses in integrin-β3 KO mice included an infiltration of macrophages that were polarized into the M2 phenotype. These macrophages produced more TGF-β1 and increased TGF-β1/Smad signaling. In vitro, we confirmed that M2 macrophages lacking integrin-β3 produced more TGF-β1. Furthermore, transplantation of bone marrow cells from integrin-β3 KO mice into WT mice led to suppression of the infiltration and accumulation of macrophages into injured muscles. There was also impaired muscle regeneration with an increase in muscle fibrosis. Our results demonstrate that integrin-β3 plays a fundamental role in muscle regeneration through a regulation of macrophage infiltration and polarization leading to suppressed TGF-β1 production. This promotes efficient muscle regeneration. Thus, an improvement in integrin-β3 function could stimulate muscle regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2149368969,"Proton pumping of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase into the lumen of the central plant organelle generates a proton gradient of often 1-2 pH units or more. Although structural aspects of the V-type ATPase have been studied in great detail, the question of whether and how the proton pump action is controlled by the proton concentration on both sides of the membrane is not understood. Applying the patch clamp technique to isolated vacuoles from Arabidopsis mesophyll cells in the whole-vacuole mode, we studied the response of the V-ATPase to protons, voltage, and ATP. Current-voltage relationships at different luminal pH values indicated decreasing coupling ratios with acidification. A detailed study of ATP-dependent H(+)-pump currents at a variety of different pH conditions showed a complex regulation of V-ATPase activity by both cytosolic and vacuolar pH. At cytosolic pH 7.5, vacuolar pH changes had relative little effects. Yet, at cytosolic pH 5.5, a 100-fold increase in vacuolar proton concentration resulted in a 70-fold increase of the affinity for ATP binding on the cytosolic side. Changes in pH on either side of the membrane seem to be transferred by the V-ATPase to the other side. A mathematical model was developed that indicates a feedback of proton concentration on peak H(+) current amplitude (v(max)) and ATP consumption (K(m)) of the V-ATPase. It proposes that for efficient V-ATPase function dissociation of transported protons from the pump protein might become higher with increasing pH. This feature results in an optimization of H(+) pumping by the V-ATPase according to existing H(+) concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2050402718,"Odors are rarely composed of a single compound, but rather contain a large and complex variety of chemical components. Often, these mixtures are perceived as having unique qualities that can be quite different than the combination of their components. In many cases, a majority of the components of a mixture cannot be individually identified. This synthetic processing of odor information suggests that individual component representations of the mixture must interact somewhere along the olfactory pathway. The anatomical nature of sensory neuron input into segregated glomeruli with the bulb suggests that initial input of odor information into the bulb is analytic. However, a large network of interneurons within the olfactory bulb could allow for mixture interactions via mechanisms such as lateral inhibition. Currently in mammals, it is unclear if postsynaptic mitral/tufted cell glomerular mixture responses reflect the analytical mixture input, or provide the initial basis for synthetic processing with the olfactory system. To address this, olfactory bulb glomerular binary mixture representations were compared to representations of each component using transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator G-CaMP2 in olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells. Overall, dorsal surface mixture representations showed little mixture interaction and often appeared as a simple combination of the component representations. Based on this, it is concluded that dorsal surface glomerular mixture representations remain largely analytical with nearly all component information preserved."

Adaptive responses to ER stress are implicated in cancer and diabetes; thus, understanding mechanisms of arsenic-induced ER stress may offer insights into pathogenesis. Here, we identify genes required for arsenite-induced ER stress response in a genome-wide RNAi screen. Using an shRNA library targeting ∼20,000 human genes, together with an ER stress cell model, we performed flow cytometry-based cell sorting to isolate cells with defective response to arsenite. Our screen discovered several genes modulating arsenite-induced ER stress, including sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, SNAT2. SNAT2 expression and activity are up-regulated by arsenite, in a manner dependent on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an important mediator of the integrated stress response. Inhibition of SNAT2 expression or activity or deprivation of its primary substrate, glutamine, specifically suppressed ER stress induced by arsenite but not tunicamycin. Induction of SNAT2 is coincident with the activation of the nutrient-sensing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is at least partially required for arsenite-induced ER stress. Importantly, inhibition of the SNAT2 or the System L transporter, LAT1, suppressed mTOR activation by arsenite, supporting a role for these transporters in modulating amino acid signaling. These findings reveal SNAT2 as an important and specific mediator of arsenic-induced ER stress, and suggest a role for aberrant mTOR activation in arsenic-related human diseases.

Phosphorylation of KATP channels by protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC) results in the modulation of channel activity and is particularly important in regulating smooth muscle tone. At the molecular level the smooth muscle channel is composed of a sulfonylurea subunit (SUR2B) and a pore-forming subunit Kir6.1 and/or Kir6.2.

To date Thr-180 is the only specific PKC site to be identified on the Kir6.2 subunit, and the mechanism behind its phosphorylation by PKC has not been investigated. In this study, we identify a new site for PKC-mediated phosphorylation leading to channel inhibition and additionally show Ca2+ dependence of PKC phosphorylation at this site. Single-point mutations were introduced into the mouse Kir6.2 clone and the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Kir6.2C vector by PCR using the Stratagene XL Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B were maintained in G418 and Zeocin selective media as described previously (9.Cui Y. Giblin J.P.

Transfection of Kir6.2ΔC26 or the mutant Kir6.2 constructs with SUR2B was carried out using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's instructions. GFP (100 ng) was co-transfected to enable transfection success and efficiency to be assessed, and cells were patched 48 h after transfection. Expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant MBP-Kir6.2C were carried out as described previously (22.Quinn K.V. Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A.

In vitro phosphorylation assays using the wild-type and mutant MBP-Kir6.2C were carried out using the method described previously (22.Quinn K.V. Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A.

Briefly, 1 mg of protein was bound to 100 μl of amylose resin (New England Biolabs). After subsequent washes with a HEPES wash buffer the amylose-bound protein was incubated in a mix containing [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi) in the presence or absence of the catalytic subunit of PKC (20 ng to give a final concentration of 8 nm; Calbiochem) for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was washed a further five times to remove excess radioactivity before subjecting it to SDS-PAGE (10%) and autoradiography. Determination of the band intensity was carried out using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and statistical analysis using an unpaired Student's t test was carried out using Prism v4 (GraphPad). The MBP-Kir6.2C protein was phosphorylated as above with the following alterations. [γ-32P]ATP was omitted from the assay, and the following wash buffer was used (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100). After incubation with PKC and further washing the sample was resuspended in 2 × SDS loading buffer before denaturation for 4 min at 85 °C. Samples were loaded onto a 10% Novex gel (Invitrogen) and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. The relevant bands were excised and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping at the Fingerprints Proteomics Facility, University of Dundee. The In Cell Western assay was carried out as described by Meimaridou et al. (33.Meimaridou E. Gooljar S.B. Ramnarace N. Anthonypillai L. Clark A.J. Chapple J.P.

In brief, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells were seeded into 24-well dishes and transfected with Kir6.2-HA/SUR2B using Turbofect (Fermentas). After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DMSO, 1 μm PdBu, or 1 μm 4α-phorbol for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min before half of the wells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The other wells were left unpermeabilized to measure the amount of protein expressed at the cell surface. Cells were blocked with PBS + 5% nonfat milk solution for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation (4 °C) with anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution; Sigma) in blocking solution. Cells were washed with PBS before incubation with IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS the fluorescent signal was measured using a LI-COR Odyssey plate reader. Data are presented as cell surface protein over total protein, normalized to DMSO (control). Surface expression of Kir6.2 in the presence and absence of PdBu was investigated using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). In brief, CHO-K1 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and transfected with Kir6.2-HA or Kir6.2-HA-S372A/SUR2B, and enhanced GFP for analysis of transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm PdBu or DMSO for 30 min at 37 °C. Following this, cells were incubated with PBS containing EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were again washed with PBS and the reaction quenched with Pierce Quenching Solution as supplied. Cells were harvested and resuspended in TDET-S buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop; Roche Applied Science). The resuspended cells were sonicated (5 × 1 s) and left for 30 min on ice with periodic vortexing every 5 min. The lysate was obtained by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and this was then incubated with avidin overnight at 4 °C to allow the biotinylated protein to bind. Following several washes with TDET-S buffer, labeled protein was eluted into 2 × SDS loading buffer + DTT at 95 °C for 5 min. Western blotting was used to detect labeled protein using a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or a rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare). An 86Rb+ assay was used to determine the amount of flux passing through KATP channels in response to various drugs as described previously (34.Farzaneh T. Tinker A.

HEK293 cells stably expressing either Kir6.1/SUR2B or Kir6.2/SUR2B were used. The cells (in 6-well dishes) were incubated for 24 h with 86RbCl (0.037 MBq/ml) before being washed three times with HBS assay medium (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). Cells were then preincubated with 2 ml of HBS ± PKC inhibitors, 1 μm staurosporine or 3 μm GF109203X, or the calcium chelator, 20 nm BAPTA-AM for 15 min at 25 °C. PdBu or 4α-phorbol was then added to each well to give a final concentration of 1 μm (concentration commonly used to activate PKC), and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before channel activators/inhibitors were added as follows (DMSO, 10 μm pinacidil, 10 μm pinacidil + 10 μm glibenclamide). After 15 min further incubation at 25 °C, the supernatant was aspirated into vials, and the cells were lysed using HBS + 2% Triton X-100 solution and collected. All vials were assayed for 86Rb content by measurement of Cherenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation counter (TriCarb, Packard 2000CA). Efflux was expressed as a percentage relative to the total amount of radioactivity incorporated. One-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni test was used to determine statistical significance as indicated in the text. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described previously (22.Quinn K.V. Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Do anionic phospholipids serve as cofactors or second messengers for the regulation of activity of cloned ATP-sensitive K+ channels?.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Capacitance transients and series resistance in whole cell recordings were compensated electronically by using amplifier circuitry (Axopatch 200B). Data were filtered at 1 kHz using the filter provided with the Axopatch 200B (four-pole Bessel) and sampled at 5 kHz using a Digidata 1440 (Axon Instruments). Currents were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 10 (Axon Instruments). The intracellular (pipette) solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgATP, and 0.5 mm NaUDP, pH 7.2, using KOH. The free Ca2+ concentration was estimated using Webmaxc standard software. An additional 5.57 mm CaCl2 was added to the standard pipette solution to give a higher free intracellular Ca2+ concentration of ∼300 nm. The bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For inside-out recordings the bath and pipette solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Pipette resistances were between 2 and 4 megohms for whole cell recordings and 5 and 8 megohms for single-channel recordings. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Agents were applied to the bath using a gravity-driven perfusion system. To analyze the rate of current inhibition, time course data were fitted using the following equation (in Origin 6),Inhibition=A1−A21+e(x−x0)/k+A2(Eq. 1) where x is the time at any given point, x0 is the time at no inhibition, and k is the time constant. A1 is the initial Y value, and A2 is the final Y value. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test or a paired Student's t test as appropriate. Statistical significance is indicated in the figure legends. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Where appropriate, current density is presented normalized to the control. It is well established that PKC regulates the activity of Kir6.1/SUR2B currents. However, the same is not true for the KATP channel composed of Kir6.2/SUR2B. To investigate this further, a 86Rb+ (as a K+ surrogate) flux assay was used to measure flux in response to a PKC activator, PdBu, and various PKC inhibitors (staurosporine and the more selective GF109203X). HEK293 cells stably expressing either Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 and SUR2B were used. 10 μm pinacidil failed to activate flux in the presence of 1 μm PdBu (DMSO, 15.75 ± 1.04%; pinacidil, 34.21 ± 1.08%; PdBu + pinacidil, 15.52 ± 0.87%; PdBu + pinacidil + glibenclamide, 17.86 ± 0.85%, n = 9, p < 0.01 compared with pinacidil) in the Kir6.1/SURB cell line (second panel, Fig. 1A). Interestingly, this was also the case with the Kir6.2/SUR2B line (DMSO, 37.84 ± 4.11%; pinacidil, 71.44 ± 2.15%; PdBu + pinacidil, 47.19 ± 2.63%; PdBu + pinacidil + glibenclamide, 23.77 ± 5.51%, n = 9, p < 0.01 compared with pinacidil) (Fig. 1B). The inactive phorbol ester 4α-phorbol was used to rule out nonspecific phorbol effects. Activation of flux by pinacidil through both Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B was unaffected by 1 μm 4α-phorbol. To ascertain whether the PdBu-induced inhibition of pinacidil-activated flux is due to PKC, we used PKC inhibitors in the presence of PdBu. Pinacidil-induced flux through both Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B was restored to pre-PdBu levels in the presence of the PKC inhibitors, 1 μm staurosporine and 3 μm GF109203X, suggesting that inhibition of flux through both channels was due to activation of PKC (Fig. 1). Additionally, we tested whether there was a Ca2+ dependence of the PKC effect on the flux through either channel. To this end, the cells were preincubated in 20 nm BAPTA-AM, a Ca2+ chelator. In the case of Kir6.1/SUR2B, the presence of BAPTA-AM had no effect on the inhibition of flux by PdBu (BAPTA-AM + PdBu, 17.81 ± 0.63%; BAPTA-AM + PdBu + pinacidil, 19.03 ± 0.44%, n = 9, p > 0.05, Fig. 1A). However, in cells expressing Kir6.2/SUR2B, BAPTA-AM prevented the inhibition previously seen in the presence of PdBu (BAPTA-AM + PdBu, 38.51 ± 6.14%; BAPTA-AM + PdBu + pinacidil, 78.17 ± 2.76%, n = 9, p > 0.01, Fig. 1B), suggesting that in the case of Kir6.2/SUR2B the PKC effect is Ca2+-dependent. In our previous studies we failed to see the inhibition of the Kir6.2/SUR2B channel current upon PKC activation using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp (22.Quinn K.V. Cui Y. Giblin J.P.

This study was designed to use fluorescence anisotropy techniques to acquire steady-state and kinetic information on the dynamic state of the C-domain of cTnI in the reconstituted thin filament. A series of single cysteine cTnI mutants was generated, labeled with the fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine, and subjected to various anisotropy experiments at the thin filament level.

Our results support the fly casting mechanism, implying that an unstructured MD with rapid dynamics and kinetics plays a critical role to initiate relaxation upon Ca2+ dissociation by rapidly interacting with actin to promote the dissociation of the RR from the N-domain of cTnC.

https://openalex.org/W2093278002,"Dendritic cells (DC) are endowed with the ability to cross-present antigens from other cell types to cognate T cells. DC are poised to meet polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as a result of being co-attracted by interleukin-8 (IL-8), for instance as produced by tumor cells or infected tissue. Human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived DC can readily internalize viable or UV-irradiated PMNs. Such internalization was abrogated at 4°C and partly inhibited by anti-CD18 mAb. In mice, DC which had internalized PMNs containing electroporated ovalbumin (OVA) protein, were able to cross-present the antigen to CD8 (OT-1) and CD4 (OT-2) TCR-transgenic T cells. Moreover, in humans, tumor cell debris is internalized by PMNs and the tumor-cell material can be subsequently taken up from the immunomagnetically re-isolated PMNs by DC. Importantly, if human neutrophils had endocytosed bacteria, they were able to trigger the maturation program of the DC. Moreover, when mouse PMNs with E. coli in their interior are co-injected in the foot pad with DC, many DC loaded with fluorescent material from the PMNs reach draining lymph nodes. Using CT26 (H-2d) mouse tumor cells, it was observed that if tumor cells are intracellularly loaded with OVA protein and UV-irradiated, they become phagocytic prey of H-2d PMNs. If such PMNs, that cannot present antigens to OT-1 T cells, are immunomagnetically re-isolated and phagocytosed by H-2b DC, such DC productively cross-present OVA antigen determinants to OT-1 T cells. Cross-presentation to adoptively transferred OT-1 lymphocytes at draining lymph nodes also take place when OVA-loaded PMNs (H-2d) are coinjected in the footpad of mice with autologous DC (H-2b). In summary, our results indicate that antigens phagocytosed by short-lived PMNs can be in turn internalized and productively cross-presented by DC."
https://openalex.org/W1980607063,"B cell acquisition and presentation of specific autoantigens (auto-Ags) are thought to play an important and complex role in autoimmunity development. We previously identified scavenger receptor A (SR-A) as an early target in altering B cell-mediated autoimmunity. SR-A is highly expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages (MΦs) and dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we demonstrate that SR-A is responsible for controlling B cell interactions with DCs/MΦs to promote Ag transfer from B cells to DCs/MΦs. We established a high-throughput ELISA-based screen to identify novel SR-A inhibitors, the specificity of which was determined by dose dependence and Biacore surface plasmon resonance testing. We identified small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) able to reduce SR-A-mediated Ag transfer in human cells. In particular, the SMIs prevented SR-A-positive cells from accumulating/loading Ag over time. Furthermore, we determined that one SMI, sennoside B, can reduce SR-A-mediated capture of B cells. Finally, SMI-mediated decreases in Ag transfer or accumulation reduced T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These observations demonstrate that B cell-DC/MΦ interactions are conducive to promoting Ag trafficking between these cell types via SR-A. Inhibitors of SR-A may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in ameliorating autoimmune disease development."

For example, Lst8 is important for the kinase activity of TORCs, whereas the TORC2-specific proteins Avo1 and Avo3 maintain the complex integrity (19.Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Oppliger W. Hall M.N.

However, the roles of specific TORC components in regulating the downstream signaling remain largely unknown. target of rapamycin target of rapamycin complex maltose-binding protein amino acids. The distinctive functions of TORCs may be attributed to the fact that each complex has its own specific substrates and downstream signaling effectors. Well characterized mammalian TORC1 substrates include eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase (S6K); S6K is a member of the AGC (cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, and PKC) protein kinase family (21.Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Sch9, a S6K homolog in yeast, is also directly phosphorylated and activated by TORC1 (22.Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H.

Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To date, most of the known TORC2 substrates are AGC kinases, including the mammalian Akt, SGK, PKC, and their counterparts in other organisms (23.Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M.

Although the substrate specificity of TORCs is presumably determined by the subunit composition of each complex, the underlying molecular interactions await further elucidation. In S. cerevisiae, one of the identified TORC2 substrates is Ypk2 (yeast protein kinase 2), an AGC kinase highly homologous to mammalian SGK and Akt (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell.

Functional counterparts of mammalian protein kinases PDK1 and SGK in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TORC2 phosphorylates Ypk2 at Ser641 in the turn motif and Thr659 in the hydrophobic motif; both sites are located in a region C-terminal to the kinase domain of Ypk2 (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is believed that the TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail relieves Ypk2 from the autoinhibition by its own N-terminal regulatory region, allowing phosphorylation of the activation loop by PDK1-like kinases Pkh1 and Pkh2 and the full activation of Ypk2 (29.Roelants F.M. Torrance P.D. Bezman N. Thorner J. Pkh1 and Pkh2 differentially phosphorylate and activate Ypk1 and Ykr2 and define protein kinase modules required for maintenance of cell wall integrity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3005-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Other TORC2 substrates found in yeast are Slm1 and Slm2; these two very similar proteins can bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and are known to be involved in the regulation of actin organization (30.Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. The pleckstrin homology domain proteins Slm1 and Slm2 are required for actin cytoskeleton organization in yeast and bind phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and TORC2.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, Ypk2 appears to mediate most of the TORC2 functions, including the regulation of actin rearrangement and ceramide biosynthesis (17.Aronova S. Wedaman K. Aronov P.A. Fontes K. Ramos K. Hammock B.D. Powers T. Regulation of ceramide biosynthesis by TOR complex 2.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 148-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y.

Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The evidence for Ypk2 being the major TORC2 downstream effector is the observation that constitutively active Ypk2 mutants suppress phenotypes of tor2 mutants (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, to further understand the functions of individual TORC2 components in mediating downstream signaling, we investigated the molecular interactions involved in the TORC2-mediated Ypk2 regulation. We found Avo3 essential for the TORC2-Ypk2 interaction in yeast cells, likely because it serves to maintain the integrity of TORC2 (20.Ho H.L. Lee H.Y. Liao H.C. Chen M.Y. Involvement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Avo3p/Tsc11p in maintaining TOR complex 2 integrity and coupling to downstream signaling.Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1328-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We identified Avo1 as a direct binding partner of Ypk2. The interaction regions were mapped to an internal region (aa 600–840) of Avo1 and the N-terminal 99 aa, as well as a C-terminal region (aa 467–677) of Ypk2. In the wild-type background, overexpression of Ypk2334–677, a truncated mutant able to interfere with the interaction between wild-type Ypk2 and Avo1, resulted in phenotypes reminiscent of TORC2 mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that the direct interaction between Avo1 and Ypk2 mediates the coupling of TORC2 to the downstream Ypk2 signaling pathway. Yeast cells were cultured at 27 °C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic complete medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and appropriate amino acids drop-out mix) for plasmid maintenance. For galactose induction, overnight yeast cultures in a medium containing 2% raffinose were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium and further grown for 4 h before the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 3%; the cells were harvested after 3 h of induction. Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. A chromosome allele expressing Ypk2-Myc was engineered by PCR-based gene tagging (31.Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). Primers Ypk2-TAG-F2 (5′-ACAGTTGGGTGATTCTCCTTCGCAGGGGAGAAGCATTAGTCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and Ypk2-TAG-R1 (5′-AAATTCCGTCCGGCTCGGCTCGGCTTGCTTCGGCTTGCTTGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′) were used to amplify a cassette containing multiple copies of the Myc epitope and the HIS3 selection marker from pFA6a-13Myc-His3MX5 (31.Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). For expressing a constitutively active form of Ypk2, primers Ypk2-S1 (5′-AAAGAGCTCGGAACGATGGAGCAACCAGTG-3′) and Ypk2-A1 (5′-AAAGAGCTCGGTATAAGCGTCCGTCCTTC-3′) were used to amplify the cDNA fragment encoding for aa 224–677 of Ypk2, and the PCR product was subcloned into pRS424 (32.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. A system of shuttle vectors and yeast host strains designed for efficient manipulation of DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express GST-tagged full-length and fragments of Ypk2 in yeast cells, plasmids pHC2–9 were constructed by inserting various YPK2 fragments into pGAL1-GST-URA3. For expressing a kinase-dead version of the Ypk2224–677 fragment, primers Ypk2-K373A-S1 (5′-GATTTACGCGTTGGCGGCTCTGAGAAAAG-3′) and Ypk2-K373A-A1 (5′-CTTTTCTCAGAGCCGCCAACGCGTAAATC-3′) were used in the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis on pHC7. To express GST-Ypk2 and MBP-Ypk2 fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, pHC2 was digested with BamHI, and the YPK2 fragment was subcloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs), respectively. For in vitro binding assays, variant forms of AVO1 were amplified from yeast genomic DNA and subcloned into yTA (Yeastern). Similarly, full-length LST8 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and AVO3 was subcloned into pSG5 (Stratagene). For yeast two-hybrid assays, different YPK2 fragments were obtained from plasmids pHC2–9 by BamHI digestion and subcloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech), whereas a PCR fragment encoding aa 600–840 of Avo1 was subcloned into pACT2 (Clontech). About 107 (0.5 A600) cells from 27 °C overnight cultures were used to make 10-fold serial dilutions over a 10000-fold range. Aliquots (5-μl) of each dilution were spotted onto appropriate plates and incubated at the indicated temperatures until colonies formed. This assay for cell wall integrity was done as described (18.Ho H.L. Shiau Y.S. Chen M.Y. Saccharomyces cerevisiae TSC11/AVO3 participates in regulating cell integrity and functionally interacts with components of the Tor2 complex.Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.15 and incubated at 27 °C for 3 h. Each culture was then divided into two aliquots; one was shifted to 37 °C, whereas the other was kept at 27 °C and further incubated for 6 h. The cells were harvested, washed in distilled water, and stained with 0.05% trypan blue for 1 h. At least 200 cells from each sample were examined under the microscope. Overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.15, grown at 27 °C for 3 h, and subsequently shifted to 37 °C for 3 h. Harvested cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. Fixed cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS; Rhodamine-Phalloidin (Sigma) and Triton X-100 were added to the suspensions to 0.66 μm and 0.02%, respectively, and cells were stained at room temperature for 1.5 h. Harvested cells were washed four times in PBS and resuspended in the mounting solution. Actin organization and cell morphology were examined using fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy. At least 200 cells from each sample were examined. At least three independent experiments were done. To examine the interaction of TORC2 components with Ypk2 in yeast cells, GST- and GST-Ypk2-expressing plasmids were transformed into yeast strains carrying different HA- or Myc-epitope-tagged TORC2 components, respectively. Cultures of transformants were subjected to galactose induction for 4 h. Harvested cells were lysed by vortexing together with glass beads in a lysis buffer containing 1× PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm ρ-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Millipore). Crude extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Twenty microliters of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) were added into each 10-mg lysate sample and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected, washed five times in the wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer. The pulled-down proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using anti-HA (Covance) or anti-Myc (LTK) antibodies. GST and GST-Ypk2 proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Different TORC2 components were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT T7 quick system (Promega). Equal amounts of individual 35S-labeled TORC2 component translated in vitro were incubated with bead-bound GST or GST-Ypk2 for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, bead-bound proteins were washed five times in the washing buffer, resuspended in 1× sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amounts of each 35S-labeled protein in GST and GST-YPK2 pulldown samples were compared. To test the Ypk2334–667 fragment for competition with the full-length Ypk2 in Avo1 binding, MBP and MBP-Ypk2 were expressed in E. coli and pulled down using amylose resin. 35S-Labeled Avo1 was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation as above-mentioned. GST and GST-Ypk2334–667 expressed in E. coli were purified following the GST pulldown and glutathione elution procedures. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled Avo1 were mixed with amylose resin-bound MBP and MBP-Ypk2 for in vitro binding at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of recombinant GST or GST-Ypk2334–667 as the competitor. Resin-bound proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed five times in the binding buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amounts of 35S-labeled Avo1 pulled down with MBP-Ypk2 in the presence of different doses of competitor were compared. Cultures of Ypk2-Myc-expressing yeast strains were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and shifted to 37 °C for 3 h. The lysates were prepared as in the GST pulldown assay and subjected to Western analysis with anti-Myc antibodies. For alkaline phosphatase treatment, samples of lysates containing 3 mg of proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-Myc antibodies and protein G-agarose beads (Millipore) at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, the beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer. Each sample was mixed with FastAPTM thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (Upstates) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by resuspending the beads in the sample buffer. The samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. We have previously obtained two temperature-sensitive mutants of the TORC2-specific component Avo3; the growth of these avo3ts mutants is sensitive to high temperatures, and they display defects in cell wall integrity and actin organization if grown at their nonpermissive temperatures such as 37 °C (18.Ho H.L. Shiau Y.S. Chen M.Y. Saccharomyces cerevisiae TSC11/AVO3 participates in regulating cell integrity and functionally interacts with components of the Tor2 complex.Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been shown that phenotypes of tor2ts mutants can be suppressed by expressing a constitutively active allele of YPK2 (YPK2ΔN), which encodes a truncated form of Ypk2 missing the N-terminal 224 aa (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of expressing the same Ypk2 variant on the temperature-sensitive growth of our avo3ts mutants. The results demonstrated that overexpressing YPK2ΔN could rescue the growth of both avo3ts mutants at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). The Saccharomyces genome encodes a Ypk2-related Ser/Thr protein kinase, Ypk1 (33.Chen P. Lee K.S. Levin D.E. A pair of putative protein kinase genes (YPK1 and YPK2) is required for cell growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, overexpressing the YPK1ΔN allele, which can also suppress the tor2ts phenotypes (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), did not have the same effect as YPK2ΔN in our strain background (data not shown). Because studies have implicated Ypk2 in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and actin organization (27.Kamada Y. Fujioka Y. Suzuki N.N. Inagaki F. Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Ohsumi Y. Tor2 directly phosphorylates the AGC kinase Ypk2 to regulate actin polarization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 29.Roelants F.M. Torrance P.D. Bezman N. Thorner J. Pkh1 and Pkh2 differentially phosphorylate and activate Ypk1 and Ykr2 and define protein kinase modules required for maintenance of cell wall integrity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3005-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of active Ypk2 on the cell wall and actin phenotypes of avo3ts mutants. Many mutants, including the avo3ts mutants, which are defective in the cell wall integrity, display caffeine sensitivity (18.Ho H.L. Shiau Y.S. Chen M.Y. Saccharomyces cerevisiae TSC11/AVO3 participates in regulating cell integrity and functionally interacts with components of the Tor2 complex.Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34.Levin D.E. Cell wall integrity signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). When we tested the cell growth in caffeine-containing media, the results showed that Ypk2ΔN overexpression markedly improved the growth of avo3ts mutants in the presence of 8 mm caffeine (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the caffeine sensitivity experiment, another cell wall assay, i.e. the trypan blue assay, also demonstrated that the cell wall defect of both avo3ts mutants at 37 °C could be suppressed when Ypk2ΔN was overexpressed (Fig. 1C). We also evaluated the effect of Ypk2ΔN on the actin phenotype of avo3ts mutants by staining cellular F-actin with TRITC-phalloidin and observing the cells using fluorescence microscopy. Overexpression of Ypk2ΔN caused a decrease in the percentages of cells with abnormal actin distribution in avo3ts mutants at 37 °C (Fig. 1D). Together, our data demonstrated that the constitutively active form of Ypk2 could rescue multiple phenotypes resulting from defective TORC2 functions in the avo3ts mutants, confirming Ypk2 as the major TORC2 effector.

https://openalex.org/W1994073020,"The Salmonella outer membrane protein Rck mediates a Zipper-like entry mechanism controlled by Rac, the Arp2/3 complex, and actin polymerization. However, little is known about the early steps leading to Rac activation and Rck-mediated internalization. The use of pharmacological inhibitors or PI 3-kinase dominant-negative mutant induced more than 80% less invasion without affecting attachment. Moreover, Rck-mediated internalization caused an increase in the association of p85 with at least one tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, indicating that class I PI 3-kinase activity was stimulated. We also report that this PI 3-kinase activity is essential for Rac1 activation. However, Rac recruitment at the Rck-mediated entry site was independent of its activation. Using a pharmacological approach or Akt-knockout cells, we also demonstrated that Akt was phosphorylated in response to Rck-mediated internalization as demonstrated by immunoblotting analysis and that all three Akt isoforms were required during this process. Overall, our results describe a signaling pathway involving tyrosine phosphorylation, class I PI 3-kinase, Akt activation, and Rac activation, leading to Rck-dependent Zipper entry. The specificity of this signaling pathway with regard to that of the type 3 secretion system, which is the other invasion process of Salmonella, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2093173517,"Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in the brain and play several roles in development and normal neuronal function. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cell TRPC3 channels underlie the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential observed after parallel fiber stimulation. In these cells TRPC3 channel opening requires stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1, activation of which can also lead to the induction of long term depression (LTD), which underlies cerebellar motor learning. LTD induction requires protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase G (PKG) activation, and although PKC phosphorylation targets are well established, virtually nothing is known about PKG targets in LTD. Because TRPC3 channels are inhibited after phosphorylation by PKC and PKG in expression systems, we examined whether native TRPC3 channels in Purkinje cells are a target for PKG or PKC, thereby contributing to cerebellar LTD. We find that in Purkinje cells, activation of TRPC3-dependent currents is not inhibited by conventional PKC or PKG to any significant extent and that inhibition of these kinases does not significantly impact on TRPC3-mediated currents either. Based on these and previous findings, we propose that TRPC3-dependent currents may differ significantly in their regulation from those overexpressed in expression systems."
https://openalex.org/W2084375447,"The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R), a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure through its actions on renal hemodynamics and epithelial ion transport, which are highly linked to its intracellular trafficking. In this study, we generated a series of C-terminal mutants of D1R that were tagged with or without enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, and analyzed the consequences of these mutants on the plasma membrane trafficking of D1R and cyclic AMP response to D1R stimulation. D1R with mutations within the endocytic recycling signal (amino acid residues 360–382) continued to be functional, albeit decreased relative to wild-type D1R. Mutation of the palmitoylation site (347C>S) of D1R did not impair its trafficking to the plasma membrane, but abolished its ability to increase cyclic AMP accumulation. In contrast, replacement of di-leucines (344–345L>A) by alanines resulted in the retention of D1R in the early endosome, decreased its glycosylation, and prevented its targeting to the plasma membrane. Our studies suggest that di-L motif at the C-terminus of D1R is critical for the glycosylation and cell surface targeting of D1R."
https://openalex.org/W2034049800,"Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by innate immune receptors is essential for host defense responses. Although extracellular stress proteins are considered as indicators of the stressful conditions (e.g., infection or cell injury), the exact roles of these molecules in the extracellular milieu remain less defined. We found that glucose-regulated protein 170 (Grp170), the largest stress protein and molecular chaperone, is highly efficient in binding CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), the microbial DNA mimetic sensed by toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Extracellular Grp170 markedly potentiates the endocytosis and internalization of CpG-ODN by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and directly interacts with endosomal TLR9 on cell entry. These molecular collaborations result in the synergistic activation of the MyD88-dependent signaling and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in mouse primary macrophages as well as human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting that Grp170 released from injured cells facilitates the sensing of pathogen-associated ""danger"" signals by intracellular receptors. This CpG-ODN chaperone complex-promoted innate immunity confers increased resistance in mice to infection of Listeria monocytogenes compared with CpG-ODN treatment alone. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized attribute of Grp170 as a superior DNA-binding chaperone capable of amplifying TLR9 activation on pathogen recognition, which provides a conceptual advance in understanding the dynamics of ancient chaperoning functions inside and outside the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2067442309,"In 2009, a novel influenza virus (2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1)) caused significant disease in the United States. Most states, including Florida, experienced a large fall wave of disease from September through November, after which disease activity decreased substantially. We determined the prevalence of antibodies due to the pH1N1 virus in Florida after influenza activity had peaked and estimated the proportion of the population infected with pH1N1 virus during the pandemic.During November-December 2009, we collected leftover serum from a blood bank, a pediatric children's hospital and a pediatric outpatient clinic in Tampa Bay Florida. Serum was tested for pH1N1 virus antibodies using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay. HI titers ≥40 were considered seropositive. We adjusted seroprevalence results to account for previously established HI assay specificity and sensitivity and employed a simple statistical model to estimate the proportion of seropositivity due to pH1N1 virus infection and vaccination.During the study time period, the overall seroprevalence in Tampa Bay, Florida was 25%, increasing to 30% after adjusting for HI assay sensitivity and specificity. We estimated that 5.9% of the population had vaccine-induced seropositivity while 25% had seropositivity secondary to pH1N1 virus infection. The highest cumulative incidence of pH1N1 virus infection was among children aged 5-17 years (53%) and young adults aged 18-24 years (47%), while adults aged ≥50 years had the lowest cumulative incidence (11-13%) of pH1N1 virus infection.After the peak of the fall wave of the pandemic, an estimated one quarter of the Tampa Bay population had been infected with the pH1N1 virus. Consistent with epidemiologic trends observed during the pandemic, the highest burdens of disease were among school-aged children and young adults."

The highly conserved NineTeen complex protein complex stabilizes various snRNA and protein interactions early in the spliceosome assembly pathway. Among several NineTeen complex-associated proteins is the nonessential protein Bud31/Ycr063w, which is also a component of the Cef1p subcomplex. A role for Bud31 in pre-mRNA splicing is implicated by virtue of its association with splicing factors, but its specific functions and spliceosome interactions are uncharacterized. Here, using in vitro splicing assays with extracts from a strain lacking Bud31, we illustrate its role in efficient progression to the first catalytic step and its requirement for the second catalytic step in reactions at higher temperatures. Immunoprecipitation of functional epitope-tagged Bud31 from in vitro reactions showed that its earliest association is with precatalytic B complex and that the interaction continues in catalytically active complexes with stably bound U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. In complementary experiments, wherein precatalytic spliceosomes are selected from splicing reactions, we detect the occurrence of Bud31. Cross-linking of proteins to pre-mRNAs with a site-specific 4-thio uridine residue at the −3 position of exon 1 was tested in reactions with WT and bud31 null extracts. The data suggest an altered interaction between a ∼25-kDa protein and this exonic residue of pre-mRNAs in the arrested bud31 null spliceosomes. These results demonstrate the early spliceosomal association of Bud31 and provide plausible functions for this factor in stabilizing protein interactions with the pre-mRNA.

These results demonstrate the early spliceosomal association of Bud31 and provide plausible functions for this factor in stabilizing protein interactions with the pre-mRNA. The spliceosome is a dynamic complex that assembles in a stepwise manner on the pre-mRNA with several conformational transitions for its activation, catalysis, and recycling. In vitro splicing assays with budding yeast cell-free extracts show that a critical and early step in spliceosome activation is the dissociation of the U1 and U4 snRNAs from the precatalytic B spliceosome that contains all five spliceosomal U-rich snRNAs.

Other than a putative nuclear localization signal and C-terminal zinc finger motif, no other domains are annotated in this protein. Other studies have reported physical interactions between Bud31 with the SF3b subcomplex, which is itself U2 snRNP-associated. Stable binding of U2 snRNA to the branch site sequences of the pre-mRNA is facilitated by the SF3b complex, and this possibly prevents premature nucleophilic attack by the branch site adenosine at the 5′ splice site (15.Wang Q. He J. Lynn B. Rymond B.C. Interactions of the yeast SF3b splicing factor.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10745-10754Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Aside from the implicated functions of Bud31 in splicing, an earlier study reported that bud31 null cells displayed cytoskeletal abnormalities and had abnormal budding patterns (16.Masciadri B. Areces L.B. Carpinelli P. Foiani M. Draetta G. Fiore F. Characterization of the BUD31 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This study also examined the splicing of ACT1 and PFY1 introns and reported inefficient splicing of these two transcripts in bud31 null cells. However, specific functions of Bud31 in pre-mRNA splicing are as yet uncharacterized. Here, we have investigated the role of Bud31 in pre-mRNA splicing and determined its in vitro spliceosome associations. In vitro splicing assays, employing bud31Δ cell-derived extracts, show a compromised progression toward first step catalysis and an arrest of the second step specifically at higher reaction temperatures. We demonstrate that the earliest association of Bud31 with spliceosomes is with the B precatalytic complex and that it continues its association with activated, catalytic, and recycling spliceosomes that are formed later. These inferences are based on our data from pulldown of the epitope-tagged protein and also through investigations on the presence of Bud31 protein in pre-mRNA substrate affinity-purified spliceosomes. We show that Bud31 is required for efficient cross-linking of a ∼25-kDa protein with exon sequences near the 5′ splice site of the pre-mRNA substrate, particularly in reactions at higher temperatures. In the inefficiently assembled and arrested spliceosomes that lack Bud31, the absence of this ∼25-kDa factor is possibly an underlying reason for the splicing defect seen at nonoptimal reaction temperatures. Taken together, our data illustrate an initial precatalytic interaction of Bud31 with the spliceosome and its sustained presence in complexes of later steps of the splicing cycle, define its functions through the catalytic steps of pre-mRNA splicing, and suggest a role in stabilizing protein-pre-mRNA interactions. Splicing extracts were prepared from the haploid strains: ycr063w::KANMX4 (bud31::KANMX4), ycr063w::KANMX4 transformed with the expression construct pCHP425YCR063w/BUD31, WT BY4743, YCWC2TAP, YPRP21TAP, and YCR063wTAP (BUD31TAP). The haploid ycr063w::KANMX4 and the BY4743 strains were generated by random sporulation from the diploid yrc063w:KANMX4/ycr063w:KANMX4 and the BY4743 strains, respectively, which, in turn, were obtained from EUROSCARF, whereas YCR063wTAP/BUD31TAP was from Open Biosystems.

In vitro transcribed ACT1 mini-transcripts were spliced using cell-free extracts prepared from haploid bud31Δ and isogenic WT BY4743 cells. Splicing reactions were carried out at 23 and 37 °C, and reaction kinetics were determined by assessing and quantifying the reaction intermediates and products in a time series (5, 15, and 25 min). Extracts from WT cells splice the ACT1 mini pre-mRNA efficiently at 23 °C. Both catalytic reactions are efficient as significant amounts of products from the second step, i.e. the intron and mRNA, are detected at all time points (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3, supplemental Fig. S1A for normalized first step and second step catalyzed RNA species). At 37 °C, overall splicing efficiency is slightly lower, even in WT extract reactions, but importantly no arrest was observed at either splicing step (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6, supplemental Fig. S1A). In reactions with the bud31Δ extract, we observe reduced efficiency of the second step even at 23 °C as compared with reactions at 23 °C with WT extracts (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9, supplemental Fig. S1A). In reactions at 37 °C, by 25 min, both first step and second step products are nearly 4-fold reduced as compared with that in reactions with WT extract (Fig. 1B, lanes 10–12, supplemental Fig. S1A). The ratios of the first and second step products are depicted in Fig. 1C to reflect splicing efficiency. Although the kinetics of the first step itself are reduced in reactions with bud31Δ extracts, the inefficiency of the second step, detectable at 23 °C, is exacerbated at elevated temperatures (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1A). These data are supported by in vitro splicing reactions performed with extracts from a diploid strain homozygous for bud 31 null allele and a control WT diploid (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). The in vitro accumulation of first step products at 37 °C in the absence of Bud31 correlate with the arrested growth of bud31Δ cells at 37 °C and implicate roles for this factor for splicing progression through the second catalytic step. Analysis of the common and unique spliceosome/snRNA interactions displayed by members of the NTC complex has provided insights on their individual contributions.

https://openalex.org/W2017971108,"The molecular mechanisms by which γδ T cells recognize ligand remain a mystery. The non-classical MHC molecule T22 represents the best characterized ligand for murine γδ T cells, with a motif (W … EGYEL) present in the γδ T cell receptor complementary-determining region 3δ (CDR3δ) loop mediating γδ T cell recognition of this molecule. Produced through V(D)J recombination, this loop is quite diverse, with different numbers and chemical types of amino acids between Trp and EGYEL, which have unknown functional consequences for T22 recognition. We have investigated the biophysical and structural effects of CDR3δ loop diversity, revealing a range of affinities for T22 but a common thermodynamic pattern. Mutagenesis of these CDR3δ loops defines the key anchor residues involved in T22 recognition as W … EGYEL, similar to those found for the G8 CDR3δ loop, and demonstrates that spacer residues modulate but are not required for T22 recognition. Comparison of the location of these residues in the T22 interface reveals a striking similarity to peptide anchor residues in classically presented MHC peptides, with the key Trp residue of the CDR3δ motif completing the deficient peptide-binding groove of T22. This suggests that γδ T cell recognition of T22 utilizes the conserved ligand-presenting nature of the MHC fold."
https://openalex.org/W1992214576,"Protein scaffolds control the intensity and duration of signaling and dictate the specificity of signaling through MAP kinase pathways. KSR1 is a molecular scaffold of the Raf/MEK/ERK MAP kinase cascade that regulates the intensity and duration of ERK activation. Relative to wild-type mice, ksr1⁻/⁻ mice are modestly glucose intolerant, but show a normal response to exogenous insulin. However, ksr1⁻/⁻ mice also demonstrate a three-fold increase in serum insulin levels in response to a glucose challenge, suggesting a role for KSR1 in insulin secretion. The kinase MARK2 is closely related to C-TAK1, a known regulator of KSR1. Mice lacking MARK2 have an increased rate of glucose disposal in response to exogenous insulin, increased glucose tolerance, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. mark2⁻/⁻ksr1⁻/⁻ (DKO) mice were compared to wild type, mark2⁻/⁻, and ksr1⁻/⁻ mice for their ability to regulate glucose homeostasis. Here we show that disruption of KSR1 in mark2⁻/⁻ mice reverses the increased sensitivity to exogenous insulin resulting from MARK2 deletion. DKO mice respond to exogenous insulin similarly to wild type and ksr1⁻/⁻ mice. These data suggest a model whereby MARK2 negatively regulates insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue through inhibition of KSR1. Consistent with this model, we found that MARK2 binds and phosphorylates KSR1 on Ser392. Phosphorylation of Ser392 is a critical regulator of KSR1 stability, subcellular location, and ERK activation. These data reveal an unexpected role for the molecular scaffold KSR1 in insulin-regulated glucose metabolism."

Here we use proximity-based ligation methods (i.e. chromosome conformation capture [3C] and circularized chromosome confrmation capture [4C]) to explore the spatial organization of tRNA genes and their locus-specific interactions with the ribosomal DNA. Directed replacement of one lysine and two leucine tRNA loci shows that tRNA spatial organization depends on both tRNA coding sequence identity and the surrounding chromosomal loci. These observations support a model whereby the three-dimensional, spatial organization of tRNA loci within the nucleus utilizes tRNA gene-specific signals to affect local interactions, though broader organization of chromosomal regions are determined by factors outside the tRNA genes themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2075612187,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) affects millions of people worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, fewer than 10% of heavy drinkers progress to later stages of injury, suggesting other factors in ALD development, including environmental exposures and genetics. Females display greater susceptibility to the early damaging effects of ethanol. Estrogen (E2) and ethanol metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450, CYP450) are implicated in sex differences of ALD. Sex steroid hormones are developmentally regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which controls sex-specific cycling of gonadal steroid production and expression of hepatic enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine if early postnatal inhibition of adult cyclic E2 alters ethanol metabolizing enzyme expression contributing to the development of ALD in adulthood. An androgenized rat model was used to inhibit cyclic E2 production. Control females (Ctrl), androgenized females (Andro) and Andro females with E2 implants were administered either an ethanol or isocalorically-matched control Lieber-DeCarli diet for four weeks and liver injury and CYP450 expression assessed. Androgenization exacerbated the deleterious effects of ethanol demonstrated by increased steatosis, lipid peroxidation, profibrotic gene expression and decreased antioxidant defenses compared to Ctrl. Additionally, CYP2E1 expression was down-regulated in Andro animals on both diets. No change was observed in CYP1A2 protein expression. Further, continuous exogenous administration of E2 to Andro in adulthood attenuated these effects, suggesting that E2 has protective effects in the androgenized animal. Therefore, early postnatal inhibition of cyclic E2 modulates development and progression of ALD in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2078283072,"Synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) appear to play opposite roles in neuronal survival and death. Here we report the new findings on the dysregulation of survival factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), by extrasynaptic NMDARs. Excitotoxicity led to the NMDAR-dependent degradation of MEF2D protein and inhibition of its transactivation activity in mature cortical neurons. The activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs alone was sufficient for degradation of MEF2D. Calpain directly cleaved MEF2D in vitro and blocking this protease activity greatly attenuated NMDAR signaled degradation of MEF2D in neurons. Consistently, inhibition of calpain protected cortical neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Furthermore, knockdown of MEF2D sensitized neurons to NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, which was not protected by calpain inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of MEF2D by calpain may mediate excitotoxicity via an extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1996924118,"In response to light, most retinal neurons exhibit gradual changes in membrane potential. Therefore K+ channels that mediate threshold currents are well-suited for the fine-tuning of signal transduction. In the present study we demonstrate the expression of the different Kv11 (ether-à-go-go related gene; erg) channel subunits in the human and mouse retina by RT PCR and quantitative PCR, respectively. Immunofluorescence analysis with cryosections of mouse retinae revealed the following local distribution of the three Kv11 subunits: Kv11.1 (m-erg1) displayed the most abundant expression with the strongest immunoreactivity in rod bipolar cells. In addition, immunoreactivity was found in the inner part of the outer plexiform layer (OPL), in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and in the inner segments of photoreceptors. Immunoreactivity for Kv11.2 (m-erg2) was observed in the outer part of the OPL and throughout the IPL. Double-labeling for vGluT1 or synaptophysin indicated a mainly presynaptic localization of Kv11.2. While no significant staining for Kv11.3 (m-erg3) was detected in the neuronal retina, strong Kv11.3 immunoreactivity was present in the apical membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium. The different expression levels were confirmed by real-time PCR showing almost equal levels of Kv11.1 and Kv11.2, while Kv11.3 mRNA expression was significantly lower. The two main splice variants of Kv11.1, isoforms a and b were detected in comparable levels suggesting a possible formation of cGMP/cGK-sensitive Kv11.1 channels in photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells. Taken together, the immunohistological results revealed different expression patterns of the three Kv11 channels in the mouse retina supposing distinct physiological roles."

To search for small molecules treating this aggressive cancer, we have established a cell-based screening and successfully identified acridine yellow G that preferentially blocks cell proliferation of the most malignant U87MG/EGFRvIII cells over the less malignant U87MG/PTEN cells. Oral administration of this compound markedly diminishes the brain tumor volumes in both subcutaneous and intracranial models. It directly inhibits EGFR and PKCs with IC(50) values of ~7.5 and 5 μM, respectively. It dually inhibits EGFR and PKCs, resulting in a blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase, which leads to activation of apoptosis in the tumors. Hence, combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and PKCs might provide proof of concept in developing therapeutic agents for treating malignant glioma and other human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2115726790,"There is a growing need for novel vaccine adjuvants that can provide safe and potent T-helper type 1 (Th1) activity. RNA-like immune response modifiers (IRMs) are candidate T-cell adjuvants that skew acquired immune responses towards a Th1 phenotype. We set out to delineate the essential signaling pathways by which the RNA-like IRMs, resiquimod (R-848) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), augment CD4+ T-helper 1 (Th1) responses. Highly purified murine conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and conventional CD4+ T-cells were co-cultured in allogeneic and MHC congenic mixed leukocyte reactions. The activation of CD4+ Th1 cells was examined utilizing cells from mice deficient in specific RNA-sensing pattern recognition receptors and signaling mediators. R-848 and poly I:C stimulation of Type I interferon production and signaling in cDCs was essential but not sufficient for driving CD4+ Th1 responses. The early and rapid production of IL-1α and IL-1β was equally critical for the optimal activation of Th1 CD4+ T-cells. R-848 activation of Toll-like receptor 7/MyD88-dependent signaling in cDCs led to a rapid upregulation of pro-IL-1α and pro-IL-1β production compared to poly I:C activation of MyD88-independent signaling pathways. The in vitro data show that CD4+ T-cell adjuvant activity of RNA-like IRMs is mediated by a critical combination of early and rapid Type I interferon, IL-1α and IL-1β production. These results provide important insights into the key signaling pathways responsible for RNA-like IRM CD4+ Th1 activation. A better understanding of the critical signaling pathways by which RNA-like IRMs stimulate CD4+ Th1 responses is relevant to the rational design of improved vaccine adjuvants."

Thus, the isolated catalytic domain of FXIa possesses normal enzymatic activity against small peptide substrates but deficient activity against the normal macromolecular substrate FIX. There are several plausible explanations for this discrepancy, one of which is that FIX undergoes an allosteric modification upon binding to the heavy chain of FXIa that facilitates access of the two FIX scissile bonds for cleavages by FXIa. Validation of this mechanism would predict that preincubation of FIX with the isolated heavy chain of FIXa would potentiate rates of FIX activation by the isolated catalytic domain of FXIa. Alternatively, if the affinity of the enzyme-substrate interaction is determined solely by the binding of FIX to the heavy chain of FXIa, then FIX activation by FXIa should be inhibited in the presence of excess of FXIa-HC because of substrate depletion. These two hypotheses were examined in experiments, the results of which are reported in this manuscript. Human FIX, FIXa, FXI, and FXIa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). FXIIa, Corn trypsin inhibitor-coupled agarose beads, high molecular weight kininogen (HK), polyclonal antibodies against FIX and FXI, and ELISA kits were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Chromogenic substrates S-2366 (L-pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide) and S-2765 (N-α-benzoxycarbonyl-D-arginyl-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline) were obtained from DiaPharma (Westchester, OH). Spectrozyme fIXa (methyl-sulfonyl-D-cyclohexylglycyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) was purchased from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT). Transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were obtained from the ATCC (CRL1573). DMEM was purchased from Mediatech (Herndon,VA). Vitamin K1 (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) was purchased from Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL). The irreversible serine protease inhibitor 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), HEPES, Tris, L-α-phosphatidylcholine, L-α-phosphatidylserine, Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin, fatty acid-free BSA, benzamidine, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The cDNA constructs of FXI mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with wild-type FXI cDNA inserted into the expression vector pJVCMV (12.Fujikawa K.

Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h and then switched to the same medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml of G418.

Cell lines exhibiting maximal expression of FXI proteins were expanded in roller bottles (Nunc, Naperville, IL). After reaching confluence, cells were washed, and the media were replaced by serum-free DMEM supplemented with ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium-A, Invitrogen), soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and lima bean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml). Conditioned media were removed every 48 h and kept frozen after supplementing with benzamidine (5 mm) and EDTA (5 mm) until ready to be purified. Expressed wtFXI, FXI/S557A, FXI/C362S/C482S and FXI/S557A/C362S/C482S proteins in the conditioned medium were purified using a monoclonal antibody (5F7) affinity column according to the protocol described earlier (19.Sinha D.

Briefly, the cell supernatant was passed through the affinity column at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of TBS followed by elution of the protein using 2 m potassium thiocyanate. The eluted protein was dialyzed and concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20, 30,000 NMWL ultrafiltration unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). To prepare FXI-HC and FXI-LC, the concentrated and purified FXI/C362S/C482S and FXI/S557A/C362S/C482S were activated with FXIIa at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 20:1 at 37 °C for 24 h. The incubation mixture was passed through a 5F7 antibody column, the unbound LC was purified from FXIIa using corn trypsin inhibitor-coupled agarose beads, and the HC bound to the 5F7 column was eluted and purified as described for FXI/C362S/C462S (21.Miller T.N. Sinha D. Baird T.R. Walsh P.N.

Protein concentration was estimated using the BCA assay (Pierce). The purified proteins were size-fractionated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and stained using GelCode blue stain (Pierce). An Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) was used for visualization and densitometric analysis of the bands. FIX activation by FXIa-LC was carried out using a modification (19.Sinha D. Marcinkiewicz M. Navaneetham D. Walsh P.N. Macromolecular substrate-binding exosites on both the heavy and light chains of factor XIa mediate the formation of the Michaelis complex required for factor IX-activation.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9830-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of a coupled assay described originally by Wagenvoord et al. (23.Wagenvoord R. Hendrix H. Tran T. Hemker H.C. Development of a sensitive and rapid chromogenic factor IX assay for clinical use.Haemostasis. 1990; 20: 276-288PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, FIX is first activated by FXIa-LC to FIXa, which is then used to activate FX in the presence of FVIIIa, phospholipids, and calcium. FXa thus generated was estimated using the chromogenic substrate S-2765. All reagents were diluted in TBS containing 0.1% BSA (TBSA). Varying concentrations of FIX (0.2–2.2 μm) were incubated with a fixed concentration (2.88 μm) of FXIa-HC or buffer for 20 min, followed by activation by FXIa-LC (15–20 nm) for 5–10 min in a microtiter plate at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl of TBSA supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. Adding EDTA to 25 mm and chilling on ice stopped the reactions. 5 μl of the reaction mixture was then added to chilled TBSA containing 25 mm EDTA to make a total volume of 200 μl. 5 μl from the diluted reaction mixture was added to 60 μl of TBSA containing 10 mm CaCl2, followed by addition of 10 μl of 10 μm phospholipid vesicles (phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine) and incubation for 2 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of freshly activated FVIIIa (66 units/ml) followed by 10 μl of FX (2 μm) were then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Final concentrations of FVIIIa, FX, and phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine in the reaction mixture were 6.6 units/ml, 0.2 μm, and 1 μm, respectively. Adding EDTA to 25 mm and placing it on ice stopped the activation of FX by FIXa. 50 μl of each reaction was mixed with 50 μl of 1 mm S-2765, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was followed on a ThermoMax microtiter plate reader. The concentration of FIXa generated was obtained from a standard curve constructed using known concentrations of purified FIXa. FIX (1 μm) was incubated with buffer or FXIa-HC (2 μm) for 15 min at room temperature and then activated using FXIa-LC (15 nm) as described above. In a separate experiment, we examined the activation of FIX using a higher concentration of FXIa-LC (50 nm) after preincubating FIX (1 μm) with varying concentrations of FXIa-HC (1–5 μm). The reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane, after thorough washing, was incubated with goat anti-human FIX polyclonal antibody (ERL, South Bend, IN), and the bound antibody was detected by HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and visualized by chemiluminescence. FIX (1 μm) was incubated with TBSA buffer, FXIa/S557A (200 nm), or FXI-HC (200 nm) for 15 min at room temperature and then activated using FXIa (1 nm). At specified time points, aliquots were drawn into SDS sample buffer for size fractionation. In a separate experiment, FIX (1 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of FXIa/S557A (200 nm-1 μm) or FXI-HC (1–4 μm) for 15 min at room temperature followed by activation for 25 min using FXIa (1 nm). FIX cleavage products were analyzed by Western blot analysis as described above. To prevent activation of FIX by FXIa or by FXIa-LC during prolonged incubation in the ELISA assay, the two proteins were irreversibly inhibited by incubation with 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride by making five sequential additions of 5 μl of 10 mm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to 500 μl of the protein solution (2–5 μm) and allowing 5 min after each addition for the inhibitor to interact with the protein. The inactivated proteins were then dialyzed extensively before being used in the ELISA assay. The proteins were inactivated by > 97%, as judged by their ability to hydrolyze S-2366. 100 μl of FIX (10 μg/ml) in 50 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was added to wells of a microtiter plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Uncoated sites of the wells were blocked by incubation with 200 μl of BSA at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. FIX coated to the wells was allowed to interact with varying concentrations (as indicated in the figures) of FXIai, FXIai/LC, FXI-HC, or FXI in TBS containing Ca2+ (5 mm) for 90 min at room temperature. The wells were thoroughly washed with TBS containing Ca2+ (5 mm) and Tween 20 (0.02%) to remove the unbound proteins, followed by detection of FIX-bound FXIai, FXIai/LC, FXI-HC, or FXI using HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody made against FXI (Enzyme Research Laboratories) according to the protocol provided by the supplier. Like plasma FXIa, the mutant FXIa/S557A is a dimer of two identical subunits joined by a disulfide linkage through Cys321 in the heavy chain, and each subunit of the enzyme is a two-chain molecule joined by Cys362 in the heavy chain and Cys482 in the light chain. Because both Cys362 and Cys482 are mutated in FXI/S557A/C362S/C482S, the activated triple mutant produces a dimeric heavy chain (one heavy chain from each subunit joined by the interchain disulfide bond at Cys321) of ∼90 kDa and a free light chain of ∼35 kDa. ELISA assays of FXIa/S557A and FXIa/S557A/C362S/C482S for FIX binding were performed as described above. In a separate experiment a fixed concentration of FIX (5 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations (15 nm-1 μm) of either FXIa/S557A or FXIa/S557A/C362S/C482S in solution for 15 min at room temperature. These preincubated samples (100 μl) were then added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with FXIa/S557A. FIX bound to the wells was detected using HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody to FIX. FXI/FXIa binds to HK through its heavy chain (24.Thompson R.E. Mandle Jr., R. Kaplan A.P. Association of factor XI and high molecular weight kininogen in human plasma.J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25.Renné T. Gailani D. Meijers J.C. Müller-Esterl W. Characterization of the H-kininogen-binding site on factor XI.

To examine whether FXIa-HC retains its capacity to bind to HK we compared binding of HK to FXIa/S557A and FXIa/S557A/C362S/C482S. For this purpose, the wells of a microtiter plate were coated with HK by incubation of 100 μl of HK at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 50 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) as for the ELISA assays described above. After blocking free sites with BSA, either FXIa/S557A or FXIa/S557A/C362S/C482S at concentrations designated in the figure were added and incubated for 90 min followed by extensive washing. HK-bound proteins were then detected using peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody to FXI as described above. To assess whether the light chain of FXIa free from the heavy chain retains its active site integrity, we compared FXIa and FXIa/C362S/C482S in their ability to hydrolyze the small peptidyl substrate S-2366. FXIa or FXIa/C362S/C482S at a concentration of 3 nm in TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA was added to varying concentrations (0–1.5 mm) of S-2366 in TBS, and the rate of hydrolysis was measured by monitoring generation of p-nitroaniline at 405 nm in a plate reader. To examine whether any major structural alteration resulted from mutations at Cys362 and Cys482, we compared plasma FXI, FXI/S557A, and FXI/S557A/C362S/C482S in their capacity to bind to a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against plasma FXI (FXI ELISA kit, Enzyme Research Laboratories) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. 200 μl of FXIa/S557A (3.75 μm) was partially reduced using 150 μm DTT by incubation for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (14.Sinha D. Koshy A. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. Functional characterization of human blood coagulation factor XIa using hybridoma antibodies.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10714-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Half of the reduced product was alkylated by further incubation for 30 min with 300 μl of iodoacetamide, and both the alkylated and non-alkylated samples were dialyzed for 48 h with two changes of buffer containing 0.02% Tween 20, EDTA (2 mm), and benzamidine (5 mm) and a final change of buffer without EDTA. After dialysis, each sample was estimated for protein concentration and used for FIX binding as described above. A plausible explanation for the observation that the isolated catalytic domain of FXIa is a poor activator of FIX compared with wild-type FXIa, despite its intact enzymatic activity against small peptide substrates, is that FIX, bound to the exosite in the heavy chain of FXIa, undergoes a conformational change that facilitates optimal cleavage rates of the two FIX peptide bonds, leading to the formation of FIXa. If this hypothesis is correct, then activation of FIX by FXIa-LC should be potentiated by preincubation of FIX with FXIa-HC. This hypothesis was tested by examining the rate of activation of FIX preincubated with buffer or FXIa-HC. As shown in Fig. 1A, preincubation of FIX with the isolated heavy chain of FXIa does not potentiate the rate of FIX activation by FXIa-LC. Cleavage patterns of FIX activation by FXIa-LC in the presence and absence of FXIa-HC were also examined by Western blot analysis and are shown in Fig. 1B. We also examined activation of FIX using a higher concentration of FXIa-LC (50 nm) after preincubating FIX (1 μm) with varying concentrations of FXIa-HC (1–5 μm) for 15 min at room temperature. The results of these experiments (Fig. 1C) demonstrate no discernible difference in the cleavage rate or cleavage pattern of FIX activation by the catalytic domain of FXIa in the presence or absence of the FXIa heavy chain. If the affinity of the substrate-enzyme interaction is solely determined through interaction of FIX with the heavy chain of FXIa, then a saturating concentration of isolated FXIa-HC should deplete the substrate, making it unavailable for binding to the enzyme, and thereby inhibiting the rate of FIX activation. We therefore compared the cleavage of FIX (1 μm) by FXIa (1.0 nm) in the presence or absence of a 200-fold molar excess of the FXIa-HC (200 nm) (Fig. 2B). The result of this experiment demonstrated no discernible effect of the isolated FXIa heavy chain on the rate or cleavage pattern of FIX activation. On the contrary; the intact molecule with the active site Ser mutated to Ala (FXIa/S557A) and, at a similar concentration (200 nm), was able to inhibit the cleavage rate of FIX activation by FXIa (Fig. 2A). The effects of higher concentrations of FXIa-HC as well as of FXIa/S557A were also examined, as shown in Fig. 2, D and C, respectively. Although FXIa/S557A inhibited cleavage of the substrate almost completely at 500 nm, no demonstrable inhibition could be observed, even at concentrations of FXIa-HC as high as 4 μm. Because FXIa-HC was ineffective in potentiating FIX activation by FXIa-LC or inhibiting the rate of FIXa generation by full-length FXIa, we examined binding of the substrate, FIX to FXIa and to the iso"

Blowflies (Chrysomya megacephala, Diptera: Calliphoridae) are attracted to oviposit (and/or larviposit) onto fermenting fish which results in infestations with fly larvae. Knowledge of traditional use of plants to repel larvae during the production of fermented fish is common and widespread in Lao PDR. Research Questions How effective are the most salient species in repelling, and killing fly larvae in fermenting fish? Material and Methods The three plant species most frequently reported to repel fly larvae during an ethnobotanical survey throughout Lao PDR were tested for repellence and larvicidal activity of fly larvae infesting fermented fish. The lethality and repellence of Tadehagi triquetrum (L.) H. Ohashi (Fabaceae), Uraria crinita (L.) Desv. ex DC. (Fabaceae) and Bambusa multiplex (Lour.) Raeusch. ex Schult. & Schult. f. (Poaceae) were tested in an experimental design using fermenting fish in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Results The repellent effect of fresh material of T. triquetrum and U. crinita, and the larvicidal effect of fresh B. multiplex, is significantly more effective than that of dried material of the same species, and the total effect (repellence and larvicidal effect combined) for each of the three species was significantly more effective for fresh than for dry material. Fresh material of T. triquetrum, U. crinita, or B. multiplex added on top of the fermenting fish repelled 50%, 54%, 37%, and killed 22%, 28%, and 40% of fly larvae. The total effect was not significantly different per species at 72%, 82%, and 77%, respectively. Discussion and Conclusions The three most salient species are effective in repelling and killing fly larvae in the production of fermented fish, and may be essential to augment food safety during traditional fermentation in open jars."
