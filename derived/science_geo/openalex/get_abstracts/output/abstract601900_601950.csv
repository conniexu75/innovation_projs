https://openalex.org/W2777810495,"The invasion of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis into Ontario, Canada poses a significant risk to public health because it is a vector for numerous pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Baseline field sampling in 2014 and 2015 detected I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi at sites across southern, eastern and central Ontario, including a hot spot in eastern Ontario. A ""speed of spread"" model for I. scapularis developed by Leighton and colleagues (2012) estimated that the tick's range was expanding northward at 46 km/year. In 2016, we revisited a subset of sites sampled in 2014 and 2015 to understand the changing nature of risk, and assess whether the rate of tick invasion is consistent with the speed of spread estimate. Ticks were collected via tick dragging at 17 out of 36 sites, 5 of which were new sites for I. scapularis. Samples were positive for B. burgdorferi at 8 sites. No other I. scapularis-borne pathogens were detected. Centrographic statistics revealed an increase in the dispersion of I. scapularis positive sites in eastern Ontario. Field data for each site were then compared to the model's predicted year of establishment for each census subdivision. Our findings illustrate that the range expansion of I. scapularis and the emergence of B. burgdorferi is ongoing, and provide short timescale evidence of the processes associated with I. scapularis spread. The range front appears to be moving at a rate of ~46 km/year, with colonization of the tick behind this range front occurring at a slower and heterogeneous rate. Assessment of site-level ecological factors did not provide any insight into the underlying processes that may be influencing the colonization of I. scapularis in specific areas. Ongoing field sampling is needed to monitor this dynamic process. This study highlights the current geographic risk associated with Lyme disease, which can be used to target public health interventions to the areas of greatest risk."

Despite the promise of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in reducing HIV transmission risk, barriers for uptake and persistence exist. We sought to identify whether GBM in a nationwide cohort who have not yet initiated PrEP (n = 906) would prefer to get PrEP-related care from a primary care provider (PCP) compared to a specialist clinic or provider. We then sought to identify their level of interest and factors associated with preference for using home-based PrEP services (i.e., HB-PrEP), defined to participants as conducting HIV/STI self-testing from home with PrEP prescription mailing after an initial in-person clinic visit. We examined the associations of demographics, sexual HIV transmission risk, concern about frequent medical checkups associated with PrEP, health care access, and PrEP intentions with preferences for healthcare provider type and HB-PrEP. Concern about frequent medical checkups were associated with preferring a PCP for PrEP-related care, but men who perceived a barrier to bringing up the topic of PrEP with a doctor preferred a specialist clinic or provider more than a PCP. HB-PrEP was more appealing for younger men and those engaged in sexual HIV transmission risk, suggesting HB-PrEP could help reach GBM most vulnerable to HIV and in need of PrEP. HB-PrEP expansion has potential to increase PrEP uptake and persistence among GBM, particularly for men with barriers to clinic-based care and higher intentions to initiate PrEP. Clinical guidelines regarding HB-PrEP are needed to expand its use."
https://openalex.org/W2781231924,"Many factors have been proposed to explain the attrition of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields, among them the lower performance of women in introductory courses resulting from deficits in incoming preparation. We focus on the impact of mixed methods of assessment, which minimizes the impact of high-stakes exams and rewards other methods of assessment such as group participation, low-stakes quizzes and assignments, and in-class activities. We hypothesized that these mixed methods would benefit individuals who otherwise underperform on high-stakes tests. Here, we analyze gender-based performance trends in nine large (N > 1000 students) introductory biology courses in fall 2016. Females underperformed on exams compared to their male counterparts, a difference that does not exist with other methods of assessment that compose course grade. Further, we analyzed three case studies of courses that transitioned their grading schemes to either de-emphasize or emphasize exams as a proportion of total course grade. We demonstrate that the shift away from an exam emphasis consequently benefits female students, thereby closing gaps in overall performance. Further, the exam performance gap itself is reduced when the exams contribute less to overall course grade. We discuss testable predictions that follow from our hypothesis, and advocate for the use of mixed methods of assessments (possibly as part of an overall shift to active learning techniques). We conclude by challenging the student deficit model, and suggest a course deficit model as explanatory of these performance gaps, whereby the microclimate of the classroom can either raise or lower barriers to success for underrepresented groups in STEM."
https://openalex.org/W2777535236,"Earth's future carbon balance and regional carbon exchange dynamics are inextricably linked to plant photosynthesis. Spectral vegetation indices are widely used as proxies for vegetation greenness and to estimate state variables such as vegetation cover and leaf area index. However, the capacity of green leaves to take up carbon can change throughout the season. We quantify photosynthetic capacity as the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and regeneration (Jmax). Vcmax and Jmax vary within-season due to interactions between ontogenetic processes and meteorological variables. Remote sensing-based estimation of Vcmax and Jmax using leaf reflectance spectra is promising, but temporal variation in relationships between these key determinants of photosynthetic capacity, leaf reflectance spectra, and the models that link these variables has not been evaluated. To address this issue, we studied hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) during a 7-week mid-summer period to quantify seasonally-dynamic relationships between Vcmax, Jmax, and leaf spectra. We compared in situ estimates of Vcmax and Jmax from gas exchange measurements to estimates of Vcmax and Jmax derived from partial least squares regression (PLSR) and fresh-leaf reflectance spectroscopy. PLSR models were robust despite dynamic temporal variation in Vcmax and Jmax throughout the study period. Within-population variation in plant stress modestly reduced PLSR model predictive capacity. Hyperspectral vegetation indices were well-correlated to Vcmax and Jmax, including the widely-used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Our results show that hyperspectral estimation of plant physiological traits using PLSR may be robust to temporal variation. Additionally, hyperspectral vegetation indices may be sufficient to detect temporal changes in photosynthetic capacity in contexts similar to those studied here. Overall, our results highlight the potential for hyperspectral remote sensing to estimate determinants of photosynthetic capacity during periods with dynamic temporal variations related to seasonality and plant stress, thereby improving estimates of plant productivity and characterization of the associated carbon budget."
https://openalex.org/W2777235740,"Experimentally derived apparent permeabilities, Papp, through cell monolayers such as Caco-2 and MDCK are considered to be an in-vitro gold standard for assessing the uptake efficiency of drugs. Here, we present a mechanistic model that describes 'passive' Papp values (i.e., neglecting active transport) by accounting for the different resistances solutes encounter when permeating a cell monolayer. We described three parallel permeation pathways, namely a cytosolic-, paracellular-, and lateral route, each of which consists of a number of serial resistances. These resistances were accounted for via a mechanistic depiction of the underlying processes that are largely based on literature work. For the present Papp dataset, about as much chemicals are dominated by the cytosolic route as were dominated by the paracellular route, while the lateral route was negligible. For the cytosolic route by far the most chemicals found their main resistance in the various water layers and not in the membrane. Although correlations within the subclasses of chemicals dominated by a specific permeation route were rather poor, we could overall satisfyingly predict Papp for 151 chemicals at a pH of 7.4 (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.48). For a specific evaluation of the intrinsic membrane permeability, Pm, a second experimental dataset based on experiments with black lipid membranes, BLM, was evaluated. Pm could be predicted for 37 chemicals with R2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 0.64 log units."
https://openalex.org/W2777961825,"Pluripotent stem cells can potentially be used in clinical applications as a model for studying disease progress. This tracking of disease-causing events in cells requires constant assessment of the quality of stem cells. Existing approaches are inadequate for robust and automated differentiation of stem cell colonies. In this study, we developed a new model of vector-based convolutional neural network (V-CNN) with respect to extracted features of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colony for distinguishing colony characteristics. A transfer function from the feature vectors to the virtual image was generated at the front of the CNN in order for classification of feature vectors of healthy and unhealthy colonies. The robustness of the proposed V-CNN model in distinguishing colonies was compared with that of the competitive support vector machine (SVM) classifier based on morphological, textural, and combined features. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation was used to investigate the performance of the V-CNN model. The precision, recall, and F-measure values of the V-CNN model were comparatively higher than those of the SVM classifier, with a range of 87-93%, indicating fewer false positives and false negative rates. Furthermore, for determining the quality of colonies, the V-CNN model showed higher accuracy values based on morphological (95.5%), textural (91.0%), and combined (93.2%) features than those estimated with the SVM classifier (86.7, 83.3, and 83.4%, respectively). Similarly, the accuracy of the feature sets using five-fold cross-validation was above 90% for the V-CNN model, whereas that yielded by the SVM model was in the range of 75-77%. We thus concluded that the proposed V-CNN model outperforms the conventional SVM classifier, which strongly suggests that it as a reliable framework for robust colony classification of iPSCs. It can also serve as a cost-effective quality recognition tool during culture and other experimental procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2781016929,"The consumption of antibiotics is a major driver in the development of antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to identify the trends and patterns of the total antibiotic consumption in China’s tertiary hospitals from 2011 to 2015 by retrospectively analyzing aggregated monthly surveillance data on antibiotic sales made to 468 hospitals from 28 provinces. Antibiotic consumption was expressed in DDD per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID). We compared population weighted antibiotic consumption patterns in China with European countries using indicators from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC). Total antibiotic consumption, including all the specific antibiotic class except for aminoglycoside antibacterials, were significantly increased during the study period from an average of 7.97 DID in 2011 to 10.08 DID in 2015. In 2015, the eastern regions of China consumed the most antibiotics using population denominator while the western regions consumed the most using inpatient denominator. Cephalosporins accounted for 28.6% of total DID, followed by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (20.0%), macrolides (17.4%), and fluoroquinolones (10.5%). Antibiotic in parenteral form accounted for nearly half of all antibiotics. Although over the past few years major efforts had been made to reduce the risks of excessive antibiotic use through antibiotic stewardship, total antibiotic consumption showed a significant upward trend during the study period. A consistent preference for cephalosporins, macrolides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, as well as parenteral preparations was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2766314204,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Early diagnosis through effective screening programs is likely to improve vision outcomes. The ETDRS seven-standard-field 35-mm stereoscopic color retinal imaging (ETDRS) of the dilated eye is elaborate and requires mydriasis, and is unsuitable for screening. We evaluated an image analysis application for the automated diagnosis of DR from non-mydriatic single-field images. Patients suffering from diabetes for at least 5 years were included if they were 18 years or older. Patients already diagnosed with DR were excluded. Physiologic mydriasis was achieved by placing the subjects in a dark room. Images were captured using a Bosch Mobile Eye Care fundus camera. The images were analyzed by the Retinal Imaging Bosch DR Algorithm for the diagnosis of DR. All subjects also subsequently underwent pharmacological mydriasis and ETDRS imaging. Non-mydriatic and mydriatic images were read by ophthalmologists. The ETDRS readings were used as the gold standard for calculating the sensitivity and specificity for the software. 564 consecutive subjects (1128 eyes) were recruited from six centers in India. Each subject was evaluated at a single outpatient visit. Forty-four of 1128 images (3.9%) could not be read by the algorithm, and were categorized as inconclusive. In four subjects, neither eye provided an acceptable image: these four subjects were excluded from the analysis. This left 560 subjects for analysis (1084 eyes). The algorithm correctly diagnosed 531 of 560 cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 91%, 97%, 94%, and 95% respectively. The Bosch DR Algorithm shows favorable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing DR from non-mydriatic images, and can greatly simplify screening for DR. This also has major implications for telemedicine in the use of screening for retinopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2778723308,"Chemical conjugation of polysaccharide to carrier proteins has been a successful strategy to generate potent vaccines against bacterial pathogens. We developed a similar approach for poorly immunogenic malaria protein antigens. Our lead candidates in clinical trials are the malaria transmission blocking vaccine antigens, Pfs25 and Pfs230D1, individually conjugated to the carrier protein Exoprotein A (EPA) through thioether chemistry. These conjugates form nanoparticles that show enhanced immunogenicity compared to unconjugated antigens. In this study, we examined the broad applicability of this technology as a vaccine development platform, by comparing the immunogenicity of conjugates prepared by four different chemistries using different malaria antigens (PfCSP, Pfs25 and Pfs230D1), and carriers such as EPA, TT and CRM197. Several conjugates were synthesized using thioether, amide, ADH and glutaraldehyde chemistries, characterized for average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, and evaluated in mice for humoral immunogenicity. Conjugates made with the different chemistries, or with different carriers, showed no significant difference in immunogenicity towards the conjugated antigens. Since particle size can influence immunogenicity, we tested conjugates with different average size in the range of 16-73 nm diameter, and observed greater immunogenicity of smaller particles, with significant differences between 16 and 73 nm particles. These results demonstrate the multiple options with respect to carriers and chemistries that are available for protein-protein conjugate vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2780130107,"Right insular cortex is involved in taste discrimination, but its functional organization is still poorly known. In general, sensory cortices represent the spatial prevalence of relevant features for each sensory modality (visual, auditory, somatosensory) in an ordered way across the cortical space. Following this analogy, we hypothesized that primary taste cortex is organized in similar ordered way in response to six tastes with known receptorial mechanisms (sweet, bitter, sour, salt, umami, CO2).Ten normal subjects were enrolled in a pilot study. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a high resolution cortical registration method, and specialized procedures of feature prevalence localization, to map fMRI responses within the right insular cortex, to water solutions of quinine hydrochloride (bitter), Acesulfamate K (sweet), sodium chloride (salt), mono potassium glutamate + inosine 5' mono phosphate (Umami), citric acid (sour) and carbonated water (CO2). During an fMRI scan delivery of the solutions was applied in pseudo-random order interleaved with cleaning water.Two subjects were discarded due to excessive head movements. In the remaining subjects, statistically significant activations were detected in the fMRI responses to all tastes in the right insular cortex (p<0.05, family-wise corrected for multiple comparisons). Cortical representation of taste prevalence highlighted two spatially segregated clusters, processing two and three tastes coupled together (sweet-bitter and salt-umami-sour), with CO2 in between.Cortical representation of taste prevalence within the right primary taste cortex appears to follow the ecological purpose of enhancing the discrimination between safe nutrients and harmful substances."
https://openalex.org/W2781459072,"Cyclic triterpenes constitute one of the most diverse groups of plant natural products. Besides the intriguing biochemistry of their biosynthetic pathways, plant triterpenes exhibit versatile bioactivities, including antimicrobial effects against plant and human pathogens. While prokaryotes have been extensively used for the heterologous production of other classes of terpenes, the synthesis of cyclic triterpenes, which inherently includes the two-step catalytic formation of the universal linear precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene, is still a major challenge. We thus explored the suitability of the metabolically versatile photosynthetic α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 and cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as alternative hosts for biosynthesis of cyclic plant triterpenes. Therefore, 2,3-oxidosqualene production was implemented and subsequently combined with different cyclization reactions catalyzed by the representative oxidosqualene cyclases CAS1 (cycloartenol synthase), LUP1 (lupeol synthase), THAS1 (thalianol synthase) and MRN1 (marneral synthase) derived from model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. While successful accumulation of 2,3-oxidosqualene could be detected by LC-MS analysis in both hosts, cyclase expression resulted in differential production profiles. CAS1 catalyzed conversion to only cycloartenol, but expression of LUP1 yielded lupeol and a triterpenoid matching an oxidation product of lupeol, in both hosts. In contrast, THAS1 expression did not lead to cyclic product formation in either host, whereas MRN1-dependent production of marnerol and hydroxymarnerol was observed in Synechocystis but not in R. capsulatus. Our findings thus indicate that 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclization in heterologous phototrophic bacteria is basically feasible but efficient conversion depends on both the respective cyclase enzyme and individual host properties. Therefore, photosynthetic α-proteo- and cyanobacteria are promising alternative candidates for providing new bacterial access to the broad class of triterpenes for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2780942770,"Climate change is increasingly impacting the water deficit over the world. Because of drought and the high pressure of the rising human population, water is becoming a scarce and expensive commodity, especially in developing countries. The identification of crops presenting a higher acclimation to drought stress is thus an important objective in agriculture. The present investigation aimed to assess the adaptation of three Vicia faba genotypes, Aguadulce (AD), Luz d'Otonio (LO) and Reina Mora (RM) to water deficit. Multiple physiological and biochemical parameters were used to analyse the response of the three genotypes to two soil water contents (80% and 40% of field capacity). A significant lower decrease in shoot, root and nodule dry weight was observed for AD compared to LO and RM. The better growth performance of AD was correlated to higher carbon and nitrogen content than in LO and RM under water deficit. Leaf parameters such as relative water content, mass area, efficiency of photosystem II and chlorophyll and carotenoid content were significantly less affected in AD than in LO and RM. Significantly higher accumulation of proline was correlated to the higher performance of AD compared to LO and RM. Additionally, the better growth of AD genotype was related to an important mobilisation of antioxidant enzyme activities such as ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. Taken together, these results allow us to suggest that AD is a water deficit tolerant genotype compared to LO and RM. Our multiple physiological and biochemical analyses show that nitrogen content, leaf proline accumulation, reduced leaf hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf antioxidant enzymatic activities (ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and polyphenol oxidase) are potential biological markers useful to screen for water deficit resistant Vicia faba genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2778567729,"Purpose Determine the characteristics of percutaneous core biopsies that are adequate for a next generation sequencing (NGS) genomic panel. Materials and methods All patients undergoing percutaneous core biopsies in interventional radiology (IR) with samples evaluated for a 46-gene NGS panel during 1-year were included in this retrospective study. Patient and procedure variables were collected. An imaging-based likelihood of adequacy score incorporating targeting and sampling factors was assigned to each biopsied lesion. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. Results 153 patients were included (58.2% female, average age 59.5 years). The most common malignancy was lung cancer (40.5%), most common biopsied site was lung (36%), and average size of biopsied lesions was 3.8 cm (+/- 2.7). Adequacy for NGS was 69.9%. Univariate analysis showed higher likelihood of adequacy score (p = 0.004), primary malignancy type (p = 0.03), and absence of prior systemic therapy (p = 0.018) were associated with adequacy for NGS. Multivariate analysis showed higher adequacy for lesions with likelihood of adequacy scored 3 (high) versus lesions scored 1 (low) (OR, 7.82; p = 0.002). Melanoma lesions had higher adequacy for NGS versus breast cancer lesions (OR 9.5; p = 0.01). Absence of prior systemic therapy (OR, 6.1; p = 0.02) and systemic therapy </ = 3 months (OR 3.24; p = 0.01) compared to systemic therapy >3 months before biopsy yielded greater adequacy for NGS. Lesions <3 cm had greater adequacy for NGS than larger lesions (OR 2.72, p = 0.02). Conclusion As targeted therapy becomes standard for more cancers, percutaneous biopsy specimens adequate for NGS genomic testing will be needed. An imaging-based likelihood of adequacy score assigned by IR physicians and other pre-procedure variables can help predict the likelihood of biopsy adequacy for NGS."

A total of 136 people living with HIV in South Africa were administered surveys measuring demographic information and mental health indicators at the time of ART initiation. Follow-up was completed via chart abstraction to assess for six-month outcomes of retention in care and viral suppression. At enrollment, 45/136 (33%), 67/136 (49%), and 45/136 (33%) participants screened positive for depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. After six months of follow-up, 96/136 (71%) participants remained in care; 35/87 (40.2%) participants who remained in care had a level <50 copies/mL. Those with depression (49% vs. 77% retained; p < 0.01) and those with alcohol use disorder (52% vs. 76% retained; p < 0.01) were less likely to be retained in care. In multivariable logistic regression, depression OR 3.46 (95% CI: 1.33, 7.97; p < 0.01) and alcohol abuse OR 3.89 (95% CI: 1.70, 8.97; p < 0.01) were independently associated with loss from care. These results emphasize the importance of mental health on early ART outcomes and the HIV care continuum."
https://openalex.org/W2779031106,"Survival of cancer cells in the harsh tumor microenvironment, characterized by oxygen and glucose deprivation, requires rapid initiation of cytoprotective measures. Metabolites whose levels change during stress are ideal signaling cues, particularly if used in post-translational modifications of stress-responsive signal transducers. In cancer cells exposed to oxygen or glucose deprivation, there is an increase in cellular levels of acetate, a substrate for acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (Acss2) that also stimulates translocation of Acss2 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Nuclear, but not cytosolic, Acss2 promotes acetylation of the stress-responsive Hypoxia Inducible Factor 2α (HIF-2α) subunit by the acetyltransferase/coactivator Creb binding protein (Cbp), a process that facilitates stable Cbp/HIF-2α complex formation. In addition to promoting de novo transcription, Cbp and HIF-2α act in concert to regulate local histone 3 epigenetic marks. Exogenous acetate augments Acss2/HIF-2 dependent cancer growth and metastasis in cell culture and mouse models. Thus, an acetate switch in mammals links nutrient intake and stress signaling with tumor growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2953261526,"Seed dormancy is a complex adaptive trait that controls the timing of seed germination, one of the major fitness components in many plant species. Despite being highly heritable, seed dormancy is extremely plastic and influenced by a wide range of environmental cues. Here, using a set of 92 Arabidopsis thaliana lines from Sweden, we investigate the effect of seed maturation temperature on dormancy variation at the population level. The response to temperature differs dramatically between lines, demonstrating that genotype and the maternal environment interact in controlling the trait. By performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified several candidate genes that could presumably account for this plasticity, two of which are involved in the photoinduction of germination. Altogether, our results provide insight into both the molecular mechanisms and the evolution of dormancy plasticity, and can serve to improve our understanding of environmentally dependent life-history transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2777337959,"Oil supplementation in dairy cattle diets is used to modulate milk fat composition, as well as the expression of mammary lipogenic genes, whose regulation remains unclear. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA considered as crucial regulators of gene expression, offering clues to explain the mechanism underlying gene nutriregulation. The present study was designed to identify miRNAs whose expression in the cow mammary gland is modulated by sunflower oil supplementation. MiRNomes were obtained using RNAseq technology from the mammary gland of lactating cows receiving a low forage diet, supplemented or not with 4% sunflower oil. Among the 272 miRNAs characterized, eight were selected for RT-qPCR validations, showing the significant down-regulation of miR-142-5p and miR-20a-5p by sunflower supplementation. These two miRNAs are predicted to target genes whose expression was reported as differentially expressed by sunflower supplementation. Among their putative targets, ELOVL6 gene involved in lipid metabolism has been studied. However, a first analysis did not show its significant down-regulation, in response to the over-expression of miR-142-5p, of miR-20a-5p, or both, in a bovine mammary epithelial cell line. However, a clearer understanding of the miRNA expression by lipid supplementation would help to decipher the regulation of lactating cow mammary gland in response to nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2950210786,"Introduction Persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of PBB. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with PBB, with an additional directed sample obtained from PBB patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed among controls, in comparison with patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. Conclusion The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with PBB were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W2779618348,"Inflammation is a commonly observed immune reaction, and rheumatoid arthritis is a particularly severe inflammatory disease. In this study, we used an air pouch mouse model to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of Allium hookeri, which has both been used as a culinary material and a traditional medicine in south-eastern Asia for many years. Allium hookeri suppressed typical symptoms of inflammation, such as condensation of the air pouch membrane, and inhibited the expression of several inducible proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-α. In order to determine the molecules modulating the inflammatory effect of carrageenan treatment, the components in Allium hookeri were analyzed by GC-MS, and linoleic acid, which have anti-inflammatory effect, was detected. From the results, we concluded that the anti-inflammatory effect of Allium hookeri might be attributed to linoleic acid, which could be promising candidates for anti-inflammatory drugs that have no adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W2780574522,"Background In sub-Saharan Africa, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are endemic. Although there has been great progress in HIV care, universal HBV vaccination and care is lacking. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of HBV, HBV genotypes, and drug resistance mutations in dual infected cases in a cohort of HIV patients in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A total of 308 HIV-1 positive patients were enrolled into the study and tested for HBsAg in plasma. In HBsAg positive samples, HBV DNA was analyzed for HBV genotype using in-house nested PCR with HBV-specific pre-core / core or surface primers, and for HBV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in polymerase region. Odds ratio at 95% confidence interval was calculated. Results Of the 308 HIV-positive subjects, 62.7% were female, median age 38 years (range 18–68, IQR: 27–49), and the median CD4 count 405 cells/μl (IQR: 75–734). Overall, 94.2% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) frequently with combinations of Zidovudine (AZT)- Lamivudine (3TC)—Nevirapine (NVP). HBsAg was detected in 5.5% (95%CI 2.95–8.08%) of the study participants, of which the majority were infected with HBV genotype A (7A, 2E, 2D, 1C, 1 G). All HIV/HBV positive cases were on ART with anti-HBV activity (i.e., 3TC) and 3TC associated HBV DRMs (i.e., rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V) were detected in 7/13 (53.8%) subjects. Conclusion In this cross-sectional study of HIV-infected individuals, we found 5.5% HBV/HIV co-infected cases. Most were receiving the first generation anti-HBV therapy with a low genetic barrier to resistance, and several carried mutations associated with anti-HBV (3TC) drug resistance. These data underscore the importance of integrating HBV screening to the HIV treatment guidelines for better management and prevention of HBV-related liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2777427112,"Host diet influences the diversity and metabolic activities of the gut microbiome. Previous studies have shown that the gut microbiome provides a wide array of enzymes that enable processing of diverse dietary components. Because the primary diet of the porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum, is lignified plant material, we reasoned that the porcupine microbiome would be replete with enzymes required to degrade lignocellulose. Here, we report on the bacterial composition in the porcupine microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We extended this analysis to the microbiomes of 20 additional mammals located in Shubenacadie Wildlife Park (Nova Scotia, Canada), enabling the comparison of bacterial diversity amongst three mammalian taxonomic orders (Rodentia, Carnivora, and Artiodactyla). 16S rRNA sequencing was validated using metagenomic shotgun sequencing on selected herbivores (porcupine, beaver) and carnivores (coyote, Arctic wolf). In the microbiome, functionality is more conserved than bacterial composition, thus we mined microbiome data sets to identify conserved microbial functions across species in each order. We measured the relative gene abundances for cellobiose phosphorylase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase to evaluate the cellulose-degrading potential of select mammals. The porcupine and beaver had higher proportions of genes encoding cellulose-degrading enzymes than the Artic wolf and coyote. These findings provide further evidence that gut microbiome diversity and metabolic capacity are influenced by host diet."

Genome-wide analysis was undertaken using custom written scripts implemented in R software.High quality homoplastic single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in genes known to confer drug resistance as well as genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX secreted protein pathway, pks12, and close to toxin/anti-toxin pairs. Correlation of homoplastic variant sites identified that many were significantly correlated, suggestive of epistasis. Variation in genes coding for ESX secreted proteins also significantly disrupted phylogenetic structure. Mutations in ESX genes in key antigenic epitope positions were also found to disrupt tree topology.Variation in these genes have a biologically plausible effect on immunogenicity and virulence. This makes functional characterization warranted to determine the effects of these polymorphisms on bacterial fitness and transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2777921789,"Retinal prostheses that are currently used to restore vision in patients suffering from retinal degeneration are not adjusted to the changes occurring during the remodeling process of the retina. Recent studies revealed abnormal rhythmic activity in the retina of genetic mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa. Here we describe this abnormal activity also in a pharmacologically-induced (MNU) mouse model of retinal degeneration. To investigate how this abnormal activity affects the excitability of retinal ganglion cells, we recorded the electrical activity from whole mounted retinas of rd10 mice and MNU-treated mice using a microelectrode array system and applied biphasic current pulses of different amplitude and duration to stimulate ganglion cells electrically. We show that the electrical stimulation efficiency is strongly reduced in degenerated retinas, in particular when abnormal activity such as oscillations and rhythmic firing of bursts of action potentials can be observed. Using a prestimulus pulse sequence, we could abolish rhythmic retinal activity. Under these conditions, the stimulation efficiency was enhanced in a few cases but not in the majority of tested cells. Nevertheless, this approach supports the idea that modified stimulation protocols could help to improve the efficiency of retinal prostheses in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2779299351,"Gaining new insights into gene regulation involves an in-depth understanding of protein-protein interactions on chromatin. A powerful model for studying mechanisms of gene regulation is dosage compensation, a process that targets the X-chromosome to equalize gene expression between XY males and XX females. We previously identified a zinc finger protein in Drosophila melanogaster that plays a sex-specific role in targeting the Male-specific lethal (MSL) dosage compensation complex to the male X-chromosome, called the Chromatin-Linked Adapter for MSL Proteins (CLAMP). More recently, we established that CLAMP has non-sex-specific roles as an essential protein that regulates chromatin accessibility at promoters genome-wide. To identify associations between CLAMP and other factors in both male and female cells, we used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches. We demonstrate that CLAMP associates with the transcriptional regulator complex Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) in both sexes and determine that CLAMP reduces NELF recruitment to several target genes. In sum, we have identified many new CLAMP-associated factors and provide a resource for further study of this little understood essential protein."
https://openalex.org/W2778847239,"Few studies of the pig production efficiency are from the perspective of animal welfare. Therefore, this study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of pig welfare levels based on survey data from 773 pig farmers from 23 counties in the Chinese provinces of Hunan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Shanxi. This study used the Delphi method, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-Tobit regression model to analyze farmers' pig production efficiency and its influencing factors. This paper found that most farmers' pig production efficiency is low, and the DEA is invalid. Only 2.9% of pig farmers' who breed pigs are at the optimal level in terms of welfare, and their production efficiency is relatively high. In contrast, 49.34% of the farmers are at the medium welfare level, and compared with the farmers at the optimal welfare level, these farmers' pig production efficiency is low. Additionally, the farmers' age, gender, and number of years of experience with pig breeding have a significant effect. Furthermore, the scale of pig breeding and feeding type, the agriculture facilities for the central treatment of waste in local areas, and the availability of local agricultural science and technology personnel have a considerable influence on pig production efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2779869592,"Background Personal relative deprivation is a negative social comparison process typified by self-comparison, negative appraisal, and resultant negative emotionality. Personal relative deprivation has been associated with poorer physical and mental health in several domains. It has been hypothesized that the deprivation-health link operates through a stress pathway. Stress has been specifically implicated in the onset and maintenance of functional disorders, including fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Despite the theoretical links between personal deprivation, stress, and functional disorders, researchers have not assessed relationships between these variables. Methods We recruited community participants (n = 517; 54.9% female) to examine whether personal relative deprivation can account for variance in fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal symptoms beyond known demographic correlates of physical health. We also examined whether the relationships between personal relative deprivation and functional disorder symptoms are mediated by stress. Results Consistent with our hypotheses, personal relative deprivation accounted for symptom variance in fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal disorders beyond that accounted for by demographic variables alone. Further, self-reported stress was found to mediate relationships between personal relative deprivation and fibromyalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions The current results support biopsychosocial models of physical health and suggest that, for patients presenting with functional disorders symptoms, a combination of biological and psychosocial interventions may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2779459158,"Though the effects of imposed trunk posture on human walking have been studied, less is known about such locomotion while accommodating changes in ground level. For twelve able participants, we analyzed kinematic parameters mainly at touchdown and toe-off in walking across a 10-cm visible drop in ground level (level step, pre-perturbation step, step-down, step-up) with three postures (regular erect, ~30° and ~50° of trunk flexion from the vertical). Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs revealed step-specific effects of posture on the kinematic behavior of gait mostly at toe-off of the pre-perturbation step and the step-down as well as at touchdown of the step-up. In preparation to step-down, with increasing trunk flexion the discrepancy in hip−center of pressure distance, i.e. effective leg length, (shorter at toe-off versus touchdown), compared with level steps increased largely due to a greater knee flexion at toe-off. Participants rotated their trunk backwards during step-down (2- to 3-fold backwards rotation compared with level steps regardless of trunk posture) likely to control the angular momentum of their whole body. The more pronounced trunk backwards rotation in trunk-flexed walking contributed to the observed elevated center of mass (CoM) trajectories during the step-down which may have facilitated drop negotiation. Able-bodied individuals were found to recover almost all assessed kinematic parameters comprising the vertical position of the CoM, effective leg length and angle as well as hip, knee and ankle joint angles at the end of the step-up, suggesting an adaptive capacity and hence a robustness of human walking with respect to imposed trunk orientations. Our findings may provide clinicians with insight into a kinematic interaction between posture and locomotion in uneven ground. Moreover, a backward rotation of the trunk for negotiating step-down may be incorporated into exercise-based interventions to enhance gait stability in individuals who exhibit trunk-flexed postures during walking."
https://openalex.org/W2780468050,"Increasing access to extensively replicated and broadly distributed tree-ring collections has led to a greater use of these large data sets to investigate climate forcing on tree growth. However, the number of chronologies added to large accessible databases is declining and few are updated, while chronologies are often sparsely distributed and are more representative of marginal growing environments. On the other hand, National Forest Inventories (NFI), although poorly replicated at the plot level as compared to classic dendrochronological sampling, contain a large amount of tree-ring data with high spatial density designed to be spatially representative of the forest cover. We propose an a posteriori approach to validating tree-ring measurements and dating, selecting individual tree-ring width time series, and building average chronologies at various spatial scales based on an extensive collection of ring width measurements of nearly 94,000 black spruce trees distributed over a wide area and collected as part of the NFI in the province of Quebec, Canada. Our results show that reliable signals may be derived at various spatial scales (from 37 to 583,000 km2) from NFI increment core samples. Signals from independently built chronologies are spatially coherent with each other and well-correlated with independent reference chronologies built at the stand level. We thus conclude that tree-ring data from NFIs provide an extraordinary opportunity to strengthen the spatial and temporal coverage of tree-ring data and to improve coordination with other contemporary measurements of forest growth to provide a better understanding of tree growth-climate relationships over broad spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2778430046,"Background Understanding patterns of physical activity and sedentary time is important to effective population-wide primary prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. This study examined the patterns of objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary time, and the prevalence of compliance with physical activity guidelines according to different public health recommendations in a sub-population of health professional students in Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 102 health professional students (age = 19–34 years old, 43.1% women) of the University of Maiduguri, Nigeria. Participants wore Actigraph accelerometers on their waist for minimum of 5 days/week to objectively measure intensity and duration of physical activity and sedentary time. Prevalence and demographic patterns of physical activity and sedentary time were examined using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The students spent most time in sedentary activity (458.6 ± minutes/day, about 61% of daily time) and the least in vigorous-intensity activity (2.1 ± 4.4 minutes/day, about 0.3% of daily time). Sedentary time was higher among older than younger students (P<0.038) and among medical laboratory science students than physiotherapy and nursing students (P = 0.046). Total physical activity was higher among nursing and medical students than medical laboratory science students (P = 0.041). Although, 85.3% of the students engaged in 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, only 2.9% met the guideline of 75 minutes/week of vigorous intensity activity. Conclusions Prevalence of sedentary time was high while that of vigorous-intensity activity was very low among health professional students in Nigeria. Compliance with physical activity guidelines was mainly through accumulation of moderate intensity activity. The results suggest that age and academic programme may influence physical activity level and sedentary behaviour of health professional students in Nigeria. These findings provide preliminary evidence that could be used to inform the needs to develop interventions to improve and support active lifestyle behaviour among students in Nigerian universities."
https://openalex.org/W2778517784,"Efficient deconstruction of plant biomass is a major barrier to the development of viable lignocellulosic biofuels. Pretreatment with ionic liquids reduces lignocellulose recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis, increasing yields of sugars for conversion into biofuels. However, commercial cellulases are not compatible with many ionic liquids, necessitating extensive water washing of pretreated biomass prior to hydrolysis. To circumvent this issue, previous research has demonstrated that several thermophilic bacterial cellulases can efficiently deconstruct lignocellulose in the presence of the ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimadizolium acetate. As promising as these enzymes are, they would need to be produced at high titer in an industrial enzyme production host before they could be considered a viable alternative to current commercial cellulases. Aspergillus niger has been used to produce high titers of secreted enzymes in industry and therefore, we assessed the potential of this organism to be used as an expression host for these ionic liquid-tolerant cellulases. We demonstrated that 29 of these cellulases were expressed at detectable levels in a wild-type strain of A. niger, indicating a basic level of compatibility and potential to be produced at high levels in a host engineered to produce high titers of enzymes. We then profiled one of these enzymes in detail, the β-glucosidase A5IL97, and compared versions expressed in both A. niger and Escherichia coli. This comparison revealed the enzymatic activity of A5IL97 purified from E. coli and A. niger is equivalent, suggesting that A. niger could be an excellent enzyme production host for enzymes originally characterized in E. coli, facilitating the transition from the laboratory to industry."
https://openalex.org/W2779734728,"Resonance frequency analysis (RFA) is clinically used in dentistry to access the stiffness of dental implants in surrounding bone. However, the clear advantages and disadvantages of this method are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare implant stability quotient (ISQ) values obtained from RFA with parameters obtained from a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of the same region.Nineteen implants (Conelog) were inserted in the posterior maxillary and mandibular partially edentulous regions of 16 patients. At the time of implant placement, the ISQ values were obtained using RFA (Osstell). CBCT was used to measure the thickness of the crestal, cortical, buccolingual cortical, and cancellous bone at 3, 6, and 9 mm below the crestal bone level, as indicated by radiographic markers. The ratio of the thickness of the cortical to cancellous bone at varying depths was also calculated and classified into 4 groups (Group 1-4).There was a strong correlation between the crestal cortical bone thickness and ISQ values (P<0.001). The thickness of the buccolingual cortical bone and ratio of the cortical to cancellous bone thickness at 3 mm were significantly related to the ISQ (P = 0.018 and P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, the ISQs in Group 1 were the highest compared with those in Group 2 and Group 3, whereas the CBCT parameters at 6 and 9 mm did not have any specific correlation with the ISQ values.This study showed that the ISQ values obtained from RFA highly correlated with the quantity and quality of bone 3 mm below the crestal bone level. The correlation between the ISQ and bone surrounding the implant site was dependent on the depth of measurement. Therefore, RFA can help to predict the marginal bone level, as confirmed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2779783470,"The Sultanate of Oman has a complex mosaic of livestock species and production systems, but the genetic diversity, demographic history or origins of these Omani animals has not been expensively studied. Goats might constitute one of the most abundant and important domestic livestock species since the Neolithic transition. Here, we examined the genetic diversity, origin, population structure and demographic history of Omani goats. Specifically, we analyzed a 525-bp fragment of the first hypervariable region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from 69 Omani individuals and compared this fragment with 17 mtDNA sequences from Somalia and Yemen as well as 18 wild goat species and 1,198 previously published goat sequences from neighboring countries. The studied goat breeds show substantial diversity. The haplotype and nucleotide diversities of Omani goats were found equal to 0.983 ± 0.006 and 0.0284 ± 0.014, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses allowed us to classify Omani goats into three mtDNA haplogroups (A, B and G): haplogroup A was found to be predominant and widely distributed and accounted for 80% of all samples, and haplogroups B and G exhibited low frequencies. Phylogenetic comparisons with wild goats revealed that five of the native Omani goat populations originate from Capra aegagrus. Furthermore, most comparisons of pairwise population FST values within and between these five Omani goat breeds as well as between Omani goats and nine populations from nearby countries were not significant. These results suggest strong gene flow among goat populations caused by the extensive transport of goats and the frequent movements of human populations in ancient Arabia. The findings improve our understanding of the migration routes of modern goats from their region of domestication into southeastern Arabia and thereby shed light on human migratory and commercial networks during historical times."
https://openalex.org/W2779839640,"Plants growing in high-mountain environments may share common morphological features through convergent evolution resulting from an adaptative response to similar ecological conditions. The Carex flava species complex (sect. Ceratocystis, Cyperaceae) includes four dwarf morphotypes from Circum-Mediterranean mountains whose taxonomic status has remained obscure due to their apparent morphological resemblance. In this study we investigate whether these dwarf mountain morphotypes result from convergent evolution or common ancestry, and whether there are ecological differences promoting differentiation between the dwarf morphotypes and their taxonomically related large, well-developed counterparts. We used phylogenetic analyses of nrDNA (ITS) and ptDNA (rps16 and 5’trnK) sequences, ancestral state reconstruction, multivariate analyses of macro- and micromorphological data, and species distribution modeling. Dwarf morphotype populations were found to belong to three different genetic lineages, and several morphotype shifts from well-developed to dwarf were suggested by ancestral state reconstructions. Distribution modeling supported differences in climatic niche at regional scale between the large forms, mainly from lowland, and the dwarf mountain morphotypes. Our results suggest that dwarf mountain morphotypes within this sedge group are small forms of different lineages that have recurrently adapted to mountain habitats through convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2777524769,"Intensive selection for milk production has led to reduced reproductive efficiency in high-producing dairy cattle. The impact of intensive milk production on oocyte quality as well as early embryo development has been established but few analyses have addressed this question at the initiation of implantation, a critical milestone ensuring a successful pregnancy and normal post-natal development. Our study aimed to determine if contrasted maternal metabolism affects the previously described sensory properties of the endometrium to the conceptus in cattle. Following embryo transfer at Day 7 post-oestrus, endometrial caruncular (CAR) and intercaruncular (ICAR) areas were collected at Day 19 from primiparous postpartum Holstein-Friesian cows that were dried-off immediately after parturition (i.e., never milked; DRY) or milked twice daily (LACT). Gene quantification indicated no significant impact of lactation on endometrial expression of transcripts previously reported as conceptus-regulated (PLET1, PTGS2, SOCS6) and interferon-tau stimulated (RSAD2, SOCS1, SOCS3, STAT1) factors or known as female hormone-regulated genes (FOXL2, SCARA5, PTGS2). Compared with LACT cows, DRY cows exhibited mRNA levels with increased expression for FOXL2 transcription factor and decreased expression for oxidative stress-related genes (CAT, SOD1, SOD2). In vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted that neither interferon-tau nor FOXL2 were involved in transcriptional regulation of CAT, SOD1 and SOD2. In addition, our data showed that variations in maternal metabolism had a higher impact on gene expression in ICAR areas. Collectively, our findings prompt the need to fully understand the extent to which modifications in endometrial physiology drive the trajectory of conceptus development from implantation onwards when maternal metabolism is altered."
https://openalex.org/W2778573921,"Background Airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) is an important defense mechanism against pulmonary infections and is compromised in cystic fibrosis (CF). Cl- and HCO3- epithelial transport are integral to MCC. During pulmonary infections prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production is abundant. Aim To determine the effect of PGE2 on airway Cl- and HCO3- secretion and MCC in normal and CF airways. Methods We examined PGE2 stimulated MCC, Cl- and HCO3- secretion using ferret trachea, human bronchial epithelial cell cultures (CFBE41o- with wildtype CFTR (CFBE41 WT) or homozygous F508del CFTR (CFBE41 CF) and human normal bronchial submucosal gland cell line (Calu-3) in Ussing chambers with or without pH-stat. Results PGE2 stimulated MCC in a dose-dependent manner and was partially impaired by CFTRinh-172. PGE2-stimulated Cl- current in ferret trachea was partially inhibited by CFTRinh-172, with niflumic acid eliminating the residual current. CFBE41 WT cell monolayers produced a robust Cl- and HCO3- secretory response to PGE2, both of which were completely inhibited by CFTRinh-172. CFBE41 CF cells exhibited no response to PGE2. In Calu-3 cells, PGE2 stimulated Cl- and HCO3- secretion. Cl- secretion was partially inhibited by CFTRinh-172, with additional inhibition by niflumic acid. HCO3- secretion was completely inhibited by CFTRinh-172. Conclusions PGE2 stimulates bronchotracheal MCC and this response is decreased in CF. In CF airway, PGE2-stimulated Cl- and HCO3- conductance is impaired and may contribute to decreased MCC. There remains a CFTR-independent Cl- current in submucosal glands, which if exploited, could represent a means of improving airway Cl- secretion and MCC in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2779649691,"Background This costing study in Malawi is a first evaluation of a Maternal Influenza Immunization Program Costing Tool (Costing Tool) for maternal immunization. The tool was designed to help low- and middle-income countries plan for maternal influenza immunization programs that differ from infant vaccination programs because of differences in the target population and potential differences in delivery strategy or venue. Methods This analysis examines the incremental costs of a prospective seasonal maternal influenza immunization program that is added to a successful routine childhood immunization and antenatal care program. The Costing Tool estimates financial and economic costs for different vaccine delivery scenarios for each of the major components of the expanded immunization program. Results In our base scenario, which specifies a donated single dose pre-filled vaccine formulation, the total financial cost of a program that would reach 2.3 million women is approximately $1.2 million over five years. The economic cost of the program, including the donated vaccine, is $10.4 million over the same period. The financial and economic costs per immunized pregnancy are $0.52 and $4.58, respectively. Other scenarios examine lower vaccine uptake, reaching 1.2 million women, and a vaccine purchased at $2.80 per dose with an alternative presentation. Conclusion This study estimates the financial and economic costs associated with a prospective maternal influenza immunization program in a low-income country. In some scenarios, the incremental delivery cost of a maternal influenza immunization program may be as low as some estimates of childhood vaccination programs, assuming the routine childhood immunization and antenatal care systems are capable of serving as the platform for an additional vaccination program. However, purchasing influenza vaccines at the prices assumed in this analysis, instead of having them donated, is likely to be challenging for lower-income countries. This result should be considered as a starting point to understanding the costs of maternal immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries."

The mechanisms directing myocardial cells to specific sub-lineages remain poorly understood. Here we report that overexpression of TGFβ-Activated Kinase (TAK1/Map3k7) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells faithfully directs myocardial differentiation of embryoid body (EB)-derived cardiac cells toward the sinoatrial node (SAN) lineage. Most cardiac cells in Map3k7-overexpressing EBs adopt markers, cellular morphologies, and electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of the SAN. These data, in addition to the fact that Map3k7 is upregulated in the sinus venous—the source of cells for the SAN—suggest that Map3k7 may be an endogenous regulator of the SAN fate."

FLG encodes a large protein called profilaggrin, which plays a key role in maintaining an effective skin barrier against the environment. In this study, we identified FLG single nucleotide variations (FLG-SNVs) and evaluated the association of FLG-SNVs with clinical phenotypes including atopic dermatitis (AD)-associated minor clinical features, presence of specific allergic sensitization, and serum parameters.


Methods 
Eighty-one Korean patients with AD were enrolled. AD-associated minor clinical features as well as allergic rhinitis and asthma were diagnosed by specialists. FLG-SNVs were identified by Sanger sequencing of entire exons through long-range PCR. Allergic sensitization to a specific allergen was evaluated by multiple allergen simultaneous test. Serologic parameters such as serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) were measured.


Results 
A total of seventy-three SNVs and 4 LOF mutations were successfully genotyped. rs71626704 and rs76413899 were significantly associated with a history of asthma and cheilitis (P = 0.002 and P = 0.033, respectively), however, the associations were not found statistically significant after adjustment by multiple comparisons. In addition, we detected haplotype blocks which were correlated with non-specific hand or foot dermatitis and scalp scale. We identified FLG-SNVs which were associated with sensitization to environmental allergens; rs62623409 and rs71625199 (P = 0.038 and P = 0.008, respectively). Patients with FLG P478S TT and history of allergic rhinitis showed a higher EDN level, and among those patients, the ones with asthma showed a higher ECP level.


Conclusion 
This study revealed the association of FLG-SNVs with AD-associated minor clinical features. We firstly identified rs71625199 which was associated with higher environmental allergic sensitization. We also suggest that FLG P478S is a kind of disease modifier which affects serologic parameters such as EDN and ECP."
https://openalex.org/W2781353107,"The ability of soluble C. albicans 20A (serotype A) mannoprotein (CMP) to serve as a ligand for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptors was examined using commercially available and stably-transfected HEK293 cells that express human TLR4, MD2 and CD14, but not MR. These TLR4 reporter cells also express an NF-κB-dependent, secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene. TLR4-reporter cells exhibited a dose-dependent SEAP response to both LPS and CMP, wherein peak activation was achieved after stimulation with 40–50 μg/mL of CMP. Incubation on polymyxin B resin had no effect on CMP’s ligand activity, but neutralized LPS-spiked controls. HEK293 Null cells lacking TLR4 and possessing the same SEAP reporter failed to respond to LPS or CMP, but produced SEAP when activated with TNFα. Reporter cell NF-κB responses were accompanied by transcription of IL-8, TNFα, and COX-2 genes. Celecoxib inhibited LPS-, CMP-, and TNFα-dependent NF-κB responses; whereas, indomethacin had limited effect on LPS and CMP responses. SEAP production in response to C. albicans A9 mnn4Δ mutant CMP, lacking phosphomannosylations on N-linked glycans, was significantly greater (p ≤ 0.005) than SEAP responses to CMP derived from parental A9 (both serotype B). These data confirm that engineered human cells expressing TLR4, MD2 and CD14 can respond to CMP with NF-κB activation and the response can be influenced by variations in CMP-mannosylation. Future characterizations of CMPs from other sources and their application in this model may provide further insight into variations observed with TLR4 dependent innate immune responses targeting different C. albicans strains."
https://openalex.org/W2776066233,"Molecular genetic tools provide a method for improving the breeding selection of chickens (Gallus gallus). Although some studies have identified genes affecting egg quality, little is known about the genes responsible for oviduct development. To address this issue, here we used a genome-wide association (GWA) study to detect genes or genomic regions that are related to oviduct development in a chicken F2 resource population by employing high-density 600 K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. For oviduct length and weight, which exhibited moderate heritability estimates of 0.35 and 0.39, respectively, chromosome 1 (GGA1) explained 9.45% of the genetic variance, while GGA4 to GGA8 and GGA11 explained over 1% of the variance. Independent univariate genome-wide screens for oviduct length and weight detected 69 significant SNPs on GGA1 and 49 suggestive SNPs on GGA1, GGA4, and GGA8. One hundred and fourteen suggestive SNPs were associated with oviduct length, while 73 SNPs were associated with oviduct weight. The significant genomic regions affecting oviduct weight ranged from 167.79-174.29 Mb on GGA1, 73.16-75.70 Mb on GGA4, and 4.88-4.92 Mb on GGA8. The genes CKAP2, CCKAR, NCAPG, IGFBP3, and GORAB were shown to have potential roles in oviduct development. These genes are involved in cell survival, appetite, and growth control. Our results represent the first GWA analysis of genes controlling oviduct weight and length. The identification of genomic loci and potential candidate genes affecting oviduct development greatly increase our understanding of the genetic basis underlying oviduct development, which could have an impact on the selection of egg quality."
https://openalex.org/W2777899495,"The combination of defined factors with small molecules targeting epigenetic factors is a strategy that has been shown to enhance optimal derivation of iPSCs and could be used for disease modelling, high throughput screenings and/or regenerative medicine applications. In this study, we showed that a new first-in-class reversible dual G9a/DNMT1 inhibitor compound (CM272) improves the efficiency of human cell reprogramming and iPSC generation from primary cells of healthy donors and patient samples, using both integrative and non-integrative methods. Moreover, CM272 facilitates the generation of human iPSC with only two factors allowing the removal of the most potent oncogenic factor cMYC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mechanistically, treatment with CM272 induces heterochromatin relaxation, facilitates the engagement of OCT4 and SOX2 transcription factors to OSKM refractory binding regions that are required for iPSC establishment, and enhances mesenchymal to epithelial transition during the early phase of cell reprogramming. Thus, the use of this new G9a/DNMT reversible dual inhibitor compound may represent an interesting alternative for improving cell reprogramming and human iPSC derivation for many different applications while providing interesting insights into reprogramming mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2780078814,"Arabidopsis plastidic HSP90C is an HSP90 family molecular chaperone that is required for chloroplast development and function. To understand the mechanism of action of HSP90C within the chloroplast, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening and revealed it interacts directly with the photosystem II extrinsic protein PsbO1, which performs a canonical function in the thylakoid lumen. To understand the biological significance of HSP90C-PsbO1 interaction, we investigated the role of HSP90C in modulating the stromal and thylakoid distribution of PsbO1GFP fusion protein. Fusion to GFP significantly delays the PsbO1 thylakoid transport and induces a variegation phenotype. Overexpression of HSP90C promotes the thylakoid distribution of PsbO1GFP and alleviates the leaf variegation. By tracking the chloroplast maturation during photomorphogenesis, we observed PsbO1GFP tends to form distinct fluorescent clusters within the stroma with delayed thylakoid membrane biogenesis, while HSP90C overexpression corrects these adverse effects. We also demonstrated that active HSP90C function is specifically required for stable accumulation of mature PsbO1GFP in thylakoid by using specific inhibitor geldanamycin. This study therefore not only identified novel HSP90C interactors, but also reports for the first time that PsbO1 enroute from the cytoplasm to thylakoid lumen is tightly regulated by the HSP90C chaperone complex in plastid stroma; whereas the proper HSP90C homeostasis is also critical for chloroplast maturation and function."

The pentacyano(isoniazid)ferrate(II) compound, named IQG-607, inhibits the enzyme 2-trans-enoyl-ACP(CoA) reductase from M. tuberculosis, a key component in the FASII system. Here, we aimed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of IQG-607 against promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis isolated from patients with different clinical forms of L. braziliensis infection, including cutaneous, mucosal and disseminated leishmaniasis. Importantly, IQG-607 inhibited the proliferation of three different isolates of L. braziliensis promastigotes associated with cutaneous, mucosal and disseminated leishmaniasis. The IC50 values for IQG-607 ranged from 32 to 75 μM, for these forms. Additionally, IQG-607 treatment decreased the proliferation of intracellular amastigotes in infected macrophages, after an analysis of the percentage of infected cells and the number of intracellular parasites/100 cells. IQG-607 reduced from 58% to 98% the proliferation of L. braziliensis from cutaneous, mucosal and disseminated strains. Moreover, IQG-607 was also evaluated regarding its potential toxic profile, by using different cell lines. Cell viability of the lineages Vero, HaCat and HepG2 was significantly reduced after incubation with concentrations of IQG-607 higher than 2 mM. Importantly, IQG-607, in a concentration of 1 mM, did not induce DNA damage in HepG2 cells, when compared to the untreated control group.

We propose these differences may alter some attributes of nanoparticles fabricated with OsrHSA, as studies have associated greater quantities of aggregates with increased nanoparticle diameters. To determine if this is the case, nanoparticles were fabricated with OsrHSA from various suppliers using ethanol desolvation and subsequent glutaraldehyde cross-linking. All nanoparticles fabricated with OsrHSA showed larger diameters of approximately 20 to 90nm than particles fabricated with either defatted bovine serum albumin (DF-BSA) (100.9 ± 2.8nm) or human plasma albumin (pHSA) (112.0 ± 4.0nm). It was hypothesized that the larger nanoparticle diameters were due to the presence of bound fatty acids and this was confirmed through defatting OsrHSA prior to particle fabrication which yielded particles with diameters similar to those fabricated with pHSA. For additional conformation, DF-BSA was incubated with dodecanoic acid prior to desolvation yielding particles with significantly larger diameters. Further studies showed the increased nanoparticle diameters were due to the bound fatty acids modulating electrostatic interactions between albumin nanoparticles during the desolvation and not changes in protein structure, stability or generation of additional albumin oligomers. Finally the presence of dodecanoic acid was shown to improve doxorubicin loading efficiency onto preformed albumin nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2776928563,"Among the genes that are up-regulated in response to a reaching training in rats, Tachykinin 1 (Tac1)-a gene that encodes the neuropeptide Substance P (Sub P)-shows an especially strong expression. Using Real-Time RT-PCR, a detailed time-course of Tac1 expression could be defined: a significant peak occurs 7 hours after training ended at the first and second training session, whereas no up-regulation could be detected at a later time-point (sixth training session). To assess the physiological role of Sub P during movement acquisition, microinjections into the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the trained paw were performed. When Sub P was injected before the first three sessions of a reaching training, effectiveness of motor learning became significantly increased. Injections at a time-point when rats already knew the task (i.e. training session ten and eleven) had no effect on reaching performance. Sub P injections did not influence the improvement of performance within a single training session, but retention of performance between sessions became strengthened at a very early stage (i.e. between baseline-training and first training session). Thus, Sub P facilitates motor learning in the very early phase of skill acquisition by supporting memory consolidation. In line with these findings, learning related expression of the precursor Tac1 occurs at early but not at later time-points during reaching training."

Recent molecular studies on population genetics and phylogeography have contributed to reveal which factors influenced the diversity within this group. This study aimed at examining the genetic diversity of Simulium hirtipupa Lutz, 1910 in populations from the biomes Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest. In this study, we carried out phylogeographic and population genetic analyses using a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI. The 19 populations studied were clustered into seven groups, most of which are associated with geography indicating certain genetic structure. The northern region of the state of Minas Gerais is most likely the center of origin of this species. The average intergroup genetic distance was 3.7%, indicating the presence of cryptic species. The species tree as well as the haplotype network recovered all groups forming two major groups: the first comprises groups Gr-Bahia (in which the São Francisco river has not acted as geographical barrier), Gr-Pernambuco, and Gr-Mato Grosso do Sul. The second included groups comprising populations of the states of Goiás, Tocantins, Minas Gerais, Bahia, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo. The mismatch distribution for groups was consistent with the model of demographic expansion, except for the Gr-Central-East_1 group. The diversification in this group occurred about 1.19 Mya during the Pleistocene, influenced by paleoclimatic oscillations during the Quaternary glacial cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2779414075,"The skin tuberculin test (TST), an example of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, is based on measuring the extent of skin induration to mycobacterial tuberculin (PPD). Little is known about the genetic basis of TST reactivity, widely used for diagnosing TB infection. The study investigated the relationship of the single base change polymorphic variants in CD14 gene (CD14(-159C/T)) with the development of DTH to PPD in BCG-vaccinated Polish Caucasian individuals. We found persistent lack of TST reactivity in about 40% of healthy subjects despite receiving more than one dose of BCG. The TST size was negatively correlated with the number of BCG inoculations. The distribution of C/T genotype was significantly more frequent among TST-negative compared with TST-positive individuals. The concentration of serum sCD14 was positively associated with mCD14 expression, but not with the TST status or CD14(-159C/T) polymorphism. A significant increase in mCD14 expression and serum sCD14 levels was found in TB group. We hypothesize that CD14(-159C/T) polymorphic variants might be one of genetic components in the response to attenuated M. bovis BCG bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W2777603218,"Classification models built on biological expression data are increasingly used to predict distinct disease subtypes. Selected features that separate sample groups can be the candidates of biomarkers, helping us to discover biological functions/pathways. However, three challenges are associated with building a robust classification and feature selection model: 1) the number of significant biomarkers is much smaller than that of measured features for which the search will be exhaustive; 2) current biological expression data are big in both sample size and feature size which will worsen the scalability of any search algorithms; and 3) expression profiles of certain features are typically highly correlated which may prevent to distinguish the predominant features. Unfortunately, most of the existing algorithms are partially addressing part of these challenges but not as a whole. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to address the above challenges. The classification and feature selection problem is first formulated as a nonconvex optimisation problem. Then the problem is relaxed and solved iteratively by a sequence of convex optimisation procedures which can be distributed computed and therefore allows the efficient implementation on advanced infrastructures. To illustrate the competence of our method over others, we first analyse a randomly generated simulation dataset under various conditions. We then analyse a real gene expression dataset on embryonal tumour. Further downstream analysis, such as functional annotation and pathway analysis, are performed on the selected features which elucidate several biological findings."
https://openalex.org/W2780877318,"There are two types of dermal skeletons in jawed vertebrates: placoderms and osteichthyans carry large bony plates (macromery), whereas chondrichthyans and acanthodians are covered by small scales (micromery). Fin spines are one of the last large dermal structures found on micromeric taxa and offer a potential source of histology and morphology that can be compared to those found on macromeric groups. Dermal fin spines offer a variety of morphology but aspects of their growth modes and homology are unclear. Here, we provide detailed descriptions of the microstructure and growth of a dorsal ridge spine from the acanthothoracid placoderm, Romundina stellina, using virtual three-dimensional paleohistological datasets. From these data we identify several layers of dentine ornamentation covering the lateral surfaces of the spine and reconstructed their growth pattern. We show that this spine likely grew posteriorly and proximally from a narrow portion of bone located along the leading edge of the spine. The spine is similarly constructed to the scales with a few exceptions, including the absence of polarized fibers distributed throughout the bone and the presence of a thin layer of perichondral bone. The composition of the spine (semidentine odontodes, dermal bone, perichondral bone) is identical to that of the Romundina dermal plates. These results illustrate the similarities and differences between the dermal tissues in Romundina and indicate that the spine grew differently from the dentinous fin spines from extant and fossil chondrichthyans. The morphology and histology of Romundina is most similar to the fin spine of the probable stem osteichthyan Lophosteus, with a well-developed inner cellular bony base and star-shaped odontodes on the surface. Results from these studies will undoubtedly have impact on our understanding of fossil fin spine histology and evolution, contributing to the on-going revision of early gnathostome phylogeny."
