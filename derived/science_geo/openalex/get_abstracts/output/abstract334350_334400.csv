https://openalex.org/W2083778516,"A method is described which permits measurement of sap pressure in the xylem of vascular plants. As long predicted, sap pressures during transpiration are normally negative, ranging from -4 or -5 atmospheres in a damp forest to -80 atmospheres in the desert. Mangroves and other halophytes maintain at all times a sap pressure of -35 to -60 atmospheres. Mistletoes have greater suction than their hosts, usually by 10 to 20 atmospheres. Diurnal cycles of 10 to 20 atmospheres are common. In tall conifers there is a hydrostatic pressure gradient that closely corresponds to the height and seems surprisingly little influenced by the intensity of transpiration. Sap extruded from the xylem by gas pressure on the leaves is practically pure water. At zero turgor this procedure gives a linear relation between the intracellular concentration and the tension of the xylem."
https://openalex.org/W2061145465,The solar neutrino problem is discussed and the Brookhaven Experiment reviewed. Speculations about the nature of the solar interior are examined. An experiment using the capture of neutrinos by $sup 7$Li to form $sup 7$Be is proposed to resolve the solar neutrino question. 24 refs. (BJG)

The living mat contains substantial amounts of the unsaturated acids, while the underlying layers become progressively depleted in unsaturated molecules. A similar progressive increase in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated acids was detected in a sediment core from a hypersaline lagoon."
https://openalex.org/W1984975116,"Three isomeric C(19) monoolefins with the carbon skeleton of pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) have been isolated from mixed zooplankton of the Gulf of Maine and from liver oils of various marine fishes and mammals. The structures have been elucidated. Zamene (norphytene), the terminal olefin, is a minor component of the mixture. The usage of the older trivial name ""zamene"" should be restricted to the total mixture of marine C(19) monoolefins with the pristane skeleton. Conventional chemical nomenclature should be used for individual isomers."

https://openalex.org/W2104831521,"A small amount of southern bean mosaic virus was contained in a narrow zone after density-gradient centrifugation, but in a much wider zone after centrifugation with a large amount of a second virus. Zone-spreading of a major component by non-ideal sedimentation in density-gradient centrifugation can cause zone spreading of a minor component that the major component overlaps."
https://openalex.org/W2050578717,"Preliminary aerial photographic studies indicate that the Alaskan earthquake produced some rockfalls but no significant snow and ice avalanches on glaciers. No rapid, short-lived glacier advances (surges) are conclusively associated with this earthquake. Recent evidence fails to support the earthquake-advance theory of Tarr and Martin."
https://openalex.org/W2025750876,"Photography of fainter surface brightnesses than heretofore detected shows a very unusual feature in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M81. If this faint feature is synchrotron radiation from electrons exploded by the neighboring galaxy, M82, then the existence of an overall magnetic field in M81 can be established and calculated at a few microgauss. Other properties of M81 and its companion are implied and can be derived from further observation."
https://openalex.org/W2027577219,"Recently released radiocarbon dates for split-twig figurines from Marble Canyon, Arizona, are 4095 ± 100 years ago; they substantiate previously determined dates of 3530 ± 300 and 3100 ± 110 years ago. A recently excavated site in Walnut Canyon, Arizona, extends the geographical range of the figurines. The dates of samples from this site are 3500 ± 100 and 3880 ± 90 years ago. It is hypothesized that the figurines were magicoreligious artifacts related to the Pinto complex of the Desert Culture."
https://openalex.org/W2029475809,"Reviewing the floral relations of North and South America as illustrated in the foregoing instances, we may say that the phenomena of distribution agree fairly with the record of physical conditions which have succeeded each other and those which still exist, and upon which we might almost a priori have predicted an analogous set of distribution phenomena. In this relationship we may distinguish three categories of distribution: (1) Those due to the conditions of human civilization, commerce, etc. This has resulted in placing the same species in similar regions of both continents, as, for example, Fagonia cretica in Lower California and Chile; Munroa squarrosa, western plains of North America, plains of Argentine and high plateaus of Chile and Bolivia; Frankenia grandiflora, Southern California and Arizona, coast lands of Chile; Oxytheca dendroidea, Lastarricea chilensis, and Chorizanthe comrnmissuralis, all in Southern California and Western Chile. (2) Those due to the operation of natural causes acting unde present conditions of climate, geology, etc. Under this head may be cited such species as sida leprosa, hastata, anomala, Cienfugosia sulphurea, Spergulariaplattensis and, in general, elements of Gulf zone distribution; also certain elements which still find a pathway along the continental axis, including some alpine and mountain xerophilous genera. (3) The third category of distribution would include those phenomena due to geological and climatic changes acting through long periods. Under this head are included the elements of greatest significance in the relationsip of the North and South America floras. The endemic boreal flora of the Andes, the equally endemic boreal flora of the Mexican Cordilleras, and genera with sharply distinct species or sub-genera in the arid extra-tropical regions of both continents, which may be called remnant elements."

https://openalex.org/W2074830067,An unusual example of convection was recently seen above large elm trees shortly after sunset. The condensation of transpirational moisture in air that was cooler than that within the tree crowns is believed to account for the readily visible convective motion above the trees.

https://openalex.org/W1976762284,"Extinction effects of the volcanic dust injected into the stratosphere by the violent eruption of Mount Agung, Bali, 17 March 1963, were studied. Visual extinction coefficients were measured photoelectrically for 153 nights during the period from March 1963 to September 1964. The data indicate that the dust is now widely dispersed and that its effects may persist for several more years. A study of the wavelength dependence of the extinction shows that the dust is a neutral scattering agent. The total global amount of airborne volcanic material is crudely estimated at 10(12) grams as of September 1964."
https://openalex.org/W2068471171,"The last 10 years have seen a revolutionary change in the way weather forecasts are made. The basis for today's forecasts is a numerical calculation of the evolution of the energy distribution and motions in a physical model of the atmosphere. The benefits of this change have affected all types of weather forecasting. The substantial benefits to aviation are well established. The benefits to forecasts for the general public can't be conclusively documented but are strongly suggested. Our present limitations are mainly due to insufficient completeness of our atmospheric models. The removal of some of these deficiencies appears to be a relatively straightforward task. Other problems, particularly those of phase change of water, are more difficult. The eventual limitation to the prediction of atmospheric motions appears to be the supply of data describing the initial conditions, but I can safely say that solution of the other problems will require more than just a few years."
