However, here we demonstrate that mmLDL (as well as OxLDL) induces actin polymerization and spreading of macrophages, which results in such pro-atherogenic consequences as inhibition of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells but enhancement of OxLDL uptake. We also demonstrate for the first time that the lipopolysaccharide receptor, CD14, and toll-like receptor-4/MD-2 are involved in these mmLDL effects. Macrophages of the J774 cell line exhibited higher mmLDL binding and F-actin response than its CD14-deficient mutant, LR-9 cells. Similarly, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human CD14 specifically bound mmLDL and responded with higher F-actin compared with control cells. Macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice, which have a point mutation in the Tlr4 gene, responded with lower F-actin to mmLDL and did not spread as well as macrophages from control animals. A significantly higher F-actin response was also observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human toll-like receptor-4/MD-2 but not with TLR4 alone or TLR2. Thus, in addition to inhibition of phagocytosis, the recognition of mmLDL by macrophage lipopolysaccharide receptors results in convergence of cellular immune responses to products of microorganisms and to oxidation-specific self-antigens, which could both influence macrophage function and atherogenesis.

These properties differentiate mmLDL from profoundly oxidized LDL (OxLDL), which is not recognized by the LDL receptor but has enhanced uptake by macrophage scavenger receptors, such as CD36 and SR-BI (2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). However, mmLDL possesses many pro-atherogenic properties; for example, it induces monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, production of colony stimulating factors, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tissue factor (1Berliner J.A.

Quehenberger O., De Nigris F. Abete P. Glass C.K. Palinski W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, a large number of apoptotic cells accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions (6Martinet W. Kockx M.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), despite the presence of many professional phagocytes-macrophages. Phagocytosis of dying cells is crucial for preventing the release of toxic cellular compounds and consequent inflammation. Inhibition of efficient phagocytosis leads to the accumulation of proinflammatory necrotic debris (such as oxidized lipids), plaque instability, and thrombogenesis (7Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: J3-J6Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed that in mouse peritoneal macrophages phagocytosing apoptotic cells, actin polymerization (which is necessary for filopodia formation) depends on the activity of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), which translocates from the cytosol to the cell membrane at sites where apoptotic cells are bound (8Miller Y.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19431-19439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). mmLDL carry hydroperoxides and hydroxides of fatty acids and phospholipids, similar to those produced by 12/15-LO catalysis (9Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thereby could also influence actin polymerization in a manner similar to that of 12/15-LO. Because mmLDL does not bind to scavenger receptors, there are presumably other receptors that mediate mmLDL effects. In two recent reports, high expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), and especially of TLR4, has been demonstrated in macrophages in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions (11Xu X.H. Shah P.K. Faure E. Equils O. Thomas L. Fishbein M.C. Luthringer D., Xu, X.P. Rajavashisth T.B. Yano J. Kaul S. Arditi M.

Circulation. 2002; 105: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Bruneck (Italy) Study has identified that the D299G TLR4 polymorphism that attenuates receptor signaling is associated with a decreased risk of atherosclerosis (13Kiechl S. Lorenz E. Reindl M. Wiedermann C.J. Oberhollenzer F. Bonora E. Willeit J. Schwartz D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). TLR4 is a receptor playing an essential role in innate immunity (14Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). It is also remarkable that the C(−260)T polymorphism in the CD14 promoter, resulting in a significantly higher density of CD14 on monocytes, has been identified as a risk factor for myocardial infarction (15Hubacek J.A. Rothe G. Pit'ha J. Skodova Z. Stanek V. Poledne R. Schmitz G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3218-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In another study, a higher density of CD14 was found on monocytes from diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease as compared with nondiabetic patients (16Patino R. Ibarra J. Rodriguez A. Yague M.R. Pintor E. Fernandez-Cruz A. Figueredo A. Am. J. Cardiol. 2000; 85: 1288-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CD14 does not have its own signaling domain. Thus, upon LPS binding (assisted by LPS-binding protein (LBP)), CD14 associates with TLR4 and triggers TLR4-dependent signaling pathways (17Jiang Q. Akashi S. Miyake K. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3541-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The TLR4 accessory protein, MD-2, is also capable of binding LPS, and the TLR4/MD-2 complex can serve as an independent LPS receptor (18Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report that mmLDL specifically binds to macrophage CD14 and via TLR4/MD-2 activates signaling pathways leading to actin polymerization and cell spreading. Moreover, in macrophages exposed to mmLDL, there is a subsequent inhibition of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (an actin-dependent process) but, in contrast, an enhancement of OxLDL uptake (an actin-independent pathway). These findings provide a new link between oxidized lipoproteins and macrophage receptors of innate immunity recognizing components of microbial infection and also could explain in part aspects of macrophage dysfunction that lead to the enhanced accumulation of apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Resident peritoneal macrophages were harvested without stimulation from 8–10-week-old female mice of C57BL/6 (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), C3H/HeJ, or C3H/HeOuJ (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) strains. Murine macrophage-like cell lines J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). An LPS-resistant mutant of J774, LR-9, developed by M. Nishijima, T. Nishihara, and colleagues (19Nishijima M. Hara-Kuge S. Takasuka N. Akagawa K. Setouchi M. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Akamatsu Y. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was obtained from R. Schlegel (Penn State University). These cells have been shown to have a decreased surface expression of CD14 (19Nishijima M. Hara-Kuge S. Takasuka N. Akagawa K. Setouchi M. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Akamatsu Y. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies in our lab with an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) confirmed significantly decreased CD14 expression on the surface of LR-9 cells as compared with J774 cells. Murine fibroblast cell lines stably overexpressing human 15-LO or β-galactosidase (LacZ) were developed in our lab (9Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably transfected with CD14 or a CD14 mutant were generated and functionally characterized as previously described (20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CD14-D5 mutant had a deletion of DPRQY peptide in the CD14 sequence. Surface expression of the protein was determined by FACS analysis with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody 63D3 (ATCC) (20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 28C5 against human CD14 was a gift from P. Tobias (Scripps Research Institute). TLR2, TLR4, and TLR4/MD-2 stably transfected cells were generated from Pdisplay, a CHO cell line bearing inducible membrane CD25 under the transcriptional control of a human E-selectin promoter containing NF-κB-binding sites, as described before (18Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLR2 and TLR4 were engineered to express with an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag, and MD-2 was engineered to express with a C-terminal His tag; their surface expression was analyzed by FACS (18Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Escherichia coli LPS was purchased from List Biological Lab (San Jose, CA). Biotinylated Re595 LPS (biotin-LPS) was a gift from R. Dziarski (Indiana University). Murine M-CSF was from R & D Systems. LDL was isolated from the plasma of normolipidemic donors by sequential ultracentrifugation. Heavily oxidized LDL (1 mg/ml) was produced by an 18-h incubation in EDTA-free phosphate-buffered saline with 10 μmCuSO4. Minimally modified LDL was prepared by incubating LDL (50 μg/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h with 15-LO fibroblasts (9Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As previously characterized in detail, the mmLDL generated by this procedure has normal binding to the native LDL receptor and does not bind to scavenger receptors of macrophages, although it is enriched by oxidized phospholipids detected by monoclonal antibody EO6 and by lipid hydroperoxides as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (10Ezaki M. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sigari F. Lee C. Witztum J.L. Reaven P.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3639-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Control LDL was prepared for these experiments by an identical incubation with LacZ fibroblasts (9Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) The extent of LDL oxidation was assessed by measuring its binding to monoclonal autoantibodies EO6, specific to oxidized phospholipid or oxidized phospholipid-protein adducts, and EO14, specific to MDA-lysine epitopes, respectively (22Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). All of the native and modified LDL preparations used in these experiments were tested for bacterial LPS with a Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate kit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The samples with LPS higher than 2 ng/mg protein were discarded. Because LDL was used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml or less in all experiments, the LPS contamination in experimental samples was always below 0.1 ng/ml. Peritoneal macrophages and J774 and RAW cells were plated overnight in culture medium before the experiment. Because quiescent adherent CHO cells have many stress fibers with a high F-actin content, it is difficult to see F-actin changes under these conditions. Thus, we plated the CHO cells for 2 h, the time sufficient for cell attachment but not for spreading, and then stimulated them with LDL samples. The LR-9 cells, which are larger than parental J774, were also plated for 2 h before experiment (in this case J774, analyzed in parallel with LR-9, were also plated for only 2 h). Relative content of F-actin in cells was assessed by flow cytometry (8Miller Y.I. Chang M.K. Funk C.D. Feramisco J.R. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19431-19439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The increase in F-actin levels is referred to throughout the text as F-actin response. The data were collected as histograms of distribution of cell fluorescence intensities, and the geometrical means of each histogram were used for further analysis. The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. J774 and LR-9 cells were thoroughly washed, preincubated for 2 h in serum-free medium, and then gently scraped into bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were stained with biotinylated anti-mouse CD14 (R & D Systems) followed by streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by flow cytometry. LDL was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to biotinylation, an aliquot of the LDL destined to be the native LDL control, was protected from oxidation by adding 10 μmbutylated hydroxytoluene. Nonprotected biotin-LDL was further incubated with the 15-LO cells, as described above, to produce biotin-mmLDL. The cells were scrapped into suspension, incubated with 2–50 μg/ml of biotin-LDL on ice for 2 h, washed, and then stained with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488. The cells were also stained with propidium iodide to differentiate live cells and analyzed on a FACSCalibur or a FACScan. Comparison of this FACS assay with a conventional 125I-LDL binding assay (22Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) showed comparable results (data not shown). A macrophage phagocytic population was measured according to the procedure published in our lab (23Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In short, thymocytes were labeled with 1 μm of 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CellTracker green CMFDA from Molecular Probes) followed by a treatment with 5 μm dexamethasone to induce apoptosis (23Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and incubated with macrophages. The macrophages that have engulfed CellTracker-labeled apoptotic cells differed on FACS from nonphagocytic macrophages by higher fluorescence intensity and were designated as a phagocytic population (23Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The cell association and degradation of 125I-OxLDL by resident peritoneal macrophages was determined by the method of Goldstein as performed in our lab (22Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To remove aggregates from the 125I-OxLDL prep, it was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter immediately before addition to the cells. The amount of specific OxLDL associated or degraded per milligram of cell protein was calculated after subtracting nonspecific values determined in presence of excess unlabeled OxLDL. Mouse peritoneal macrophages and the cells of the murine macrophage-like cell line J774 exhibited a rapid and robust increase in polymerized F-actin in response to OxLDL or mmLDL (further referred to as F-actin response) but not to native LDL, as was evident from the increased fluorescence of the cells stained with FITC-phalloidin (Fig. 1, a andb). Note that compared with the content of F-actin in unstimulated peritoneal macrophages or J774 cells, OxLDL, and to an even greater extent mmLDL, increased absolute content of F-actin by up to 70%, whereas native LDL had no such activity. This degree of stimulation was even greater than that observed with M-CSF (5 nm), which also increases F-actin formation (24Nakamura I. Lipfert L. Rodan G.A. Le T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This gain in the total cellular F-actin content is substantial, because actin filaments build up the cytoskeleton and are the most abundant protein polymer in the cell. Indeed, as might be anticipated, the increased F-actin response was associated with a major change in cell shape, as noted by the marked degree of cell spreading (Fig. 1, c–e). The F-actin response to mmLDL was blunted in another macrophage line, RAW cells; in fact, the latter did not respond to OxLDL (Fig. 1 b). Concentrations of OxLDL or mmLDL between 10 and 50 μg/ml appear to saturate the ability of OxLDL to stimulate F-actin formation (not shown). OxLDL and mmLDL caused about a 20% increase in F-actin as early as in 10 min (not shown), and as much as 50–70% F-actin was attained at 1 h (Fig. 1 b). These results were not due to LPS contamination. As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” the maximum concentration of LPS in any preparations used was below 0.1 ng/ml. Furthermore, polymyxin B did not inhibit the mmLDL effect (Fig. 1 b). When LPS was directly added at 10 ng/ml, which is at least 100-fold higher than the trace amounts of LPS present in any of the LDL samples used, F-actin formation was increased by only 20% in J744, and in this case, polymyxin B abolished this response (Fig. 1 b). Clearly, the mmLDL effect was not produced by LPS. Because mmLDL was produced by incubating LDL with 15-LO-overexpressing fibroblasts (10Ezaki M. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sigari F. Lee C. Witztum J.L. Reaven P.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we purified it by centrifugation, 0.2-μm filtration, and concentration on a filter with a 100-kDa cut-off. The eluent fraction of molecular mass below 100 kDa as well as LDL incubated with control LacΖ fibroblasts (9Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) had a significantly lower activity. mmLDL produced by a short period of incubation with copper (1 h), replacing 15-LO cells, was also active in eliciting the F-actin response (data not shown). Because the response to mmLDL was so pronounced and mmLDL could not bind to scavenger receptors, we focused further studies on the mechanism by which mmLDL induced F-actin formation. We hypothesized that the differences in amplitudes of the F-actin increase between J774 and RAW cells in response to mmLDL and OxLDL (Fig. 1 b) might be due to a differential expression of particular receptors that bound the modified LDL and signaled actin polymerization. We screened several receptors, including CD14, which is known to participate in phagocytosis (26Schlegel R.A. Krahling S. Callahan M.K. Williamson P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which binds ceramide (27Pfeiffer A. Bottcher A. Orso E. Kapinsky M. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Spreitzer I. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Gempel K. Horn M. Holmer S. Hartung T. Multhoff G. Schutz G. Schindler H. Ulmer A.J. Heine H. Stelter F. Schutt C. Rothe G. Szollosi J. Damjanovich S. Schmitz G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3153-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and which might be involved in LPS-induced macrophage spreading (28Schmidt A. Caron E. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The J774 cells showed a much stronger binding of anti-mouse CD14 and anti-mouse TLR4/MD-2 antibodies than the RAW cells (data not shown). Further, a mutant of J774, LR-9 cells, selected for their resistance to LPS because of the decreased surface expression of CD14 (19Nishijima M. Hara-Kuge S. Takasuka N. Akagawa K. Setouchi M. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Akamatsu Y. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (a finding confirmed in our lab), responded to mmLDL with a significantly smaller increase in the F-actin levels compared with the parental J774 cells (Fig. 2 a). The difference in F-actin response by J774 and LR-9 cells correlated with nearly 6-fold increased specific binding of mmLDL to J774 but not to LR-9 cells (Fig. 2 b). (Note that the binding of biotinylated mmLDL to J774 cells was abolished by a 25-fold excess of unlabeled mmLDL). Again, note that polymyxin B had no effect on the binding of mmLDL to J774 cells (Fig. 2 b). The experiments above provided substantial support for specific binding of mmLDL to CD14. To provide direct evidence, we next tested whether overexpression of CD14 would lead to an increased F-actin response to mmLDL. A CHO cell line stably transfected with human CD14 (CD14 cells) responded to mmLDL with significantly higher levels of F-actin than the wild type CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 3 a). Although changes in F-actin levels in CD14 cells were not as pronounced as in macrophages, the 25% increase is still a substantial change in F-actin formation for these large ovary cells, which are not professional phagocytes and do not rapidly form filopodia, as do macrophages. Accordingly, binding of biotinylated mmLDL to the CD14 cells was significantly higher than to the wild type CHO cells (Fig. 3, b and c). To demonstrate specific binding to the CD14 cells, biotinylated mmLDL binding curves were determined in the absence or presence of unlabeled mmLDL. As shown in Fig. 3 b, there was specific and saturable binding of mmLDL with a calculated K d of 15 ± 3 μm. The specific binding of mmLDL to CD14 cells was 10-fold higher than to control CHO cells (Fig. 3 c). The mmLDL binding correlated with increased binding of LPS to the CD14 cells (Fig. 3 e). This increased LPS binding was specific for CD14, because monoclonal antibody 28C5, directed against the LPS binding site of CD14, reduced LPS binding to levels seen in nontransfected CHO cells (Fig. 3 e and Ref 20Viriyakosol S.

However, antibody 28C5 did not block either the F-actin response to mmLDL or mmLDL binding to the CD14 cells (Fig. 3, a andd). These data suggest that although mmLDL has specific binding to CD14, it binds at a site distinct from the LPS binding site (at least that domain to which 28C5 binds). Further support for this comes from studies of binding to the CD14 mutant CD14-D5, in which the peptide DPRQY is deleted, rendering CD14 unable to support binding of LPS (20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO cells with CD14-D5 resulted in CHO cells in which no specific LPS binding was observed (Fig. 3 e). However, binding of mmLDL to CD14-D5 was inhibited by only 25% compared with CD14 cells (Fig. 3 d), and the ability to stimulate F-actin formation was not significantly decreased (Fig. 3 a). These data confirm that mmLDL binds to CD14 but to a region distinct from the LPS-binding site. Because most CD14-dependent LPS effects are believed to require the TLR4 signaling pathways (29Guha M. Mackman N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar), we studied whether the F-actin response to mmLDL depended on TLR4. Peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice have normal CD14 expression, but they are resistant to LPS because of a mutation in the TLR4 gene, Tlr4Lps-d (30Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6349) Google Scholar). In contrast, macrophages from C3H/HeOuJ mice carry a wild typeTlr4Lps-n and are sensitive to endotoxin. The F-actin response to mmLDL was significantly blunted inTlr4Lps-d macrophages compared withTlr4Lps-n macrophages (Fig. 4 a). Moreover, in agreement with our experiments with C57BL/6 macrophages (Fig. 1,c–e), Tlr4Lps-n macrophages from C3H/HeOuJ mice readily spread following a 1-h exposure to mmLDL (Fig. 4, b and c). In contrast, the morphology of theTlr4Lps-d macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice exposed for the same time to mmLDL did not significantly differ from those exposed to nLDL or medium alone (Fig. 4, d ande). To support the hypothesis of TLR4 involvement in mediating the mmLDL induction of actin polymerization, we next compared the F-actin response of CHO cells stably transfected with either TLR2, TLR4, or TLR4/MD-2. Of these, only the TLR4/MD-2 cells responded to mmLDL with significantly increased levels of F-actin as compared with the control CHO cells (Fig. 4 f). Thus, mmLDL can directly activate TLR4/MD-2 in these cells when these molecules are overexpressed. Next, we tested whether inhibition of several key components of known TLR signaling pathways (14Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar) will influence the F-actin response. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (31Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J.

Based on in vitro andex vivo studies, protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) was implicated in the regulation of several RTKs, yet mice lacking PTP1B show defects mainly in insulin and leptin receptor signaling. To address this apparent paradox, we studied RTK signaling in primary and immortalized fibroblasts from PTP1B−/− mice. After growth factor treatment, cells lacking PTP1B exhibit increased and sustained phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). However, Erk activation is enhanced only slightly, and there is no increase in Akt activation in PTP1B-deficient cells. Our results show that PTP1B does play a role in regulating EGFR and PDGFR phosphorylation but that other signaling mechanisms can largely compensate for PTP1B deficiency. In-gel phosphatase experiments suggest that other PTPs may help to regulate the EGFR and PDGFR in PTP1B−/− fibroblasts. This and other compensatory mechanisms prevent widespread, uncontrolled activation of RTKs in the absence of PTP1B and probably explain the relatively mild effects of PTP1B deletion in mice.

Multiple peptide growth factors direct these processes to differing extents in primary fibroblasts and fibroblast cell lines. These growth factors signal via receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, termed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).1 Ligand binding activates the intrinsic kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in the phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosyl residues. These serve as docking sites to recruit signal relay molecules containing src homology-2 and/or phosphotyrosine binding domains, most of which also are RTK substrates. The resultant complexes lead to activation of downstream signaling, including the Ras-Erk and PI-3K/Akt pathways. Ultimately, downstream signaling pathways stimulate new transcription and changes in cellular behavior and/or state (reviewed in Ref. 1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Because of their pleiotropic actions, RTKs must be regulated carefully. Abnormally increased RTK activity can have dire consequences, including developmental abnormalities (reviewed in Ref. 2Robertson S.C. Tynan J.A. Donoghue D.J.

Classic PTPs comprise a large family of receptor-like and non-receptor enzymes that share a highly conserved catalytic (PTP) domain that is absolutely specific for phosphotyrosine hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Because tyrosyl phosphorylation is reversible, PTPs probably play important roles in the regulation of RTKs and/or their substrates (reviewed in Refs. 5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin.

Which, if any, of these PTPs regulate RTK signaling under physiologically relevant conditions of expression has remained largely unclear. Also unknown is the extent to which RTK dephosphorylation, as opposed to other down-regulatory mechanisms such as RTK degradation and/or inhibitory seryl phosphorylation, plays the (a) key role in receptor inactivation. PTP1B is a widely expressed non-receptor PTP that is localized on intracellular membranes via a hydrophobic C-terminal targeting sequence (18Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G.

However, these mice lack any obvious signs of increased activity of the EGFR or PDGFR, such as increased tumor incidence or fibrosis. We used fibroblasts derived from wild-type (WT) and PTP1B−/− mice to address the role of PTP1B in the regulation of RTK signaling. We find that PTP1B−/− cells exhibit enhanced and sustained tyrosyl phosphorylation of both RTKs. Despite increased RTK phosphorylation, EGF- and PDGF-evoked Akt activation is not enhanced, whereas Erk activation is only minimally increased. Our results show that PTP1B is a bona fideregulator of EGF and PDGF signaling in vivo, but other cellular regulatory mechanisms, including other PTPs, can largely compensate for loss of PTP1B regulation of these RTKs. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to murine PTP1B were described previously (37Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H.

DeMaio (Yale Medical School, New Haven, CT). Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc (Lake Placid, NY) and anti-PTP1B monoclonal antibodies (FG6) were from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total Akt, phosphorylated (Ser-473) Akt, and phosphorylated (Thr-202/Tyr-204) Erk were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-Erk2, -Shp2, and -EGFR antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from embryonic day 14 embryos from WT or PTP1B−/− (exon 1) mice (C57/Bl6J X SV129 background) (37Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K.

Embryos were incubated in trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C, and dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum,100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2atmosphere. Four independent WT and PTP1B−/− MEF strains were used for experiments, with similar results. For immortalization with simian virus 40 large T antigen, PTP1B−/− MEFs were infected with pZipTex (38Jat P.S. Cepko C.L. Mulligan R.C. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

To generate viral stocks, these vectors were transiently transfected into the Phoenix-Eco retroviral packaging line (http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/index.html), and supernatants were collected 48 h later. Immortalized PTP1B−/− cells were infected in the presence of polybrene (1 μg/ml) and selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum plus hygromycin (700 μg/ml). Pools of hygromycin-resistant cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. MEFs were seeded at 2.5 × 105cells per 60-mm tissue culture plate for 24 h, starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus antibiotics for 48 h, and stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml). At the indicated times after stimulation, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml of antipain)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 3 h overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected onto protein A-Sepharose beads, washed extensively, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin or Carnation non-fat dry milk in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. After incubation with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL;Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was carried out using NIH Image Pro Software Version 1.62; data are expressed as relative units of phosphorylated protein per total protein for each band. Anti-PTP1B and anti-PDGFRβ antisera were used at 1/1000 for immunoblotting. Anti-human PTP1B monoclonal antibodies (FG6) were used at 1 μg/ml for immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. All other antibodies were used at concentrations as recommended by the supplier. Cells were starved overnight in 0.5% fetal calf serum, treated with 2 mmH2O2 at 37 °C for 30 min, and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF at room temperature for 10 min or left untreated. Anti-PDGFR immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of one 75-cm2 tissue culture flask. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out using normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz). In-gel phosphatase assays were performed as described by Burridge and Nelson (41Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For substrate, poly(Glu4Tyr1)n was radiolabeled with [γ32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using recombinant human p60c-Src, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein inEscherichia coli. The substrate was cast in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 30:0.8). Instead of Tween 40, Tween 20 was used throughout, and the final renaturation step was carried out overnight in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.04% Tween 20. Previous reports indicated that PTP1B dephosphorylates the EGFR, at least when one or both of these proteins are overexpressed. To investigate whether the EGFR is a PTP1B target under physiological conditions, primary MEFs were generated from PTP1B (exon 1) −/− mice and WT control mice. Starved MEFs were stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for various times or left unstimulated. Total cell lysates or EGFR immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A). As expected, in starved cells, there was no detectable tyrosyl phosphorylation of the EGFR in total cell lysates or EGFR immunoprecipitates from either WT or PTP1B−/− MEFs. However, after stimulation, EGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation was enhanced and sustained in PTP1B−/−MEFs compared with control MEFs (KO/WT ratio ± S.E., 1.73 ± 0.22, 1.46 ± 0.18, 1.83 ± 0.13, and 1.55 ± 0.21 at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively, as quantified by scanning densitometry). Reprobing these blots with anti-EGFR antibodies revealed that the difference in EGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation was not caused by increased EGFR expression in PTP1B−/− MEFs, but instead reflected increased specific tyrosyl phosphorylation. Together with the earlier PTP1B overexpression/dominant-negative mutant studies, these data show that PTP1B plays a role in dephosphorylating the EGFR, at least in MEFs. Although to our knowledge PTP1B has not been shown to regulate the PDGFR, PDGF-stimulated PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation also was increased in the absence of PTP1B (Fig. 1 B), (KO/WT ratio ± S.E., 1.53 ± 0.22, 1.72 ± 0.12, 1.94 ± 0.35, and 2.1 ± 0.44 for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively), suggesting that PTP1B also regulates the PDGFR. Anti-PTP1B immunoblots confirmed the absence of PTP1B protein in the PTP1B−/−MEFs (Fig. 1 C). Although EGFR and PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation are increased in the absence of PTP1B, mice lacking PTP1B exhibit no obvious hypermorphism of EGFR or PDGFR pathways. To begin to understand this apparent paradox, we examined signaling pathways downstream of these RTKs in WT and PTP1B−/− MEFs. Activation of the Erk pathway, as assessed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific anti-Erk antibodies, was enhanced slightly in response to EGF stimulation of PTP1B−/−, compared with WT MEFs (KO/WT ratio ± S.E., 1.02 ± 0.08, 1.31 ± 0.1, 1.36 ± 0.25, and 1.39 ± 0.04 at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively). Erk activation was enhanced to an even greater extent in PDGF-stimulated PTP1B−/− MEFs compared with WT (Fig. 2 A) (KO/WT ratio ± S.E., 1.13 ± 0.15, 1.2 ± 0.07, 1.58 ± 0.14, and 1.76 ± 0.36 at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively). In contrast, growth factor-stimulated Akt activation (as assayed by pAkt immunoblotting) was not increased in PTP1B−/− MEFs (compared with WT MEFs) in response to either growth factor, in fact there was a tendency for decreased activation (Fig. 2 B) (e.g. KO/WT ratio ± S.E., 0.93 ± 0.21, 0.85 ± 0.04, 0.95 ± 0.11, and 0.99 ± 0.12 for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min of PDGF stimulation, respectively; 0.73 ± 0.28 and 0.98 ± 0.15 for 1 and 5 min post-EGF stimulation, respectively). These results suggested that MEFs compensate for the increased EGFR or PDGFR activation caused by PTP1B deficiency somewhere between the hyperphosphorylated RTK and Akt activation. The small enhancement of Erk activation in PTP1B−/− cells suggests compensatory mechanisms for the effects of increased RTK activation on this signaling pathway as well. To begin to understand the molecular basis for these effects, we focused on more immediate events after PDGFR activation. PDGF-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 (Fig. 3 A) and Shc (Fig. 3 B), two signal relay molecules implicated in Erk activation (reviewed in Refs. 42Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 43Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), was enhanced significantly in PTP1B−/− MEFs compared with WT. Association of Shp2 with the PDGFR is probably increased as well (Fig. 4). Activation of the Akt pathway is mediated, at least in part, by recruitment of phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) to the PDGFR (reviewed in Ref. 44Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of enhanced Akt activation in PDGF-stimulated PTP1B−/− MEFs, association of the p85 (targeting) subunit of PI-3K with the PDGFR was not increased in the absence of PTP1B (Fig. 3 C). In addition, PDGFR-associated PI-3K activity was not altered significantly in PTP1B−/−, compared with WT cells (data not shown).Figure 4Reconstitution of PTP1B in immortalized murine PTP1B−/− fibroblasts. Immortalized PTP1B−/− cells were generated and then reconstituted with hPTP1B-WT, hPTP1B-D/A, or the parental pWZL vector, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, lysates from randomly growing cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted for hPTP1B and Shp2. B, lysates of PDGF-stimulated PTP1B−/− and hPTP1B-WT fibroblasts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine (Ptyr), anti-phospho-Erk (pMAPK), anti-total Erk-2 (ERK 2), anti-phospho-Akt (pAKT) and anti-total Akt (AKT) antibodies, respectively. C, lysates of unstimulated and PDGF-stimulated (15 min) PTP1B−/−, hPTP1B-WT-, and hPTP1B-D/A-reconstituted cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-hPTP1B antibodies and then subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine (Ptyr) immunoblotting. Right panel, multiple PTPs, including PTP1B, associate with the PDGFR in murine fibroblasts. Lysates of immortalized PTP1B−/−fibroblasts, reconstituted with hPTP1B or the parental vector, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibodies or normal rabbit IgG as control, as indicated. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels containing32P-tyrosine-phosphorylated poly(Glu4Tyr1), and PTPs were visualized as activity bands (white) after renaturation. Identification of PTPs is based on immunodepletion experiments and comparison of wild type and PTP1B−/− cells. Note that several fragments of PTP1B are detectable. A component of about 40 kDa is present in the PTP1B−/− cells and is therefore not a PTP1B fragment. Different parts of the same gel have been exposed for different lengths of time to optimize PTP detection. Lower panels show controls for PDGFR immunoprecipitation (PDGFR-IP) and PDGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conceivably, increased RTK activation in PTP1B−/− MEFs could reflect an indirect effect of PTP1B on fibroblast differentiation, rather than an effect of PTP1B on RTK signaling per se. To exclude this possibility, we restored PTP1B expression to PTP1B−/− cells (Fig. 4 A). A large T Ag-immortalized PTP1B−/−fibroblast cell line was generated and reconstituted with human PTP1B (hPTP1B-WT), the PTP1B substrate-trapping mutant D181A (hPTP1B-D/A), or the parental pWZL expression vector (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunostaining revealed that >90% of hPTP1B-WT- and hPTP1B-D/A-infected, hygromycin-resistant cells expressed hPTP1B protein (data not shown); thus, these pools can be studied directly, avoiding potential clone-to-clone variation. Notably, PDGF-stimulated (but not basal) PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation was greater in the vector control-infected PTP1B−/− cell pool, compared with the cells reconstituted with hPTP1B-WT (Fig. 4 B). Restoration of hPTP1B-WT expression in immortalized PTP1B−/− fibroblasts diminished PDGF-evoked Erk activation but left PDGF-evoked Akt activation unaffected (Fig. 4 B). The effects of restoring hPTP1B expression on PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation were observed only at submaximal doses of PDGF. The reason for this is not clear, but may be caused, at least in part, by the increased level of PDGFR expression that accompanied immortalization (data not shown). The resultant increase in the concentration of activated PDGFR may allow access to a secondary PDGFR phosphatase with a higher Kmvalue (see below). These data indicate that PTP1B regulates PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation in a cell-autonomous manner. To seek further evidence that PTP1B directly regulates PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation, we asked whether the PDGFR could form a stable complex with PTP1B-D/A, which is impaired catalytically, but retains substrate-binding ability (16Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 43Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin.

PTP1B immunoprecipitates prepared from starved or PDGFR-stimulated, immortalized PTP1B−/− cells reconstituted with hPTP1B-WT, hPTP1B-D/A, or the vector controls were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. An ∼180-kDa band corresponding in size to the PDGFR coimmunoprecipitated with hPTP1B-D/A but not hPTP1B-WT (Fig. 4 C); this interaction was detected only upon PDGF stimulation. Unfortunately, available anti-PDGFR antibodies were insufficiently sensitive to unambiguously identify this band as the PDGFR. However, this is highly likely; using a highly sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach, we recently demonstrated complex formation between the PDGFR and PTP1B in hPTP1B-D/A-expressing cells (46Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Previous studies reported associations between the C215S and/or D181A substrate trapping mutants of PTP1B and the PDGFR (17Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as well as the EGFR (16Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and IR (15Seely B.L. Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Berhanu P. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Kusari J. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Unlike the inducible interaction we observed, in these earlier studies, constitutive complex formation was observed. This most probably reflects the high level of overexpression of PTP1B trapping mutant and/or the RTK used in those studies. Although coimmunoprecipitation of the PDGFR and WT-PTP1B was not observed by immunoblotting, PDGFR immunoprecipitates contained an ∼50-kDa PTP activity detectable by a highly sensitive in-gel phosphatase assay (Fig. 4 D). This activity is almost certainly PTP1B, because it is absent in PDGFR immunoprecipitates prepared from PTP1B−/− cells. Interestingly, PTP1B/PDGFR association was detected only when cells were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). Much recent work suggests that specific PTPs, including PTP1B, undergo physiological oxidation (and thus transient inactivation) by peroxide (reviewed in Ref. 47Xu D. Rovira I.I. Finkel T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 251-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Conceivably, PDGFR/PTP1B association requires a conformational change in PTP1B that is induced upon oxidation. Alternatively, transient PDGFR/PTP1B interactions may be “trapped” by the peroxide-induced generation of one or more intermolecular disulfide bonds. A peroxide-dependent a"
https://openalex.org/W2122828155,"Mutations of NPHS1 or NPHS2, the genes encoding for the glomerular podocyte proteins nephrin and podocin, cause steroid-resistant proteinuria. In addition, mice lacking NEPH1 develop a nephrotic syndrome that resembles NPHS mutations, suggesting that all three proteins are essential for the integrity of glomerular podocytes. Podocin interacts with the C-terminal domain of nephrin and facilitates nephrin-dependent signaling. NEPH1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is structurally related to nephrin. We report now that NEPH1 belongs to a family of three closely related proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of podocin. All three NEPH proteins share a conserved podocin-binding motif; mutation of a centrally located tyrosine residue dramatically lowers the affinity of NEPH1 for podocin. NEPH1 triggers AP-1 activation similarly to nephrin but requires the presence of Tec family kinases for efficient transactivation. We conclude that NEPH1 defines a new family of podocin-binding molecules that are potential candidates for hereditary nephrotic syndromes not linked to either NPHS1 or NPHS2."
https://openalex.org/W1997002747,"In the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, yeast DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) replicated DNA at a rate of 40–60 nt/s. When downstream double-stranded DNA was encountered, Pol δ paused, but most replication complexes proceeded to carry out strand-displacement synthesis at a rate of 1.5 nt/s. In the presence of the flap endonuclease FEN1 (Rad27), the complex carried out nick translation (1.7 nt/s). The Dna2 nuclease/helicase alone did not efficiently promote nick translation, nor did it affect nick translation with FEN1. Maturation in the presence of DNA ligase was studied with various downstream primers. Downstream DNA primers, RNA primers, and small 5′-flaps were efficiently matured by Pol δ and FEN1, and Dna2 did not stimulate maturation. However, maturation of long 5′-flaps to which replication protein A can bind required both DNA2 and FEN1. The maturation kinetics were optimal with a slight molar excess over DNA of Pol δ, FEN1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. A large molar excess of DNA ligase substantially enhanced the rate of maturation and shortened the nick-translation patch (nucleotides excised past the RNA/DNA junction before ligation) to 4–6 nt from 8–12 nt with equimolar ligase. These results suggest that FEN1, but not DNA ligase, is a stable component of the maturation complex."

The formation and repair of H2O2-induced DNA lesions were examined using quantitative PCR. It was found that NHF hTERTs show extensive mtDNA damage (∼4 lesions/10 kb) after exposure to 200 μm H2O2, which is partially repaired during a recovery period of 6 h. At the same time, the nDNA seemed to be completely resistant to damage. Cell sorting experiments revealed persistent mtDNA damage at 24 h only in the fraction of cells with low mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Further analysis also showed increased production of H2O2 by these cells, which subsequently undergo apoptosis. This work supports a hypothesis for a feed-forward cascade of reactive oxygen species generation and mtDNA damage and also suggested a possible mechanism for persistence of lesions in the mtDNA involving a drop in ΔΨm, compromised protein import, secondary reactive oxygen species generation, and loss of repair capacity.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In addition to these sources, ROS are also produced in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation and ischemic reperfusion injury (2Kehrer J.P. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 305-314Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain environmental pollutants (like pesticides and herbicides), as well as smoking, can induce ROS either directly or indirectly (1Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 3Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is well known that ROS can damage biomolecules and have been postulated as an important cause of aging, cancer, and various human degenerative diseases (3Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar, 5Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). One of the most widely used compounds to produce oxidative stress, both in vitro and in vivobiological studies, is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Unlike other ROS, H2O2 is not charged and is therefore freely diffusible within the cell. It can arise spontaneously or be generated from superoxide by superoxide dismutase. More importantly, in the presence of metal ions such as copper or iron, H2O2 can undergo Fenton chemistry and give rise to the potent hydroxyl radical. This radical is extremely reactive and can damage different components of the cell (6Fridovich E. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The responses of cultured cells to H2O2 vary according to cell type and are known to be both time- and, especially, dose-dependent (for review see Ref. 7Davies K.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, low concentrations (3–15 μm) of H2O2were shown to activate a mitogenic response (8Wiese A.G. Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas higher doses can have either cytostatic or cytotoxic effects. It was observed that concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 μm promote DNA damage (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With regard to DNA damage, we and others have demonstrated that the mtDNA of different cell types and organisms is more prone to oxidative injury than the nDNA (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl.

A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) demonstrated that depending on the intensity of the damage (dose and time of exposure), nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are differentially damaged and repaired. Although the precise molecular reason(s) that lead to the persistence of lesions in the mitochondrial genome is not clear, several explanations have been offered to clarify the increased vulnerability of the mtDNA to damage. These include the lack of a compact nucleosome structure as compared with the nDNA, the limited mitochondrial repair pathways, as well as the proximity of the mtDNA to the main source of ROS generation (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 23Sawyer D.E. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More work is needed to understand the molecular events underlying the susceptibility of the mtDNA to oxidative damage. Whereas the initial results obtained regarding the kinetics of damage and repair in both mitochondria and nuclear genomes were based on SV40-transformed fibroblasts (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), data from the literature raise concerns as to the suitability of the SV40-transformed cell model. In fact, a significant number of physiological changes after viral transformation have been reported. For example, loss of p53 function with consequent alteration in cell cycle control (24Garbe J. Wong M. Wigington D. Yaswen P. Stampfer M.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2169-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) decreased DNA repair (25Bowman K.K. Sicard D.M. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 1: 17-24Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Estrade S. Cassingena R. Calvayrac R. Sarasin A. Dutrillaux B. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was found. In an effort to better understand the basis of the increased susceptibility and persistent damage observed in mtDNA after oxidative stress, we have used a non-transformed diploid fibroblast cell line expressing the telomerase gene (NHF hTERT) to follow the formation and removal of H2O2-induced lesions. With this approach it was observed that these cells accumulate large amounts of mtDNA damage, which can be completely repaired after a 15-min treatment but not a 60-min treatment. Cell sorting experiments revealed that persistent lesions in the mtDNA correlate with loss of Δψm, increased ROS generation, and cell death. Interestingly, we also show that the nDNA of the NHF hTERTs seems totally resistant to H2O2-induced damage, suggesting that SV40-transformation makes the nuclear genome more prone to oxidative injury. The normal human fibroblasts transfected with the telomerase gene (NHF hTERT) used throughout this study were a gift from Dr. Carl Barrett (NCI, National Institutes of Health). The cells were routinely grown and sub-cultured in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), SAP (0.2 mm serine, 0.1 mm aspartic acid, and 1.0 mm pyruvate), 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for selection of the stable transfectants. Cells were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes 15–18 h prior to the experiments. Immediately before treatment cells were washed once with DMEM/F-12 without any supplements, and the conditioned medium was saved for later use. A 30 mm stock of H2O2 (30% Sigma) was prepared in PBS (Invitrogen) and used to generate the 200 μm solution (in DMEM/F-12 alone) with which the cells were challenged. Monolayer cultures were exposed to H2O2 for 15 or 60 min and harvested immediately or allowed to recover for up to 24 h (in this case, in the original conditioned medium). High molecular weight DNA was extracted, and QPCR was performed and analyzed as described elsewhere (22Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated, and specific primers were used to amplify a fragment of the mitochondrial and/or nDNA. The assay is based on the premise that DNA lesions (including oxidative damage such as strand breaks, base modifications, and abasic sites) block the progression of the polymerase so that only undamaged templates can participate in the PCR. Thus, amplification is inversely proportional to DNA damage: the more lesions encountered on the target DNA, the less the amplification. Note that for the mitochondrial genome both a short (221 bp) and a long fragment (8.9 kb) are routinely amplified. The rationale underlying this procedure is that the probability of introducing a lesion in a short segment is low, and therefore amplification of this segment gives an accurate estimation of the copy number of mtDNA in the sample. The data obtained from the small fragment were subsequently used to normalize the results of the 8.9-kb target (more details can be obtained in Ref. 22Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification of treated samples was then compared with controls, and the relative amplification was calculated. These values were next used to estimate the average number of lesions per 10 kb of the genome, using a Poisson distribution (22Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ayala-Torres S. Chen Y. Svoboda T. Rosenblatt J. Van Houten B. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 135-147Google Scholar). It is important to mention that a “negative” number of lesions was obtained when amplification of the treated sample was higher than that of the matched control. This phenomenon can occur by means of induced repair activity in the treated sample (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 29Chen H.-K. Yakes F.M. Srivastava D.K. Singhal R.K. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Van Houten B. Wilson S.H.

Results presented here are the mean of two sets of PCR for each target gene of at least three different biological experiments. Student's unpaired t test was performed to evaluate statistical significance. Changes in the Δψm were measured by flow cytometry using JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetra-ethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; Molecular Probes). JC-1 was chosen because of its specificity regarding the mitochondrial membrane (30Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 31Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Res. 2000; 46: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). At various time points (every 2 h up to 24 h and then at 36 h and 48 h) after the challenge with H2O2, control and treated cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 10 μm JC-1 for 10 min (37 °C; 5% CO2atmosphere). For each sample, 10,000 cells were examined on an FL-1 (530 nm) versus FL-2 (585 nm) dot plot using a BD Biosciences FACSort. JC-1 has dual emission depending on the state of the Δψm, forming aggregates with a high 585 nm fluorescence in cells (which indicates a normal Δψm). Loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity results in reduction in 585 nm fluorescence with a concurrent gain in 530 nm fluorescence as the dye shifts from an aggregate to a monomeric state (33Haugland R. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996: 269Google Scholar). Therefore, retention of the dye in the cell can be monitored. The data were converted to density plots using the CellQuest software. Cells were treated as described above and at various times after the treatments were subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI, Molecular Probes). Briefly, at each time point both control and treated cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 1 mg/ml RNase, 1 μl of Triton X-100(Sigma), and 20 μg/ml of PI. Samples were then immediately analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Measurement of caspase 3 activation was performed fluorimetrically using the Bio-Rad Apopain Kit, according to instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 24 h after the challenge with H2O2 cells were harvested and subjected to total protein extraction using CHAPS buffer with 5 mm dithiothreitol (Cell Signaling) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 5 rounds of quick-freezing (dry ice embedded in ethanol) and thawing (37 °C bath), protein concentrations were determined, and subsequently, 50 μl of each sample was used in the Apopain assay. Pro-caspase/apopain activity was monitored using a fluorogenic peptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC. Apopain enzymatically cleaved the AFC from the peptide and released it in a free form, which upon exposure to near UV light produced a blue-green fluorescence (detected at 500–550 nm). A calibration curve was generated first by measuring fluorescence of AFC released from a serial dilution of the standard substrate (AC-DEVD-AFC). A positive control consisting of protein extract of Jurkat cells treated with a Fas ligand, a model system for apoptosis, was also included. Duplicate fluorescence readings of the samples were taken every 30 min after reaction was started for up to 3 h until the readings stabilized. Caspase activity was calculated comparing results from the samples to the calibration curve. Data were reported as fluorescence readings. Sorting of the normal and depolarized (low Δψm) JC-1-stained cells was accomplished using a BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE. In these experiments, both control and 60-min treated cells were initially gated in forward-scatter versus a side-scatter dot plot to exclude debris. Sort gates were set up on an FL-1 (530:30 nm)versus FL-2 (575:26 nm) dot plot with increased stringency for only the depolarized cells. An all-sort cell population (cells gated on the initial forward-scatter versus side-scatter dot plot) was also collected to control for the introduction of DNA lesions and/or any change in the Δψm because of the sorting procedure. The data were converted to density plots using CellQuest software. Individual sorted cell populations were then immediately subjected to DNA extraction and QPCR analysis or placed back into culture for viability assays. Cells were sorted as described above, and supernatants were immediately collected by centrifugation and subjected to analysis using the Amplex Red Kit (Molecular Probes). The assay is based on the detection of H2O2 using 10-acetyl-7-hydroxiphenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent), a highly stable and specific probe for this compound. In the presence of horseradish peroxidase, Amplex Red reacts with H2O2 at a 1:1 stoichiometry, producing a highly fluorescent product, resorufin, which can be detected using excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm, respectively (34Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the supernatants was loaded in a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 30 min (protected from light and at room temperature) in the presence of phosphate buffer containing 400 μm of Amplex Red reagent and 2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. Background fluorescence was corrected by subtracting the values derived from PBS alone. Controls including catalase were also included to ensure that the fluorescent signal was due to H2O2. For each sample, all measurements were made in duplicate. The mean of those readings was then used to estimate H2O2 concentration using a standard H2O2 curve. The purpose of this study was to investigate the formation and repair of H2O2-induced lesions in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of normal human fibroblasts transfected with the telomerase gene. In addition, we also wanted to understand the apparent loss of DNA repair activity in cells showing persistent mtDNA damage and to gain some insights into the biological outcome(s) of this permanent damage. Quantitation of lesions introduced both in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes was performed using QPCR, and the details of the assay have been published previously (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 22Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ayala-Torres S. Chen Y. Svoboda T. Rosenblatt J. Van Houten B. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 135-147Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the relative amplification for the mtDNA of NHF hTERT cells after treatment with 200 μm H2O2 and repair periods of up to 24 h. As can be seen, a 15-min exposure to H2O2 gives rise to an ∼70% decrease in amplification as compared with the untreated control. Note that amplification was completely restored after a 1.5-h incubation in conditioned medium. In contrast, cells challenged for 60 min showed a marked reduction in amplification, corresponding to ∼4 lesions/10 kb. Unlike the 15-min treatment, the 60-min treatment leads to lesions that persisted even after long recovery periods (24 h). During the first 6 h, ∼50% of the damage from a 60-min treatment could be repaired. However, no further removal could be observed up to 24 h. These data suggest that the 60-min treatment passed some threshold of damage, such that some other deleterious events have taken place inside the mitochondria. Surprisingly, the nDNA of NHF hTERT cells did not show any decrease in amplification (when compared with untreated controls) even after a 60-min exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 1 B). This result suggested an absence of lesions detected in the two genomic regions (β-globin and HPRT) studied. These data differ significantly from the findings of Yakes and Van Houten (9Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), which demonstrated the same type of treatment to introduce 0.5 lesions/10 kb into the nuclear genome of SV40-transformed fibroblasts. Interestingly, we were able to perceive a very low amount of nDNA damage 24 h after the treatments, which was coupled to the observation that a vast proportion of cells (∼50%, data not shown) were detaching from the dishes. Together, these results indicate that the biology of a specific population of cells has changed after H2O2treatment, culminating in cell death. Moreover, the absence of nDNA damage suggests that, in this scenario, the cell death is exclusively a consequence of persistent lesions in the mtDNA. We next sought to determine whether the fraction of cells that were detaching from the dishes was dying by apoptotic death. We reasoned that cells with extensive and persistent mtDNA damage might not be able to maintain the Δψm across the inner membrane, believed to play a role in the apoptotic process (reviewed in Ref. 35Waterhouse N.J. Ricci J.-E. Green D.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The integrity of the Δψm was evaluated using JC-1, a fluorophore recognized as the most specific probe for the detection of changes in the Δψm of different cell types as compared with other available dyes (30Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 31Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21953-21962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 32Mathur A. Hong Y. Kemp B.K. Barrientos A.A. Erusalimsky J.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 46: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures” for 15 or 60 min and were analyzed every 2 h after the exposure to H2O2. No differences in the Δψm were observed when comparing the 15-min with the control at any time monitored (Fig. 2 A, upper right panel). However, a decline in the Δψm was detected at around 14 h in cells treated with H2O2for 60 min, with the highest proportion of cells (∼70%) with decreased Δψm values observed at 24 h (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that the cells treated for long periods of time with H2O2 might be undergoing apoptosis. To confirm that a fraction of the cells in our experiments were undergoing apoptotic death, other apoptosis-specific assays were conducted including analysis of caspase-3 activation as well as the staining of the nDNA with PI. Caspase 3 activation was followed using a fluorimetric assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 B shows that only cells that were exposed for 60 min to H2O2 had increased caspase-3 activation as compared with the negative control. DNA staining with PI also indicated a significant percentage of apoptotic cells beginning at 24 h with a peak at 72 h (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data indicate that a fraction of NHF hTERTs, when exposed to H2O2 for 60 min, undergoes apoptosis; this process was exclusively a consequence of extensive damage to the mitochondrial genome. Like many other studies with fibroblasts, these same cells did not show DNA laddering at any time monitored (24, 36, 48, and 72 h; data not shown). Integrity of the Δψm plays a role not only in apoptosis but also in trafficking various proteins into the mitochondria. In fact, nuclear encoded proteins that act in this organelle have to be targeted, unfolded, and refolded inside the mitochondrion by different protein complexes attached to the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. This import mechanism also depended on the maintenance of a high Δψm (reviewed in Ref. 36Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Considering that repair proteins that act in mitochondria are nuclear encoded, we next sought to evaluate whether the persistent mtDNA damage observed only in the cells treated for 60 min correlated with the drop in Δψm. To determine whether this was the case, a procedure relying on JC-1 staining and flow cytometry was adopted. By using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer and JC-1, both control and H2O2-treated cells were sorted into separate populations based on having low (depolarized cells) or high Δψm values (polarized cells). Fig. 3 shows the gating scheme used to individually isolate polarized and depolarized populations. Immediately after sorting, DNA was isolated, and damage was evaluated with the QPCR assay. Fig. 4 A illustrates the results from the mtDNA damage analysis on the various sorted populations of cells. Interestingly, only the depolarized population from the treated cells showed significant mtDNA damage. This is the first evidence that directly links depolarization of the Δψm with persistent lesions in this genome. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” an all-sort cell population where cells passed through the sorter but were not physically separated was included. Note that no significant differences in the amount of mtDNA damage were observed between the depolarized and all-sort treated cells, which is probably due to stringency of the gated depolarized population that excluded some depolarized cells (those falling between the two sort gates) that were included in the all-sort. In addition, it is important to notice that the majority of the treated (≥60%) cells were falling in the depolarized gate (example depicted in Fig. 3).Figure 4Persistent mitochondrial DNA damage is restricted to treated depolarized cells, which also show significantly increased levels of ROS. A, QPCR analysis of the mitochondrial target of NHF hTERT cells after the sorting procedure. Cells were treated as described previously, allowed to repair for 24 h, stained with JC-1 for 10 min, and subjected to flow cytometric sorting using the FACSVantage SE. Controls included 1) cells harvested immediately after the treatments (data not shown); 2) aliquot harvested 24 h after the challenge and kept with JC-1 for the same period as sorted cells but not submitted to this procedure (data not shown); and 3) cells that passed through the sorter but no separation of the two distinct populations conducted (all-sort). Data represent the amount of lesions per 10 kb in the populations that were sorted (n = 2). B, H2O2detection in sorted cells. After sorting, cells were harvested, and the supernatant was collected for H2O2measurements. To ensure comparability of results, the ratio between cell number and volume collected was constant so that the dilution was the same in all samples (i.e. the volume of flow cytometer fluid per cell was identical). Aliquots of the supernatant were then subjected to the Amplex Red coupled to horseradish peroxidase assay and H2O2 concentration calculated based on a standard H2O2 curve.

https://openalex.org/W1532542691,"The prevailing amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) holds that amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) causes neuronal degeneration by forming neurotoxic fibrillar structures. Yet, many aspects of AD pathology and symptoms are not well explained by this hypothesis. Here, we present evidence that neurotoxicity of soluble oligomeric Abeta closely corresponds to the selective neurodegeneration so distinctly manifest in AD. Selectivity was first observed in vitro, where only the human central nervous system neuronal cells were susceptible to soluble oligomeric Abeta. Furthermore, in mouse cerebral slice treated with soluble oligomeric Abeta, selective regiospecific toxicity was evident in the hippocampal CA1, a division important for memory, but not in the CA3 subfield. The fibrillar Abeta, however, killed neurons in all regions of the cerebral slice cultures and also in cerebellar slices. Remarkably, even at the highest soluble oligomeric Abeta concentrations, cerebellar neurons were completely spared, consistent with one of the hallmark features of AD pathology. Our observation of the selective neurodegeneration of soluble oligomeric Abeta to neurons involved in cognitive function may provide a new opportunity for the development of an effective AD therapy as well as elucidating the pathological mechanism of AD."

However, its significance in the lung and its role as a therapeutic agent against diseases characterized by pulmonary fibrosis are yet to be established. In this study, we examined age-related structural and functional changes in the lung of relaxin-deficient mice. Lung tissues of male and female RLX knockout (-/-) and RLX wild-type (+/+) mice at various ages were analyzed for changes in collagen expression and content. We demonstrate an age-related progression of lung fibrosis in RLX -/- mice with significantly increased tissue wet weight, collagen content and concentration, alveolar congestion, and bronchiole epithelium thickening. The increased fibrosis was associated with significantly altered peak expiratory flow and lung recoil (lung function) in RLX -/- mice. Treatment of RLX -/- mice with relaxin in early and developed stages of fibrosis resulted in the reversal of collagen deposition. Organ bath studies showed that precontracted lung strips relaxed in the presence of relaxin. Together, these data indicate that relaxin may provide a means to regulate excessive collagen deposition in diseased states characterized by pulmonary fibrosis."

Fukushima M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 500-505PubMed Google Scholar) where they can react covalently with other molecules via their electrophilic β-carbon (4Honn K.V. Marnett L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Few of the proximal molecular targets of these PG are established (5Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J.

Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). There are two formal hypotheses to explain how electrophilic PG might inactivate p53. First, they might act directly, via covalent reaction with p53 itself. Second, they might act indirectly, via covalent reaction with regulatory proteins that govern p53 conformation and function. A direct mechanism of action is incompatible with our observation that PGA1 and PGA2 antagonize only the apoptosis mediated by p53 (1Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but not the cell-cycle arrest. These PG should antagonize all functions mediated by p53 if their molecular mechanism of action involved its modification directly. Accordingly, we sought candidate proteins consistent with an indirect molecular mechanism of action. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is notable from biological and chemical perspectives. Biologically, TrxR-Trx cycling modulates sulfhydryl-disulfide isomerization reactions that govern the conformation and function of p53, as well as several other redox sensitive transcription factors, like NFκB and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (8Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 9Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

Chemically, TrxR is a selenoprotein. Selenocysteine residues are typically more nucleophilic than cysteine under comparable conditions. Chemical precepts dictate that electrophilic agents, like cyclopentenone PG, should react readily with selenoproteins under conditions encountered in cells. Here we report that: (i) a prototypical PGA analog forms a covalent adduct with TrxR; (ii) analogous to the cyclopentenone PG, several representative, naturally occurring or synthetic aldehydes and ketones with electrophilic β-carbons (15-keto-PG, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and ethacrynic acid) impair p53 conformation and function, indirectly, via inhibition of TrxR; (iii) other redox-sensitive transcription factors governed by TrxR-Trx cycling, e.g. HIF, are also susceptible to inactivation by lipid aldehydes and ketones with electrophilic β-carbons; (iv) supplementation of cell culture medium with inorganic Se spares p53 from inactivation by lipid electrophiles; (v) impairment of p53 by lipid electrophiles is comparable in severity to loss of one allele of the p53 gene. Our results provide a novel framework to understand how these agents and numerous chemically related, endogenous and exogenous electrophiles might participate in carcinogenesis; how selenoproteins and dietary selenium may confer protection against cancer (13Ganther H.E.

Meuth, Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. We supplemented media with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. In certain experiments, cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi of 75Se, obtained from the University of Missouri Research Reactor, for 48 h to ensure that selenoproteins were labeled to steady state. For Neutravidin sequestration, we treated RKO and HCT 116 cells with 60 μm PGA1-APB for 4 h, or as described in the text. We lysed cells in 250 mm sucrose/50 mm Tris, pH 7.4/25 mm KCl/5 mmMgCl2/1 mm EDTA/1× Complete™ protease inhibitor/2 mm NaF/2 mm sodium orthovanadate. We sonicated the lysate twice for 5 s at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g, we incubated samples containing 200 μg of total cell lysate for 16 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of neutravidin beads in 1 ml of PBS with 0.4% Tween 20. We centrifuged the samples at 500 × g for 5 min to isolate the neutravidin-biotin complexes. We washed the beads 5 times with 1 ml of PBS/0.4% Tween 20. We fractionated samples by SDS-PAGE and detected the biotinylated proteins with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. We also reprobed the membrane with antibodies directed against Trx, TrxR, p53, p50/p105 of NFκB, and IKKα to determine whether they adhered to the Neutravidin beads. We lysed cells and incubated 200 μg of total cell lysate for 16 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of either Pab240 or Pab1620, antibodies that specifically recognize p53 in its mutant or wild-type conformation, respectively (21Legros Y.

We aspirated media, washed cells with PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C, and then lysed cells at 4 °C in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. We centrifuged the lysate at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and quantified luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in the supernatant fractions. We lysed RKO cells in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4/0.1 M NaCl/2 mm EDTA/1% SDS/1% deoxycholate/1 mm NaF/1 mm sodium orthovanadate/1× Complete™ protease inhibitors. We added 20 μl of protein lysate (3–4 μg/μl) to 100 μl of 20 μmTris, pH 7.4, containing 70 μm insulin, 66.6 μm Escherichia coli thioredoxin, 120 nm NADPH and 5.5 mm EDTA. We monitored the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm for 0–5 min at 25 °C or longer to ensure we measured the linear portion of the progress curve. We treated 106 HCT116 cells for 48 h with 20 μm amethopterin plus 0, 6, or 20 μm PGA2. We measured caspase-3 activity as an index of apoptosis (22Moos P.J. Fitzpatrick F.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 687-697PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that PGA2 did not interfere with caspase-3. To determine whether electrophilic PGs react with TrxR or other proteins we used PGA1 amidopentyl biotin (PGA1-APB). PGA1-APB retains the α, β-unsaturated ketone substituent and the electrophilic β-carbon of PGA1. Its C1 biotin amide, instead of a C1 carboxyl group, facilitates the detection of any covalent adducts it might form with proteins (Ref. 6Parker J. Prostaglandins. 1995; 50: 359-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To calibrate the utility of PGA1-ABP, we examined its interaction with IKKα, a protein putatively modified by cyclopentenone PG (7Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). We incubated intact RKO and HCT 116 colon cancer cells with PGA1-ABP (60 μm) for 4 h; sequestered any proteins with biotin epitopes on Neutravidin beads; fractionated these same biotinylated proteins by SDS-PAGE; and identified them immunochemically. Cells contained ∼15 proteins labeled de novo with PGA1-APB under these conditions; two of these proteins were IKKα (Fig. 2) and the p50/p105 subunit of NFκB (data not shown). Our data are the first direct evidence that cyclopentenone PG do covalently modify cellular IKK, as hypothesized (7Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), and they suggest that PGA1-ABP is useful for isolating and identifying proteins that react with cyclopentenone PG. Accordingly, we determined if PGA1-APB reacted with TrxR, the strongest candidate molecule for an indirect mechanism of action that leads to impairment of p53. RKO cells and two HCT 116 cell lines contained a protein modified covalently by PGA1-ABP and identified as TrxR immunochemically with anti-TrxR antibody (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3). The fact that HCT 116 p53+/+ and HCT 116 p53−/− cells each contained this ∼56-kDA protein excludes the possibility that it is a p53-PGA1-ABP adduct that migrates more slowly than p53 during fractionation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3). Incubation of cells with PGA1 alone, or aminopentyl biotin alone, did not generate proteins with biotin epitopes inserted de novo (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, the biotin epitope on the 56-kDa TrxR protein and other cellular proteins originates from their covalent reaction with PGA1-ABP, not its hydrolysis products in cells. We exploited the fact that TrxR is a selenoprotein to strengthen our conclusion that it forms an adduct with PGA1-ABP. We metabolically labeled RKO and HCT 116 cells with 75Se to incorporate it into their selenoproteins; repeated the previous experiment; and found a 75Se-labeled, 56-kDa protein recognized by anti-TrxR antibody among the proteins sequestered on neutravidin beads (Fig. 2 B). RKO cells and HCT 116 p53+/+ cells that are haplosufficient in p53 contained barely detectible amounts of p53 covalently modified by PGA1-APB when we conducted experiments analogous to those described above. In corresponding experiments in which we immunoprecipated p53 with anti-p53 antibodies; fractionated the precipitate by SDS-PAGE; and probed with neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase, we found no detectable biotinylated p53 adduct (data not shown). Thus, PGA1-ABP does not react to an appreciable extent with p53, itself, in intact cells. As expected, the HCT 116 p53−/− cells that lack p53 did not contain any modified protein corresponding to p53. In addition to TrxR, we examined Trx, the substrate of TrxR. RKO cells contained a 12-kDa species labeled by PGA1-ABP and identified as Trx with anti-Trx antibody (data not shown). The 12-kDa species also immunoprecipitated with anti-Trx antibody and reacted positively with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, consistent with its annotation as a Trx:PGA1-ABP adduct. Several representative electrophilic lipids also inhibited p53 transactivation, p53 conformation, TrxR activity, and HIF transactivation with a similar rank order of potency (Fig. 3). 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a decomposition product of linoleic or arachidonic acid hydroperoxides was the most potent inhibitor followed by J- and A-series cyclopentenone PG; ethacryinic acid, and 15-keto PGF2α, the main pulmonary metabolite of PGF2α. Under our experimental conditions malodialdehyde and PGB1 were inactive, as expected, because exogenously added malodialdehyde does not penetrate cell membranes readily and PGB1 has an inert β-carbon. We investigated the kinetic features of p53 inactivation by PGA1 to assess their compatibility with inhibition of TrxR. We exposed RKO cells to 50 μm etoposide for 6 h to initiate genomic damage and time-dependent accumulation of wild-type p53. We added PGA1 simultaneously with etoposide at t = 0 h or at 1, 2 and 4 h after the addition of etoposide. PGA1 impaired p53 transcription maximally when present throughout the entire 6-h duration of the experiment. When added at intervals after etoposide, PGA1 impaired p53 transactivation proportionately to exposure time (Fig. 4 A). For example, when present only for the final two h, t = 4 - 6 h, PGA1 did not impair p53 transactivation or conformation significantly (95%versus 100%). TrxR is a selenoprotein whose cellular steady-state level depends on selenium availability (23Berggren M. Gallegos A. Gasdaska J. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3377-3380PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gallegos A. Berggren M. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4965-4970PubMed Google Scholar). Most tissue culture media is partially deficient in selenium (∼0.1 μm). Tumor suppressor p53 was less vulnerable to impairment by PGA2 when cells were grown in media supplemented with 1 μm inorganic Se. Half-maximal impairment of p53 required exposure to ∼3-fold more PGA2 (IC50 = 60 μmPGA2) in cells grown with supplemental seleniumversus cells with no supplementation (IC50 = 20 μm PGA2) (Fig. 4 B). Auranofin is chemically unrelated to cyclopentenone PG or other electrophilic lipids, but it is an inhibitor of TrxR activity (23Berggren M. Gallegos A. Gasdaska J. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3377-3380PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams C.H., Jr. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Auranofin impaired the conformation of p53 and transcription by p53 and HIF (Fig. 4 C), analogous to the electrophilic lipids depicted in Fig. 3. Bunz and colleagues recently established that p53 haplosufficiency is proportional to p53-mediated apoptosis in vitro using a panel of isogenic HCT 116 cells in which p53 alleles were disrupted experimentally (20Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). We used these same cell lines to compare the functional consequences of p53 inactivation by electrophilic agentsversus the functional consequences of genetic deletion of p53 alleles. Consistent with previous results (20Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) amethopterin induced apoptosis proportional to p53 haplosufficiency (caspase-3 activity in HCT 116 p53+/+ > HCT 116 p53+/− > HCT 116 p53−/−) (Fig. 5, bars to right). When we incubated the HCT 116 p53+/+ cells with amethopterin plus PGA2, the PGA2antagonized apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, bars to left). Apoptosis in HCT 116 p53+/+ cells treated with 6–20 μmPGA1 plus amethopterin corresponded approximately to apoptosis in the HCT 116 p53+/− cells treated with amethopterin alone. In other words, chemical impairment of p53 approximates the loss of at least one allele of p53. We recently discovered that electrophilic cyclopentenone PG impair the p53 tumor suppressor by a novel mechanism that is distinct from mutation of the p53 gene or functional inactivation of p53 by oncoproteins like mdm-2. Since our initial report (1Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have sought the precise molecular mechanism responsible for this effect. Here we report that cyclopentenone PG act by covalently modifying and inhibiting TrxR. This indirect mechanism can account fully for the p53 phenotype in cells exposed to cyclopentenone PG, as well as other representative electrophilic lipids. To develop our mechanism-of-action hypothesis, we integrated three independent observations: (i) PGA1 and PGA2impair the conformation, transactivation, and function of p53 (1Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); (ii) PGA1-ABP reacts covalently with TrxR and Trx (Fig. 2); and (iii) TrxR-Trx coupling maintains p53 and several other redox-sensitive proteins and transcription factors in an active state (8Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 9Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 10Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest a model with several testable predictions. First, our model predicts that many other chemical agents with an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and accessible, electrophilic β-carbons should impair p53 conformation and function. Second, these chemical agents should impair p53 transcription and p53 conformation and inhibit TrxR activity with the same rank order of potency, if they act indirectly via TrxR. Third, these agents should impair transactivation by other redox-sensitive transcription factors,e.g. hypoxia-inducible factor (10Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 26Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the same rank order of potency with which they impair TrxR and p53. Our results affirm each of these predictions. Our model also predicts that PGA1 will impair p53 only as it accumulates during the initial, early stage of the cellular response to DNA damage, but not later, after it has assumed a transcriptionally active, wild-type conformation. By inhibiting the disulfide reductase activity of TrxR-Trx, PGA1 should prevent assembly of p53 into a mature conformation, but it should not convert p53 from an active to an inactive conformation. Kinetic experiments affirmed this prediction. Last, the molecular mechanism of action we propose can resolve a paradox. Namely, A-series PG antagonize p53-dependent apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest. These effects are fully compatible with inhibition of TrxR. Inhibition of TrxR-Trx cycling deranges the assembly of p53 into a transcriptionally competent form; this manifests as antagonism of p53-mediated processes, such as apoptosis. Inhibition of TrxR-Trx cycling can derange the redox status and catalytic competence of ribonucleotide reductase; this manifests as cell-cycle arrest in G1 because ribonucleotide reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis. Our mechanistic framework is supported, but not necessarily proven, by our data. Notably, our framework aligns well with yeast genetic experiments indicating that TrxR is essential for transcription by p53 (11Pearson G.D. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5431-5434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Casso D. Beach D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 518-529PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on TrxR, we observed that PGA1-APB binds covalently to thioredoxin, the substrate of TrxR. TrxR and Trx are vital components of a regulatory cycle and they act coordinately to maintain p53 conformation and function. Biologically, the reductase activity of TrxR maintains Trx in a reduced state so that it is competent to function as a sulfhydryl-disulfide isomerase (8Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It is possible that covalent binding to, and direct inactivation of Trx is also important for p53 inactivation. In other words, electrophilic lipids inhibit Trx directly, via irreversible, covalent binding and indirectly via their effects on TrxR. Certain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with electrophilic carbons are known risk factors for cancer, e.g. acrolein, malodialdehyde, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. Their carcinogenic mechanism is best understood in terms of their direct interaction with DNA (27Basu A.K. O'Hara S.M. Valladier P. Stone K. Mols O. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1988; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Basu A.K. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2848-2854PubMed Google Scholar, 29Basu A.K. Marnett L.J. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our data and model provide a new molecular basis for appreciating their carcinogenic effects. Aside from these well established carcinogens, many chemically complex α,β-unsaturated ketones and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are considered safer because they have low rates of reaction with DNA and reduced glutathione (30Parker J. Ankel H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dipple and colleagues have termed these agents “stealth carcinogens” (31Khan Q.A. Vousden K.H. Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2313-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) because the unusual elements of this phenotype occur in tumors. Our data and model provide a new molecular basis for appreciating and reassessing the safety of such compounds. The cyclopentenone PG provoke an unusual and distinctive phenotype typified by accumulation of p53 protein in an abnormal conformation that cannot support DNA binding and transcription. We have tested a set of representative electrophilic chemicals that include agents derived from the cyclooxygenase pathway (malondialdehyde, metabolites of prostaglandins, e.g.15-keto-PGF2 α, and dehydration products, e.g.PGA2 or Δ12-PGJ2) and agents derived from the lipoxygenase pathways (e.g. 4-HNE generated by decomposition of hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids. Based on chemical precepts, we anticipate that electrophilic carbons on numerous other compounds would confer a similar ability to inhibit TrxR. Cells can encounter electrophilic chemicals via environmental exposure, dietary exposure, or normal metabolic processes. We draw special attention to inflammation as one of these processes. As part of their normal host-defense function, inflammation inevitably exposes proximal epithelial and stromal cells to substances with mutagenic potentialin vitro (18Fitzpatrick F.A. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1651-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Individual eicosanoids with α,β-unsaturated ketone substituents like PGA1 or PGA2 may not occur in μm concentrations at a site of inflammation. However, inflammatory exudate contains a blend of electrophiles typified by α,β-unsaturated aldehydes derived from eicosanoid biosynthesis or lipid peroxidation (4-HNE); α,β-unsaturated ketones derived from eicosanoid metabolism (15-keto-PGF2α, 15-keto-PGE2, 5-, 12-, and 15-oxo-ETE); and α,β-unsaturated ketones derived from albumin dehydrating PGE2 to PGA2 and PGD2to Δ12- PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12-PGJ2(32Shibata T.

Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inflammation likely exposes cells to a mixture of electrophiles in quantities sufficient to impair TrxR. Note that 4-HNE, a common product from lipid peroxidation, potently inactivates the selenoprotein TrxR. The level of endogenous 4-HNE in tissues ranges from 0.1 to 3.0 μm and increases to ∼10 μm in conditions of oxidative stress (36Esterbauer H. Eckl P. Ortner A. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although purely speculative at this point, our mechanistic framework aligns well with the lipid mediator class switching hypothesis recently proposed by Serhan and colleagues (37Levy B.D. Clish C.B. Schmidt B. Gronert K. Serhan C.N. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that J-series cyclopentenone PG are present during resolution phases of inflammation and attenuate the inflammatory response (33Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Electrophilic lipoxins would also be present and perhaps act through a common mechanism involving TrxR inhibition. The same electrophilic cyclopentenone PG and lipid aldehydes that impair conformation and repress transcription by p53 can also repress transcription and antagonize the effects of NFκB (7Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 38Straus D.S. Pascual G., Li, M. Welch J.S. Ricote M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18223-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This may also occur via an irreversible, covalent modification of proteins. For instance, cyclopentenone PG of the A and J series or 4-HNE can form adducts with IKK (7Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 40Ji C. Kozak K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35530-35536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) in situ. Investigators have inferred that repression of NFκB in cells derives from this mechanism. However, they have demonstrated adduct formation only with isolated NFκB and IκB proteins in situ, not in cells (7Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 38Straus D.S. Pascual G., Li, M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18223-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). With the PGA1-APB analog, we have now demonstrated direct alkylation of IKK in cells. Therefore, electrophilic lipids may resolve inflammation through direct and indirect mechanisms to attenuate cellular signaling pathways. The fact that several of these types of chemicals can impair the p53 tumor suppressor and that the functional consequences of its impairment rival the loss of a p53 allele may have broad implications for cancer progression. The fact that electrophilic lipids act indirectly via a selenoprotein may have implications for cancer prevention. For instance, our model predicts that selenium supplementation of culture medium should maintain TrxR activity and thereby spare p53 from inactivation by electrophilic lipids. We affirmed this prediction. Clark and colleagues have reported that supplementation of dietary selenium lowers the risk of prostate, colon, and certain other cancers (41Clark L.C. Combs G.F., Jr. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher J.L., Jr. Park H.K. Sanders B.B., Jr. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this phenomenon, especially the role of selenoproteins, is uncertain. Our observation that selenium spares an important tumor suppressor, p53, provides an explicit mechanistic framework to understand how dietary selenium confers protection against cancer. Approximately 50–60% of cancer patients have tumors harboring mutations or deletions of p53. These patients typically have a poorer prognosis than patients with tumors harboring wild-type p53 (20Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 42Goh H.S. Yao J. Smith D.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5217-5221PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, not all mutations are equally pernicious; certain classes may be worse than others. In particular, mutations associated with an altered conformation of p53 protein correlate with significantly shorter survival and poorer prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (43Borresen-Dale A.L.

We can recapitulate this unusual and unexplained p53 phenotype in cells by impairing their TrxR-Trx activity with electrophilic lipids, suggesting a potential role for TrxR-Trx, or related disulfide reductases, in its emergence. In summary, various electrophilic lipids have the capacity to repress transactivation by several redox-responsive transcription factors by covalently modifying regulatory proteins in the pathways, IKK in the case of the NFκB pathways and TrxR-Trx in the case of p53 and HIF.

The deadly cascade of events involves detrimental actions by free radicals and the activation of proapoptotic transcription factors, which finally result in neuronal destruction. Here, we provide direct evidence that the nutritionally essential trace element selenium has a pivotal role in neuronal susceptibility to excitotoxic lesions. First, we observed in neuronal cell cultures that addition of selenium in the form of selenite within the physiological range protects against excitotoxic insults and even attenuates primary damage. The neuroprotective effect of selenium is not directly mediated via antioxidative effects of selenite but requires de novo protein synthesis. Gel shift analysis demonstrates that this effect is connected to the inhibition of glutamate-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that selenium deficiency in vivo results in a massive increase in susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures and cell loss. These findings indicate the importance of selenium for prevention and therapy of excitotoxic brain damage."
https://openalex.org/W2146851796,"To address the different functions of Pol δ and FEN1 (Rad27) in Okazaki fragment maturation, exonuclease-deficient polymerase Pol δ-01 and Pol δ-5DV (corresponding to alleles pol3–01-(D321A, E323A) and pol3–5DV-(D520V), respectively) were purified and characterized in this process. In the presence of the replication clamp PCNA, both wild-type and exo− Pol δ carried out strand displacement synthesis with similar rates; however, initiation of strand displacement synthesis was much more efficient with Pol δ-exo−. When Pol δ-exo− encountered a downstream primer, it paused with 3–5 nucleotides of the primer displaced, whereas the wild type carried out precise gap filling. Consequently, in the absence of FEN1, Pol δ exonuclease activity was essential for closure of simple gaps by DNA ligase. Compared with wild type, Okazaki fragment maturation with Pol δ-exo−proceeded with an increased duration of nick translation prior to ligation. Maturation was efficient in the absence of Dna2 and required Dna2 only when FEN1 activity was compromised. In agreement with these results, the proposed generation of double strand breaks inpol3-exo − rad27 mutants was suppressed by the overexpression of DNA2. Further genetic studies showed that pol3-exo − rad27 double mutants were sensitive to alkylation damage consistent with an in vivo defect in gap filling by exonuclease-deficient Pol δ."
https://openalex.org/W2002093986,"Signaling from the Notch (N) receptor is essential for proper cell-fate determinations and tissue patterning in all metazoans. N signaling requires a presenilin (PS)-dependent transmembrane-cleaving activity that is closely related or identical to the gamma-secretase proteolysis of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, a potent gamma-secretase inhibitor reported to reduce amyloid-beta levels in transgenic mice, prevents N processing, translocation, and signaling in cell culture. This compound also induces developmental defects in Drosophila remarkably similar to those caused by genetic reduction of N. The appearance of this phenocopy depends on the timing and dose of compound exposure, and effects on N-dependent signaling molecules established its biochemical mechanism of action in vivo. Other gamma-secretase inhibitors caused similar effects. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of the drug-binding site(s) in Drosophila gamma-secretase is remarkably conserved vis-à-vis the same site(s) in the mammalian enzyme. These results show that genetics and developmental biology can help elucidate the in vivo site of action of pharmacological agents and suggest that organisms such as Drosophila may be used as simple models for in vivo prescreening of drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1529713622,"Changes in the intracellular reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) are crucial reduction-oxidation (redox) events that trigger downstream proliferation or death responses. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying redox-mediated cell signaling upon an oxidative insult by treating U937 cells with exogenous nonpermeable GSSG. This treatment results in a significant decrease of exofacial cell membrane thiol groups and intracellular decrement of GSH content, owing to its engagement in the formation of mixed disulfides. Changes in thioredoxin redox state were also observed, and they may be related to the activation of upstream ASK1 and selective induction of downstream p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, detectable by phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK. Moreover, an increase in reactive oxygen species production was detected, and cells were committed to apoptosis along the mitochondrial pathway, evidenced by Bcl-2 down-regulation, cytochome c release from mitochondria, caspase-9 cleavage, and caspase-3 activation. GSH ethyl ester, a precursor of GSH, by counteracting intracellular mixed disulfide formation, canceled both p38 MAPK activation and GSSG-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of thioredoxin oxidation and stabilization of thioredoxin/ASK1 complex, whereas, blockage of p38 MAPK by specific inhibitor SB 203580 allowed apoptosis at a very reduced extent. Results suggest that kinase cascade may serve as a primary transducer of cytoplasmic oxidative signals to the nucleus before apoptosis-inducing signals are activated."
https://openalex.org/W2146362515,"Clustering of macrophage Fcγ receptors by multimeric immunoglobulin complexes leads to their internalization. Formation of small aggregates leads to endocytosis, whereas large particulate complexes induce phagocytosis. In RAW-264.7 macrophages, Fcγ receptor endocytosis was found to be dependent on clathrin and dynamin and insensitive to cytochalasin. Clathrin also associates with nascent phagosomes, and earlier observations suggested that it plays an essential role in phagosome formation. However, we find that phagocytosis of IgG-coated large (≥3 μm) particles was unaffected by inhibition of dynamin or by reducing the expression of clathrin using antisense mRNA but was eliminated by cytochalasin, implying a distinct mechanism dependent on actin assembly. The uptake of smaller particles (≤1 μm) was only partially blocked by cytochalasin. Remarkably, the cytochalasin-resistant component was also insensitive to dominant-negative dynamin I and to clathrin antisense mRNA, implying the existence of a third internalization mechanism, independent of actin, dynamin, and clathrin. The uptake of small particles occurred by a process distinct from fluid phase pinocytosis, because it was not inhibited by dominant-negative Rab5. The insensitivity of phagocytosis to dominant-negative dynamin I enabled us to test the role of dynamin in phagosomal maturation. Although internalization of receptors from the plasma membrane was virtually eliminated by the K44A and S45N mutants of dynamin I, clearance of transferrin receptors and of CD18 from maturing phagosomes was unaffected by these mutants. This implies that removal of receptors from the phagosomal membrane occurs by a mechanism that is different from the one mediating internalization of the same receptors at the plasma membrane. These results imply that, contrary to prevailing notions, normal dynamin and clathrin function is not required for phagocytosis and reveal the existence of a component of phagocytosis that is independent of actin and Rab5.

Some phagocytic receptors interact directly with the pathogens, by recognizing motifs that are conserved on the surface of various types of microorganisms (1Janeway C.A., Jr. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Google Scholar, 2Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Google Scholar). A second group of receptors interact instead with opsonins, host molecules such as antibodies, or complement components that coat the surface of the microorganisms (3Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Google Scholar). The latter class includes Fcγ receptors, which bind to the constant region of IgG. Fcγ receptors are involved in the recognition and elimination of IgG-coated microbes, erythrocytes, and platelets and in the clearance of IgG-containing immune complexes, thereby playing a role in antigen presentation (4Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 279-284Google Scholar, 5Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 385-390Google Scholar). Abnormal function or regulation of Fcγ receptors may lead to the ineffective clearance of infectious organisms or can cause immunohematologic and autoimmune disorders (4Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 279-284Google Scholar). In phagocytes the mode of internalization of Fcγ receptors depends on the size of the opsonized complex. Small immune complexes and soluble aggregated IgG are internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis (6Mellman I.S. Plutner H. Steinman R.M. Unkeless J.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 887-895Google Scholar, 7Mellman I. Plutner H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1170-1177Google Scholar, 8Hedin U. Stenseth K. Thyberg J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 35: 41-48Google Scholar). In contrast, the internalization of IgG-opsonized particles occurs via phagocytosis (9Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Google Scholar). Although cross-linking of Fcγ receptors triggers both internalization processes, the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis and endocytosis differ markedly. Endocytosis requires assembly of clathrin at the site of receptor clustering, yet is not strictly dependent on the cytoskeleton and does not require class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (10Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Google Scholar). In contrast, phagocytosis involves acute assembly of F-actin and is blocked by inhibitors of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, such as wortmannin (11Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Google Scholar, 12Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Google Scholar). A recent study further highlighted the mechanistic differences between the two modes of Fcγ receptor internalization (13Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Google Scholar); endocytosis, but not phagocytosis, was found to require receptor-induced ubiquitination. Even though phagocytosis is thought to be driven by remodeling of actin, assembly of clathrin and of the associated proteins dynamin and amphiphysin has been reported to occur at sites of phagocytosis (14Aggeler J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 613-623Google Scholar, 15Gold E.S. Morrissette N.S. Underhill D.M. Guo J. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 285-292Google Scholar, 16Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Google Scholar). The purpose of this clathrin recruitment may be to drive the budding and fission of vesicles from the nascent phagosomes, contributing to their maturation process. In this regard, it is noteworthy that phagosome maturation is akin to the progression of the endocytic pathway and that clathrin assembles on endocytic vesicles and is thought to contribute to the maturation of endosomes (17Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Google Scholar, 18Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Google Scholar). To date, however, the role of clathrin-coated vesicles in phagosome maturation has not been studied. The paucity of information likely stems from the fact that, unexpectedly, interference with the formation and/or detachment of the clathrin coat resulted in inhibition of phagocytosis. Thus, impairment of the function of clathrin (19Perry D.G. Daugherty G.L. Martin W.J., II J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 380-386Google Scholar), dynamin II (15Gold E.S. Morrissette N.S. Underhill D.M. Guo J. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 285-292Google Scholar), or amphiphysin II (16Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Google Scholar) all markedly depressed the phagocytic efficiency. Clathrin-dependent membrane budding and fission are also essential for the secretory and recycling pathways (20Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Google Scholar, 21Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the seemingly paradoxical effects of clathrin impairment on phagocytosis may be indirect, caused by depletion of plasmalemmal components that are required for the phagocytic process. To address this possibility and to analyze the role of clathrin in phagosome maturation, we used an isoform of dynamin that is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. Three isoforms of dynamin have been described. Dynamin I is abundant in the brain, and dynamin III is abundant in testis, lung, and neurons (22Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Google Scholar), whereas dynamin II is ubiquitous. Importantly, whereas dynamin II is found both in endomembranes and at the plasma membrane, dynamin I is predominantly plasmalemmal (23Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Google Scholar). We reasoned that transfection of cells with a dominant-negative form of dynamin I was less likely to result in an indirect inhibition of phagocytosis and would enable us to compare the requirement of clathrin in endocytosis versus phagocytosis and to assess the possible role of clathrin-dependent budding in phagosomal maturation. In addition, we used antisense technology to depress the level of clathrin. By controlling the expression of the heavy chain using an inducible vector, we were able to assess the role of clathrin in Fcγ receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis with minimal nonspecific damage to the cells.

RAW 264.7 murine macrophages obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. Transient transfection of RAW 264.7 cells with clathrin-GFP, dynamin (Dyn) I (K44A), Dyn II (K44A), Dyn I (S45N), wild-type (WT) dynamin, and Rab5(S34N)-GFP, a GFP-labeled dominant-negative (DN) form of Rab5, was performed utilizing FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were used 24 h after transfection of clathrin and DN-Rab5 and 48 h after dynamin transfection. BHK21-tTA cells transfected with antisense clathrin heavy chain (24Torgersen M.L.

Plasmids encoding Dyn I K44A, Dyn S45N, and Dyn WT were generously provided by Dr. S. L. Schmid (Department of Cell Biology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Dyn II K44A cDNA was prepared as described (16Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Google Scholar). Rab5(S34N)-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. C. Bucci (Universita degli Studi de Lecce, Lecce, Italy). Endocytosis was assessed by quantifying the uptake of Tf or aggregated human IgG. Prior to Tf uptake determinations RAW 264.7 cells grown on 25-mm coverslips were pre-incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h. Rhodamine-Tf (50 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Tf bound extracellularly was removed by washing cells sequentially in media of pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. Human IgG (10 mg/ml) was aggregated by heating to 62 °C for 20 min. Insoluble complexes were sedimented, and 1 mg/ml of soluble aggregated IgG was added to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Internalized IgG complexes were identified by incubating cells with anti-human Cy3-conjugated antibodies (1:1000). Sheep RBC were opsonized with rabbit anti-sheep RBC antibody (1:50) and latex beads with 1 mg/ml human IgG at 37 °C for 1 h. Opsonized RBC or latex beads were added to RAW 264.7 macrophages grown on coverslips (30–50 RBC or beads per RAW 264.7 cell) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. External RBC were lysed by hypotonic shock with distilled water, lysis was terminated by addition of 10× PBS, and the cells were washed and resuspended in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium. Unbound particles were washed, and external beads were labeled in the cold with Cy3-conjugated anti-human antibody. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the beads were labeled with Cy5-conjugated anti-human antibody. Those beads that were Cy5-positive but Cy3-negative were considered to be internalized. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated dextran (500 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS, and either visualized immediately or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h prior to visualization. Phagocytosis of opsonized RBC by RAW 264.7 cells were induced as described above. After 5 min at 37 °C the external RBC were lysed, and maturation of the phagosomes containing internalized RBC were allowed to proceed for 1 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h followed by permeabilization and blocking in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% milk. The cells were next immunostained with anti-human Tf receptor (1:500), anti-mouse CD18 (1:500), or anti-mouse LAMP1 (1:4) antibodies. Cy3-conjugated secondary anti-mouse and anti-rat antibodies were used as appropriate, at 1:1500 dilution. Samples were analyzed using a Leica fluorescence microscope (model DMIRB) with a ×100 oil immersion objective and appropriate filter sets. All cells and phagosomes were identified under DIC optics. Images were acquired digitally utilizing a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Micromax; Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) controlled by the Winview software. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. The presence of Tf receptor, CD18, or LAMP1 in the phagosomal membrane was scored in individual phagosomes in an all-or-none basis. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between means was assessed utilizing Student's t test. Upon binding to Fcγ receptors, IgG-containing immune complexes are internalized and travel along the endocytic pathway where they are targeted for degradation. This is part of a key process involved in antigen processing and presentation (6Mellman I.S. Plutner H. Steinman R.M. Unkeless J.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 887-895Google Scholar,7Mellman I. Plutner H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1170-1177Google Scholar). Transient expression of a fusion of the light chain of clathrin with EGFP was used to examine whether clathrin is involved in the receptor-mediated endocytosis of aggregated IgG by RAW 264.7 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1, A−C, EGFP-clathrin was found to colocalize with some, but not all, of the immune complexes undergoing internalization. The partial colocalization may be attributed to asynchrony of the internalization process, or to the co-existence of clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent uptake pathways. It is noteworthy that another immunoreceptor, the interleukin 2 receptor, is internalized primarily via clathrin-independent endocytosis (28Lamaze C. Dujeancourt A. Baba T., Lo, C.G. Benmerah A. Dautry-Varsat A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 661-671Google Scholar). Next, we assessed whether clathrin is associated with phagosomes during engulfment of IgG-opsonized particles. RAW 264.7 cells transiently transfected with EGFP-clathrin were incubated with IgG-opsonized RBC for 5 min and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. In agreement with the report by Aggeler and Werb (14Aggeler J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 613-623Google Scholar), we were able to detect clathrin on the membrane of nascent phagosomes (Fig. 1, D andE). We also analyzed whether dynamin I associated with the phagosomal membrane. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged wild-type dynamin I and analyzed by confocal microscopy following immunostaining. It is noteworthy that, prior to phagocytosis, dynamin I was associated with the plasma membrane but not with endomembranes (not shown). Upon addition of opsonized particles, dynamin I accumulated markedly in the phagosomal cup (Fig. 1 F), resembling the distribution of dynamin II reported by Gold et al. (16Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Google Scholar). Severing of clathrin-coated pits to form intracellular vesicles requires functional dynamin (29Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Google Scholar, 31van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar). To assess the role of clathrin-dependent vesiculation in Fcγ receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis, we transfected cells with an inactive form of dynamin I (Dyn I K44A), which has been reported to exert a dominant-negative effect (29Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 31van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar). To identify the transfected cells, Dyn I K44A was cotransfected with soluble EGFP (10:1 cDNA ratio). Because Dyn I K44A was tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope, we were able to verify the effectiveness of co-transfection (>90%) and, in addition, confirmed that the dominant-negative protein was largely associated with the plasma membrane (not illustrated). Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of Dyn I K44A on receptor-mediated endocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Uptake of Tf was greatly diminished in cells expressing the dominant-negative construct, identified by expression of co-transfected EGFP (Fig. 2,A−C). For these and all subsequent experiments, cells were incubated 48 h post-transfection, because inhibition at this time was greater than after 24 h (data not shown). The inhibition was not a consequence of the transfection process per se, because expression of wild-type dynamin I was without effect. Moreover, expression of a second dynamin I mutant (Dyn I S45N), also reported to be inhibitory (32Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Google Scholar), similarly obliterated Tf uptake (Fig. 2 D). These findings are in good agreement with the effects of dynamin I mutants in other cell types (29Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J.

Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Google Scholar). The effect of dominant-negative dynamin I on Fcγ receptor-mediated endocytosis was studied next (Fig. 3). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with Dyn I K44A, and their ability to internalize aggregated IgG was quantified. As before, transfected cells were identified by co-expression of EGFP (Fig. 3 B), and uptake of IgG was determined following permeabilization and addition of labeled anti-IgG antibody (Fig. 3 C). As summarized in Fig. 3 D, inhibition of dynamin function reduced IgG uptake by >80%. We next tested the effect of Dyn I K44A on phagocytosis. We anticipated that the preferential association of this isoform with the plasma membrane would resolve whether the reported inhibitory effects of dynamin II and other clathrin-disrupting maneuvers reflect a direct role of plasmalemmal clathrin in phagocytosis or are indirect (see Introduction). As shown in Fig. 4 A, phagocytosis was scored by DIC microscopy following hypotonic lysis of adherent extracellular RBC. In the transfected cells, phagocytosis was also apparent from the exclusion of EGFP from areas of the cytosol (Fig. 4 B). Remarkably, Dyn I K44A had only a modest, statistically insignificant effect on phagocytosis, which was not different from that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 C). Similar negative results were obtained using Dyn I S45N (Fig. 4 C), under conditions where IgG endocytosis was largely eliminated. These results contrast sharply with those obtained earlier by Goldet al. (16Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Google Scholar) using the equivalent dominant-negative form of dynamin II (Dyn II K44A). To ensure that these results reflect distinct properties of the two isoforms and not differences in the experimental system we tested the effect of transient transfection of Dyn II K44A on RAW 264.7 cells. Under conditions like those of Fig. 4, transiently transfected Dyn II K44A inhibited phagocytosis of IgG-coated sheep RBC by ≥85%. In view of the apparent discrepancy between the data obtained with dynamin I and II, we sought alternative ways of assessing the involvement of the clathrin complex in phagocytosis. To this end, we used a cell line in which the expression level of the heavy chain of clathrin can be controlled by inducing the expression of antisense mRNA (24Torgersen M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3737-3747Google Scholar, 25Llorente A. Prydz K. Sprangers M. Skretting G. Kolset S.O. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 335-343Google Scholar, 26Iversen T.G. Skretting G. Llorente A. Nicoziani P. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2099-2107Google Scholar). The BHK cells into which the tetracycline-regulated expression of antisense mRNA was engineered, however, are normally unable to internalize IgG-coated particles. This problem was circumvented by transiently expressing GFP-tagged human FcγRIIA receptors in these cells, 24 h prior to the assay. Prior to stimulation, these receptors are largely localized to the plasmalemma, with a fraction found in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes (not shown). As shown in Fig. 5,A and B, addition of aggregated IgG displaced most of the receptors to an intracellular compartment, where they co-localized with the ligand. Partial depletion of the heavy chain of clathrin by expression of antisense mRNA resulted in a pronounced (≥90%) inhibition of endocytosis of aggregated IgG and prevented the internalization of plasmalemmal receptors (Fig. 5, C,D, and G). The clathrin dependence of phagocytosis was tested next. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, engulfment of IgG-coated beads persisted in cells expressing clathrin antisense mRNA, under conditions where endocytosis was virtually obliterated. No significant difference in the phagocytic efficiency was noted in controlversus antisense-expressing cells (Fig. 5 G). These results are consistent with the observations made in cells expressing Dyn I K44A and indicate that, although essential for Fcγ receptor endocytosis, normal clathrin/dynamin function is not required for phagocytosis. The diametrically opposed effects of Dyn I K44A on Fcγ receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis suggests vastly different underlying processes, a notion supported by the effects of cytochalasin. This antagonist of actin assembly precludes phagocytosis of opsonized RBC but has no discernible effect on endocytosis (not illustrated). It is of interest, however, that the sensitivity of phagocytosis to cytochalasins has been reported to vary directly with the size of the particle (34Koval M. Preiter K. Adles C. Stahl P.D. Steinberg T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 265-273Google Scholar). Particles ≤1 μm in diameter can be internalized effectively in the presence of the actin antagonist. This range is of particular importance, as it encompasses the size of most pathogenic bacteria. The sensitivity of endocytosis to Dyn I K44A suggests that the actin-independent uptake of small particles may be mediated by clathrin/dynamin. To test this notion, we compared the effects of cytochalasin D and Dyn I K44A on the uptake of small (0.8 μm) and large (3.1 μm) IgG-opsonized latex particles. Particle internalization was scored by immunolabeling the opsonizing IgG before and after permeabilization of the cells. In accordance with the results obtained using RBC, phagocytosis of large beads was unaffected by Dyn I K44A (Fig. 6, A andE). Conversely, cytochalasin D inhibited the uptake of large beads completely, and no further effect was seen by expression of Dyn I K44A (Fig. 6, B and E). As reported earlier (34Koval M. Preiter K. Adles C. Stahl P.D. Steinberg T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 265-273Google Scholar), we found that cytochalasin had only a partial (∼40%) inhibitory effect on the phagocytosis of small (0.8 μm) beads (Fig. 6, D and E). Unexpectedly, expression of Dyn I K44A had no significant effect on the uptake of small particles and only marginally enhanced the inhibition induced by cytochalasin (Fig. 6, C−E). In accordance with this observation, we also found that the uptake of small beads was essentially unaffected by clathrin antisense mRNA (Fig. 5, F and G). Jointly, these observations imply that small particles are ingested, in part, by a mechanism that differs from that used by both large particles and immune complexes. Unlike most receptor-associated solutes, extracellular fluids are taken up by cells by a pinocytic process that is independent of clathrin, yet exquisitely sensitive to inhibitory forms of Rab5 (35Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Google Scholar, 36Mukhopadhyay A. Barbieri A.M. Funato K. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1227-1237Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that an analogous Rab5-dependent process could contribute to small particle uptake. We therefore tested the effects of a dominant-negative form of Rab5 on Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis of small beads. To ensure the effectiveness of the construct we also assessed the pinocytic uptake of the fluid phase marker rhodamine-dextran. As shown in Fig. 7, A, B, andG, expression of DN-Rab5 obliterated fluid phase uptake in macrophages. In contrast, DN-Rab5 had no discernible effect on the ingestion of small particles (Fig. 7, E−G). Therefore, the actin- and dynamin-resistant ingestion of small IgG-coated particles is not akin to pinocytosis. Rab5 mediates the stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor by its ligand (37Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Fcγ receptor endocytosis was unaffected by DN-Rab5 (Fig. 7, C and D), implying a different mode of activation. The ability of RAW 264.7 cells to engulf IgG-opsonized particles despite the expression of dominant-negative dynamin I enabled us to analyze the role of clathrin-dependent fission in phagosome maturation. The transition between the early and intermediate stages of maturation is marked by the removal of Tf receptors from the phagosomal membrane, a process that in RAW cells is completed ∼30 min after completion of phagocytosis (38Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the rate of depletion of Tf receptors from phagosomes formed in cells expressing Dyn I K44A. Inhibition of Tf endocytosis by Dyn I K44A, as reported in Fig. 2, results in a concomitant accumulation of Tf receptors on the plasma membrane of the transfected cells (Fig. 8, A−C), facilitating detection of their rate of removal from the phagosomes. Despite the overabundance of Tf receptors in the membrane of Dyn I K44A-transfected cells, the receptors were rapidly cleared from the phagosomes shortly after internalization (Fig. 8, G−I). Quantification of the kinetics of removal from phagosomes showed that the half-life of Tf receptors in the phagosomes of Dyn I K44A-expressing cells was 10 min (Fig. 8 J), which is similar to that we reported earlier for untreated RAW 264.7 cells (38Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Google Scholar). Because the endocytosis of Tf was demonstrably impaired in the plasma membrane of these cells, as indicated by the accumulation of receptors at the plasmalemma, we conclude that different processes mediate the budding and fission of Tf receptor-containing vesicles from the surface and phagosomal membranes. Similar results were obtained when we measured the traffic of another plasmalemmal protein, CD18, a subunit of leukocyte integrins. In otherwise untreated cells, CD18 was found to be incorporated into newly formed phagosomes and was subsequently removed during the course of phagosomal maturation, becoming undetectable by 40 min. Essentially identical results were obtained in cells transfected with Dyn I K44A (data not shown). During the course of maturation, phagosomes sequentially fuse with early and late endosomes and eventually with lysosomes. The late stages of the maturation process are characterized by the acquisition of LAMP-1, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes. Because clathrin assembles on endosomes (18Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Google Scholar) and is also important in the delivery of proteins to prelysosomes by the trans-Golgi (39Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Google Scholar), we studied whether recruitment of LAMP-1 to late phagosomes requires functional dynamin. In untreated cells, LAMP-1 acquisition by phagosomes becomes apparent by 10 min and proceeds to reach a plateau by ∼30 min (Fig. 9). In Dyn I K44A-transfected cells the course of LAMP-1 recruitment to the phagosomes was virtually identical (Fig. 9 D). Thus, the acquisition of LAMP-1 by phagosomes appears to be a dynamin I-independent process. Dynamin has been reported to be an important mediator of budding and scission of clathrin-coated structures such as endocytic pits (29Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Google Scholar, 31van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar, 33Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Google Scholar) and those derived from the trans-Golgi network (40Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Google Scholar, 41Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Google Scholar). We found that endocytosis of aggregated IgG was virtually eliminated by Dyn I K44A (Fig. 3), adding Fcγ receptor endocytosis to the list of dynamin-dependent processes. Because dynamin is intimately linked to clathrin-dependent endocytosis, this process is also likely to mediate the internalization of immune complexes. However, dynamin has also been implicated in the fission of non-clathrin coated vesicles such as caveolae (42Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Google Scholar, 43Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Google Scholar). Two observations argue against a role for caveolae in Fcγ receptor internalization. First, at least some of the sites of Fcγ receptor accumulation were decorated with clathrin (Fig. 1), and second, extraction of plasmalemmal cholesterol using methylcyclodextrin (10 mm for 30 min) did not prevent the endocytosis of aggregated IgG by RAW 264.7 cells (not illustrated). More importantly, we found that partial depletion of clathrin using antisense mRNA virtually eliminated endocytosis of aggregated IgG. We therefore concluded that a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process is largely responsible for internalization of immune complexes. Recently, Gold et al. (15Gold E.S. Morrissette N.S. Underhill D.M. Guo J. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 285-292Google Scholar) found that expression of dominant-negative dynamin II inhibited phagocytosis. Although we were able to reproduce the latter results, we also found that inhibitory forms of dynamin I were without effect on phagocytosis, under conditions where clathrin-dependent endocytosis was obliterated. To the extent that the two isoforms share a high degree of homology, it is unlikely that dynamin is required for pinching and scission of the phagosomal membrane. Indeed, Gold et al.(15Gold E.S. Morrissette N.S. Underhill D.M. Guo J. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 285-292Google Scholar) reported that in cells expressing dominant-negative dynamin II phagocytosis was arrested at an early stage, seemingly because of the inability of the cells to extend pseudopodia. This phenotype resembles the appearance of cells treated with wortmannin (12Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Google Scholar) and also of cells with impaired COP-I function (38Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Google Scholar), which are similarly defective in phagocytosis. Both of these conditions depress the delivery of endomembranes to the plasmalemma, whether from the secretory or recycling compartments. We therefore speculate that in cells expressing dominant-negative dynamin II, interference with the normal delivery of endomembranes to the surface or to a reserve pool may result in the depletion of components that are essential for pseudopod elongation. This effect is not observed in cells expressing inhibitory forms of dynamin I, likely because the latter are restricted to the surface membrane. Alternatively, dynamin II (but not dynamin I) may contribute to the assembly and remodeling of actin at the phagosomal cup. The differential sensitivity of endocytosis and phagocytosis to clathrin antisense mRNA and to inhibitory forms of dynamin emphasizes the divergence in the underlying molecular mechanisms and may reflect the differential requirement for ubiquitination. It has recently become apparent that receptor-initiated ubiquitination can trigger the recruitment of clathrin and the associated coating and scission machinery (44van Kerkhof P. Sachse M. Klumperman J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3778-3784Google Scholar). The involvement of clathrin in endocytosis is therefore not unexpected, inasmuch as Fcγ receptor endocytosis depends on ubiquitination. By contrast, phagocytosis of large particles proceeds normally in ubiquitination-deficient cells (13Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Google Scholar). It remains to be defined how Fcγ receptor-induced endocytosis and phagocytosis, two processes triggered by clustering of the same receptors, differ so drastically at the molecular level. We speculate that the more intense and prolonged stimulation elicited by large particles recruits additional signaling pathways that are not activated during endocytosis. Although uptake of aggregated IgG and large IgG-opsonized particles occur by clearly different mechanisms, the distinction is not as obvious in the case of smaller particles, particularly those in the size range of most bacteria (≤1 μm). We confirmed earlier observations (34Koval M. Preiter K. Adles C. Stahl P.D. Steinberg T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 265-273Google Scholar) that such particles are only modestly sensitive to cytochalasin but also found that, unlike immune complexes and soluble aggregated IgG, small particle uptake was virtually unaffected by inhibition of dynamin or by reduction of clathrin with antisense mRNA. Of note, uptake of small particles also proceeded at near normal rates in cells with impaired ubiquitination (not illustrated). The existence of a cytochalasin- and clathrin/dynamin-insensitive fraction of ingestion implies that small particles can be internalized by a mechanism distinct from conventional clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin-driven phagocytosis. We considered the possibility that a process akin to pinocytosis may be involved. However, this mechanism appears unlikely, because the uptake of small beads was not affected by DN-Rab5 under conditions where the uptake of a fluid phase marker was eliminated. Although clathrin may not be involved directly in the particle engulfment process, it is nevertheless recruited to the phagocytic cup, albeit in modest amounts. This may simply be the result of frustrated endocytosis, triggered by receptor cross-linking yet unable to proceed because of the physical size of the opsonized particle. However, the recruitment of clathrin to the cup may have an ulterior purpose, namely, to participate in the fission of vesicles from the phagosome during maturation. Although we could not identify a role for dynamin I in the recycling of Tf receptors or of CD18, or in the acquisition of LAMP-1, it is nevertheless likely that clathrin-coated vesicles are responsible for some aspect of phagosomal maturation, which is an elaborate phenomenon. It is noteworthy that Tf receptors are removed from the phagosomal membrane by a process that is insensitive to Dyn I K44A, whereas their budding and pinching from the plasma membrane is exquisitely sensitive to this dominant-negative mutant. This implies that the processes underlying the remodeling of the phagosomal membrane differ drastically from those of the plasma membrane wherefrom it originated. Little is currently known about the fission events that remove constituents from the early phagosome and that maintain near constant phagosomal size despite continued fusion of endomembranes throughout the maturation process. Earlier findings in εCOP-deficient cells and in cells treated with brefeldin A indicated that COP-1 plays a measurable yet comparatively minor role in phagosome remodeling (38Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Google Scholar). To test the cooperativity between the COP-I and clathrin pathways, we treated with brefeldin A (2 μg/ml) cells that had been transfected with Dyn I K44A. The expression of the dominant-negative dynamin did not accentuate the effects of brefeldin on the removal of Tf receptors and CD18, or on the acquisition of LAMP1 by the phagosomal membrane (data not shown). This implies that additional mechanisms operate during phagosome remodeling. Caveolae or other coating structures such as the nexin-retromer complex (45Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Google Scholar) may be primarily responsible for vesicular fission during phagosome maturation. Alternatively, clathrin-mediated fission that is insensitive to Dyn I K44A may be taking place. We thank Dr. J. H. Keen (Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) for advice and for providing clathrin light-chain cDNA. We also thank Dr. Otilia Vieira and Richard Collins for help."

Using IGF-1 transgenic mice that specifically express human recombinant IGF-1 in skeletal muscle, we test the hypotheses that targeted gene expression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle enhances motor nerve regeneration after a nerve crush injury. The IGF-1 transgene affects the initiation of the muscle repair process after nerve injury as shown by increased activation of SCA-1positive myogenic stem cells. Increased satellite cell differentiation and proliferation are observed in IGF-1 transgenic mice, shown by increased expression of Cyclin D1, MyoD, and myogenin. Expression of myogenin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, initially increased in both wild-type and IGF-1 transgenic mice, are restored to normal levels at a faster rate in IGF-1 transgenic mice, which indicates a rescue of nerve-evoked muscle activity. Expression of the IGF-1 transgene in skeletal muscle results in accelerated recovery of saltatory nerve conduction, increased innervation as detected by neurofilament expression, and faster recovery of muscle mass. These studies demonstrate that local expression of IGF-1 augments the repair of injured nerve and muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2156374661,"The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is essential for fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. ENaC consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which contains a PPxY motif that interacts with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle's syndrome in which mutations delete or alter the PPxY motif of either the beta or the gamma subunits, results in increased ENaC activity. We report here that Nedd4-2 has two major isoforms that show tissue-specific expression; however, both isoforms can inhibit ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. Because there are four WW domains in Nedd4-2, we analyzed binding kinetics and affinity between individual WW domains and ENaC subunits. Using whole cell patch-clamp techniques, we studied the role of individual WW domains in the regulation of ENaC in mammalian cells. We report here that unlike Nedd4, only two of the Nedd4-2 WW domains, WW3 and WW4, are required for both the binding to ENaC subunits and the regulation of Na+ feedback control of ENaC. Although both WW3 and WW4 individually can interact with all three ENaC subunits in vitro, both domains together are essential for in vivo function of Nedd4-2 in ENaC regulation. These data suggest that Nedd4-2 WW3 and WW4 interact with distinct, noninterchangeable sites in ENaC and that to prevent Na+ feedback control of ENaC it is necessary to occlude both sites."

Here, we demonstrate that mice infected with trypomastigotes develop potent edema after treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (or kininase II) inhibitor captopril. Experiments performed with specific kinin receptor (B2R/B1R) antagonists and knockout mice revealed that the early-phase (3-h) edema is mediated by the constitutive B2R, whereas the late-phase (24-h) response depends on stimulation of the up-regulated B1R. Given previous evidence that parasite invasion of cells expressing B2R is potentiated by captopril, we investigated the prerequisites for in vitro infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing either B1R or B2R, human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated by lipopolysaccharide, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that captopril potentiates parasite invasion regardless of the kinin (B2/B1) activation pathways, whereas DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid (MGTA), an inhibitor of kininase I (carboxypeptidase M/N), selectively decreases parasite infectivity for B1R-expressing cells. These data suggest that formation of the B1R agonist, i.e., [des-Arg] kinins, critically depends on the processing action of kininase I, here proposed as a potential pathogenesis cofactor. Collectively, our data suggest that fluctuations in the levels of kininases may modulate parasite infectivity and pathological outcome in Chagas' disease."

To identify the source and signal transduction pathway of ROS formation in SMC, we investigated PDGF-induced ROS formation. Stimulation of SMC with PDGF resulted in a rapid increase of ROS production. Using an inactivating antibody, we identified the increase to be dependent on p22phox, a NAD(P)H-oxidase subunit. ROS release was completely inhibited by the Gi protein inhibitor PTX as well as an antibody against Galphai1,2, however, not by antibodies against Galphai3/0, Gas, and Gbeta1beta2. The effect of PDGF on ROS production in SMC membranes could likewise be mimicked by the use of a recombinant Galphai2 subunit but not by Galphai3, Galphai0, Gas, and Gbetagamma subunits. Immunoaffinity chromatography demonstrated coupling of Galphai1,2 to the PDGF a-receptor, which, after preincubation of the SMC membranes with PDGF, was increased in the absence of GTPgammaS but decreased in the presence of GTPgammaS and prevented by PTX treatment. These data define a novel G protein-dependent mechanism by which PDGF signaling is transduced through direct coupling of the Gai1,2 subunit of the trimeric G proteins to the PDGF tyrosine kinase receptor."

However, CNTF has also been shown to cause weight loss in a variety of rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes, whereas a modified form also causes weight loss in humans. CNTF administration can correct or improve hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and hyperlipidemia associated with these models of obesity. In order to investigate the effects of CNTF on fat cells, we examined the expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins (LIFR, gp130, and CNTFRα) during adipocyte differentiation and the effects of CNTF on STAT, Akt, and MAPK activation. We also examined the ability of CNTF to regulate the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipogenic proteins. Our studies clearly demonstrate that the expression of two of the three CNTF receptor complex components, CNTFRα and LIFR, decreases during adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, gp130 expression is relatively unaffected by differentiation. In addition, preadipocytes are more sensitive to CNTF treatment than adipocytes, as judged by both STAT 3 and Akt activation.

Initially, CNTFRα was described as being distributed predominantly within neural tissues (7Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) but has since been reported in skeletal muscle, adrenal gland, sciatic nerve, skin, kidney, and testes (8Ip N.Y. Nye S.H.

CNTFRα can be cleaved from the cell surface and exist and act in a soluble form. The soluble CNTFRα has been detected in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid and has been shown to initiate signaling in cells not responsive to CNTF alone (6Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L.

Aldrich T.H., Ip, N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mice lacking CNTF develop normally and appear to have no visible defects well into adulthood, when they develop minor loss of motor neurons (10Masu Y. Wolf E. Holtmann B. Sendtner M. Brem G. Thoenen H. Nature. 1993; 365: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). However, mice lacking CNTFRα tend to have severe motor neuron defects and die perinatally because they fail to initiate feeding behaviors (11DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). CNTF signaling is initiated when CNTF binds CNTFRα, either in its soluble or membrane-bound form (12Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Once a CNTF·CNTFRα complex is formed, two of these heterodimers come together and recruit a gp130 transducer protein, followed by a subsequent recruitment of LIFR protein. The resulting receptor complex is a hexamer of CNTF, CNTFRα, gp130, and LIFR in a 2:2:1:1 ratio, respectively (13De Serio A. Graziani R. Laufer R. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Within this complex, CNTF and CNTFRα make direct contacts with all the complex components (7Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CNTF·CNTFRα is considered to be a low affinity binding complex until further bound to gp130 and LIFR (14Huber J. Dittrich F. Phelan P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aside from this hexameric, high affinity binding complex, CNTF can bind its receptors and can induce signaling in the absence of CNTFRα, solely by binding to a gp130:LIFR dimeric receptor (15Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Monville C. Coulpier M.

Although CNTF was first identified as a trophic factor in the ciliary ganglion, it was later found to act on other motor neuron populations (17Sendtner M. Arakawa Y. Stockli K.A. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 15: 103-109Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, it was evaluated as a therapeutic tool in patients suffering from motor neuron diseases (18Miller R.G. Petajan J.H. Bryan W.W. Armon C. Barohn R.J. Goodpasture J.C. Hoagland R.J. Parry G.J. Ross M.A. Stromatt S.C. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Interestingly, during these trials, CNTF administration resulted in unexpected weight loss (19ALS CNTF Treatment Study Group Neurology. 1996; 46: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies showed that, like leptin, CNTF can activate the same signaling molecules and that CNTFRα is co-localized with ObR in the hypothalamic nuclei involved in the regulation of feeding (20Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E.J. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). CNTF can also cross the blood-brain barrier in a manner similar to leptin (21Pan W. Kastin A.J. Maness L.M. Brennan J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 263: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CNTF treatment of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice was found to reduce adiposity, hyperphagia, and hyperinsulinemia associated with this genotype. Leptin administration had the same effect in these animals. However, unlike leptin, CNTF also corrected obesity-related phenotypes in leptin-resistant, ObR-deficient, db/db mice and in mice with diet-induced obesity that are partially resistant to leptin (22Lambert P.D. Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4652-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). CNTF and its synthetic analog, Axokine, have also been found to suppress NPY gene expression (23Xu B. Dube M.G. Kalra P.S. Farmerie W.G. Kaibara A. Moldawer L.L. Martin D. Kalra S.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and pCREB in the feeding-relevant brain sites (22Lambert P.D. Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4652-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The weight loss caused by CNTF administration is due to the preferential loss of fat (24Henderson J.T. Mullen B.J. Roder J.C. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is believed to occur by resetting the hypothalamic weight set point, such that cessation of CNTF treatment does not result in overeating and rebound weight gain (22Lambert P.D. Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4652-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Unlike cachectic cytokines, the appetite diminution during CNTF treatment does not appear to be due to stress, inflammatory responses, nausea, or conditioned taste aversion but is possibly due to the modification of NPYergic signaling (22Lambert P.D. Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the regulation and activation of STATs and proteins by CNTF in adipocytes. The objective of this project was to determine whether CNTF, a cytokine known to result in weight loss, could have effects on peripheral tissues such as white adipose tissue. Our results clearly demonstrate that two of the three CNTF receptors are down-regulated during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. However, CNTF administration results in the activation of STAT 3 in both cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in rodent adipose tissue. Also this study provides the first evidence that CNTFRα is expressed in adipose tissue and that the expression of this receptor is regulated in four rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes. We also observed that CNTF treatment did not effect the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors such as PPARγ and C/EBPα but did result in a decrease of fatty-acid synthase (FAS) expression. Also, unlike other cachectic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, chronic CNTF treatment did not result in the development of insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes. Moreover, acute CNTF administration resulted in increased GLUT4 expression, whereas chronic CNTF treatment resulted in a substantial increase in IRS-1 expression. Also, acute CNTF treatment resulted in an increase in insulin-induced IRS-1 and Akt activation. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that both cultured and native adipocytes, as well as skeletal muscle, are responsive to CNTF and that this cytokine may act as an insulin-sensitizer in cultured adipocytes. These studies support our hypothesis that the ability of CNTF to result in weight loss is not solely mediated by the central nervous system. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Bovine and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. Rat CNTF was purchased from Calbiochem. The non-phospho-STAT antibodies were monoclonal IgGs purchased from Transduction Laboratories or polyclonal IgGs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A highly phospho-specific polyclonal antibody for STAT 3 (Tyr705) was purchased from BD Biosciences. LIFR and gp130 were rabbit polyclonals from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PPARγ was a mouse monoclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SREBP-1 and ERK1/ERK2 were rabbit polyclonals from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Active ERK antibody was a rabbit polyclonal from Promega.

CNTFRα was a mouse monoclonal purchased from BD Biosciences. IRS-1 polyclonal was a polyclonal obtained from Upstate Biotechology, Inc., and the phospho-specific IRS-1 polyclonal was from BIOSOURCE International. PGNaseF was obtained from New England Biolabs. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated and grown to 2 days post-confluence in DMEM with 10% bovine serum. Medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 48 h this medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells were maintained in this medium until utilized for experimentation. Monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or adipocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a non-denaturing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. Samples were extracted for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants containing whole cell extracts were analyzed for protein content using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nuclear homogenization buffer (NHB) containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.15%, and cells were homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were saved as cytosolic extract, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.5 volume of NHB and were centrifuged as before. The pellet of intact nuclei was resuspended again in 0.5 of the original volume of NHB and centrifuged again. A small portion of the nuclei was used for trypan blue staining to examine the integrity of the nuclei. The majority of the pellet (intact nuclei) was resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min on ice and then placed at room temperature for 10 min. Two hundred units of DNase I was added to each sample, and tubes were inverted and incubated an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing nuclear extracts were analyzed for protein content. Proteins were separated in 5, 7.5, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Following chemiluminescence, some results were quantified by scanning film, and densitometry analysis was performed with associated analytical software (Biomax, Eastman Kodak Co.). The assay of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was performed as described previously (27Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived for 4 h. Uptake measurements were performed in triplicate under conditions where hexose uptake was linear, and the results were corrected for nonspecific uptake, and absorption was determined by 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in the presence of 5 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma). Nonspecific uptake and absorption were always less than 10% of the total uptake. Seven-week-old ob/+ and ob/ob mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Eight-week-old fa/+ and fa/fa rats were purchased from Harlan. C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories at 3–5 weeks of age, and upon receipt were placed on a high fat/high sucrose diet (Research Diets 12331, Surwit diet) or a low fat/high sucrose diet (Research Diets 12329). In each experiment, at least five animals were used for each condition. Twelve-week-old transgenic mice expressing agouti under the control of the β-actin promoter were obtained from a colony at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Rodents were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and adipose tissue was quickly removed, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen fat pads were homogenized in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, and 10 μm leupeptin, and 2 mmsodium vanadate. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm to remove any debris and insoluble material and then analyzed for protein content. All animal studies were carried out with protocols that were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male C57Bl/6J mice (35g) by collagenase digestion. The sensitivity of 3T3-L1 cells to cytokine treatment was examined by treating undifferentiated preadipocytes and fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with an acute treatment of 0.8 nm CNTF or 0.8 nm LIF. As shown in Fig. 1, immunoblotting of whole cell extracts demonstrated that both preadipocytes and adipocytes express STAT 3. Treatment of both preadipocytes and adipocytes with LIF or CNTF resulted in the rapid activation of STAT 3, as evident by increased tyrosine phosphorylation. However, treatment of preadipocytes resulted in a greater stimulation of STAT 3 activation, relative to adipocytes, despite equivalent expression of STAT 3 protein. In addition, CNTF and LIF treatment caused a robust activation of Akt in preadipocytes, whereas the same treatment of adipocytes did not result in a detectable activation of Akt. The expression of two CNTF receptor complex proteins, LIFR and gp130, was also examined. LIFR was expressed at a substantially higher level in preadipocytes than in adipocytes, whereas the expression of gp130 protein was not differentially expressed in these two cell types. The expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins was also examined during a time course of adipocyte differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of CNTFRα protein decreases notably after 15 min of induction of differentiation, and this lower level of expression is maintained for 48 h. However, there were no detectable levels of CNTFRα 72 h after the initiation of differentiation in whole cell extracts. Yet we did observe the presence of CNTFRα in the media at 72, 96, and 120 h at lower levels (data not shown). As indicated in Fig. 1, the expression of LIFR decreased during adipogenesis, and there was a slight modulation of gp130 expression. The expression of STAT 5A is known to be induced during adipocyte differentiation and is shown as a positive control for adipogenesis. Because the expression of two CNTF receptor complex proteins was reduced during adipogenesis, we wanted to determine whether these proteins were expressed in adipose tissue and to compare the expression levels to other tissues. Whole cell extracts were isolated from the various tissues indicated in Fig. 3. Western blot analysis revealed lung, stomach, epididymal fat, spleen, heart, brain, testes, and skeletal muscle as tissues expressing both CNTFRα and LIFR. All of these tissues had comparable receptor expression levels, except for the brain, which had significantly higher levels of CNTFRα expression. Also the molecular weight of CNTFRα in stomach and brain was greater than in other tissues. In agreement with our earlier observations (Fig. 2), the expression of CNTFRα was abundant in preadipocytes and undetectable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We also observed that the expression of CNTFRα was up-regulated in the epididymal fat pad of an obese Zucker rat as compared with a lean littermate. To determine whether the altered mobility of CNTFRα was due to glycosylation, tissue extracts were incubated with PNGaseF. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment with PNGaseF resulted in the deglycosylation of CNTFRα and LIFR. In particular, the CNTFRα bands of larger molecular weights (brain and stomach) co-migrated with the CNTFRα from other tissues following digestion, indicating that the size difference between CNTFRα in these tissues was due to different glycosylation patterns. Also all LIFR bands migrated at the same molecular weight following PNGaseF treatment. Although our results demonstrate that fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes do not express CNTFRα, it has been demonstrated previously (15Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B.

Therefore, we examined the ability of CNTF to activate STATs in a time-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Serum-deprived fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to CNTF and examined over an 8-h period. Cells were harvested at the times indicated at the top of Fig. 5 and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 5 A, CNTF administration to 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in the nuclear translocation of STAT 3. STAT 3 was present in the nucleus after a 10- or 30-min treatment with CNTF, and the amount of STAT 3 nuclear protein was decreased after a 1-h treatment. After 2 h, there was little STAT 3 present in the nucleus. CNTF treatment did not result in the activation/nuclear translocation of STAT 1 or STAT 5B, indicating the specificity of the response. Also CNTF did not effect the distribution of STAT 5A. Unlike other adipocyte-expressed STATs, some STAT 5A is always present in the adipocyte nucleus (28Balhoff J.P. Stephens J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent effects of CNTF on 3T3-L1 adipocytes were also examined by treating adipocytes for 10 min with varying concentrations of CNTF. As shown in Fig. 5 B, CNTF had no effect on STATs 1 or 5A but resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 3. In addition, CNTF treatment resulted in a dose-dependent activation of MAPK (ERKs 1 and 2). To assess the dose effects of CNTF on STAT 3 activation, we compared STAT 3 activation in preadipocytes and adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 5 C, CNTF results in a dose-dependent effect on STAT 3 activation in preadipocytes but not in adipocytes. To characterize further the effects of CNTF, we treated fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes for a 12-h period, and we isolated whole cell extracts at the times indicated at the top of Fig. 6. As indicated previously, acute CNTF treatment resulted in a time-dependent activation of STAT 3 and MAPK but was unable to activate Akt. A positive control for Akt activation (10 min of treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 50 nm insulin) is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6. Acute CNTF treatment did not affect the expression levels of STATs 1, 3, or 5A. There were also no observable differences in the expression of SREBP-1 protein, as indicated by the levels of the cleaved 67-kDa form of the protein. Next, we examined the effects of chronic CNTF administration on the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipocyte proteins. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to CNTF over a 96-h period. A fresh bolus of CNTF was added to the cells every 24 h. Whole cell extracts were isolated at the times indicated at the top of Fig. 7 and subjected to Western blot analysis. Chronic administration of CNTF did not alter the expression of adipocyte expressed STATs, PPARγ, or C/EBPα. There were no notable differences in the levels of gp130 and LIFR expression, and chronic CNTF treatment was insufficient to induce the expression of CNTFRα. A positive control of confluent preadipocytes is shown for CNTFRα expression. We also observed that CNTF treatment did not alter the expression of acrp 30 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, CNTF had no effect on the expression or secretion of leptin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Interestingly, CNTF treatment resulted in a decrease of FAS expression and a substantial increase in the expression of IRS-1. Also, the levels of the 67-kDa SREBP-1 protein were slightly decreased by CNTF treatment after 72 h. Although we did not observe substantial levels of CNTFRα in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figs. 2, 3, and 5), we were able to detect the expression of CNTFRα in rodent adipose tissue from an obese Zucker rat, and the levels of this receptor appeared to be up-regulated in conditions of obesity (Fig. 3). Hence, we examined the expression of CNTF receptors in adipose tissue of additional rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes. Whole cell extracts were prepared from epididymal fat pads of five ob/ob and five ob/+ lean littermates. As shown in Fig. 8 A, we observed very little expression of CNTFRα in the adipose tissue of lean mice, but we observed a substantial increase in the expression of this receptor in three of the five"
https://openalex.org/W2106040905,"In cardiomyocytes, calcium plays important roles as a signal in cardiac hypertrophy and contraction-relaxation cycling. Elevation of Ca2+ concentration in myoplasm is associated with the onset and progression of hypertrophy as well as the enhancement of contractility. The cardiac Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a dominant role in lowering cytoplasmic calcium levels during relaxation and is regulated by phospholamban (PLN). To examine whether the modulation of SERCA2a activity results in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and enhancement of contractility, we generated transgenic mice (TG) overexpressing a high calcium affinity SERCA2a mutant (K397/400E), lacking a functional association with PLN. In the TG hearts, the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ significantly increased compared with their nontransgenic littermate controls. The TG showed increased contraction and relaxation, with increases in the amplitude of Ca2+ transient and rapid Ca2+ decay. Upon induction of pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction, the TG developed less cardiac hypertrophy than littermate controls did. The activation of Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase C by pressure overload was significantly attenuated in the TG hearts. Our findings indicate an association of SERCA2a activity with cardiac hypertrophy and thus a new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of cardiac hypertrophy."

The amino-terminal region that immediately precedes the transmembrane anchor contains a conserved sequence motif consisting of two interfacial domains separated by Asn and Gln residues. The presence of this motif confers on the 6K pretransmembrane region the tendency to partition into the membrane interface. To study the functional importance of the interfacial sequences, three different Sindbis virus 6K variants were obtained with the following modifications: 9YLW11xAAA, 18FWV20xAAA, and 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA. Reconstituted mutant viruses were infectious and showed no defects in glycoprotein processing, although virus budding was hampered. Single 6K expression in Escherichia coli cells showed interfacial mutants to have a diminished capacity to modify membrane permeability and to have lower toxicity. In particular, the 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA variant was expressed at high levels and did not enhance membrane permeability significantly, although it retained its integral membrane protein condition. Parallel analyses of membrane permeabilization in baby hamster kidney cells were carried out using a Sindbis virus replicon that synthesized both capsid protein and 6K. Transfection of the construct with wild-type 6K strongly increased permeability to the antibiotic hygromycin B. Replicons encoding 6K interfacial mutants induced lower membrane permeabilization. Again, the greatest impairment was observed for the 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA variant, permeabilization activity of which was ∼10% that of wild-type 6K.

Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schlesinger S. Schlesinger M. Fields B.N. Fields' Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 825-841Google Scholar, 3Garoff H. Hewson R. Opstelfen D.-J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1171-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capsid (C)1 protein is first synthesized and detaches from the rest of the polyprotein by autocatalytic proteolysis. Once C protein has been liberated into the cytoplasm, polyprotein synthesis continues to be associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The exposed amino terminus contains a signal sequence that interacts with ER membranes and directs the glycoprotein precursor (E3-E2–6K-E1) into the lumen of the ER. The precursor is associated with the ER membrane, spanning the lipid bilayer six times. Soon after synthesis, this precursor is cleaved at both ends of the 6K protein by a cellular protease present in the ER, generating the products PE2 (E3+E2), 6K, and E1. PE2 and E1 then associate to form dimers that travel with 6K through the vesicular system to the plasma membrane. As a final activation step, PE2 is cleaved by a furin-like protease present in a post-Golgi compartment, giving rise to glycoproteins E3 and E2. The glycoproteins transported to the plasma membrane expose their amino terminus ectodomains to the external medium, whereas the carboxyl domains remain facing the cytoplasm. The virus genomes replicated in the cytoplasm interact with the C protein to form nucleocapsids. The assembled nucleocapsids subsequently interact with the carboxyl domain of E2. This interaction provokes the wrapping of the capsid with the lipid envelope, concomitant with the budding of virus particles (1Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schlesinger S. Schlesinger M. Fields B.N. Fields' Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 825-841Google Scholar, 3Garoff H. Hewson R. Opstelfen D.-J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1171-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 6K is a small hydrophobic polypeptide acylated with fatty acids (4Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Ding M.X Levy M.A. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Lusa S. Garoff H. Liljeström P. Virology. 1991; 185: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite the association of the 6K protein with the plasma membrane and its interaction with E1-E2, very little 6K is incorporated into the budded virus particles (4Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Ding M.X Levy M.A. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Lusa S. Garoff H. Liljeström P. Virology. 1991; 185: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although 6K protein provides the cleavage sites in the glycoprotein precursor for signalase activity, a Semliki forest virus variant lacking the entire 6K is processed between E2 and E1 (6Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Loewy A. Smyth J. Von Bonsdorff C.-H. Liljestrm P. Schlesinger M.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This virus mutant is not defective in synthesis and transport of glycoproteins or in nucleocapsid formation; its major defects concern the budding process. Another function assigned to Semliki forest virus 6K protein is to provide the signal sequence for E1 translocation to the lumen of the ER (8Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, E1 is properly translocated in the 6K-deleted Semliki forest virus mutant (6Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Loewy A. Smyth J. Von Bonsdorff C.-H. Liljestrm P. Schlesinger M.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Sindbis virus (SV) variants with single or multiple amino acid substitutions in the 6K have defects in virion release, leading to the formation of multinucleated virus particles (4Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Ding M.X Levy M.A. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1991; 183: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Ivanova L., Le, L. Schlesinger M.J. Virus Res. 1995; 39: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Ivanova L. Lustig S. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1995; 206: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proper proteolytic processing of the virus glycoproteins is hampered in an SV variant bearing an insertion of 15 amino acids in the 6K protein. This variant exhibits a transdominant phenotype, but virus particles display a morphology similar to that of wt virus (12Schlesinger M.J. London S.D. Ryan C. Virology. 1993; 193: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An SV variant with deleted 6K 22 amino acids shows defects in glycoprotein proteolytic processing (13Sanz M.A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7778-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A revertant of this mutant in which these defects were corrected was subsequently isolated, but virus release was still impaired. Furthermore, the in trans expression of a genuine 6K from an extra subgenomic promoter placed in the same genome did not produce appreciable reversion. In addition, the functions of the 6K protein cannot be rescued by the corresponding counterparts from related virus species. Thus, the substitution of the SV 6K gene by the 6K counterpart from Ross River virus leads to the small plaque phenotype and reduced formation of infectious virus (14Yao J.S. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7910-7920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This SV variant with the 6K gene from Ross River virus was able to cleave the glycoprotein precursors proteolytically and to transport them into the plasma membrane, although the budding process was impaired. Together, these observations suggest a function for 6K in the release of virions from infected cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which 6K protein enhances virion release remains unknown. This article reports an unexplored feature of SV 6K that might be related to the promotion of the virion-release process (i.e.the affinity of 6K for the membrane interface). It was found that the amino-terminal 6K ectodomain contains two hydrophobic-at-interface segments that can mediate association of this sequence with the external membrane monolayer. Conservation of the interfacial 6K segments among divergent members of the Alphavirus genus suggests a functional role for these motifs. Accordingly, SV 6K variants containing substitutions that interfere with the capacity of the amino terminus to partition into membranes without affecting overall 6K hydrophobicity were obtained and characterized. The data support the hypothesis that 6K participates in virus release through direct interaction with membranes that compromise the permeability barrier. A model is proposed that accounts for the involvement of 6K in this phenomenon. Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids. SV was derived from the cDNA clones described below after transfection of the RNAs synthesized in vitro. A full-length cDNA clone of Sindbis virus pT7SVwt (13Sanz M.A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7778-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as the wt parental clone to generate mutagenized SV variants. pT7SV YLW/AAA, pT7SV FWV/AAA, and pT7SV YLW/AAA/FWV/AAA carry mutations in the 6K gene: 9YLW11xAAA, 18FWV20xAAA, and both 9YLW11x AAA and 18FWV20xAAA, respectively. They were generated by replacing the BssHII/SplI fragment in pT7SVwt by PCR-amplified and subsequently digested fragments incorporating the 6K substitutions. Several SV replicons were obtained by deleting glycoprotein genes: C+6Kwt, C+6K YLW/AAA, C+6K FWV/AAA, and C+6K YLW/AAA, FWV/AAA. These replicons were made in two steps. First, pT7SVwt was digested with BssHII and StuI and the recessed ends filled in with DNApol I, Large (Klenow fragment). Thus, part of the sequence coding for the proteins E3 and E2 was deleted. The open reading frame was not broken, and the remaining sequence coded for the 45 amino-terminal amino acids of E3 fused to 31 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of E2 plus 6K and E1. In a second step, the different 6K sequences were introduced at the same time as the E1 sequence was deleted, using the unique restriction sitesBssHII, upstream of 6K, and ApaI, downstream of E1. Sequences with the different 6Ks were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides that incorporated the restriction sitesBssHII and ApaI and a stop codon placed after the 6K sequence. Digested products replaced the sequences located between the BssHII and ApaI sites in the above plasmid. The replicon coding only for the capsid protein was obtained by replacing the pT7SVwt sequence between the AatII andApaI sites by a PCR-amplified fragment encoding the Capsid sequence from the AatII site to the end and a stop codon. pET11 plasmid (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 165: 60-89Crossref Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) was used for this purpose. pET11 6Kwt, pET11 6K YLWxAAA, pET11 6K FWVxAAA, and pET11 6K YLWxAAA/FWVxAAA were constructed replacing theNdeI/BamHI fragment in pET11 by PCR-amplified products encoding the different 6K protein variants. Plasmids were checked by sequencing the inserts from PCR amplification by standard sequencing techniques. Subconfluent BHK cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a density of about 2.5 × 106cells/ml. A 25-μl aliquot of T7 RNA polymerase transcription mixture with about 10 μg RNA from the different cDNA constructs was added to 0.4 ml of cells, and the mixture was transferred to a 2-mm electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was performed at room temperature by generating two consecutive 1.5-kV, 25-microfarad pulses using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) as described Liljeström et al. (6Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then diluted in growth medium and seeded onto culture plates. Transfected cells were processed for electron microscopy as follows. At 16 h.p.e. (hours post-electroporation), cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.2m HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature and immediately scraped off the plate. These were then washed twice and resuspended in 0.2 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. After fixation, they were dehydrated and infiltrated with Epon. Thin sections were obtained and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Permeability changes to the antibiotic hygromicin B (HB) induced by the expression of 6K proteins were measured in E. coli cells as described previously (16Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the described pET11 recombinant plasmids were grown in M-9 medium (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). At 30 and 60 min after induction, proteins were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met-Cys in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm HB. Cells were subsequently harvested and the radiolabeled products analyzed by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and autoradiography. Membrane association of the 6K proteins in these experiments was analyzed as follows. Radioactively labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol) lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant fraction obtained was further subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 1 h. The pelleted fraction was resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Three aliquot samples of the pelleted membrane fraction were processed as follows: 1) untreated as a control; 2) treated with 8 m urea, and 3) treated with 0.5% SDS. After further ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 1 h, equivalent amounts of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. 106BHK cells were electroporated with 10 μg of RNA synthesized in vitro from the different plasmids and further seeded in three wells of an L-24 plate. At 16 h.p.e., proteins were radiolabeled for 45 min with 200 μl Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine/cysteine but supplemented with 2 μl of Trans label [35S]Met-Cys (15 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) per well in the presence or absence of 0.5 or 1 mm HB. Cells were harvested and labeled proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The sequence alignments for representative 6K products derived from divergent alphaviruses (1Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1 A. Trp-11 and Trp-19 are totally conserved at the amino terminus of these sequences (Fig. 2 A, bold characters). When average interfacial hydrophobicity was plotted for several of these representative sequences (Fig. 1B), the hydropathy plots detected two consecutive peaks at the short amino-terminal 6K ectodomain, immediately preceding the transmembrane domain (TMD). The average hydropathy plots in Fig. 1 B were calculated according to the so-called Wimley-White(WW)hydrophobicity-at-interface scale (19Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 20White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). In contrast with classical hydrophobicity scales, this is a whole-residue scale (i.e. it includes contributions from peptide bonds as well as amino acid side-chains) based on the water-to-membrane interface transfer-free energies for each amino acid. Consequently, the average interfacial hydrophobicity of an arbitrary sequence directly reflects the tendency of such a sequence to partition from water into membrane interfaces or, in other words, to promote the first step of the protein-membrane interaction process leading to integration (21Deber C.M. Goto N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The positive 6K peaks indicate that the conserved amino-terminal stretches have a propensity to interact with and to remain immersed in the interfacial region of the membrane. Because this side of 6K faces the external side of the membrane, the presence of these segments confers on the 6K ectodomain the ability to interact differentially with the external membrane monolayer.Figure 2Hydropathy plots for the different 6K variants studied. Hydropathy plots (mean values for a window of 5 amino acids) were elaborated using the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index (KD) and Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity (WW) scales for individual residues. The black bar and white box above indicate the approximate extensions of pretransmembrane and transmembrane sequences, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the role of the interfacial domains in 6K protein, several variants were generated (Fig. 2). Because the goal was to explore the functional importance of the hydrophobic-at-interface character of the sequences, substitutions specifically affecting this parameter that did not, however, induce appreciable changes in the overall sequence hydrophobicity, were selected. The hydropathy plots in Fig. 2illustrate this strategy. Kyte-Doolittle plots (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar), based on relative side-chain hydrophobicities, accurately predict transmembrane regions in constitutive integral membrane proteins (translocated with energy cost during biogenesis). Positive peaks are consistent with translocated TMD regions remaining stably inserted in membranes. Accordingly, the Kyte-Doolittle plots in Fig. 2 detect the TMD region of 6K as a positive peak. None of the 6K mutations generated altered this hydrophobicity pattern (Fig. 2). In contrast with Kyte-Doolittle, the WW algorithm is based on the water-to-membrane interface transfer-free energies for each amino acid (19Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The membrane interfaces are distinct regions of the bilayer, characterized by their chemical heterogeneity and sharp polarity changes with distance. Wimley and White (19Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) found unexpected differences in the relative hydrophobicities of the amino acid residues when these residues partition from water into interfaces of phospholipid bilayers. In particular, hydrophobic sequences rich in Trp residues show the greatest tendency to partition spontaneously from the aqueous phase into the membrane. The different substitutions made in SV 6K in the present work resulted in abolition of the first, second, or both amino interfacial subdomains (Fig. 2). To test the effect of the 6K mutations on different aspects of the virus life cycle, the different SV variants in 6K were first reconstituted. BHK cells were transfected with RNA transcribed from these SV variants. The proteins synthesized at 16 h.p.e. were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 A shows that the three SV 6K mutants synthesized viral proteins as efficiently as wt SV. Thus, the levels of synthesized protein and host translation inhibition were similar for all viruses assayed. In addition, no defects were found in the processing of the different viral structural proteins. These results indicate that the cleavage sites in the viral polyprotein contributed by the 6K variants were able to undertake proteolytic processing adequately. Moreover, no alterations were noted in the migration of the viral glycoproteins, suggesting that their post-translational processing was not hampered by the mutations in 6K. Previous analyses have indicated that one of the major defects of alphaviruses with a mutated 6K appears at a very late step in the virus life cycle: the process of virus budding. Therefore, the exit of viruses from the infected BHK cells was investigated by electron microscopy. Fig. 3 B shows a number of SV particles exiting from wtSV-infected cells. The morphology of these virus particles was normal. In contrast, a clear defect was observed with the three 6K variants analyzed. In all three cases, virus particles accumulated at the plasma membrane. Although their morphology showed no anomaly, these particles were unable to detach efficiently from cells. It is concluded that the three mutations introduced in the 6K sequence confer defects in virus budding, such that the pinching-off of the assembled virus particles is inefficient. In turn, this defect leads to the formation of virus plaques of smaller size (data not shown). The clearest activity that 6K shows when individually expressed in cells is the capacity to increase membrane permeability to a number of solutes (17Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the participation of the interfacial region of 6K in this process, wt 6K and the three 6K gene variants were cloned and expressed in E. coli cells using an inducible system of gene expression (Fig. 4). Membrane permeability was analyzed by the HB test (16Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of the wt 6K gene not only permeabilized prokaryotic cells to the antibiotic HB, but also induced rapid cell lysis, such that the synthesis of 6K lasted only a few minutes upon 6K induction. By comparison, the three 6K variants showed a reduced permeabilization capacity and lower toxicity after induction. In particular, the variant with both mutated tripeptides (i.e. 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA) maintained the same expression level 60 min after induction, and membrane permeability to HB did not appreciably change. To assess further whether mutations introduced in the interfacial sequence affected the capacity of 6K to interact with membranes, the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B was performed. After protein labeling, the cells were broken, and the membrane-containing fraction was obtained. The wt 6K protein seemed associated with the membrane fraction even after urea treatment. However, incubation of this membrane fraction with SDS detergent led to the release of 6K from membranes. The data in Fig. 4B demonstrate that the 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA variant behaves in a way akin to wt 6K. Together, these results suggest that both wt 6K and its 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA 6K variant are integral membrane proteins. Therefore, the double modification of the interfacial sequence does not hamper the ability of 6K to become an integral membrane protein, although it does affect its ability to perturb the membrane permeability barrier. The potent permeabilizing capacity of 6K in prokaryotic cells was recognized several years ago (17Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the action of this protein in mammalian cells remains unknown. To address this matter, a system was designed based on SV replicons that synthesize 6K product in large amounts. This system consisted of cloning the 6K sequences adjacent to the capsid, so that upon translation of the subgenomic mRNA, C protein is liberated by its autocatalytic activity, and the rest of the protein is made at normal levels. The two sites of proteolytic cleavage, those between C-E3 and E2–6K, were maintained in this construct to synthesize a genuine 6K protein with no extra amino acid (see Fig. 5 A). Using this approach, constructs were made with wt 6K or the three different variants placed just after C (Fig. 5 A). BHK cells were transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNAs, and after 16 h.p.e., protein synthesis was estimated in the absence or presence of the aminoglycoside antibiotic HB (Fig. 5 B). This compound did not permeate into uninfected cells or into cells transfected with RNA encoding only C protein (Fig. 5 B). Notably, HB readily entered into BHK cells transfected with full-length RNA from wt SV, leading to a profound inhibition of viral translation. The expression of wt 6K enhanced membrane permeability to HB, whereas this effect was not as strong with the 6K variants. Thus, with respect to synthesis-inhibition levels, it may be inferred that 9YLW11xAAA, 18FWV20xAAA, and 9YLW11xAAA/18FWV20xAAA substitutions provoked a reduction in the capacity of wt 6K to induce HB entry by 25, 66, and 94%, respectively. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the integrity of the interfacial sequence of 6K is crucial for the correct activity of this protein with respect to enhancing membrane permeability (Figs. 4 and 5) and virus budding (Fig. 3). Some instability of the double 6K mutant was also observed, perhaps indicating that the mutated region plays a part in governing protein degradation in mammalian cells. There are a number of virus-encoded proteins capable of enhancing cell membrane permeability. These proteins can be classified into two broad groups. One comprises viral glycoproteins with a particular architecture in their transmembrane regions and the sequences proximal to that domain (23Arroyo J. Boceta M. Gonzalez M.E. Michel M. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Suárez T. Gallaher W.R. Agirre A. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. J.

Constantino A. Marcantonio C. Equestre M. Geraci A. Rapicetta M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2243-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of these proteins may lead to pore formation and membrane disturbance (27Suárez T. Nir S. Goñi F.M. Saéz-Cirión A. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The other is a group of viral proteins that destabilize membranes and includes a number of small and very hydrophobic proteins. These integral membrane polypeptides are also able to oligomerize, promoting pore formation in biological membranes. Consequently, they are known as viroporins (16Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol.

The alphavirus 6K protein is a typical viroporin that contains a transmembrane region that anchors it to membranes during protein synthesis. Despite its relative structural simplicity, 6K plays several roles during the virus life cycle. Apart from its participation in polyprotein processing, the major function of 6K stems from its requirement for efficient virus budding from infected cells (6Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Loewy A. Smyth J. Von Bonsdorff C.-H. Liljestrm P. Schlesinger M.J. J.

Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7910-7920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanisms of virus budding are not yet fully understood. The fact that 6K enhances membrane permeability led to the proposal that this activity facilitated the exit of viruses from cells. Perhaps the destabilization of the plasma membrane by 6K promotes the release of virus particles to the medium. This may rely not only on the physical modification of the membrane but also on the local dissipation of ionic gradients by the pore-formation capacity of 6K. The 6K transmembrane region is thought to allow the early formation of a hairpin structure embedded in the ER membrane. This structure positions the polypeptide amino and carboxyl termini in the ER lumen (8Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). Little is known about the stability of this predicted structure or the eventual topology adopted by 6K embedded in the plasma membrane. Prediction of membrane protein structure and stability has been recently implemented with the introduction of the WW hydrophobicity-at-interface scale (20White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). The present work analyzed the interfacial hydrophobicity of alphavirus 6K. The predilection of a given sequence for membrane interfaces over bulk apolar or polar phases seems to be dictated by the presence of aromatic residues. WW analysis shows the presence of two stretches containing invariant Trp residues within the 6K protein ectodomain, with a high tendency to partition into membrane interfaces. The preservation of these interfacial sequences is crucial for enhanced membrane permeability by 6K protein. The 6K variants mutated in the pretransmembrane region were unable to permeabilize membranes even though they seemed to be membrane-integral products. Thus, the integration of 6K into the membrane is insufficient for membrane destabilization, but this 6K amino-terminal region is also necessary to permeabilize membranes and for efficient virus budding. We have previously reported (13Sanz M.A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7778-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) the isolation of an SV variant, Del6K-revQ21L, with a partially deleted 6K that displays an almost genuine interfacial domain (Figs. 2 B and6 B). This variant shows correct proteolytic processing and transport but still exhibits defects in virus budding comparable with those observed when the 6K gene is completely oblated. Therefore, expression of the isolated interfacial region does not restore 6K function either. It would seem that a sequence immersed in the membrane interface followed by the transmembrane anchor represents the minimal structure required for functional 6K to induce membrane alterations (Fig. 6 C). Exposure to different lipid environments during protein trafficking might affect 6K structure and membrane topology. In particular, it has been proposed that cells rely on membrane thickness to sort proteins destined for the plasma membrane from the Golgi apparatus (33Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the TMDs of plasma membrane proteins are longer than those of Golgi proteins (34Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that differences in membrane thickness, such as those that occur along the secretory pathway, might play a role in regulating 6K topology and structure. Computation of the free energy according to values determined by Wimley and White (19Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 20White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar) indicate that the inside-outside TMD (number 2 in model 6A) would not remain stably immersed in the membrane core (data not shown). It is therefore conceivable that a topology such as that shown in Fig. 6 C, with the interfacial region (gray cylinder) followed by a single transmembrane helix (white cylinder) would be more favorably adopted by the secreted versions of 6K (see also the predictions in Fig. 1). Several forms of peptide-chain embedding within the external membrane monolayer interface might influence 6K-induced membrane perturbation and permeabilization. In principle, the interfacial sequence might be required to disrupt interactions between lipid molecules and might be directly involved in the destabilization of membrane integrity (Fig. 6 C). A similar mechanism has previously been proposed for poliovirus 3A protein (35Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The differential surface increase of the external membrane monolayer might also contribute to membrane deformation and bending (positive curvature) at the points of virus budding (4Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Ding M.X Levy M.A. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Loewy A. Smyth J. Von Bonsdorff C.-H. Liljestrm P. Schlesinger M.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tendency to minimize energetically those perturbations might be exploited to assemble oligomeric transmembrane pores that actually induce the rupture of the permeability barrier. Moreover, the interfacial region might participate in the regulation of the opening of those transmembrane pores. Finally, it should noted that the presence of complex helical transmembrane regions might be of functional importance to viral proteins that induce membrane perturbations required for fusion or permeabilization. Thus, an interfacial region similar to the 6K sequence described here has been reported to occur in the region proximal to the transmembrane anchor of human immunodeficiency virus gp41 fusion protein (24Suárez T. Gallaher W.R. Agirre A. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8038-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A long interfacial sequence preceding the transmembrane anchor seems to be a common structural motif in fusogenic proteins belonging to several virus families. Our initial analyses indicate that interfacial helices adjacent to membrane-spanning domains might represent a motif conspicuously present also among members of the viroporin protein family. A comparative study is under way in an effort to establish the extent to which interfacial sequences contribute to the pore-forming activity of this family of viral proteins."

The transport of chemotherapeutic drugs requires the presence of reduced GSH. By using hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics and limited trypsin digestion, the structural changes associated with each step of the drug transport process are analyzed. Purified MRP1 is reconstituted into lipid vesicles with an inside-out orientation, exposing its cytoplasmic region to the external medium. The resulting proteoliposomes have been shown previously to exhibit both ATP-dependent drug transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Our results show that during GSH-dependent drug transport, MRP1 does not undergo secondary structure changes but only modifications in its accessibility toward the external environment. Drug binding induces a restructuring of MRP1 membrane-embedded domains that does not affect the cytosolic domains, including the nucleotide binding domains, responsible for ATP hydrolysis. This demonstrates that drug binding to MRP1 is not sufficient to propagate an allosteric signal between the membrane and the cytosolic domains. On the other hand, GSH binding induces a conformational change that affects the structural organization of the cytosolic domains and enhances ATP binding and/or hydrolysis suggesting that GSH-mediated conformational changes are required for the coupling between drug transport and ATP hydrolysis.

Its predicted topology is characteristic of a typical ABC transporter: a core structure containing two membrane-spanning domains (MSD1 and MSD2), each of them composed of six transmembrane (TM) segments and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) that are located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (6Hipfner D.R.

In addition to this core structure, MRP1 contains a third NH2-terminal membrane-spanning domain (MSD0) made of five transmembrane segments (21Bakos E. Hegedüs T. Holló Z Welker E. Tusnády G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20934-20941Google Scholar), whereas the NBDs are responsible for ATP binding/hydrolysis and for coupling energy release to substrate transport. Recently, low resolution images of MRP1 have been obtained from single particle image analysis and electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals (33Rosenberg M.F. Mao Q. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16076-16082Google Scholar). The projection structures give the first static image of the tertiary organization of MRP1. Nevertheless, no information about the structural modifications induced upon GSH and drug binding at different steps of MRP1-mediated drug transport process is available. To gain further insight into the mechanism by which MRP1-mediated drug transport occurs, we have characterized the intermediate structural states associated with each step of the drug transport, and we observed the influence of GSH on these conformational changes. Purified MRP1 was reconstituted into lipid vesicles with an inside-out orientation, exposing its cytoplasmic region to the external medium (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar). The resulting proteoliposomes have been shown previously to exhibit both ATP-dependent drug transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar). We have utilized limited proteolytic cleavage and infrared spectroscopy to identify and characterize distinct intermediate structural states. The data suggest that GSH induces structural modifications that allow the coupling between drug transport and ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ATP, rather than hydrolysis, increases the accessibility of MRP1 to the aqueous medium. Such a conformational change may be required for the release of the drug in the external medium. No additional change in the accessibility toward the solvent and no change in the orientation of the transmembrane helices are observed upon ATP hydrolysis. Therefore we suggest that ATP hydrolysis could change the affinity of the substrate through conformational changes involving rotation of the transmembrane helices along their axis. Binding of a non-transported drug reorganizes the membrane-embedded domains in a conformation that restricts the movement of the drug and its release. ATP, AMP-PNP, GSH, doxorubicin (DOX), andN-α-benzoylarginine-l-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) were purchased from Sigma. FCE (3′-(3-methoxymorpholino)doxorubicin) was supplied by Farmitalia. D2O was from Merck. Stable baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell line expressing MRP1 was generated by using procedures described previously (35Chang X.B. Hou X.Y. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Google Scholar). The conditions of expression and purification were as described (35Chang X.B. Hou X.Y. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the purified MRP1 was achieved using SM-2 Bio-Beads to remove detergent from protein/detergent/lipid mixture as described previously (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar). ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded, at room temperature, on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1 and encoded every 1 cm−1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air dried on a FTIR purge gas generator 75-62 Balston (Maidstone, UK) at a flow rate of 5.8 liters/min. The internal reflection element (ATR) was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (36Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Google Scholar). The sample contained 20 μg of reconstituted MRP1. For the measurements carried out in the presence of different ligands, the molar protein to ligand ratio is 1:14 for DOX and FCE, 1:3 for GSH, and 1:6 for ATP or AMP-PNP. Thin films of oriented multilayers were obtained by slowly evaporating the sample on one side of the ATR plate under a stream of nitrogen (36Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Google Scholar). The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder. The sample on the ATR plate was rehydrated by flushing D2O-satured N2 for 2 h at room temperature. 512 scans were averaged for each measurement. The determination of the secondary structure was based on the shape of the amide I band (1600–1700 cm−1), which is sensitive to the secondary structure (37Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar). The analysis was performed on the amide I region of deuterated samples because the H/D exchange allows differentiation of the α-helical secondary structure from the random secondary structure whose absorption band shifts from about 1655 cm−1 to about 1642 cm−1 (38Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Google Scholar). A combination of Fourier self-deconvolution and a least squares iterative curve fitting was applied to narrow and to quantify the area of the different components of amide I band between 1700 and 1600 cm−1(39Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar). To avoid the introduction of artifacts because of the self-deconvolution procedure, the fitting was performed on the non-deconvoluted spectrum. The proportion of a particular structure was computed as the sum of the area of all the fitted Lorentzian bands having their maximum in the frequency region where that structure occurs divided by the total area of the amide I. The frequency limits for each structure were assigned according to theoretical (40Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Google Scholar) or experimental (41Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Google Scholar) data: 1662 to 1645 cm−1, α-helix; 1689 to 1682 and 1637 to 1613 cm−1, β-sheet; 1644.5 to 1637 cm−1, random; 1682 to 1662.5 cm−1, β-turns. The orientation of different secondary structures was determined as described previously (42Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Google Scholar, 43Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded with the incident light polarized parallel and perpendicular with respect to the incidence plane. Dichroism spectra were computed by subtracting the perpendicular polarized spectrum from the parallel polarized spectrum. The subtraction coefficient was chosen so that the area of the lipid ester band at 1740 cm−1 equals zero on the dichroism spectrum, to take into account the difference in the relative power of the evanescent field for each polarization and also the differences in film thickness as described previously (44Marsh D. Muller M. Schmitt F.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2499-2510Google Scholar). An upward deviation on the dichroism spectrum indicates a dipole oriented preferentially near a normal to the ATR plate. Conversely, a downward deviation on the dichroism spectrum indicates a dipole oriented closer to the plane of the ATR plate (36Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Google Scholar). The dichroic ratio RATR is defined as the ratio of the amide I area recorded for the parallel polarization (A ∥) and perpendicular polarization (A ⊥) as shown in Equation 1,RATR=A∥/A⊥Equation 1 In ATR, the dichroic ratio for an isotropic sample Riso is different from unity and is computed on the basis of the area of the lipid ester band (1762–1700 cm−1). As described previously, the presence in the sample of a fractionx of oriented helices and a fraction 1 − xof randomly oriented dipoles results in an experimental dichroic ratio RATR whose value is between the value of oriented helices dichroic ratio Rα and of randomly oriented dipoles Riso. Rα is calculated from x, Riso, and RATR (36Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2,Rα=Aα∥/Aα⊥=RATR−RATR+22Riso+1(1−x)1−1RisoRATR+22Riso+1(1−x)Equation 2 In an α-helical structure, the amide I dipole is oriented 27° (44Marsh D. Muller M. Schmitt F.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2499-2510Google Scholar) with respect to the helix axis. The mean orientation of the helix axis with respect to the membrane was estimated as described previously (for review, see Ref. 45Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membranes by Computer-aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). 20 μg of reconstituted MRP1 were deposited on a germanium plate as described above. Nitrogen was saturated with D2O by bubbling in a series of three vials containing D2O. Before starting the deuteration, 10 spectra of the sample were recorded to test the stability of the measurements. At zero time, the D2O-saturated N2 flux, at a flow rate of 100 ml/min, was connected to the sample. For each kinetic time point, 24 scans were recorded and averaged at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The signal from the atmospheric water was subtracted as described by Goormaghtigh and Russschaert (46Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Spectrochimica Acta. 1994; 50: 2137-2144Google Scholar). As described previously (40Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Google Scholar), deuteration of protein side chains induces modifications in the amide I (1700 to 1600 cm−1) and amide II (1600 to 1500 cm−1) regions. Several parameters modulate their contribution including the ionization state of the carboxylic amino acids and the fraction of deuterated and undeuterated amino acid side chains for every spectrum of the kinetics. We used homemade software, which can compute the contribution of the amino acid side chains as a function of the extent of deuteration (47Goormaghtigh E. de Jongh H.H. Ruysschaert J.M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1519-1527Google Scholar). The area of the amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-H) vibration, was obtained by integration between 1596 and 1502 cm−1. For each spectrum, the area of the amide II was divided by the corresponding lipidic ν(C=O) area to take into account small but significant variations in the total intensity due to the presence of D2O which induced swelling of the sample layer at the beginning of the kinetics (39Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar). This ratio expressed in percentage was plotted versus deuteration time. The value corresponding to 0% of deuteration is defined by the amide II/lipid ratio obtained before deuteration. The 100% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the amide II region, observed for full deuteration of the protein. ATPase activity of reconstituted MRP1 was measured by following the release of the inorganic phosphate using a colorimetric method (48Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes (4 μg of MRP1) were incubated in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 6 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, in the absence or in the presence of 20 μm DOX or FCE and 3 mm GSH, over a 2-h period at 37 °C. The contribution of MgATP, drugs, or GSH to the colorimetric assay was subtracted. Reconstituted MRP1, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, was preincubated with different ligands (3 mm GSH, 20 μm anthracycline and 3 mm ATP or AMP-PNP) for 10 min at 37 °C before trypsin digestion was performed. Trypsin was added to the mixture (trypsin/MRP1 ratio is 1:400, w/w) and incubation carried out at 25 °C. After the desired times of incubation, aliquots were removed from the mixture, and the reaction was stopped by adding a trypsin inhibitor solution (TLCK) to 50 μg/ml. Zero time controls were obtained by adding trypsin inhibitor before adding trypsin. The peptide fragments were separated through a Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel (16.5% T, 3% C) and visualized by silver staining. Effects of different ligands on trypsin activity were assayed using BAPNA as substrate. The tryptic activity was tested at room temperature in 200 μl of medium containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 μg of trypsin, 0.5 mm BAPNA with or without ligands. The enzymatic activity of trypsin was determined by measuring the absorbance of p-nitroanilide at 405 mm. This absorbance was recorded immediately after mixing and continued every minute for 10 min and every 2 min until 30 min, on a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF spectrophotometer. The aim of the present study was to investigate how GSH affects the structure of MRP1 at different steps of the transport cycle,i.e. the drug-binding step and the ATP-binding and hydrolysis step. Experiments are conducted in the presence of two anthracycline derivatives that either do accumulate or do not accumulate in resistant cells. Doxorubicin, a widely clinically used anticancer agent, is actively extruded from cells overexpressing MRP1 (2Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser L. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910Google Scholar, 3Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Van Leusden M.R., De Haas M. Mülder H.S. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. Scheper R.J. Bass F. Broxterman H.J. Borst P. Proc. Natl.

In contrast, a doxorubicin analogue, 3′-(3′-methoxymorpholino-doxorubicin (FCE), accumulates identically in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells overexpressing MRP1, demonstrating that this compound is not transported by MRP1 (49Bakker M. Renes J. Groenhuijzen A. Visser P. Timmer-Bosscha H. Müller M. Groen H.J.M. Smit E.F. de Vries E.G.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 362-366Google Scholar). Conformational changes induced by binding and hydrolysis of ATP are analyzed in the presence of MgAMP-PNP and MgATP. The use of MgAMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of MgATP, allows discrimination between the influence of nucleotide binding and nucleotide hydrolysis on MRP1 structure. The study is performed on purified MRP1 reconstituted into liposomes of asolectin as described previously (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar). The reconstituted MRP1 retains its ATPase and transport activity. The orientation of MRP1 into liposomes was investigated by comparison of its ATPase activity before and after permeabilization of liposomes in the presence of 2 mm Chaps. This Chaps concentration has been shown previously to permeabilize liposomes (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar, 50Sharom F.J., Yu, X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Google Scholar). We observed that the ATPase activity was not enhanced by addition of 2 mm Chaps indicating that MRP1 is inserted into liposomes in an inside-out configuration (34Manciu L. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13026-13033Google Scholar). The infrared spectrum of MRP1 alone, in the 1800 to 1400 cm−1 region, is shown in Fig. 1. The lipid ester ν(C=O) band is located in the 1800 to 1700 cm−1 region. The amide I band due to the ν(C=O) vibration of the peptide bonds is located between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 and is highly sensitive to the secondary structure. The 1600 to 1500 and 1500 to 1400 cm−1 bands represent unexchanged and exchanged amide II, respectively, corresponding to the δ(N–H) and δ(N–D) amide bonds. The secondary structure of MRP1 in the absence or in the presence of ligands was determined by Fourier deconvolution and curve-fitting analysis of the amide I band of a deuterated sample as described previously (39Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar). The proportions of different secondary structures are shown in Table I and indicate that drug and GSH binding in the absence or in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP do not modify MRP1 secondary structure.Table IMRP1 secondary structure composition determined in the absence and in the presence of substratesSubstrateα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnRandom%None42 ± 329 ± 312 ± 417 ± 6GSH1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.42 ± 529 ± 314 ± 714 ± 3DOX1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.43 ± 431 ± 212 ± 115 ± 1FCE1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.39 ± 629 ± 214 ± 519 ± 7DOX + GSH1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.41 ± 530 ± 612 ± 617 ± 1FCE + GSH1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.41 ± 229 ± 214 ± 715 ± 4DOX + GSH + AMP-PNP1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.1-cMRP1/nucleotide molar ratio = 1:6.39 ± 331 ± 510 ± 319 ± 1FCE + GSH + AMP-PNP1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.1-cMRP1/nucleotide molar ratio = 1:6.40 ± 332 ± 511 ± 517 ± 3DOX + GSH + ATP1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.1-cMRP1/nucleotide molar ratio = 1:6.39 ± 529 ± 311 ± 219 ± 6FCE + GSH + ATP1-aMRP1/GSH molar ratio = 1:3.1-bMRP1/drug molar ratio = 1:14.1-cMRP1/nucleotide molar ratio = 1:6.40 ± 532 ± 410 ± 117 ± 7The percentages were obtained by analysis of the shape of the amide I band according to Goormaghtigh et al.

Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar). Spectra of MRP1 are recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized light (Fig. 2, A and B). Dichroic spectra are obtained by subtracting the perpendicular from the parallel polarized spectrum (Fig. 2 C). The orientation of the acyl chains of lipids is assessed using characteristic bands associated with lipid molecules. Specific spectral bands, such as νas(CH2) at 2920 cm−1 and νs(CH2) at 2851 cm−1 display a negative deviation in the dichroic spectrum (Fig. 2 C). This means that the dipole is oriented perpendicular to the normal of the germanium crystal plane. As the dipole orients perpendicular to the hydrocarbon chains of lipids, the acyl chains are oriented normal to the germanium plate. It is the dichroism of the amide I band that characterizes the orientation of MRP1 transmembrane domains. The dichroic spectrum (Fig. 2 C) displays, in all cases, a positive dichroism in the amide I region with a maximum at 1654 cm−1 indicating that the oriented structure is essentially helical in nature because this maximum is characteristic of α-helix structure and that the helices are oriented mainly perpendicular to the germanium crystal plane,i.e. perpendicular to the membrane plane. More quantitative information upon the helix mean tilt requires the evaluation of the dichroic ratio (Rα) associated with the helical structure. According to Equation 2, Rα depends on Riso, RATR, and x. xrepresents the fraction of oriented helices.

https://openalex.org/W2007830063,"DNA replication is inhibited by DNA damage through cis effects on replication fork progression andtrans effects associated with checkpoints. In this study, we employed a combined pulse labeling and neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel-based approach to compare the effects of a DNA damaging agent frequently employed to invoke checkpoints, UVC radiation, on the replication of cellular and simian virus 40 (SV40) chromosomes in intact cells. UVC radiation induced similar inhibitory effects on the initiation and elongation phases of cellular and SV40 DNA replication. The initiation-inhibitory effects occurred independently of p53 and were abrogated by the ATM and ATR kinase inhibitor caffeine, or the Chk1 kinase inhibitor UCN-01. Inhibition of cellular origins was also abrogated by the expression of a dominant-negative Chk1 mutant. These results indicate that UVC induces a Chk1- and ATR or ATM-dependent checkpoint that targets both cellular and SV40 viral replication origins. Loss of Chk1 and ATR or ATM function also stimulated initiation of cellular and viral DNA replication in the absence of UVC radiation, revealing the existence of a novel intrinsic checkpoint that targets both cellular and SV40 viral origins of replication in the absence of DNA damage or stalled DNA replication forks. This checkpoint inhibits the replication in early S phase cells of a region of the repetitive rDNA locus that replicates in late S phase. The ability to detect these checkpoints using the well characterized SV40 model system should facilitate analysis of the molecular basis for these effects.

In mammalian cells, this inhibitory effect is generally detected as a decrease in incorporation of radioactive DNA precursors into newly synthesized DNA. The dose-dependent magnitude of the inhibitory effect induced by ionizing radiation and UVC radiation is biphasic in nature—an initial steep component occurs at low levels of damage, followed by a shallower component at higher levels. Analysis of cellular DNA pulse-labeled shortly after inducing DNA damage with ionizing radiation (1Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

Acta. 1985; 824: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggest these two components correspond to effects on two fundamentally different processes involved in DNA replication, initiation of DNA replication at origins of replication, and subsequent elongation of nascent chains at replication forks. Early studies of these effects suggested that inhibition of initiation of DNA replication induced by ionizing radiation might occur incis as a result of alterations in chromatin structure produced by radiation-induced strand breaks (6Makino F. Okada S. Radiat. Res. 1975; 62: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The elongation arrest observed at high doses of UVC radiation also was thought to occur incis when lesions formed a physical block to replication fork progression (7Berger C.A. Edenberg H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, more recent experiments indicate that the inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation (8Cleaver J.E. Rose R.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2189-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) on episomal DNA replication can occur in trans. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of ionizing radiation on DNA replication is reduced in cells from ataxia telangectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients containing mutations in the ATMand NBS1 genes, indicating that the products of these genes mediate this effect in trans as part of an intra-S phase checkpoint response to DNA damage (12Painter R.B.

Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Similarly, in both budding and fission yeast, the DNA replication-inhibitory effect of DNA damage corresponds in part to a trans-acting intra-S phase DNA damage checkpoint mediated by the products of a number of different genes, including structural and functional homologues of ATM and the related checkpoint kinase ATR (14Foiani M.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 369-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In budding yeast, this and a similar checkpoint that responds to stalled replication forks repress late S phase origins of replication in early S phase cells (16Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and budding (17Santocanale C. Sharma K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) yeast, this latter checkpoint also requires homologues of ATR and ATM, in addition to other checkpoint proteins. A similar checkpoint in mammals requires the checkpoint kinase Chk1 (20Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C., Wu, R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. Smythe C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and is abrogated by the ATM and ATR inhibitor caffeine (21Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although this latter checkpoint can be induced by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea in p53-defective cells, a p53-dependent intra-S phase checkpoint that responds to hydroxyurea treatment has also been described (22Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Chernova O. Sharma Y. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14775-14780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although most of the DNA damage and DNA replication intra-S phase checkpoints described above have been shown to inhibit initiation of DNA replication, the molecular targets of these checkpoints remain unknown. Furthermore, whether these checkpoints can also inhibit elongation of nascent chains remains unclear. In fact, recent evidence suggests that UVC radiation also induces a checkpoint that contributes to the elongation-inhibitory effects of this DNA damaging agent (23Bullock S.K. Kaufmann W.K. Cordeiro-Stone M. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, the initiation-inhibitory effect of the intra-S phase checkpoint that responds to stalled forks could be caused by checkpoint stabilization of protein complexes at stalled replication forks in early S phase cells (21Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Thus, a detailed understanding of checkpoints and their molecular targets requires the ability to distinguish initiation from elongation-inhibitory effects, as well as information about the specific conditions under which these effects occur. Most efforts to distinguish between these effects in cellular replicons have employed an indirect approach involving velocity sedimentation of pulse-labeled nascent DNA. Experiments that rely completely on indirect labeling techniques can be problematical in their interpretation, however, because of differences in rate of replication fork movement, radiolabel incorporation at sites of DNA repair, and DNA damage in nascent radiolabeled DNA molecules. Further characterization of checkpoint effects also has been hindered by the difficulty with which the velocity sedimentation technique can be applied to the analysis of DNA replication in the experimental systems that have proved most useful as model eukaryotic replicons, those of yeast and small viral DNA replicons such as simian virus 40 (SV40). SV40 is a particularly useful model system for studying different aspects of the regulation of DNA replication because of the small size of its genome, its replication to high copy numbers, and except for the viral initiator protein and helicase large T antigen, its dependence on cellular proteins for DNA synthesis. Cell-free systems that replicate SV40 DNA have been extensively employed to analyze the effects of DNA damage on SV40 DNA replication (25Iliakis G. Wang Y. Wang H.Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 543-553PubMed Google Scholar). However, most of these studies do not distinguish between initiation versuselongation-inhibitory effects. Consequently, the relationship between the biochemical events detected in these experiments and cellular responses to DNA damage that inhibit DNA replication in intact cells remains unclear. We previously employed SV40 to study the effects of drugs on SV40 DNA replication in intact cells using an assay that clearly and simply distinguishes initiation-specific inhibitory effects from even subtle effects on the elongation phase of SV40 DNA replication (26Gilbert D.M.

This assay employs radiolabeling of replicating SV40 DNA combined with a neutral-neutral (N/N) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique that separates replicating from nonreplicating molecules of DNA. In this study, we employed the velocity sedimentation technique and the neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel-based assay to analyze the initiation and elongation-inhibitory effects on cellular and SV40 DNA replication induced by UVC radiation, which is frequently employed to study DNA damage and checkpoint effects on DNA replication in other systems. We also asked whether the effects of UVC radiation on cellular and viral DNA replication require the checkpoint kinase Chk1. Our results confirm the interpretation of velocity sedimentation experiments in uninfected cells and show that UVC radiation induces a Chk1-dependent and caffeine-sensitive checkpoint that does not require p53 and targets the initiation, but not elongation, phase of cellular and viral DNA replication. They also reveal the existence of a novel intrinsic Chk1-dependent checkpoint pathway that regulates both cellular and viral origins of replication in the absence of DNA damage or stalled DNA replication forks.

For SV40 virus infections, BSC-1 monkey cells were seeded at 5 × 105cells per 100-mm plate and grown for 24 h until 70–80% confluent in Dulbecco's minimum essential media containing Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and 1% nonessential amino acids. Cells were infected with SV40 virus (multiplicity of infection >1) diluted 1:10 in Dulbecco's minimum essential media for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus-containing medium was then removed and cells were incubated an additional 23 h in fresh medium. MDA041 cells were infected with 5 × 109 infectious units/ml of recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP or the dominant negative Chk1 (Lys-Arg) mutation (Ref. 47Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar; gift of C. Vaziri) and analysis of UVC and UCN-01 effects on DNA replication was performed 22 h later. Expression of adenovirus-encoded proteins was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (GFP) or immunoblotting (dn-Chk1). Culture medium was briefly removed from infected and uninfected cells just before irradiation to a sterile bottle in a 37 °C water bath, and monolayers were irradiated with 254 nm wavelength UVC radiation using a Stratagene Stratalinker. Medium was then returned to the plates and cells were cultured for an additional period of time until labeling and/or harvest of DNA. Caffeine or UCN-01 were added to medium to final concentrations of 2 mm or 100 nm, respectively, 2 min before UVC irradiation. Sucrose gradients were prepared from equal volumes of solutions containing 0.1 m NaOH, 0.9 m NaCl, and 0.02 m EDTA and either 5 or 20% sucrose. Measurements of UVC effects on cellular DNA replication were performed by labeling DNA in UVC-irradiated or sham-irradiated cells with 10 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 15 min beginning at 50 min after irradiation. Medium was then removed, and monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. They were then trypsinized at room temperature and cells were suspended in 500 μl of 1× SSC. Aliquots of suspensions containing 3 × 105 cells were then diluted into an equal volume of cell lysis buffer containing 0.2m NaOH, 0.02 m EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 that had been gently layered on top of each sucrose gradient. Cells were allowed to lyse for 3 h at room temperature. The gradients were then centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 20 °C for 2.5 h at 27,000 rpm. They were then distributed into 1-ml fractions and the DNA in each fraction was precipitated on ice for 15 min after adding 100 μg of herring sperm DNA and perchloric acid to a final concentration of 4%. The precipitated DNA was collected on GF/C glass fiber filters prewetted with 1.6 n HCl containing 6% sodium pyrophosphate. Each filter was washed twice with 20 ml of 4% perchoric acid, and then twice with 5 ml of 70% ethanol, and finally 5 ml of 100% ethanol. The dried filters were counted in 3 ml of scintillation mixture. SV40 viral DNA replicating in infected cells was labeled for 20 min with [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml medium) at times after irradiation as indicated in the figure legends. Viral DNA was harvested by washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 3 ml/100-mm culture plate of 100 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS containing 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. Cell lysates were scraped into Falcon round-bottomed polypropylene tubes on ice, and 1 ml of 4 m NaCl was added to each tube with gentle mixing prior to refrigeration for a minimum of 1 h. Hirt supernatants were prepared by centrifugation of the precipitates containing high molecular weight cellular DNA for 30 min at 10,200 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman J-13.1 centrifuge rotor. Supernatants were extracted twice with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (TE)-buffered phenol (pH 7.6) and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). DNA was ethanol precipitated, recovered by centrifugation as above, washed with 70% ethanol, re-centrifuged, and resuspended in restriction enzyme buffer. The effects of UVC radiation on SV40 DNA replication were analyzed as we described previously (27McHugh M.M. Beerman T.A. Burhans W.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,28Cobuzzi R.J., Jr. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol.

The assay employs neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the method of Brewer and Fangman (30Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Purified SV40 DNA was linearized with BamHI for 4 h at 37 °C, and electrophoresed in a 0.6% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr) for 25 h at 0.7 V/cm. The lanes were excised from the first dimension gel, inserted into enlarged preparative wells in second dimension gels of 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE containing 0.5 μg/ml EtBr, and sealed in place with excess agarose. Second dimension gels were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 19 h at 4 V/cm in a 1× TBE running buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml EtBr. Southern blots were hybridized to [α-32P]dATP-labeled full-length linear SV40 DNA probe (specific activity ∼1 × 109 cpm/μg) prepared by random priming EcoRI-linearized SV40 DNA. Unincorporated dNTPs were removed from labeled probe using a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Blots were hybridized to probe for 16 h at 65 °C, washed, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (AmershamBiosciences). The mass of replication intermediates was determined from two-dimensional gel phosphorimages using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) to measure the signals from bubble arcs and 1n DNA. To control for differences in yield of DNA in different experiments, the relative number of RIs was calculated for each experiment by normalizing the signal in the bubble arc to that from the completely replicated 1n DNA, as described previously (27McHugh M.M. Beerman T.A. Burhans W.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Cobuzzi R.J., Jr. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19852-19859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For fluorographic analyses, gels were dehydrated by gentle agitation for 1 h in 95% ethanol followed by a change of ethanol and another 1-h incubation. The dehydrated gels were then impregnated with 5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in 100% ethanol for 1 h with gentle agitation. Fluor was precipitated during a 45-min incubation in distilled water, and the gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper using a gel dryer for 60 min at 60 °C. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C with exposure times adjusted within the linear response range of the film. Replication activity was determined from the [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA signals in x-ray films scanned by computing laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Calculations of relative replication activity were performed using signals from either bubble arcs or completely replicated 1n DNA after normalizing these signals to the mass of the 1n DNA measured in the Southern blots run in parallel, as described previously. The expression of p53 was induced ectopically in exponentially proliferating populations of TR9-7 human fibroblast cells by the withdrawal of tetracyclin from the medium for 2 days to synchronize them mostly in G1, as reported previously (29Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). They were released from the G1 block by addition of tetracyclin and allowed to transit to early S phase in the presence of 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) for 16 h. Cells were then allowed to transit into S phase by withdrawal of aphidicolin for 2 (early S phase) or 6 h (late S phase) before addition of UCN-01 to a concentration of 100 nm. 50 min later, replication intermediates were harvested on the nuclear matrix and then separated from nonreplicating DNA on (N/N) two-dimensional gels as described previously by Brewer and Fangman (30Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Gels were blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes and probed with radiolabeled sequences specific for a 5.6-kbEcoRI fragment of DNA in the human rDNA locus. Signals were detected by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To compare the effects of UVC radiation on SV40 DNA replication detected by two-dimensional gel methodology to its effects on cellular DNA replication detected by velocity sedimentation of pulse-labeled DNA, we first established the precise conditions under which the cellular effects could be observed in our laboratory using the velocity sedimentation technique. In this approach, nascent molecules are pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for a short time in control cells or cells subjected to DNA damaging agents, and then size-fractionated on alkaline sucrose gradients. A selective decrease in numbers of small, [3H]thymidine-labeled origin-proximal nascent molecules compared with larger molecules that had been extended further from origins before the pulse label indicates an initiation-inhibitory effect. A decrease in label associated with nascent molecules of all sizes indicates an elongation-inhibitory effect. Exponentially proliferating cultures of MEFs were subjected to various doses of 254-nm wavelength UVC radiation, pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for 15 min beginning 50 min after irradiation, and then size fractionated on alkaline sucrose gradients. Nascent DNA molecules pulse-labeled in sham-irradiated control cells had a broad distribution of sizes from short, origin-proximal molecules near the top of the gradient to longer molecules that had been extended to regions distal to origins, which migrated closer to the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 1 A, 0 J/m 2 ). Incorporation of label into both populations was reduced in cells irradiated with 10 J/m2UVC (Fig. 1 A, 10 J/m 2 ), indicating inhibitory effects on both initiation and elongation, although the greater decrease in numbers of short, origin-proximal nascent molecules compared with large nascent molecules indicated that the predominant inhibitory effect at this dose of UVC was on initiation of DNA replication. Similar effects were observed at 25 J/m2 UVC radiation (Fig. 1 A, 25 J/m 2 ) except that the labeling of long nascent DNA molecules was somewhat reduced, suggesting a slightly more pronounced elongation-inhibitory effect at this higher fluence. These results are similar to those described earlier except that levels of UVC radiation reported previously to induce these effects were somewhat lower compared with our experiments (3Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 145: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar). At the highest dose of UVC radiation (Fig. 1 A, 50 J/m 2 ), the size distribution of nascent molecules was shifted significantly toward shorter molecules, and the pulse label associated with large molecules was reduced even further. This pattern also has been observed previously at higher fluences of UVC, and has been attributed to a pronounced inhibitory effect on elongation coupled to reinitiation of DNA synthesis beyond a lesion that blocks DNA synthesis on the leading strand template, or discontinuous synthesis beyond a lesion on the lagging strand template (2Kaufmann W.K. Cleaver J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that caffeine abrogates the initiation-inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation (31Painter R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and UVC radiation (32Lehmann A.R. Biophys. J. 1972; 12: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), similar to the effects of mutations in theATM gene (12Painter R.B. Young B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7315-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether caffeine would have a similar effect on DNA synthesis in the UVC-irradiated MEFs employed in our experiments (Fig. 1 B). Irradiation of caffeine-treated cells with 10 and 25 J/m2 UVC only slightly reduced the amount of incorporation into short molecules (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, caffeine abolishes the initiation-inhibitory effect on cellular DNA replication induced by these fluences of UVC radiation in MEFs. Caffeine also slightly reduced the inhibitory effect of 10 J/m2, but not 25 J/m2 UVC radiation on the labeling of long nascent chains (Fig. 1 B, 25 J/m 2 ). These results are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating an initiation-inhibitory effect of UVC radiation by a checkpoint that is inhibited by caffeine (32Lehmann A.R. Biophys. J. 1972; 12: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and suggest that the elongation-inhibitory effect at higher doses of UVC is not part of this checkpoint. The initiation-inhibitory checkpoint does not depend on p53, because UVC radiation had similar effects on DNA replication in p53 −/− MEFS (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the overall amount of incorporation of [3H]thymidine in these experiments was somewhat greater in the sham-irradiated control cells treated with caffeine (Fig. 1 B) compared with control cells that were not treated with this compound (Fig. 1 A, note change of scale for theordinate, B compared withA). Furthermore, the size distribution of nascent DNA molecules in sham-irradiated control cells treated with caffeine was shifted to somewhat shorter lengths (Fig. 1 B, 0 J/m 2 ) compared with the distribution observed in unirradiated control cells in the absence of caffeine (Fig. 1 A, 0 J/m 2 ). The increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine and shorter lengths of nascent molecules suggest that caffeine activates origins of replication independently of its effects on a UVC-induced checkpoint. Stimulatory effects of caffeine on cellular DNA replication have been reported previously (32Lehmann A.R. Biophys. J. 1972; 12: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Tatsumi K. Strauss B.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 135: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Application of the velocity sedimentation technique for distinguishing between initiation- and elongation-inhibitory effects on DNA replication is limited to relatively large nascent molecules. To compare the dose-dependent effects of UVC radiation observed in cellular replicons with those induced on the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication in the much smaller SV40 genome, we analyzed replicating SV40 genomes isolated from UVC-irradiated cells using an assay based on the neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique developed by Brewer and Fangman (30Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). This method separ"

However, there is significant sequence similarity between the two 70-kDa polypeptides only in the N-terminal putative capsid-binding domains. The major, central part of P22 tailspike protein, which forms a parallel β-helix and is responsible for saccharide binding and hydrolysis, lacks detectable sequence homology to the Sf6 protein.

Both are members of the class C bacteriophages (1Ackermann H.W. Eisenstark A. Intervirology. 1974; 3: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) consisting of an icosahedral head and a short tail containing six tailspike proteins responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of the receptorO-antigen. Phages are classified mainly by their morphology, but an evolutionary relationship of all tailed phages is assumed (2Ackermann H.W. Elzanowski A. Fobo G. Stewart G. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,3Hendrix R.W. Lawrence J.G. Hatfull G.F. Casjens S. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 504-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To verify this relationship, it will be helpful not only to rely on sequence similarities but also on the much more strongly conserved folding topologies of homologous proteins. The gene of Sf6 tailspike protein (TSP)1 has been cloned on the basis of its high sequence identity to the P22 TSP gene in the part coding for the N-terminal head-binding domain (4Chua J.E. Manning P.A. Morona R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Quite surprisingly no sequence identity was found in the major central and C-terminal parts of the 70-kDa proteins. The central part harbors theO-antigen-binding sites of P22 TSP. High resolution crystal structures of both the head-binding and theO-antigen-binding part of the homotrimeric P22 TSP have been determined (5Steinbacher S. Seckler R. Miller S. Steipe B. Huber R. Reinemer P. Science. 1994; 265: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Steinbacher S. Miller S. Baxa U. Budisa N. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The central part of P22 TSP consists of right-handed parallel β-helices, associated side-by-side, whereas the subunits strongly interdigitate in the C-terminal part (5Steinbacher S. Seckler R. Miller S. Steipe B. Huber R. Reinemer P. Science. 1994; 265: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The short peptide linking the N-terminal domain to the major central and C-terminal part of P22 TSP is thought to be quite flexible (7Seckler R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both proteins, the P22 and the Sf6 TSP, are endorhamnosidases but function on different O-antigen substrates (8Lindberg A.A. Wollin R. Gemski P. Wohlhieter J.A. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 38-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Iwashita S. Kanegasaki S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The end products in both cases are dimers of the repeating unit (in both cases an octasaccharide), but no hydrolysis of Shigella O-antigen treated with P22 TSP was observed and vice versa (4Chua J.E. Manning P.A. Morona R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The interaction of P22 TSP with O-antigen fragments has been investigated by x-ray crystallography and in solution by biophysical techniques (10Steinbacher S. Baxa U. Miller S. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10584-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Baxa U. Steinbacher S. Miller S. Weintraub A. Huber R. Seckler R. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5144-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TSP binds one oligosaccharide per subunit with micromolar affinity, and the binding site for octasaccharide is a groove running parallel to the β-helix axis along its solvent-exposed face. The active site is situated at the reducing end of the octasaccharide product seen in the complex structure (11Baxa U. Steinbacher S. Miller S. Weintraub A. Huber R. Seckler R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2040-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Specificity forSalmonella O-antigen is reached by a large contact surface involving all sugar residues in the octasaccharide, explaining the unusually high change in heat capacity upon saccharide binding (12Baxa U. Cooper A. Weintraub A. Pfeil W. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5144-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the characterization of Sf6 TSP using biochemical, spectroscopic, and hydrodynamic techniques. We found that Sf6 TSP is a homotrimeric protein with a stability similar to that of P22 TSP. Circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the secondary structure contents of Sf6 and P22 TSP are very similar, thus suggesting similar three-dimensional structures. In analogy to previous experiments on P22 TSP (13Danner M. Fuchs A. Miller S. Seckler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we produced a C-terminal 60-kDa fragment of the Sf6 tailspike polypeptide lacking the putative capsid-binding domain. This large C-terminal fragment, like the corresponding part of the P22 protein, is a homotrimer and resistant to SDS at room temperature, despite the lack of significant sequence identity between both proteins in these parts. The crystallization of this major C-terminal fragment of Sf6 TSP is reported. As P22 TSP is an important model system in protein folding, the relatedness of Sf6 TSP will be used in the future to assess the general validity of conclusions drawn from the P22 TSP system. Ultrapure guanidinium chloride was obtained from ICN Biomedicals. Concentrations of guanidinium chloride solutions were determined by refractive index measurements (15Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Standard proteins for gel filtration were purchased from AP Biotech. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin was from Aldrich. Solutions for the crystallization screen were obtained from Hampton Research. Lipopolysaccharide fragments fromS. flexneri F3, O-antigen 3,4 were purified as described (16Carlin N.I. Lindberg A.A. Bock K. Bundle D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Labeling with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin and purification of labeled O-antigen fragments were done as described forSalmonella O-antigen oligosaccharides (11Baxa U. Steinbacher S. Miller S. Weintraub A. Huber R. Seckler R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2040-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). P22 TSP was expressed and purified as described (14Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was at least 98% pure. UV absorption spectra were recorded in a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Protein extinction coefficients were determined according to the Edelhoch method (17Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Briefly, the molar extinction coefficient of unfolded Sf6 TSP was calculated from the amino acid composition to 62,120m−1 cm−1. Absorbance values were determined from the spectra of quadruplicate dilutions into buffer or denaturant, respectively. The absorbance readings at 280 nm of native and denatured protein were very similar. Thus, the extinction coefficient (61,100 ± 1,000 m−1cm−1) and specific absorbance (0.91 ± 0.014 cm2 mg−1) determined for the native protein in neutral buffer are close to the calculated values for the denatured protein. Fluorescence spectra were measured in a Spex Fluoromax, and circular dichroism was recorded in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Rectangular fused silica cells were used, and the temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath (Spex) or peltier elements (Jasco). Infrared spectra were recorded at 25 °C using the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer IFS66 (Bruker) equipped with an MCT detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. Infrared cells with CaF2 windows and 25-μm lead spacer were used. Protein solutions were extensively dialyzed against 100 mm D2O phosphate buffer, pD 7.0, in a water vapor tight box. Interferograms were taken in the double-sided forward/backward acquisition mode, with zero filling factor of 4, phase corrected according to the Metz algorithm, and Fourier-transformed using the Blackman-Harries 3-point apodization function. Three measurements of each 2000 scans were accumulated and averaged. The single channel intensity spectrum of the protein sample was ratioed to the spectrum of the buffer from the last dialysis step to ensure the best buffer compensation. In order to eliminate spectral contributions due to the atmospheric water vapor, the instrument was continuously purged with dry air. Residual water vapor signals were finally eliminated by interactively subtracting a water vapor spectrum recorded under identical acquisition conditions. A flat base line between 1715 and 1745 cm−1 was obtained. To estimate the secondary structure content, the amide I′ absorption spectrum was corrected for the amino acid side chain absorption of Tyr, Arg, Gln, Asn, Asp, and Glu. The side chain spectra were rebuilt from their molar extinction coefficients at the wavelengths (18Jung C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 325-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) multiplied by the number of the side chains occurring in the protein. Side chain corrected non-deconvoluted and deconvoluted spectra were fitted with a non-linear least squares procedure using Voigt functions representing a convolution of Lorentz and Gauss functions (19Jung C. Hoa G.H. Schroder K.L. Simon M. Doucet J.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12855-12862Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amide I′ deconvolution was performed with the Bruker Opus software using a noise reduction factor of 0.3 and a deconvolution factor of 5000 (Lorentz function, 16 cm−1 width). The start band parameters for the fitting were derived from the position of the negative peaks in the second derivative spectrum. The percentage content of the secondary structure elements was determined from the relative area of the single bands assuming that the integral extinction coefficient for the CO stretching mode of the peptide group is the same for all structural elements (18Jung C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 325-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene for Sf6 TSP (pSf6orf1) has been described elsewhere (4Chua J.E. Manning P.A. Morona R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA coding for the N-terminally shortened Sf6 TSPΔN was amplified from purified pSf6orf1 plasmid DNA using PCR. The oligonucleotides 5′-ATTAATTAGCTAGCGACCCTGATCAGTTCGGTC-3′ and 5′-AATAATTAGCTAGCTAATCAGATGGCCAGATACTC-3′ were used as primers. The PCR fragments were cloned via the NheI restriction site into a pET11a expression vector (Novagen). A clone harboring the PCR fragment in the right orientation was selected by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by sequencing using the following oligonucleotide primers: T7-promoter primer (Novagen), T7-terminator primer (Novagen), and 5′-TTTGCTTATTCCTGGCGGTG-3′. This cloning strategy led to a polypeptide product, which consists of the amino acid sequence Met-Ala-Ser-Lys108-Ile623. Cells ofEscherichia coli GJ1158 (20Bhandari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or BL21 (21Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) carrying the respective expression plasmid were grown in flasks containing 1 liter of LB medium (or LB medium prepared without NaCl for GJ1158) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C. At an absorbance at 550 nm of about 1.0, expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm or by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mm (for GJ1158), and the cells were further incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), disrupted by high pressure lysis, and cleared by high speed centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The tailspike protein was precipitated from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 35% saturation. Because it was observed that salt precipitation for Sf6 tailspike proteins is exceedingly slow, the solution was incubated for 2 days or more at 4 °C to reassure the completeness of precipitation. The precipitate was again resuspended in buffer A, dialyzed against the same buffer, and applied to a DE52 anion exchange column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions of a linear gradient (0–300 mm NaCl in buffer A) were pooled, brought to 0.8 m ammonium sulfate by addition of a concentrated solution, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose FF column (AmershamBiosciences). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.8–0m ammonium sulfate in buffer A and were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon). The last impurities were removed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mmNaCl, pH 7.0). Purified full-length or N-terminally shortened Sf6 tailspike proteins could be concentrated to about 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration without showing strong tendency for aggregation. Analytical gel filtration was performed at room temperature on a Superdex 200 HR size exclusion column (30 cm × 1 cm; Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Proteins used as molecular mass standards were ferritin (450 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), P22 TSP (215 kDa), P22 TSPΔN (180 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), hen egg albumin (45 kDa), Bacillus subtilis pectate lyase (43 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa). 50 μl of Sf6 TSP (1.0 mg/ml) and standard proteins (1.0 mg/ml) dissolved in the buffer B were applied to the column, and protein fluorescence (excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm) was detected. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with UV absorbance optics. The proteins were dissolved at concentrations from 0.14 to 0.42 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. To determine the apparent molecular mass (M), radial absorbance distributions at sedimentation equilibrium were recorded at three different wavelengths (280, 285, and 290 nm) and fitted globally to Equations 1 and 2, ar=a0eMFEquation 1 withF=(1−ρν̄)ω2(r2−r02)2RTEquation 2 using the program Polymole (22Behlke J. Ristau O. Schonfeld H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these equations ρ is the solvent density; ν̄ is the partial specific volume of the protein; ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant;T is the absolute temperature; a r is the radial absorbance, and a 0 is the corresponding value at the meniscus position. The molecular mass was determined by extrapolation of the apparent data to infinite dilution according to Equation 3.1M=1Mapp(1−Bc)Equation 3 In this equation, c is the initial protein concentration, and B is the second virial coefficient. Crystals were grown in hanging drops in cell culture plates (24 wells sealed with cover slips). Protein solutions of about 12 mg/ml were dialyzed against 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and centrifuged to remove aggregates prior to use. Drops were made of equal volumes (1 μl) of protein and precipitant solution and were suspended over 0.5 ml of precipitant solution at 20 °C. By using 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 18% PEG 8000 as the precipitant solution, crystals appeared within 2 weeks. To investigate the stability of the tailspike proteins, thermal unfolding in the presence of SDS was analyzed by quantitative gel electrophoresis (23Danner M. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation was performed essentially as described (14Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the buffer solution used was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, instead of 50 mm Tris/HCl. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and densitometry (14Miller S. Schuler B. Seckler R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Brunschier R.

Expression of the gene coding for Sf6 TSP in E. coli in the absence of Sf6 phage heads or any other Sf6 components resulted in over-produced material in the soluble fraction of cell lysates. After purification as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the recombinant Sf6 TSP was judged to be at least 98% pure, because no additional bands were detectable on silver-stained SDS gels at high sample loads. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation were used to determine the molecular size of Sf6 TSP. The elution volume of Sf6 TSP was almost identical to that of P22 TSP. Both proteins eluted slightly earlier than expected for a trimer on the basis of the column calibration made with globular proteins (Fig. 1 A). This discrepancy may be explained by the somewhat elongated shape of the two tailspike proteins. However, on the basis of the gel filtration results, a tetrameric association state cannot be ruled out. Therefore, we determined the molecular mass of Sf6 TSP independently by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1 B). Sedimentation equilibrium runs were done at different initial concentrations, and the resulting apparent molecular masses were extrapolated to infinite dilution. The molecular mass so determined was 201.2 kDa, close to the value of 202 kDa expected for a homotrimer (Fig. 1 B, inset). Similar to P22 TSP, Sf6 TSP was found to be resistant to denaturation by SDS at room temperature. Unheated samples migrated with an apparent molecular mass of about 180 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, whereas a band at about 67 kDa, the molecular mass expected for the monomer, was observed when the samples had been heated to 99 °C for 3 min prior to electrophoresis. The SDS resistance of the Sf6 TSP trimer allowed us to use SDS gel electrophoresis in order to analyze the time course of thermal denaturation of the protein. The kinetics of thermal denaturation in the presence of 2% SDS at 72 °C are compared for the Sf6 and P22 TSPs in Fig. 2. Only two bands were observed for Sf6 TSP, corresponding to the native protein and the denatured monomer (Fig. 2 B). This is in contrast to the heat denaturation of P22 TSP, where an additional intermediate band is observed (Fig. 2 A). It has been shown previously (25Chen B. King J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal domain is unfolded in this intermediate, whereas the major C-terminal part remains intact (13Danner M. Fuchs A. Miller S. Seckler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The unfolding rate of Sf6 TSP was similar to the unfolding rate of the main C-terminal part of P22 TSP, with half-times of 21.0 and 14.7 min, respectively. The secondary structure content of proteins is commonly determined by far-UV circular dichroism or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Both were used to compare Sf6 and P22 TSP (Fig. 3). In both methods, shape and amplitudes of the spectra were similar between Sf6 and P22 TSP in the regions that are indicative for β-structure. Both methods reveal a very high content of β-structure and suggest that both proteins are essentially devoid of α-helices. Specific differences between the two tailspike proteins are the amplitude of the far-UV CD peak at about 195 nm and the exact position of the main peak in the infrared spectra, which was observed at 1638 and 1635 cm−1 for Sf6 and P22 TSP, respectively. Because FT-IR is a better method for estimating the secondary structure content for all-β-proteins (26Pelton J.T. McLean L.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), only the IR spectra were analyzed quantitatively. The minimum fit model (18Jung C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 325-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for the non-deconvoluted spectra of both P22 and Sf6 TSPs was realized by 5 Voigt bands with predominantly Gauss character. For fitting the deconvoluted spectra, which showed a higher amide I′ band resolution, 10 Voigt bands with predominantly Gauss character gave the best result. The frequency of the single bands assigned to the different structural elements was very similar to the frequencies found for other proteins (18Jung C. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 325-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The results summarized in Tables Iand II show that the secondary structure contents of Sf6 and P22 TSPs are identical within experimental error, regardless of the model used.Table ISecondary structure content of P22 and Sf6 TSP as determined from FT-IR spectra (fit of non-deconvoluted spectra with 5 Voigt bands)Protein structure assignmentSf6 TSP FTIRP22 TSP FTIRP22 TSPx-rayPeaks (cm−1)%1-aCalculated from the relative area of the single bands considered in the curve fitting of side chain corrected, non-deconvoluted amide I′ spectra using 5 Voigt bands.Peaks (cm−1)%1-aCalculated from the relative area of the single bands considered in the curve fitting of side chain corrected, non-deconvoluted amide I′ spectra using 5 Voigt bands.%1-bDetermined from 1TSP and 1LKT by the method of Kabsch and Sander (48).β-Sheet1622.716.81612.94.6β-Sheet1638.943.91634.652.4α-Helix1653.48.91651.19.5Turn/loop1663.016.11661.117.1Turn/loop1678.214.31675.916.4Total β-sheet60.757.035.7Total α-helix8.99.54.4Total turn/loop30.433.559.91-a Calculated from the relative area of the single bands considered in the curve fitting of side chain corrected, non-deconvoluted amide I′ spectra using 5 Voigt bands.1-b Determined from 1TSP and 1LKT by the method of Kabsch and Sander (48Kabsch W.

Open table in a new tab Absorbance, fluorescence, and near-UV CD spectra of Sf6 TSP did not show close similarities to the corresponding spectra of P22 TSP, although the content of aromatic side chains in the two proteins is similar. Nevertheless, these methods verified the well defined tertiary structure of the native Sf6 TSP. Fluorescence emission of the native protein showed a maximum at 342 nm. Denaturation in 6 mguanidinium chloride shifted the maximum to 355 nm, as expected for tryptophan fluorescence in aqueous solution but did scarcely influence the fluorescence emission amplitude. The near-UV circular dichroism spectrum revealed well defined peaks at 278, 285, and 293 nm. Obviously, the environment of the aromatic side chains in Sf6 and P22 TSP is rather different, as could be expected from the different sequences in the C-terminal part. Shigella O-antigen serotype Y consisting of repeating units of -α-l-Rhap-(1,2)-α-l-Rhap-(1,3)-α-l-Rhap-(1,3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1,2)- (16Carlin N.I. Lindberg A.A. Bock K. Bundle D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is hydrolyzed by Sf6 TSP in the α-l-Rhap-(1,3)-α-l-Rhapbond, with the main product containing 2 repeating units (octasaccharide) (8Lindberg A.A. Wollin R. Gemski P. Wohlhieter J.A. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 38-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a more detailed analysis of the enzymatic activity of Sf6 TSP, we performed hydrolysis assays with fragments of the Shigella O-antigen labeled at their reducing ends with the fluorescent dye amino-methyl-coumarin (Fig. 4). Octasaccharide (2 RU), dodecasaccharide (3 RU), and decasaccharide were used as substrates. The latter results from the nonreducing end of the O-antigen polysaccharide chains and contains 2 RU with an α-l-Rhap-(1,2)-α-l-Rhap-(1,3)- unit at the nonreducing end (16Carlin N.I. Lindberg A.A. Bock K. Bundle D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis could be followed by separating samples after different reaction times by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. For all three substrates, the only fluorescence-labeled product was tetrasaccharide. No coumarin-labeled octasaccharide was produced from labeled decasaccharide or dodecasaccharide. Labeled octasaccharide and decasaccharide were hydrolyzed very slowly. At 2.2 μm oligosaccharide, the observed initial rates of enzymatic turnover were 3 × 10−5 and 1 × 10−4 s−1, respectively, more than 100-fold lower than the rate for labeled dodecasaccharide, which was 0.13 s−1. Still, decasaccharide was hydrolyzed significantly faster than octasaccharide (Fig. 4). These features point to a minimum architecture of the binding and active site of the Sf6 tailspike endorhamnosidase, where at least two RU are necessary for efficient binding, and the hydrolysis reaction takes place at the reducing end of these two RU (Fig. 4 B). These features are identical to those observed previously for the P22 TSP (10Steinbacher S. Baxa U. Miller S. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10584-"

Most bacteria have evolved an essential alternative isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that is a target for antibacterial therapeutics. A notable exception is the Gram-positive cocci includingStreptococcus pneumoniae and other pathogenicStreptococci that have retained the mevalonate pathway (14Smit A. Mushegian A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1468-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, the kinetic mechanisms of several of the enzymes in the mevalonate pathway have yet to be determined; among them, phosphomevalonate kinase. Phosphomevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.4.2) catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to (R)-5-phosphomevalonate, resulting in the formation of the pyrophosphoryl linkage found in (R)-5-diphosphomevalonate (Reaction 1). Product formation is favored slightly, K eq = 1.7 (pH = 8.0, T = 30 °C) (15Lee C.S. O'Sullivan W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated subunit molecular mass of the S. pneumoniae enzyme used in this study is 37,026 Da. In the crystal, the enzyme is a hexamer organized as two back-to-back 3-fold symmetric trimers, each arranged around a central hollow core; however, it is a monomer in solution (7Romanowski M.J.

Among the features that distinguish the GHMP kinase nucleotide-binding pocket from the more well known P-loop kinases are that the GHMP P-loop is “missing” the catalytic lysine reside thought to stabilize negative charge that develops at the β,γ-bridging oxygen of ATP during bond cleavage (21Krell T. Maclean J. Boam D.J. Cooper A. Resmini M. Brocklehurst K. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Lapthorn A.J. Coggins J.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Admiraal S.J.

Phosphomevalonate kinase was selected as a crystallization target by the Rockefeller University contingent of the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium because of the lack of a representative structure for the GHMP kinase superfamily. Targeting families without structural representatives maximizes the impact of a structure. This impact is extended into the area of protein function in the current study, which uses a classical initial-rate investigation to define fully for the first time the kinetic mechanism of a phosphomevalonate kinase. Lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast), pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle), hexokinase (yeast), β-NADH, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and pepstatin were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, ADPβS), β-NADP, P-enolpyruvate, β-mercaptoethanol, reduced glutathione, polyethyleneimine-cellulose, and KH2PO4were purchased from Sigma. Mevalonic acid was purchased from Aldrich. NaCl, KCl, Na2HPO4, Hepes, Tris, MgCl2, KOH, glycerol, and Luria-Bertani Miller media and agar were purchased from Fisher.

AG MP-1 resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. YM-10 membranes were purchased from the Millipore. Competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen. Plasmids for the expression of mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase from S. pneumoniae (strain R6) were kindly provided by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium (www.nysgrc.com). Mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases are expressed from a pGEX-6P-1 plasmid with a PreScission protease-cleavable N-terminal GST tag (7Romanowski M.J. Bonanno J.B. Burley S.K. Proteins. 2002; 47: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). LB media (37 °C) was inoculated with freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3). The cells were grown toA 600 = 0.5 and cooled to 17 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 0.70 mm, and the cells were agitated for an additional 16 h at 17 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the wet cell pellet was suspended in 4.2 ml/g cell paste of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) containing lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml), PMSF (290 μm), pepstatin A (1.5 μm), and β-mercaptoethanol (14 mm). The cells were then disrupted by sonication at 4 °C, and cellular debris was spun down (30 min, relative centrifugal force = 12,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was loaded onto a GSTrap column equilibrated at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline. The loaded column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST fusion protein was eluted using Tris/Cl− (250 mm, pH 8.0), KCl (500 mm), and reduced glutathione (10 mm). The GST tag was removed with PreScission protease during overnight dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline containing β-mercaptoethanol (14 mm) at 4 °C. The digest was loaded again onto the GSTrap column. The flow-through, which contained the enzyme, was dialyzed against Hepes/K+ (20 mm, pH 7.5), KCl (100 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (14 mm) at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein was further purified using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (20 mm Hepes, 0–1.0 m KCl gradient). The protein was eluted at 0.2 m KCl. Glycerol and β-mercaptoethanol (10% v/v and 14 mm, respectively) were then added, and the protein was frozen in aliquots and stored at −70 °C where it is stable for ∼3 months. Typically, initial rates were measured at the 16 conditions defined by a 4 × 4 matrix of substrate concentrations in which each substrate was varied in equal steps in reciprocal space from 0.20 to 5.0 ×K m. The energetics of the coupling enzyme reactions are sufficiently favorable that the limiting substrate for the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction is drawn essentially completely to product in either direction. All measurements were taken during consumption of the first 7–8% of the concentration-limiting substrate. The coupling enzymes were extensively dialyzed against Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 7.0), and their kinetic constants were determined at the conditions used to assay phosphomevalonate kinase. The enzyme concentrations were chosen such that the coupling reactions achieved ∼98% of their steady-state levels in <15 s (24McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2782-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ADP synthesis was coupled to the oxidation of NADH using the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (24McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2782-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The formation of NAD+ was monitored by a decrease in fluorescence (λex = 340 nm; λem = 460 nm). Controls determined that the inner filter effect was not significant at the ≤6 μm (i.e. A 340 ≤ 0.037) concentration of NADH used in the experiments. The reaction progress in the inhibition studies was monitored by the change in absorbance (340 nm), rather than fluorescence, associated with the oxidation of NADH. Due to slight inhibition of pyruvate kinase by AMP-PNP, the concentration of this enzyme was increased 5-fold over the assays lacking AMP-PNP to ensure that at the highest concentration of AMP-PNP used in the inhibition study the coupling system reached ∼98% of its steady-state levels in <30 s. Reaction conditions were as follows: Hepes/K+ (50 mm, pH 7.0), P-enolpyruvate (1.0 mm), NADH (0.20 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1.0 mm), and MgCl2 (1.0 mm + [nucleotide]) (T = 25 °C). The production of ATP was coupled to the reduction of NADP+ using the enzymes hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. NADP+ reduction was monitored using fluorescence (λex = 340 nm; λem = 460 nm). Controls determined that the concentration of NADPH produced during the measurements (<5 μm) was low enough to avoid inner filter effects. To lower background fluorescence associated with ATP contamination of ADP, it was purified using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow ion-exchange resin (0–1.0 mKCl gradient). The purified ADP was desalted by loading onto an ion-exchange resin, eluting KCL with 10 mmTEA/HCO 3− and then eluting ADP using 1m TEA/HCO 3−, which was removed by rotary evaporation (25Liu C. Martin E. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting ADP contained <0.1% ATP. The conditions of the reaction were: hexokinase (1.8 units/ml) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.55 units/ml), Hepes/K+(50 mm, pH 7.0), P-enolpyruvate (1.0 mm), NADP+ (0.20 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1.0 mm), and MgCl2 (1.0 mm + [nucleotide]) (T = 25 °C). Data were fit with the non-linear least-squares algorithm developed by Cleland using the models for a sequential mechanism (SEQUEN), which assumes that the binding reactions are at equilibrium), linear competitive inhibition (COMP), and linear noncompetitive inhibition (NONCOMP) (26Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The ADPβS inhibition data were corrected for the very slight (∼2- 8%) background velocity associated with turnover of the ADPβS. Phosphomevalonate was synthesized from ATP and mevalonate using mevalonate kinase. The reaction conditions att o were as follows: mevalonate kinase (0.20 unit/ml), ATP (4.5 mm), mevalonate (3.0 mm), pyruvate kinase (0.5 unit/ml), P-enolpyruvate (5.0 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (1.0 mm), and MgCl2 (7.0 mm) (T = 25 °C). The reaction achieved 80% conversion of mevalonate to phosphomevalonate in 12 h. Mevalonate kinase was purified in a manner similar to that of phosphomevalonate kinase with the exception that the GST tag was not cleaved away and the enzyme was not further purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Mevalonate was prepared from mevalonic acid lactone by incubating the lactone with three equivalents of KOH at 37 °C for 1 h (27Eyzaguirre J. Bazaes S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The solution was then adjusted to pH 7 with HCl and diluted with water to an appropriate concentration. 13C and1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the lactone was quantitatively converted into the free acid, and conversion back to the lactone was not detected for at least 1 h following neutralization. Enzymes were removed by passing the reaction mixture through a YM-10 membrane. The solution was loaded onto an anion-exchange resin (AG MP-1), and the compounds were eluted using a linear 0–1.0 m KCl gradient. Phosphomevalonate eluted at ∼0.35 m salt and contained <1% nucleotide, <5% pyruvate, and <1% P-enolpyruvate. The purified phosphomevalonate was loaded onto a 3-ml Fast-Q resin, washed with 10 mmTEA/HCO 3− to remove KCl, and eluted at 1.0 m TEA/HCO 3−. Excess TEA was removed by rotary evaporation (25Liu C. Martin E. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Diphosphomevalonate was synthesized from mevalonate and ATP using mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase. Pyruvate kinase and P-enolpyruvate were added to minimize product inhibition by ADP and to thermodynamically drive the reaction forward. When mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase were simultaneously added at t o, the reaction proceeded extremely slowly. This was due to what appears to be potent inhibition of mevalonate kinase by diphosphomevalonate. This finding was not pursued in detail and will form the basis for further experimentation. Inhibition was avoided by adding phosphomevalonate kinase after the mevalonate kinase reaction had reached completion. The reactions conditions att o were as follows: mevalonate kinase (0.012 unit/ml), ATP (4.0 mm), mevalonate (3.0 mm), pyruvate kinase (0.5 unit/ml), P-enolpyruvate (5.0 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (3.0 mm), and MgCl2 (7.0 mm) (T = 25 °C). Once the reaction had reached completion (3 h, 80% conversion to product), phosphomevalonate kinase was added to 0.07 unit/ml and the reaction was run for 12 h at 25 °C (60% ATP was converted to diphosphomevalonate). Purification began by removing the enzymes by passing the reaction mixture through a YM-10 membrane. The mixture was then loaded onto an anion-exchange resin (AG MP-1), and the compounds were eluted using a linear KCl gradient (0–1.2 m). Diphosphomevalonate eluted at 0.45 m salt contained <1% nucleotide and <2% pyruvate. Diphosphomevalonate was desalted using the procedure described above for phosphomevalonate. To begin to understand the steady-state ligand-binding properties of the enzyme and to determine its kinetic constants, a classical initial-rate study of the forward and reverse reactions was performed. The forward and reverse reactions, which produce ADP and ATP respectively, were monitored by following the change in fluorescence (λex = 340 nm; λem = 460 nm) associated with either the oxidation of NADH or the reduction of NADP+. ADP production was coupled to NADH oxidation using the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and ATP synthesis was linked to NADP+ reduction using the enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (see “Materials and Methods”). The activities of the coupling enzymes used in the assays were determined under the conditions of the assay and were selected such that the intrinsic lag time of the coupling systems was <15 s (24McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2782-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The energetics of the coupled reactions are sufficiently favorable that, given the modest overall energetics for the PMK reaction, nearly 100% of the limiting substrate for the PMK reaction is drawn to the product in all cases. The initial rates were determined during consumption of the first 7–8% of the limiting substrate. The patterns of the double reciprocal plots of the initial-rate data are consistent with a sequential mechanism in both directions (Fig. 1, A (forward) andB (reverse)). The data were fit using the programs of Cleland (see “Materials and Methods”), and the resulting kinetic constants are compiled in Table I. Intersection to the left of the 1/v axis, seen in each of the four possible 1/v versus 1/S plots, argues against an equilibrium-ordered mechanism (28Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. II. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1970: 1-65Google Scholar). Such mechanisms predict intersection on the 1/v axis when the rates are plotted versus the substrate that is added last, because the first substrate to add is driven to saturate the enzyme at an infinite concentration of the second due to their linked binding. The data also argue against a Ping-Pong mechanism in which, for example, the γ-phosphate is transferred first to the enzyme and then to phosphomevalonate. Such mechanisms predict parallel lines with the exception of the case in which the enzyme intermediate is unstable (29Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. II. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1970: 1-65Google Scholar). An unstable intermediate would produce ADP and be detected by the assay; however, this was not observed. Assuming a random mechanism (which is well supported by the inhibition studies described below), intersection of the lines above the 1/[S] axis indicates positive synergy in the steady-state ligand affinities. In this case, the presence of a productively bound substrate at the active site enhances the affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate 1.8-fold in the forward reaction and 1.2-fold in the reverse reaction. Whenk cat/K m (the pseudo-first order rate constant governing the conversion of substrate to product at [S] ≪ K m) equals the rate constant for a diffusion-limited encounter between a ligand and its active site (∼108-109m−1s−1) (30Samson R. Deutch J.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 68: 285-290Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, New York1998Google Scholar), the encounter is rate determining and the sum of the activation energies of all other barriers is relatively small. This is not the case for the PMK-catalyzed reaction.k cat/K m ranges from 1.1 × 104m−1 s−1 for ADP to 3.3 × 106m−1s−1 for diphosphomevalonate. Thus, steps other than encounter are rate determining. Using the kinetic constants in Table I, the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction was calculated using the Haldane relationship (32Haldane J.S.B. Enzymes. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1965Google Scholar) at 7.5 ± 2.2. This value is in reasonable agreement with the value of 1.8 obtained under slightly different conditions (i.e. T = 28 °C and [MgCl2] = 12.6 mm) (15Lee C.S. O'Sullivan W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IInitial-rate constants for the PMK-catalyzed reactionSubstrateK mK ik catk cat/K mμmμms−1m−1s−1Pmev4.2 (0.6)1-aParentheses indicate the mean ± S.E.7.7 (1.8)Forward1.8 × 106ATP74 (9)137 (35)3.4 (0.2)8.2 × 104PPMev12 (0.6)14 (1.5)Reverse3.3 × 106ADP350 (20)410 (45)3.9 (0.1)1.1 × 104a Parentheses indicate the mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Random and ordered binding mechanisms are distinguishable on the basis of their initial-rate behavior toward inhibitors. Competitive dead-end inhibitors, which typically prevent product formation by preventing the binding of one of the substrates to the active site, are particularly useful for determining the binding order because they result in an uncompetitive inhibition pattern only in the ordered mechanism (34Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is the case whether the reactant binding steps are at equilibrium or in steady-state during turnover (34Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 176-187Crossref Google Scholar, 36Cornish-Bowden A. Principles of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworths- Heineman, London1976Google Scholar). When plotted in the 1/v versus 1/S format, the uncompetitive pattern is a series of parallel lines (i.e. identical slopes) whose 1/v axis intercepts increase with an increasing concentration of inhibitor. The absence of an [I]-dependent slope effect is readily appreciated at [S] ≪ K m where the fraction of enzyme bound to S in any complex can be made negligibly small by a suitable selection of [S]. At these concentrations, I, which is incapable of binding E, will not significantly effect [E] or the quantity of ES formed per unit of concentration of S (i.e. the slope). In a random mechanism, I decreases [E] regardless of [S] and thereby increases the slope of the double reciprocal plot. Thus, the binding order is established by determining whether an inhibitor that is competitive against a given substrate is uncompetitive or non-competitive against the other substrate. If uncompetitive inhibition is observed against a given inhibitor, the mechanism is ordered and the substrate that is competitive against that inhibitor is the second to add. The inhibition patterns needed to define the order of binding in the forward reaction were obtained using the dead-end inhibitors mevalonate and AMP-PNP. Mevalonate is competitive versus phosphomevalonate and noncompetitive versus ATP (see Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Because dead-end complexes do not participate in chemistry, their binding reactions achieve equilibrium in a steady-state mechanism. Consequently, dead-end inhibition constants represent dissociation constants (28Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cornish-Bowden A. Principles of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworths- Heineman, London1976Google Scholar). The mevalonateversus phosphomevalonate study (Fig. 2 A) was carried out at a near saturating concentration of MgATP (34 ×K m; 18 × K i). Assuming random binding (see below) the mevalonate inhibition constantK Mev, 0.92 mm is the dissociation constant governing the binding of mevalonate to the E·MgATP complex. The K m of phosphomevalonate (4.2 μm), is 220-fold less than KMev; thus, the contacts between the enzyme and phosphate play an important role in recognition. This comparison must be tempered by the fact that K mmight not equal K d. It is notable that the addition of the second phosphate to form diphosphomevalonate has a relatively small (3.3-fold) effect on the steady-state affinity. AMP-PNP is a competitive dead-end inhibitor versus ATP (Fig. 3 B).K i for AMP-PNP (1.8 mm) is 24 ×K m for ATP. The AMP-PNP inhibition experiment was performed under conditions ([phosphomevalonate] = 200 μm = 26 × K i) in whichK AMP-PNP should represent the affinity of AMP-PNP for the E-phosphomevalonate complex. The 24-fold difference between the K AMP-PNP and theK m for ATP suggests either that ATP binding is not at equilibrium during turnover or that AMP-PNP does not behave like ATP in its binding interactions with the enzyme. AMP-PNP is noncompetitiveversus phosphomevalonate (Fig. 3 A). Controls established that AMP-PNP inhibition of pyruvate kinase, the coupling enzyme used in these studies, was not significant and did not influence the rate measurements. The absence of an uncompetitive inhibition pattern among these four dead-end inhibition studies argues strongly against an ordered binding mechanism and in support of a random binding scheme in the forward direction. The inhibition patterns needed to determine the order of substrate binding in the reverse direction were obtained using mevalonate, a reversible dead-end inhibitor, and ADPβS, a slow and alternate substrate. Alternate substrates whose turnover is sufficiently slow compared with their native counterparts that their contribution to observed velocity is negligible, behaving like dead-end inhibitors because they effectively stop turnover without influencing the distribution of enzyme intermediates in the native reaction pathway. Reactions in which the γ-phosphate of ATPβS is transferred to a recipient cause sulfur to move from a diester to a monoester environment. Such reactions are ∼50-fold more favorable than their ATP counterparts (37Lerman C.L. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8756-8760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced stabilization is due to the sulfur-dependent reorganization of the charge that occurs in the monoester to diester conversion (i.e. accumulation of negative charge on sulfur and a decrease in the P–O bond order and pK a of the diester oxygen atoms) (38Frey P.A. Sammons R.D. Science. 1985; 228: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant for the phosphomevalonate kinase-catalyzed reaction is 48-times more favorable when ATP is replaced by ATPβS (15Lee C.S. O'Sullivan W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reasoned using the Haldane relationship that the equilibrium effect of sulfur might manifest in the mechanism predominantly as changes ink cat rather than K m, causing ADPβS to be a very slow substrate and a suitable inhibitor; this was the case. k cat for ADPβS, determined at a near-saturating (8.8 × K m) concentration of diphosphomevalonate (0.095 s−1 ± (0.0006)), is 41-fold slower than k cat using ADP.K m for ADPβS and ADP are quite comparable (0.38 ± (0.003) and 0.41 mm, respectively) as are theK ms for diphosphomevalonate with ADPβS and ADP (11 ± (1.2) and 14 μm, respectively). The considerable change in k cat and very small changes in K m that occur when ADP is replaced by ADPβS suggest that the binding reactions in the reverse direction may be at equilibrium during turnover; however, this assertion assumes that the binding interactions of ADPβS and ADP are extremely similar. ADPβS is a non-competitive inhibitor versusdiphosphomevalonate and is competitive versus ADP (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). The kinetic constants for the R- andS-diastereomers of ATPβS in the yeast hexokinase-catalyzed reaction are quite different (39Jaffe E.K. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10839-10845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With Mg2+ as the activating cation, the ratios of K m andk cat for the R/S-isomer pairs are 0.22 and 590, respectively. Accurate interpretation of the results of the ADPβS experiments depends upon accurate quantitation of the ATPβS (R and/or S) formed during the reaction. Because of uncertainty regarding the ratio in which the R- and S-diastereomers of ATPβS are produced by phosphomevalonate kinase and the selective turnover of these diastereomers is produced by hexokinase, it was important to ensure that neither isomer was accumulating during the steady-state measurements. For example, if the S-isomer (the poor hexokinase substrate) was the predominant product, it might accumulate sufficiently to cause significant error in the quantitation of both ADPβS concentration and reaction rate. The ADPβS consumed by phosphomevalonate kinase is regenerated by hexokinase. If regeneration is rapid compared with consumption, the concentration of ADPβS will remain essentially unchanged, indicating that ATPβS has not accumulated. ADPβS is a substrate for pyruvate kinase (it produces the S-diastereomer of ATPβS); thus, it is possible to monitor changes in the ADPβS concentration during initial-rate turnover of phosphomevalonate kinase using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupling system. The success of this method requires that the pyruvate kinase reaction velocity be linear with ADPβS (i.e. ADPβS < K m for the pyruvate kinase reaction, which is 1.2 mm at the conditions used in the ADPβS initial-rate experiments) and that the ADPβS concentration not be depleted significantly by the pyruvate kinase reaction. These constraints were satisfied at conditions identical to those used in the inhibition experiments ([ADPβS] = 0.9 mm) (see legend for Fig. 4) with the exception that ADP was not added and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was replaced by pyruvate kinase (2.0 milliunits/ml) and lactate dehydrogenase (10 units/ml). The pyruvate kinase reaction velocity did not change detectably (<2%) during the initial-rate stage of the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction, indicating that the ADPβS concentration remained essentially constant and that ATPβS did not accumulate. Mevalonate was used as a dead-end inhibitor of the reverse reaction. It is competitive versus diphosphomevalonate and non-competitive versus ADP (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). As was the case for the forward reaction, the inhibition patterns obtained in the four reverse reaction studies are either competitive or noncompetitive. The lack of the uncompetitive pattern convincingly rules out an ordered mechanism (either steady state or equilibrium) and supports a random binding scheme. The data presented in this paper strongly support that the kinetic mechanism of phosphomevalonate kinase from S. pneumoniae is random sequential in both directions. It should be noted that this mechanism differs from that proposed for the same enzyme from mammals. Unlike the Streptococcal enzyme, mammalian phosphomevalonate kinase is not a member of the GHMP kinase family. Studies of the pig liver enzyme have established that the K m for phosphomevalonate ranges from 0.075 (27Eyzaguirre J. Bazaes S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to 0.3 mm (33Lee C.S. O'Sullivan W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which is 18–71-fold higher than that for the Streptococcalenzyme. The pig liver enzyme is reportedly ordered sequential (27Eyzaguirre J. Bazaes S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); unfortunately, the data supporting this conclusion are not published. Nevertheless, this disagreement leaves open the question of the extent to which the mechanisms of these isoforms diverge and whether these differences offer the opportunity for selective inhibition of this essential enzyme, which is found in essentially all pathogenic Gram-positive cocci (14Smit A. Mushegian A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1468-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)."

This structure is involved in locomotion via the attachment of opposed muscles, and in Caenorhabditis elegans, the cuticle is initially synthesized in the embryo and then shed and replaced four times at the end of each larval stage (3Singh R.N. Sulston J.E. Nematologica. 1978; 24: 63-71Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar), resulting in five structurally and chemically distinct stage-specific ECMs (4Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic nematodes. CABI Press, Wallingford, Oxon, United Kingdom2001: 167-193Google Scholar). This ECM is predominantly composed of small highly cross-linked collagens, and in C. elegans, over 150 genes encode cuticle collagens (2Johnstone I.L. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), representing 1% of the entire genome (4Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic nematodes.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and involves numerous complex post-translational modifications (4Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic nematodes. CABI Press, Wallingford, Oxon, United Kingdom2001: 167-193Google Scholar). Mutations in C. elegans cuticle collagen genes can result in abnormal body shape (1Kramer J.M. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 471-500Google Scholar). One such abnormal phenotype is the dumpy (Dpy) phenotype, a shortening of the body length and widening of the animal, and several Dpy loci have been assigned to mutations in individual collagen genes, namely dpy-7 (2Johnstone I.L. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), dpy-2 anddpy-10 (5Levy A.D. Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 55: 567-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Dpy phenotype has additionally been shown to be the result of mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in collagen assembly or modification such asdpy-11 and dpy-18. The dpy-11 locus has been mapped to a gene encoding a thioredoxin-like enzyme (7Ko F.C.F. Chow K.L. Development. 2002; 129: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar). The thioredoxin enzymes are essential redox cofactors in numerous diverse biochemical reactions and cell functions (7Ko F.C.F. Chow K.L. Development. 2002; 129: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse thioredoxin gene knock-out resulted in embryonic lethality, the function of which however remains to be elucidated (8Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M.

Similarly, no function or substrate was identified for dpy-11, but its hypodermal expression pattern and phenotype suggest that it is involved in cuticular ECM assembly.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol.

Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Another key enzyme that is also a part of the P4H complex is the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) enzyme PDI-2 (9Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PDI-2 forms the sole β-subunit of the cuticle-specific P4H complexes and is essential for nematode development, a fact confirmed by the embryonic lethal RNAi phenotype associated with this enzyme (9Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PDIs are multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily (14Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). They can act as molecular chaperones, catalyze disulfide bond formation (14Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and can have specialized functions as exemplified by the β-subunit of P4H (12Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A second C. elegans PDI-encoding gene pdi-1has been characterized. pdi-1 is expressed in an operon withcyp-9 (15Page A.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), an arrangement that is conserved in the closely related species Caenorhabditis briggsae (16Page A.P. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with both PDI-1 and CYP-9 being expressed in the hypodermis in a similar temporal pattern (15Page A.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This operon is predicted to contribute to ECM assembly through the chaperone and disulfide bond formation activity of PDI-1 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity of CYP-9 (15Page A.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An additional predicted pdi with homology topdi-1 and pdi-2 was identified from the C. elegans genome (chromosome I, cosmid H06o01). This third C. elegans pdi was named pdi-3. An ortholog ofpdi-3 has been studied in the parasitic nematodeDirofilaria immitis and has been termed ERp60-like protein (17Chandrashekar R. Tsuji N. Morales T. Ozols V. Mehta K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ERp60 proteins are part of the PDI family; however, they do not substitute for PDI in the P4H complex (18Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola P. Veijola J. Raisanen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). D. immitisERp60-like protein has isomerase activity and is able to refold denatured RNase A, but unusually, it also has transglutaminase-like cross-linking activity in the absence of any sequence identity to this class of enzymes (17Chandrashekar R. Tsuji N. Morales T. Ozols V. Mehta K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase (TGase, EC 2.3.2.13) catalyzes the covalent cross-linking of cellular molecules by the formation of isopeptide bonds between glutamine and lysine residues or polyamines. In many parasitic nematode species (Brugia malayi,Brugia pahangi, Brugia patei, andAcanthocheilonema viteae) TGase activity has been shown to be essential for the production of microfilarial larval stages and the viability of adult worms (19Chandrashekar R. Mehta K. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The D. immitis pdi-3ortholog was also recently determined to have a role in larval molting (20Chandrashekar R. Devarajan E. Mehta K. Parasitol. Res. 2002; 88: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, TGases have been shown to be involved in many processes such as apoptosis (21Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and human epidermal development (22Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigate the genetic and biochemical properties ofC. elegans pdi-3 and its encoded enzyme with respect to the cuticular ECM assembly and modification. Wild type (Bristol N2), CB27(dpy-3), CB61(dpy-5), CB88(dpy-7), MQ375(dpy-7), CB130(dpy-8), CB128(dpy-10), CB224(dpy-11), CB1180(dpy-11), CB458(dpy-13), CB364(dpy-18), EM76(dyp-18), JK2729(dpy-18), CB1350(sqt-1), BE13(sqt-1), BE99(sqt-1), BE63(sqt-3), CB4121(sqt-3), and JR667[unc-119(e2498::Tc1wIs51)] strains were obtained from the C. elegans Genetic Center. The deletion mutant strains for phy-2 and phy-3were generated by the C. elegans genome deletion consortium JK2757(ok177) and TP7(ok199), respectively. A PDI-3-specific anti-peptide antiserum was produced in rabbits using the synthetic peptideCREVKDFVSFISKHSTDGLKGFS. The cysteine residue (underlined) was added to permit conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin prior to immunization. N2 embryos and larvae collected from NGM agar plates were placed on poly-l-lysine slides and freeze-cracked according to previously published methods (23Rogalski T.M. Williams B.D. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The slides were blocked and washed, and the PDI-3 antiserum and/or a monoclonal antibody anti-DPY-7 (a kind gift from Iain Johnstone, Glasgow University) were added (both at 1/50 dilutions). Following incubation, the slides were washed and the secondary anti-rabbit conjugate antibody Alexa Fluor 488 and/or anti-mouse conjugate Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (both from Molecular Probes) were applied. Following incubation, the slides were washed and the solution (50% glycerol, 2.5% DABCO) containing antifadant and nuclear staining solution was added to the slides. Slides were viewed by epifluorescence on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope, and images were taken with a Hamamatsu digital camera and pseudocolored using Improvision OpenLab software. Similarly, MH27 labeling of worms following pdi-3 RNAi was performed as described above but with a fixation step added prior to freeze cracking: 1.25% glutaraldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The MH27 monoclonal antibody (a kind gift from Robert Waterston, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was raised against hypodermal cell desmosomes (24Francis G.R. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1532-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and was used at 1/100 dilution. The secondary antibody used was anti-mouse conjugate Alexa Fluor 594. The pdi-3 reporter gene plasmids were constructed using the C. elegans lacZ/gfppromoterless reporter gene expression vector pPD96–04 (kindly provided Andy Fire and co-workers, Carnegie Institute). The plasmid encodes a nuclear localization signal N-terminal to the lacZ gene. The upstream regulatory region of pdi-3 was identified from a cosmid (H06o01.1, GenBank™ accession number CAB07480 .1). Two constructs encoding 4075- and 1301-base pair 5′ regions of thepdi-3 gene were amplified from genomic DNA by the PCR withTaq polymerase (AB Gene). The primers contained an artificial restriction site (lowercase andunderlined) to allow directional subcloning into the multiple cloning sites of the vector pPD96–04: pdi3P for 5′-gcctgcagTGAAACTGATGCATCCGCAGC-3′ (sense,PstI); pdi3Prev for 5′-gcggatccTTCTCGGTGGTACAATCGACCTG-3′ for the 4075-bp fragment; and 5′-gcggatccGCCTGGACCCAAATCATTAC-3′ for the 1301-bp fragment (antisense, BamHI). These constructs permitted a translational fusion to lacZ with the first six amino acids of the second exon of PDI-3 (pPDI-3PLacZ1) or the first five amino acids of the first exon of PDI-3 (pPDI-3PlacZ2). PCR products were initially cloned into pPCRscript (Stratagene), digested withPstI and BamHI, and ligated into similarly digested pPD96-04. Miniprep DNA was prepared using a Qiagen Miniprep kit, and sequencing was performed to confirm the identity and the translational context of the insert. Transformation of adult hermaphrodite C. elegans was performed by microinjection of plasmid DNA into the syncytial gonad and was carried out using standard methods as described previously (25Picken N.C. Eschenlauer S. Taylor P. Page A.P. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Transformed nematodes were fixed and stained with a 0.3% X-gal solution to detect β-galactosidase activity using standard methods also described previously (25Picken N.C. Eschenlauer S. Taylor P. Page A.P. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR method including the generation of synchronous nematode cultures for staged mRNA and subsequent cDNA are described in detail elsewhere (26Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The gene combinations, pdi-3 and the control gene ama-1(which encodes the large subunit of RNA polymerase II), were amplified from the staged cDNA samples representing pooled mRNA samples from different post-embryonic developmental stages. Primers were designed to span introns in order to distinguish between cDNA and possible genomic DNA signals, and combinations used were as follows:pdi-3, pdi3RT for 5′-ACCACCGAGAAGACTGTTTG-3′ and pdi3ndeR for 5′-TTACAATTCAGTCTTCTTCTTC-3′; and ama-1, ama1F for 5′-TTCCAAGCGCCGCTGCGCATTGTCTC-3′ and ama1R for 5′-CAGAATTTCCAGCACTCGAGGAGCGGA-3′. The PCR reaction samples were electrophoresed, Southern blotted, and probed with pdi-3 andama-1 DNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Prime-It®II Random Primer labeling kit, Stratagene). The blots were autoradiographed and quantified using a Typhoon imager and software. The relative abundance of pdi-3 was determined by comparing its signal toama-1 following four independent RT-PCR reactions. pdi-3 was cloned from wild type C. elegans mixed stage cDNA by PCR using Vent proofreading polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR primers contained artificial restriction sites (lowercase and underlined) to allow cloning into similarly digested pET-15b expression vector (Novagen): pdi3ndeF, 5′-gccatatgGGAGGAGCCGTTCTCGAGTATAC-3′ (sense, NdeI); and pdi3ndeR, 5′-gccatatgTTACAATTCAGTCTTCTTCTTC-3′ (antisense,NdeI). Plasmid DNA was isolated (Plasmid MiniKit, Qiagen), and the insert was sequenced to check that no mutations had been generated by the PCR procedure before transforming into competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene). The expression of recombinant PDI-3 was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to apdi-3/pET15b BL21(DE3)pLysS culture (A 600 0.4–1.0) at 20 °C. After induction, the cells were pelleted, sonicated, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and applied to a nickel-agarose column. Recombinant PDI-3 was eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole pH 8.0, and the elution samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on Nu-PAGE® 4–12% gradient precast acrylamide gel (Invitrogen). The transglutaminase assay was carried out essentially as described previously (27Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In summary, microtiter plates were coated withN, N′-dimethylcasein. The cross-linking assay was performed using 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce) as a substrate. After the washes, the cross-linking of the substrate onto theN, N′-dimethylcasein was detected using a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Calbiochem) andp-nitrophenyl phosphate as a chromogenic substrate. Guinea pig liver TGase (Sigma T5398) was used as a positive control (2.5 μg/ml). Negative control wells with no enzyme were used to monitor and subtract background alkaline phosphatase activity. The data were expressed as percentage activity to that of the positive control, 2.5 μg/ml guinea pig liver TGase. Each assay and control were done in eight replicates. The protein disulfide isomerase assay was performed as described previously (14Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RNase A was denatured using guanidine hydrochloride and DTT, and refolding by PDI was observed in a 1-ml cuvette containing cyclic CMP using a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. In the presence of active RNase A, cyclic CMP is converted to CMP that resulted in an increase in absorbance at 296 nm. Native RNase A (8 μm, same amount as denatured RNase A) was used as a positive control. The data were expressed as percentage of activity compared with that of native RNase A. Both assays were also performed with recombinant PDI-1 and PDI-2, which were expressed in a similar manner as PDI-3 described above. 2S. C. P. Eschenlauer and A. P. Page, unpublished data. The RNA interference procedures employed in this study were as described previously (25Picken N.C. Eschenlauer S. Taylor P. Page A.P. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Full-length pdi-3 cDNA minus the signal peptide-encoding region was produced using the primers described above. The pdi-3 PCR product was ligated in pPCRScript (Stratagene) linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes, SacI for T7 reaction and EcoRV for T3 reaction. T7 or T3 Ribomax kits (Promega) were used to generate sense and antisense RNAs by following the manufacturer's instructions. The injection and soaking RNAi methodology has been described elsewhere (25Picken N.C. Eschenlauer S. Taylor P. Page A.P. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For RNAi feeding, the pdi-3/pPCRscriptEcoRV and SacI fragment was ligated into similarly digested L4440 feeding vector. The construct was then transformed into HT115(DE3) cells, which were used for RNAi feeding at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. The nematode strains tested in the RNAi experiments are described above. N2 and CB364(dpy-18) hermaphrodites and EM76(dpy-18 males) were fed induced pdi-3/L4440 HT115(DE3) cells as described above, and nematodes were collected and washed with M9 buffer. Nematodes were fixed for 1.5 h on ice in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4, rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in distilled water for 1 h followed by three 10-min rinses in distilled water. Samples were then incubated in the dark for 1 h in 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by a wash in distilled water. Nematodes were then dehydrated in acetone, critical point dried in CO2, mounted on stubs, coated with gold (Polaron SC515), and examined in a Phillips SEM500 scanning electron microscope. The gene pdi-3 is found within cosmid H06o01 located on linkage group I. The predicted open reading frame forpdi-3 (H06o01.1) has 8 exons (ranging from 77 to 300 bp). Six of the seven introns ranged between 46 and 362 bp, whereas the first intron was relatively large (2539 bp) for C. elegans(Fig. 1 A). The alignment of the PDI-3 protein, PDI-1, PDI-2, human ERp60, and the D. immitis ERp60-like protein (GenBankTM accession numbers Z92970, Q17967, Q10576, S68363, and AF008300) confirms that the two thioredoxin active site domains (WCGHCK) are highly conserved (Fig. 1 B). The percentage of identical amino acid residues between full-length PDI-3 compared with PDI-1, PDI-2, human ERp60, and D. immitis ERp60-like protein was 28, 30, 45, and 63%, respectively. PDI-3 was more similar to human ERp60 than to C. elegansPDI-1 or PDI-2, but it was most closely related to the ERp60-like protein from the parasitic nematode D. immitis. The alignment of human, rat, mouse, bovine, and hamster ERp60s (respective GenBankTM accession numbers S68363, A28807, P27773, P38657, and AAL18160 ) showed that these vertebrate ERp60s were highly conserved, having 85% of their amino acid residues in common (alignment not shown). The vertebrate ERp60s did not possess the standard ER retention signals of PDI (KDEL) but instead had the sequence QEDL. Preceding this sequence was a lysine rich stretch of amino acid residues (PKKKKKA), which may act as a nuclear localization signal. ER retention signals were present in PDI-1, PDI-2, PDI-3, andD. immitis ERp60-like protein, but they did diverge slightly from the more usual KDEL, being HEEL, HTEL, KTEL, and KEEL, respectively. Indeed a previous study (28Andres D.A. Dickerson I.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that many non-KDEL sequences can act as effective protein ER retention signals (Prosite, www.expasy.org/prosite). In addition, both PDI-3 and D. immitis ERp60-like protein displayed the C-terminal ER membrane retention signals KKTE and KKEE, respectively (29Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). No conserved cluster or bipartite nuclear localization motifs (30Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R922-R924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were detected in PDI-1, PDI-2, PDI-3, or the D. immitis ERp60-like protein. The alignment data suggested that despite their high protein sequence homology to human ERp60, the nematode PDIs may have a different cellular localization and hence a different function. Wild type embryos and larvae were probed with a PDI-3-specific polyclonal antibody in combination with a DPY-7-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). DPY-7 is a cuticle collagen that is expressed solely in the hypodermis and is localized in the cuticular ECM from the elongated embryo stage onwards. 3I. L. Johnstone, personal communication. In the 2-fold embryo (∼500 min after fertilization), PDI-3 staining was observed in most tissues including the gut and the hypodermis (Fig. 2 A). Conversely, DPY-7 localized exclusively in the hypodermal cells (Fig. 2 B). In L1 larvae, PDI-3 localized in many tissues with predominant staining found in the hypodermal and the gut tissues (Fig. 2 C). It can be noted that the pharynx, gut lumen, and body cavity were not stained with either antibody tested (Fig. 2, B and C). Gut nuclei did not stain and appeared as dark patches among the PDI-3-labeled gut tissue (Fig. 2 C). DPY-7 antibody was localized solely to the annular furrows of the hypodermally derived cuticle (Fig. 2 D). The antibody expression pattern was confirmed following the examination of the nuclear-localized reporter constructs comprising thepdi-3 promoter region fused in frame with thelacZ gene. The initial four transgenic lines generated from the construct, comprising the promoter region and the first exon and first large intron of pdi-3 (Fig. 1 A, pPDI-3PLacZ1) did not produce a discernable β-galactosidase staining pattern in the four independent lines generated (data not shown). The second promoter reporter construct (Fig. 1 A,pPDI-3PLacZ2), which only contained a few amino acids ofpdi-3 exon one, resulted in the isolation of three transgenic lines in which each produced distinct β-galactosidase staining patterns. Prominent β-galactosidase reporter expression was observed in many tissues included the lateral seam cell hypodermis (Fig. 2 E), and additionally, strong staining was also observed in the gut cells (Fig. 2 F). The analysis of the pdi-3 temporal expression pattern via RT-PCR on staged mRNA samples demonstrated that it was constitutively expressed throughout the post-embryonic life cycle ofC. elegans (Fig. 3). However, peaks of highest relative abundance were observed at final L4 larval stage and in the young adult stages (Fig. 3). The isomerase activity of recombinant PDI-3 was measured using an RNase A refolding assay (14Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PDI-3 was able to refold denatured RNase A and therefore has disulfide isomerase activity (Fig. 4 A). Following a 4–5-min lag phase, the RNase A activity increased when compared with denatured RNase A in the absence of enzyme (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, theC. elegans hypodermally expressed PDIs, PDI-1 (15Page A.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and PDI-2 (9Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were also found to refold denatured RNase A (Fig. 4 A), and activity was dependent on the concentration of all three recombinant enzymes (Fig. 4 B). PDI-1 had the highest refolding activity over a 20-min reaction (77% RNase A activity recovered) followed by PDI-2 (64%) (Fig. 4 B), whereas PDI-3 was determined to be the least active, having a recovery rate of only 44% for RNase A over the same time interval (Fig. 4 B). In addition to the above disulfide isomerase activity, all three PDIs also displayed TGase-like cross-linking activity using a microplate-based assay (27Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). However, the levels of TGase activity determined for PDI-3 were significantly higher (>2-fold increase) than those observed for bo"

It has been suggested that the functions of arrestins are dependent upon both the number and pattern of phosphorylation sites present in an activated GPCR. However, little is currently known about the relationships between the sites of receptor phosphorylation, the resulting affinities of arrestin binding, and the ensuing mechanisms of receptor regulation for any given GPCR. To investigate these interactions, we used an active truncated mutant of arrestin (amino acids 1–382) and phosphorylation-deficient mutants of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR). In contrast to results with wild type arrestins, the truncated arrestin-2 protein bound to the unphosphorylated wild type FPR, although with lower affinity and a low affinity for the agonist as revealed by competition studies with heterotrimeric G proteins. Using FPR mutants, we further demonstrated that the phosphorylation status of serines and threonines between residues 328–332 is a key determinant that regulates the affinity of the FPR for arrestins. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation status of serine and threonine residues between amino acids 334 and 339 regulates the affinity of the receptor for agonist when arrestin is bound. These results suggest that the agonist affinity state of the receptor is principally regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites and is not simply a consequence of arrestin binding as has previously been proposed. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration that agonist affinity of a GPCR and the affinity of arrestin binding to the phosphorylated receptor are regulated by distinct receptor phosphodomains.

Phosphorylation partially quenches heptahelical signaling, as heterotrimeric G proteins display lower affinity for certain phosphorylated receptors (6Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A.

Subsequent binding of arrestins to activated phosphorylated GPCRs further desensitizes them as a result of the steric preclusion of G protein binding. In addition, arrestin binding can direct the translocation of phosphorylated GPCRs to the endocytic machinery (8Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol.

Many GPCRs resensitize over time in a process presumably dependent upon ligand and arrestin dissociation and the actions of phosphatase(s) (16Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol.

Notwithstanding this basic model, there is great diversity in the processing of GPCRs with respect to sites of phosphorylation and the ensuing mechanisms of desensitization and internalization (8Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that multiple biological models are necessary to account for the complex mechanisms of GPCR processing. Surprisingly little is known regarding arrestin's mechanism of activation through its interactions with GPCRs and the reciprocal effects of arrestin binding on receptor properties. It has been suggested that the ionic interactions of polar residues in the “phosphate-sensing” core of arrestin with phosphoamino acids of an activated G protein-coupled receptor are required for stable complex formation (18Granzin J.

Presumably, phosphoreceptor binding disrupts a delicate charge balance and causes reorientation of the inactive arrestin molecule around a “fulcrum” in the molecule (20Hirsch J.A. Schubert C.

It has been put forward that the binding of activated arrestins to phosphorylated receptors preferentially stabilizes a receptor conformation that displays enhanced ligand affinity (7Key T.A.

Despite these advances, a single model that accounts for the coordinated actions of multiple receptor and arrestin domains in terms of complex formation and agonist affinity regulation has yet to be described. Furthermore, the precise correlation between the type, number, and location of receptor phosphorylation sites and their role in determining arrestin binding affinity as well as the regulation of receptor ligand binding affinity has yet to be elucidated. Carboxyl-terminal truncation of arrestin-2 has been characterized as an “activating” mutation (19Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J.

It is believed that the tail of arrestin stabilizes the basal inactive state by intramolecular interactions with the polar core domain. Truncation reduces the activation energy of visual arrestin by ∼50%, in theory, by the removal of stabilizing interactions that maintain the molecule in an inactive conformation (28Pulvermuller A.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Arrestin truncation has been demonstrated to lead to partial phosphorylation- and activation-independence with a number of GPCRs, including receptors from which the carboxyl terminus, containing critical phosphorylation sites, has been removed (25Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the affinity of truncated arrestin-2 for a carboxyl-terminal peptide of theN-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is significantly higher than that of wild type arrestin-2 (30Potter R.M. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8970-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely there is a complex interplay of multiple receptor and arrestin domains. However, it has yet to be fully determined how multiple, distinct mutations can render arrestins phosphorylation-independent. We have previously demonstrated that FPR internalization, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and chemotaxis can proceed through arrestin-independent mechanisms (31Bennett T.A.

We have also described the characteristics of G protein- and arrestin-FPR complexes in both cell-based and cell-free systems using flow cytometry, spectrofluorometry, and confocal microscopy (7Key T.A.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8483-8486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our work has suggested that phosphorylation of the wild type FPR is sufficient to prevent G protein binding in vitro (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, we also demonstrated that two partial phosphorylation-deficient mutants of the FPR are unable to interact with wild type arrestins (36Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49195-49203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Presumably, the absence of key phosphates in either of two distinct serine and threonine clusters in the carboxyl terminus of these receptors completely inhibited their ability to bind arrestins. Despite this inability, these receptors were fully proficient in terms of their signaling and internalization. In the current report, we examined the interactions of a truncated arrestin-2 mutant (amino acids 1–382) with both wild type and phosphorylation-deficient forms of the FPR. We initially demonstrated both high and low affinity binding of the mutant arrestin to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated wild type receptor, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that the relative agonist affinity of such complexes was entirely dependent upon the phosphorylation status of the receptor. Through subsequent reconstitutions with phosphorylation-deficient FPRs, we identified regions of receptor phosphorylation regulating the affinity of arrestins for the FPR as well as sites critical for high agonist affinity complex formation. To our knowledge, these studies have allowed, for the first time, conclusive discrimination of phosphorylation sites regulating arrestin binding from sites regulating agonist affinity of the receptor. fNle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa546 was synthesized as follows. Alexa Fluor 546 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) and fNle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys (Sigma) were each dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to 2 mm. Equal volumes were incubated with 100 mmtriethylamine at room temperature overnight, and the product was used directly. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. As described previously, stably transfected U937 cells were grown in tissue culture medium at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged from near confluent cultures every 3–4 days by reseeding at 2 × 105 cells/ml, expanded for membrane preparations in sealed, 5% CO2-equilibrated, 1-liter, baffled spinner flasks (Pyrex), and incubated at 37 °C. As described previously, spinner flasks containing near confluent FPR-expressing U937 cells were stimulated for 8 min at 37 °C with 10 μm fMLF, which results in ∼90% maximal receptor phosphorylation (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, flasks were placed on ice, and an equal volume of ice-cold PBS was added. For membrane preparation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in cavitation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 600 μg/ml ATP, pH 7.3) at 4 °C. The cell suspension was then placed in a nitrogen bomb for 15–20 min at 500 p.s.i. Following cavitation, nuclei were separated by centrifugation. The membrane fraction was resuspended in HEPES sucrose buffer (200 mm sucrose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem) prior to flash freezing. Aliquots were stored until use at −80 °C. Membranes were thawed, diluted in an intracellular binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2), and isolated by centrifugation. The membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture set I, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). Suspensions were solubilized on a nutator (Clay Adams) for 90 min. The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation and placed on ice for immediate experimentation. Detergent-solubilized FPR (8–12 μl of receptor preparation) was incubated with either a mixture of bovine brain Gi/Go heterotrimer, purified arrestins, or buffer alone. A fluorescent agonist,N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (10 nm), was added, and the samples were gently mixed at 4 °C for up to 120 min. Blocked samples received a large excess of an unlabeled peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe (fMLFF), prior to fluorescent ligand addition. As described previously, fluorescence was measured by an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (Spectronics) using the photon counting mode in time acquisition mode (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Excitation was fixed at 490 nm with a 490-nm, 10-nm band pass filter (Corion) and an excitation monochrometer. Emission was monitored using a 520-nm, 10-nm band pass interference filter (Corion) and a 500-nm long pass filter (Kopp). Antibody and nucleotide additions were made through a microinjection port above the sample holder. Following protein reconstitution and ligand incubation at 4 °C, samples were diluted with a room temperature binding buffer containing 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and inhibitors. Samples were placed into the spectrofluorometer with gentle stirring, and data were acquired for 70–100 s with a 1.0-s integration time. For the first 10 s, equilibrium levels were obtained. At 10 s, excess anti-fluorescein antibodies, prepared as described previously, were added to the sample. The antibodies rapidly quenched the fluorescence of unbound, labeled ligand. In some assays, excess GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) (Sigma) was added at 40 s to assess receptor-G protein coupling. U937 cells (8 × 106) that stably express the wild type FPR were electroporated with 25 μg of DNA for wild type or mutant arrestin-GFP (pEGFP-N1) constructs. The wild type arrestin-GFP construct was a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). The truncated arrestin-GFP was generated through PCR amplification of amino acids 1–382. After 24–48 h, cells were incubated with 10 nmfNle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa546 for 10 min at either 0 °C or 37 °C. Stimulated samples were immediately fixed with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were washed, resuspended in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and mounted onto glass slides. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope to localize both the FPR (red) and arrestin-2 (green). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. In general, data were plotted as normalized FITC intensity as a function of time. Non-linear regression analyses were performed to generate dose response curves and normalized to maximal values. Carboxyl-terminal truncation of arrestin-2 has been shown to result in phosphorylation-independent binding to GPCRs as well as confer enhanced affinity for an agonist (24Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the current report, we examine the effects of carboxyl-terminal truncation of arrestin-2 on full-length FPR assemblies, employing a non-cellular, spectrofluorimetric assay. The system is predicated on three facts. First, the anti-fluorescein antibody specifically quenches the fluorescence of unbound ligand (37Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay therefore provides a direct measurement of the FITC-ligand dissociation rate. Second, ligand dissociation rates vary on the basis of receptor assemblies. Ternary complexes of both arrestins and G proteins with the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated FPR, respectively, display high affinity for the agonist (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D.

Finally, the addition of guanine nucleotides causes the rapid dissociation of G proteins, but not arrestins, from receptors (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22453-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This dissociation, in turn, results in the rapid dissociation of ligand, because the uncoupled receptor exhibits low affinity for the agonist. We initially sought to examine the effects of arrestin truncation on the ligand dynamics of the phosphorylated, wild type FPR. As shown in Fig. 1 A, incubation of the phosphorylated wild type receptor with 10 μm wild type arrestin-2 and fluorescent ligand for 90 min leads to the formation of a slowly dissociating complex, as described previously (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Truncated arrestin-2 reconstitution, in contrast, at an equivalent concentration results in a high fraction of slowly dissociating species (Fig. 1 A). Titration studies of truncated arrestin-2 with the phosphorylated FPR demonstrate an EC50 of 220 ± 50 nm (Fig. 1 B) in contrast to results with wild type arrestin-2, which display an EC50 of ∼600 nm (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The truncated arrestin-2 therefore exhibits higher affinity for the phosphorylated FPR. Moreover, the magnitude of the ligand affinity shift at a theoretical maximum (B max) is greater in the case of the truncated mutant (see Ref. 7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These effects were entirely dependent upon incubation time with the ligand, because pre-incubation with arrestins alone in the absence of ligand had no demonstrable effects on reconstitution. The t 12 for FPR-truncated arrestin-2 complex formation was 5 ± 2 min (Fig. 1 C), which was similar to results with wild type arrestins (t 12, ∼9 min). Thus, we see no evidence of activation-independent reconstitution in the case of the soluble FPR, in contrast to studies with other GPCRs (25Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our prior work has suggested that a truncated protein of arrestin-3 can bind to the nonphosphorylated, full-length FPR without inducing a ligand affinity change (34Bennett T.A. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neubig R. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22453-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we have also shown that neither truncated arrestin-2 nor arrestin-3 exhibits specific binding to the nonphosphorylated FPR carboxyl terminus alone (30Potter R.M. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8970-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Together, these results support a role for additional receptor domains in arrestin binding. Incubation of the nonphosphorylated FPR with truncated arrestin-2 had no discernible effects on ligand affinity, in contrast to results with the phosphorylated FPR (Fig. 2,cf. Fig. 1). Therefore, to discriminate between a lack of binding and a lack of a ligand affinity shift, we undertook competition studies between heterotrimeric G proteins and truncated arrestin-2. Incubation of the nonphosphorylated FPR with G proteins results in the formation of a high affinity, nucleotide-sensitive complex (7Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A.

We therefore incubated the receptor with high concentrations of truncated arrestin-2 and 1.5 μm G protein to assess competition. As shown in Fig. 2, partial inhibition of high agonist affinity complex formation was observed in the presence of excess truncated arrestin-2. The truncated mutant can therefore compete for the nonphosphorylated FPR with an estimated EC50 of 15–25 μm. Moreover, FPR-arrestin complexes display low agonist affinity in comparison to phosphoreceptor-arrestin assemblies. We have previously demonstrated that two phosphorylation-deficient mutants of the FPR cannot bind to wild type arrestins either in vivo or in vitro despite full competency in terms of signaling and internalization (33Maestes D.C.

These ΔA and ΔB receptors contain targeted substitutions of groups of serines and threonines in the carboxyl terminus of the FPR with non-phosphorylatable alanines and glycines (TableI). Because the truncated arrestin displayed binding toward both the fully phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the FPR, we sought to investigate the binding properties and effects of reconstitution on the ligand dynamics of the phosphorylated ΔA and ΔB receptors.Table ICarboxyl-terminal sequences of FPR mutants Open table in a new tab Incubation of the phosphorylated ΔA receptor with 10 μmtruncated arrestin-2 results in the formation of a high affinity complex, in contrast to an equivalent concentration of wild type arrestin-2 (Fig. 3 A).

Studying Elongator subunit communications, Tot1p (Elp1p), the yeast homologue of human IKK-associated protein, was found to be essentially involved in maintaining the structural integrity of Elongator. Thus, the ability of Tot2p (Elp2p) to interact with the HAT subunit Tot3p (Elp3p) of Elongator and with subunit Tot5p (Elp5p) is dependent on Tot1p (Elp1p). Also, the association of core-Elongator (Tot1–3p/Elp1–3p) with HAP (Elp4–6p/Tot5–7p), the second three-subunit subcomplex of Elongator, was found to be sensitive to loss of TOT1 (ELP1) gene function.

As judged from the observations that (i) pol II-driven transcription is down-regulated in zymocin-treated cells (8Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R.

Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and (iv) the phospho-states of pol II are imbalanced in zymocin-treated cells (29Jablonowski D. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26276-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), zymocin may work by hijacking the TOT function of Elongator to convert it into a global pol II inhibitor. Genetic analyses have shown that deletion of any one of theELP/TOT genes phenocopies the full range ofelp/tot phenotypes induced by elp3point mutations that drastically reduce the HAT activity of Elongator (8Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been speculated that the functional integrity of Elongator is compromised in these deletants, leading to non-productive Elongator HAT scenarios (12Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J., Du, W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).To study TOT/Elongator function further, we analyzed subunit communications within the complex by co-immune precipitation (co-ip). We found Elongator subunit Tot1p (Elp1p) to be essential for Tot2-Tot3 (Elp2-Elp3) and Tot2-Tot5 (Elp2-Elp5) protein-protein interactions. Also, the association of core-Elongator (Tot1–3p/Elp1–3p) with the HAP complex was dependent on Tot1p (Elp1p). The interaction between Elongator and Tot4p (Kti12p) required Tot1–3p (Elp1–3p) and Tot5p (Elp5p), suggesting that Tot4p contacts Elongator as a preassembled holo-complex. Tot4p also bound pol II hyperphosphorylated at its CTD Ser5 position, implying that it may bridge Elongator and pol II.RESULTSTo analyze subunit communication within TOT/Elongator, we constructed strains in which one subunit gene was deleted and different subunits were c-Myc- and HA epitope-tagged. Co-ip was then done in an effort to study protein-protein interaction. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, tot6Δ andtot7Δ cells were found to lose the ability of Tot5p (Elp5p) to associate with core-Elongator subunit Tot2p (Elp2p). Thus,TOT6 (ELP6) and TOT7 (ELP4) influence the structural integrity of the HAP complex, and deletion of either gene causes it to lose its capability to interact with core-Elongator. The fact that protein-protein interaction between the two three-subunit entities also becomes distorted upon deletion ofTOT1 (ELP1) (Fig. 1 A) can be regarded as evidence that Tot1p (Elp1p) is crucial in mediating this inter-complex communication. Consistently, the ability to co-ip Tot5p (Elp5p) by the HAT subunit, Tot3p (Elp3p), was lost when Tot1p (Elp1p) was removed (not shown). Together with the fact that Tot5-Tot3 (Elp5-Elp3) protein-protein interaction is not compromised byTOT2 (ELP2) deletion (19Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), this indicates that the HAP complex communicates with core-Elongator mainly by virtue of Tot1p (Elp1p)-mediated contact(s). Tot4-Tot5 protein-protein interaction, however, does require TOT2 (ELP2) and again TOT6 (ELP6) function (Fig. 1 B). As for the contact between Tot4p and core-Elongator, this may indicate that Tot2p (Elp2p) directly communicates with Tot4p, and indeed, if Tot2p is missing or C-terminally truncated, Tot4p can no longer associate with the HAT subunit Tot3p (Elp3p) of Elongator (see below). Thus, both Tot4p and the HAP complex contact core-Elongator in a different manner that is likely to happen in parallel and not to be mutually exclusive.The yeast Elongator subunit Tot1p (Elp1p) has been shown to be related to IKAP, a scaffold protein that associates with IκB kinase and that is the largest subunit of the human Elongator complex (21Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 24Hawkes N.A. Otero G. Winkler G.S. Marshall N. Dahmus M.E. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Thomas C.L.

To assess its role in mediating the structural integrity of Elongator, we required data concerning individual Elongator subunit interactions in the presence and absence of TOT1(ELP1). Thus, the ability of Elongator subunit Tot2p (Elp2p) to co-ip the HAT subunit Tot3p (Elp3p) of Elongator was fully dependent on the presence of a functional TOT1 (ELP1) gene (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, Elongator-associated factor Tot4p required Tot1p (Elp1p) to interact with the HAP component Tot5p (Elp5p) (Fig. 2 B). Together with our previous findings that the interactions between Tot1p (Elp1p) and Tot3p (Elp3p) as well as Tot5p (Elp5p) and Tot3p (Elp3p) are insensitive to Tot2p (Elp2p) (19Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), our observations suggest that Tot1p (Elp1p) may play a role as a scaffold to which Tot3p (Elp3p) and Tot2p (Elp2p) assemble onto to form core-Elongator. Moreover, Tot1p (Elp1p) can be considered to mediate the contact between core-Elongator and the HAP complex since this inter-subcomplex communication is lost in the absence of Tot1p (Elp1p). As for the capability of Tot3p (Elp3p) to co-ip Tot4p, both Tot1p (Elp1p) and Tot2p (Elp2p) are required (Fig. 3). Together with the surprising observation that this also holds true for a functionalTOT5 (ELP5) gene (Fig. 3), these data strongly indicate that the association of Tot4p with Elongator requires a completely assembled six-subunit holo-complex.Figure 2Elongator subunit Tot1p mediates Tot2-Tot3 and Tot4-Tot5 protein-protein interactions.

Intriguingly, however,TOT2 (ELP2) deletion does not compromise Tot1-Tot3 (Elp1-Elp3) and Tot3-Tot5 (Elp3-Elp5) protein-protein interaction, indicating that communication between both of these core-Elongator subunits and a representative HAP component is insensitive to Tot2p (15Krogan N.J.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As for the established roleTOT2 (ELP2) plays in the association of Tot4p with Elongator (19Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J.R. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we tested episomal TOT2(ELP2) deletion alleles coding for C-terminally truncated variants (Fig. 4 A, pTOT2Δ1–2) for their abilities to mediate Tot4-Tot3 protein-protein interaction by co-ip. As illustrated in Fig. 4 C, none of these truncations lacking up to one WD40 domain was able to restore Tot4-Tot3 protein-protein interaction in atot2Δ (elp2Δ) background, whereas full-length episomal TOT2 (ELP2) mediated association of Tot4p with Tot3p (Elp3p) in a way indistinguishable from chromosomally encoded wild-type TOT2 (ELP2) (Fig. 4 C). Anti-HA Western analysis of protein extracts obtained from yeast strains expressing the truncations as HA-tagged proteins revealed that the Tot2p (Elp2p) variants were synthesized (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that their incapability in mediating co-ip between Tot4p and Tot3p (Elp3p) in tot2Δ (elp2Δ) cells was not due to protein instability or lack of protein synthesis. Thus, the function of Tot2p in mediating association of Tot4p with Tot3p (and core-Elongator) resides in its extreme C terminus. Consistently, the appropriate truncation alleles conferred zymocin resistance in killer eclipse assays, suggesting that this region plays a role in TOT function and K. lactis zymocicity, too (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these data indicate that Tot2p (Elp2p) mediates at least in part the contact between Tot4p and Elongator. However, for inter-complex communication and interaction between Tot1p (Elp1p) and Tot3p (Elp3p), it appears to be dispensable (15Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell.

As for the zymocin mode of action, which is abrogated in the absence of the C terminus of Tot2p, our findings indicate that zymocin requires Tot4p to be associated with Elongator, providing further evidence that Tot4p influences the TOT function of Elongator (19Fichtner L.

Similarly, c-Myc-tagged Tot4p interacted with pol II form II0 (Fig. 5 A). Remarkably, as judged from utilizing different anti-pol II antibodies, the interaction between Tot4p and pol II was solely restricted to form II0 hyperphosphorylated at Ser5 within the CTD repeat (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, neither pol II form IIA (hypophosphorylated on its CTD) nor pol II form II0 (hyperphosphorylated at the Ser2 of CTD) were co-precipitable with HA-tagged Tot4p (Fig. 5 B). Also, lack of interaction could not be overridden by subjecting yeast cells to cross-linking prior to protein extraction and co-ip to amplify weaker interactions (Fig. 5 B). Thus, Tot4p interacts with pol II form II0 hyperphosphorylated at the Ser5 of CTD, a modification that is transcriptionally characteristic for a post-initiation event and for pol II0 engaged in promoter clearance and/or early transcript elongation (37Komarnitsky P.

This inter-complex communication largely relies on Tot1p (Elp1p), which may serve as a scaffold protein. Fully assembled holo-Elongator is capable to contact Tot4p (Fig. 6), an Elongator-associated factor that is not a structural subunit but rather transiently contacts Elongator, presumably to promote its interaction with elongation-competent pol II0. Consistent with this, Tot4p associates both with core-Elongator subunits and HAP components (8Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R.

Since this modification occurs after preinitiation complex formation (37Komarnitsky P. Cho E-J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 38Cho E-J.

Indeed, a single chromosomal break is lethal if left unrepaired (1Sandell L.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). DSBs are introduced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals, or even spontaneously. DSB results in the loss of the continuity of DNA and the formation of two physical ends. These non-physiological ends of DNA are repaired in eukaryotes by two major pathways, the error-prone NHEJ pathway and the more accurate homologous recombination (HR) pathway (reviewed in Ref. 2Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). NHEJ ligates two broken DNA ends with little or no requirement for sequence homology between the two ends. In contrast, HR requires an intact DNA that is homologous with the DNA to be repaired and that serves as a template for the DNA synthesis to repair the break. The HR pathway requires products of the RAD52 epistasis group genes, including Rad51 and Rad54 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On the other hand, a different set of gene products is necessary for the NHEJ pathway, which includes the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), XRCC4, DNA ligase IV proteins, and the recently described Artemis protein in human cells (3Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M., Le Deist F. Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Artemis possesses nuclease activity that functions to process double-stranded DNA ends and is regulated by DNA-PKcs (4Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber R.M. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The DNA-PK holoenzyme is a serine-threonine protein kinase consisting of DNA-PKcs and the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer. The Ku70-Ku80 complex binds to the very end of broken DNA and then recruits and activates the DNA-PKcs (reviewed in Ref. 5Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The function of Ku proteins is not limited to the repair of non-physiological DNA ends. Ku is a bona fide component of telomeres, the physiological end of linear DNA in eukaryotes (6Gravel S. Larrivee M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Telomeres consist of telomeric DNA, tandem repeats of short G-rich sequences in most cases, and many associating proteins (reviewed in Refs. 9Cooper J.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 10de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By forming a large protein-DNA complex, telomeres protect the physiological end from DNA degradation and HR- or NHEJ-mediated DNA repair reactions. Accordingly, telomeres are essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Besides this essential role, telomeres show several characteristic features. It is known that genes located close to telomeres become silenced. This is a phenomenon related to the position effect shown by a variety of heterochromatins, and it is called the telomere position effect (TPE). Indeed, telomeres are uniquely localized at the nuclear periphery in budding and fission yeasts (11Funabiki H. Hagan I. Uzawa S. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 12Gotta M. Laroche T. Formenton A. Maillet L. Scherthan H. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1349-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), a finding commonly observed with heterochromatin. These observations indicate that telomeres compose a class of heterochromatin. Indeed, many proteins are shared by telomeres and other classes of heterochromatin, such as the silent mating type loci in S. cerevisiae. In addition to these properties shown by the telomeres as heterochromatin, other functions performed by telomeres can be viewed as unique to the telomeres themselves. For example, by recruiting telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase synthesizing telomeric DNA, telomeres compensate for the continuous telomere length reduction caused by the end replication problem. Without this, telomeres become shorter and eventually lose telomeric DNA, leading to genetic instability. In S. cerevisiae, Yku70/Hdf1 and Yku80/Hdf2, the homologues of human Ku70 and Ku80, respectively, are components of telomeres and are involved in such telomere functions as TPE, telomere localization at the nuclear periphery, and telomere length control (13Porter S.E.

However, the presence of the Ku proteins at telomeres is enigmatic, because Ku proteins promote NHEJ at the DSB ends, a reaction that evidently should be inhibited at telomeres. Therefore, the physiological significance of the Ku proteins at telomeres is not known precisely. Here we describe the identification and characterization ofpku80 +, the gene coding for theSchizosaccharomyces pombe Ku80 homologue. We found that Pku80 is involved in both NHEJ and telomere metabolism, indicating the conserved roles of this protein in a diverse set of eukaryotes. Interestingly, we found that Pku80 is bound to the native telomere but not to the ectopically integrated internal telomeric repeats. This result suggests that the physical end of DNA is necessary for the recruitment of Pku80. The fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

The ORF was then cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen). The resultant plasmid (pMP16) was digested with EcoRV, and aura4 + cassette was inserted (pMP19). pMP16 was digested with EcoRV, and a LEU2 cassette or akan r cassette was inserted (pMP20 or pMP31, respectively). pMP19, pMP20, and pMP31 were digested withNdeI and BamHI, and thepku80::ura4 +,pku80::LEU2, orpku80::kan r fragment was used for transformation.

The strain with circular chromosomes was obtained by successive plating of PM26-1 trt1::LEU2on YPD (TN254). Loss of telomeric repeats and chromosome circularization were confirmed by Southern hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, respectively. This strain was used for constructing the strains expressing pku70-3HA, pku80-3HA, or taz1-3HA. To tag Pku70 with the HA epitope at the C terminus, we amplified the pku70 + ORF by PCR with a primer set of pku70NotEGFP (5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCATAATTTTTTGACATAGTTCGTTAG-3′, the NotI site is underlined) and pku70NotHA (5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAACTCTAAAACCCTGGCACTG-3′, theNotI site is underlined) using wild-type genomic DNA as a template.

The resultant plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and aura4 + cassette was inserted. The resultant plasmid was digested with HindIII, and the pNSU56HindIII fragment was inserted. The resultant plasmid was digested with PvuI and inserted into the pYB26NdeI-AatII site (pYB41). pYB26 consists of theade6 locus BamHI-SpeI fragment inserted into pBluescript II SK(−). pYB41 was digested withBamHI and SpeI and used for transformation.

The linear substrate for the NHEJ assay was prepared by excision of the PvuII fragment from pAL19. Both undigested and linear DNAs were purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Logarithmically growing cells were transformed with an equal amount (0.3 μg) of undigested or linear DNA using the lithium acetate method (20Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E.

The NHEJ frequency was expressed as the percentage of the number of Leu+colonies arising from cells transformed with the linearized plasmid divided by that of colonies transformed with the undigested plasmid. This value was normalized by the value obtained from wild-type cells. Experiments were performed three times, and the average is shown on bar graphs. The pku70 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech). The pku80 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGAD-GH (Clontech).

Chromosomal DNA was isolated using the glass bead-phenol chloroform method (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A.E. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Taz1-HA-, Pku70-HA-, or Pku80-HA-expressing cells grown in 50 ml of YES culture (2 × 107/ml) at 30 °C were fixed with formaldehyde. For immunoprecipitation, anti-HA antibodies (16B12; Babco) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) were used.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas the Ku80 homologue remains to be identified. To investigate whether Ku plays a role in telomere maintenance in fission yeast, we searched for the candidate Ku80-homologue gene in the Sanger InstituteS. pombe genome data base. By using the BLASTP program, we identified ORF SPBC543.03C (hereafter referred to aspku80 +) that encodes a protein showing 20 and 16% identities to human Ku80 and budding yeast Yku80, respectively. The pku80 + gene encodes a protein of 695 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 80 kDa. In mammals and S. cerevisiae, Ku80 forms a complex with Ku70 and is involved in the NHEJ DSB repair pathway (5Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 14Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 27Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We first examined whether Pku80 associates with Pku70 in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 1 A, we found that Pku70 and Pku80 physically interact with each other in this system. We next investigated whether pku80 +is involved in NHEJ, as reported in other organisms, by using thein vivo plasmid DSB repair assay (22Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 28Wilson S. Warr N. Taylor D.L. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2655-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pAL19 plasmid was linearized and transformed into strains containing theleu1-32 mutation (Fig. 1 B). In this assay, the DNA sequence around the linearized site bears no homology with anyS. pombe genomic sequence. Therefore, the linearized DNA is not integrated into the S. pombe genome by HR and is repaired solely by NHEJ. The deletion of pku80 +caused an ∼20-fold decrease in NHEJ efficiency compared with the wild-type strain, and this reduction in the pku80 strain was similar to that found in the pku70 strain (22Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Taken together, we found that Pku80 associates with Pku70 and is involved in NHEJ in fission yeast. We therefore conclude that Pku80 is the orthologue of Ku80. We next analyzed the role of Pku70 and Pku80 in the repair of chromosomal DNA damage. The pku70, pku80, and wild-type cells were exposed to HU, MMS, ultraviolet, or high temperature stress, and the number of surviving colonies was measured (Fig. 1 C). The mutant strain ofrad3 +, a checkpoint gene essential for repairing a variety of DNA damages (29Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S. DeMaggio A. Ford J.C. Hoekstra M. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), was also examined as control. We found that both the pku70 and pku80 cells are sensitive to MMS or HU but not to UV or high temperature. We noticed that the sensitivities of the pku70 and pku80 cells were moderate; minimal numbers of pku70 or pku80colonies were formed, whereas almost no rad3 +colony was formed in this assay. These data suggest that Pku70 and Pku80 are involved in repairing the DNA damage induced by MMS or HU. It has been shown that Ku proteins are involved in telomere metabolism in diverse organisms. In fission yeast, it was reported that Pku70 is involved in telomere length control and suppression of subtelomeric recombination but not in TPE (22Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We next examined the role of Pku80 in telomere maintenance. We first analyzed TPE using the strain that has theura4 + gene inserted within the telomeric region (30Nimmo E.R. Pidoux A.L. Perry P.E. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mutant strain of taz1 + that encodes the fission yeast telomeric DNA-binding protein is known to be defective in TPE (30Nimmo E.R. Pidoux A.L. Perry P.E. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 31Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and is therefore used as control. When TPE is proficient, the cells do not grow on a plate lacking uracil, because the ura4 + gene is silenced. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both the wild-type andpku80 cells, but not the taz1 cells, did not grown on plates lacking uracil (SD-uracil). It was therefore concluded that pku80 + is not required for efficient TPE. Together with the previous study on pku70 + (22Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), both Pku70 and Pku80 are not necessary for TPE in fission yeast. This result is in contrast to what is known in budding yeast, where both Yku70 and Yku80 play crucial roles in TPE (15Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr.

We next investigated whether Pku80 is involved in telomere length control. Genomic DNAs were digested with ApaI to produce ∼300-bp fragments derived from telomeric repeats in wild-typeS. pombe (Fig. 2 B). We found that the length ofApaI-digested telomeric fragments in the pku80strain is ∼100 bp less than that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2 C). A similar degree of telomere shortening was observed in the pku70 strain, as reported previously (22Manolis K.G. Nimmo E.R. Hartsuiker E. Carr A.M. Jeggo P.A. Allshire R.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2 C. It is known that the rad3strain shows telomere shortening (32Dahlen M. Olsson T. Kanter-Smoler G. Ramne A. Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Naito T. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Telomere lengths in thepku70 or pku80 strain were slightly longer than those in the rad3 strain. This result indicates that both Pku70 and Pku80 play a role in telomere length control. In S. pombe, telomeric repeat sequences are flanked by a conserved sequence called TAS (24Sugawara N. DNA Sequences at the Telomeres of the Fission Yeast S. pombePh.D. thesis. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA1988Google Scholar). Depending on the strain background, TAS is found in four, five, or all six chromosome ends (24Sugawara N. DNA Sequences at the Telomeres of the Fission Yeast S. pombePh.D. thesis. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA1988Google Scholar, 26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34Nakamura T.M. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science. 1998; 282: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It was reported that TAS very frequently undergoes recombination in thepku70 strain (26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We examined whether a similar instability of TAS is observed in the pku80 strain. Two probes, TAS1 and TAS2, located within TAS were used as probes in Southern hybridization experiments (26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34Nakamura T.M. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science. 1998; 282: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). TAS1 is positioned immediately centromeric to the telomeric repeats, whereas TAS2 is positioned more internally. In the wild-type strain, digestion of total DNA with EcoT22I generated several TAS1-containing fragments, and the restriction pattern remained constant through 160 generations in liquid growth (Fig. 2 D, left panel). In contrast, aberrant TAS1-positive bands were frequently observed in the pku70 and pku80 strains. During extended growth, the frequency and length of the aberrant bands were increased, as shown by the appearance of slower migrating bands with higher intensities (Fig. 2 D, left panel). Several hypotheses can be proposed for these results. Among them, it is possible that the absence of Pku gave rise to unusual DNA, such as single-stranded DNA, in the subtelomeric region, which was resistant to restriction digestion. The failure of restriction digestion in the subtelomeric region would render the telomere-derived fragments apparently longer than the actual size. However, when TAS2 was used as a probe, no aberrant bands were detected, indicating that the twoEcoT22I sites that demarcate TAS2 were efficiently digested by EcoT22I (Fig. 2 D, right panel). This result makes the hypothesis unlikely, and we concluded that the aberrant telomeric bands in the pku80strain were produced most probably by subtelomeric rearrangements, as reported in the pku70 strain (26Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These rearrangements appear to occur in a relatively small region close to telomeres, because it was detected by the TAS1 probe, but not by the TAS2 probe. The TAS1-hybridizing aberrant bands in the pku70 andpku80 strains showed regular spacing, forming a ladder (Fig. 2 D, left panel). The simplest interpretation of this observation was that the aberrant bands were produced by tandem amplification of a specific TAS1-containing sequence. The length of this amplicon should correspond to the regular increase of the aberrant band ladder (∼0.9 kb). If this interpretation was true, digesting the aberrant bands with restriction site contained by the amplicon only once should produce a single unit of the amplicon in addition to the band derived from the most distal end (presumably containing telomeric repeats that are heterogeneous in size). This prediction turned out to be correct when we digested the genomic DNA from the pkustrain with EcoRI, only a single restriction site of which is present around TAS1 in pNSU70 (Fig. 2 B). The results shown in Fig. 2 E (middle panel) indicate that two types of signals were obtained with the TAS1 probe inEcoRI-digested pku80 DNAs, both of which were also observed in the wild-type strain. Importantly, the intensity of the band at ∼0.9 kb was stronger in the pku80 strain at 10 generations (∼2.6-fold increase, when normalized by the internal control signal (ade6)) than that in the wild-type strain and further increased at 230 generations (∼3.1-fold increase). Moreover, the length of this band is similar to the length increment in the aberrant band ladder. In contrast, the intensities of the smeared bands appearing above the ∼0.9-kb band did not change significantly between the wild-type and pku80 stra"
https://openalex.org/W2100622029,"Severe necrotizing pancreatitis occurs in young female mice fed a choline-deficient and ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Although the mechanism of the pancreatitis is unknown, one consequence of this diet is depletion of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM formation is catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs), which are encoded by liver-specific (MAT1A) and non-liver-specific (MAT2A) genes. In this work, we examined changes in pancreatic SAM homeostasis in mice receiving the CDE diet and the effect of SAM treatment. We found that both MAT forms are expressed in normal pancreas and pancreatic acini. After 48 h of the CDE diet, SAM levels decreased 50% and MAT1A-encoded protein disappeared via post-translational mechanisms, whereas MAT2A-encoded protein increased via pretranslational mechanisms. CDE-fed mice exhibited extensive necrosis, edema, and acute pancreatic inflammatory infiltration, which were prevented by SAM treatment. However, old female mice consuming the CDE diet that do not develop pancreatitis showed a similar fall in pancreatic SAM level. SAM was also protective in cerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat, but the protection was limited. Although the pancreatic SAM level fell by more than 80% in the MAT1A knockout mice, no pancreatitis developed. This study thus provides several novel findings. First, the so-called liver-specific MAT1A is highly expressed in the normal pancreas and pancreatic acini. Second, the CDE diet causes dramatic changes in the expression of MAT isozymes by different mechanisms. Third, in contrast to the situation in the liver, where absence of MAT1A and decreased hepatic SAM level can lead to spontaneous tissue injury, in the pancreas the roles of SAM and MAT1A appear more complex and remain to be defined."
https://openalex.org/W2128984013,"Fcγ receptors are important mediators of the binding of IgG to and induction of phagocytosis in neutrophils. COS-1 cells provide a potentially useful model for studying these receptors because transfection with the FcγRIIA renders these cells phagocytic. During FcγRIIA-mediated phagocytosis in COS-1 cells, endogenous ceramide levels increased 52% by 20 min (p < 0.01). Phospholipase D activity increased by 62% (p < 0.01). Correspondingly, the phagocytic index increased by 3.7-fold by 20 min. Two inhibitors of ceramide formation were used to assess the consequences of reduced ceramide generation. l-Cycloserine, an inhibitor that blocks serine palmitoyltransferase activity, lowered both sphingosine and ceramide levels. Under these conditions, the phagocytic index increased 100% in the presence of 2 mm l-cycloserine. The formation of ceramide resulting from theN-acylation of dihydrosphingosine or sphingosine by ceramide synthase is inhibited by the fungal toxin fumonisin B1. When cells were treated with 5–50 μmfumonisin B1, the cellular level of ceramide decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, while simultaneously the phagocytic index increased by 52%. Concomitantly, three indirect measures of FcγRIIA activity were altered with the fall in ceramide levels. Syk phosphorylation, phospholipase D activity, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation were increased at 30 min. When Syk phosphorylation was blocked with piceatannol and cells were similarly challenged, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation was blocked, but no changes in either ceramide accumulation or MAP kinase activation were observed. Ceramide formation and MAP kinase activation are therefore not dependent on Syk kinase activity in this system. These results indicate that COS-1 cells provide a useful model for the recapitulation of sphingolipid signaling in the study of phagocytosis. Ceramide formed by de novo synthesis may represent an important mechanism in the regulation of phagocytosis.

Receptors for the constant region of IgG, the Fcγ receptors, enable these cells to detect and destroy IgG-coated microorganisms during infection and IgG-coated blood cells in autoimmune disorders. There are three major classes of Fcγ receptors, designated FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII. The various isoforms of FcγRs have highly conserved extracellular portions, but their cytoplasmic domains are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity suggests that all FcγRs may not be involved in phagocytosis. One of the main problems for understanding the FcγR requirements for phagocytosis has been that multiple isoforms are expressed on each type of phagocytic cell. The expression of FcγR in a cell line that does not have endogenous FcγRs provides a model for defining the molecular signals associated with phagocytosis. Fcγ receptor-transfected COS-1 established that a single class of human Fcγ receptor can induce phagocytosis of IgG-sensitized red blood cells (1Indik Z.K. Hunter S. Huang M.M. Pan X.Q. Chien P. Kelly C. Levinson A.I. Kimberly R.P. Schreiber A.D. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 599-606PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIA, which is restricted to cells of megakaryocytic and myeloid lines, mediates several functions. Stimulation of FcγRIIA leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, superoxide production, phagocytosis in monocytes (2Schreiber A.D. Gomez F. Levinson A.I. Rossman M.D. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1989; 3: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 3Unkeless J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and platelet activation (4King M. McDermott P. Schreiber A.D. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 128: 462-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FcγRIIA expression is increased by interferon-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and is decreased by glucocorticoids (6Comber P.G. Rossman M.D. Rappaport E.F. Chien P. Hogarth P.M. Schreiber A.D. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 124: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Rossman M.D. Ruiz P. Comber P. Gomez F. Rottem M. Schreiber A.D. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). Thus COS-1 cells transfected with FcγRIIA provide a potentially useful model for the study of phagocytosis. The tyrosine kinase Syk plays a critical role in the phagocytic pathway mediated by Fcγ receptors. A cytoplasmic amino acid motif, known as ITAM, is present on FcγRIIA, FcγRI/γ, and FcγRIIIA/γ and is essential for phagocytosis. Cross-linking of the Fc receptor induces binding of Src family protein tyrosine kinase to the ITAM, leading to an activation of the Src family protein tyrosine kinases and ITAM tyrosine phosphorylation (8Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kiener P.A. Rankin B.M. Burkhardt A.L. Schieven G.L. Gilliland L.K. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Ledbetter J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24442-24448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This serves to recruit Syk, an SH2-domain-containing tyrosine kinase, which when activated phosphorylates multiple substrates, including neighboring ITAMs. Syk is recruited from a cytosolic pool. It is also possible that a small number of preformed Syk-ITAM complexes exist in resting cells (10Greenberg S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1039-1040PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of Syk phosphorylation by cross-linking of FcγRII therefore suggests that Syk plays an important role in phagocytic signaling through FcγRIIA (8Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15900-15905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol.

The essential role for Syk in phagocytosis signal transduction is supported by the observation that Syk is a necessary component in ITAM-dependent activation of actin assembly (13Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Down-modulation of Syk expression in monocytes using Syk antisense oligonucleotides also results in the decreased ability of these cells to ingest IgG-coated particles (14Matsuda M. Park J.G. Wang D.C. Hunter S. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-1 cells, Syk kinase enhances the phagocytic signal induced by FcγRIIA and increases the number of cells able to mediate phagocytosis (12Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The agonist-stimulated metabolism of membrane lipids produces potent second messengers that regulate phagocytosis. These not only include glycerolipids but sphingolipids as well. Sphingolipids are composed of all lipids carrying a long chain sphingoid amine. Although the role of sphingolipids in membrane structure and organization has been appreciated for some time, members of this diverse group of lipids have recently emerged as a novel class of signaling molecules that also affect phagocytosis. We observed previously (15Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J., Wu, D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 4761-4769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that ceramide is formed in PMN following ingestion of EIgG and that ceramide plays a negative modulatory role in both phagolysosome formation and oxidant release. Sphingosine is known to inhibit phagocytosis by blocking the action of protein kinase C β or protein kinase C δ as well as inhibiting the formation of diacylglycerol by phosphatidic phosphohydrolase (18Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill A.H., Jr. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lavie Y. Piterman O. Liscovitch M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are interconvertible molecules. Thus when using exogenously added sphingolipids, it is often difficult to ascertain which metabolite is responsible for a specific biological response (20Abe A., Wu, D. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,21Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism provide an alternative method for altering the intracellular concentration of sphingolipids. In contrast to short chain sphingolipid analogs, these inhibitors alter the levels of endogenous sphingolipids (22Merrill A.H., Jr. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar, 23Merrill A.H., Jr. Wang E. Vales T.R. Smith E.R. Schroeder J.J. Menaldino D.S. Alexander C. Crane H.M. Xia J. Liotta D.C. Meredith F.I. Riley R.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 392: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The first step in sphingolipid synthesis is the condensation of a fatty acyl-CoA, usually palmitoyl-CoA, with serine in a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (3-ketosphingosine synthase).l-Cycloserine and β-chloro-l-alanine block sphingosine and ceramide biosynthesis by inhibiting serine palmitoyltransferase activity both in vitro and in vivo (24Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Medlock K.A. Merrill A.H., Jr. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The next step, the formation of ceramides resulting from the N-acylation of dihydrosphingosine or sphingosine by ceramide synthase, is inhibited by the fungal toxin fumonisin B1. These inhibitors will provide the first step in determining if de novo synthesis of either sphingosine or ceramide is required for phagocytosis. In the present study we report that COS-1 cells transfected with FcγIIA receptor replicate many of the events associated with phagocytosis in PMNs. We also observe that phagocytosis is associated with the formation of ceramide through de novo synthesis and that inhibition of ceramide synthesis increases phagocytosis. All phospholipids, imidazole, fumonisin B1, l-cycloserine, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and proteinase inhibitors pepstatin and leupeptin were obtained from Sigma.sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli and dithiothreitol were purchased from Calbiochem.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against Syk were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and antibody against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 85 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies against ERK1 and ERK2, recognizing the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of p44 and p42, were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsin EDTA, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and geneticin (G118 sulfate) were from Invitrogen. Sheep erythrocytes were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and were opsonized with anti-sheep erythrocyte IgG (Chapel Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Piceatannol (3,4,3′,5′-tetra-hydroxytrans-stilbene) was obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA). COS-1 cells stably transfected with FcγRIIA receptor cDNA were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose 4.5 mg/ml, glutamine 25 mg/ml, streptomycin 100 units/ml, penicillin (100 mg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium (for control cells) or fresh medium containing inhibitors or agonists. Sheep red blood cells were sensitized with rabbit IgG anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody as described previously (16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes (109/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with anti-sheep erythrocyte IgG (1:350), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Antibody-treated erythrocytes (EIgG) were washed three times and suspended in the same buffer at 2–3 × 109. Phagocytosis assays were conducted as described previously (26Indik Z. Kelly C. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For studies with fumonisin B1 or cycloserine, cells were incubated 24 or 6 h, respectively, prior to the experiment. Fumonisin B1 was applied to cultured cells dissolved in Me2SO, and l-cycloserine was dissolved in water. Lipids were extracted by the method of Van Veldhoven and Bell (27Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Total cellular ceramide was assayed by the method of Preiss et al. (28Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cultured at 1.7 × 106/ml in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media and incubated with fumonisin B1 (24 h) or l-cycloserine (6 h) in the concentrations shown in the figure legends. Cells were labeled with 1-O-[3H]octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (10−8 mol/liter) for 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmol/liter Ca2+ and 1 mmol/liter Mg2+. Ethanol (200 mmol/liter) was added for 5 min at 37 °C. COS-1 cell phagocytosis was initiated as outlined above. Thirty minutes after the addition of opsonized targets, the cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA; the EIgG not internalized were lysed, and COS-1 cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The lipids were extracted, and 3H-labeled phosphatidylethanol and phosphatidic acid were assayed as described previously (29Suchard S.J. Nakamura T. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Boxer L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8063-8068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingosine was quantitated by acetylation with [3H]acetic anhydride to form C2-[3H]ceramide as described by Yatomiet al. (30Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Ohta J. Welch R.J. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Samples were spotted on high performance thin layer chromatography plates and developed in a chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (92:2:8, v/v) solvent. Sphingosine levels were calculated by interpolation from sphingosine standards that were run through the same procedure. For the Syk phosphorylation studies, COS-1 cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 along with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Syk antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added to each sample and incubated for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed briefly three times with lysis buffer and twice with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Absorbed proteins were solubilized in sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF for 2 h at 100 V and immunoblotted with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The membrane was washed three times with 0.2% Tween 20 in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl and then incubated with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) in wash buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Phosphorylated bands were visualized by using ECL. The PVDF membranes were stripped with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.5) at 50 °C and reprobed with the appropriate antibody to demonstrate equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated protein. Immunoprecipitations for the measurement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity were performed as follows. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and incubated with anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit antibody overnight. The kinase activity was measured using phosphatidylinositol and 5 μCi per sample of [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. MAP kinase phosphorylation experiments were performed as follows. The COS-1 cells were cultured in medium containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum to reduce the basal levels of phosphorylation. One hour prior to phagocytosis, the media were aspirated, and the cells were maintained in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride followed by the addition of EIgG. COS-1 cells were lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer. The cleared lysates were combined with sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and run on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with antibody against phosphorylated p44/42 in blocking buffer, washed three times, and then incubated with a secondary antibody consisting of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody in wash buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk. In the present study the role of ceramide in the phagocytic response of COS-1 cells transfected with FcγRIIA was investigated. It was first determined whether the COS-1 cell model recapitulates the changes in ceramide content observed in PMNs. In the PMN ceramide acts as a negative regulator of phagocytosis (16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with FcγRIIA were challenged with EIgG. The ceramide mass and phagocytic index were measured (Fig. 1). In the absence of phagocytic targets ceramide formation did not occur, but following phagocytosis, ceramide levels increased significantly in a time-dependent manner. When COS-1 cells were challenged with EIgG (1:200) endogenous ceramide levels increased 52% over control levels by 20 min (p < 0.01) and remained elevated at 30 min. Correspondingly, the phagocytic index increased by 3.7-fold by 20 min. Phospholipase D activation is a principal signal in PMN activation and has been linked to the uptake of complement and EIgG-opsonized particles. Furthermore, phospholipase D has been identified as an intracellular target of ceramide action (15Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J., Wu, D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase D activity was measured as the formation of phosphatidylethanol. A time-dependent increase in phosphatidylethanol was observed in EIgG-stimulated COS-1 cells (62% at 30 min, Fig. 2). A corresponding increase in the phagocytic index was also observed under these conditions suggesting that the presence of ethanol did not impair phagocytic activity (Fig. 2). The formation of ceramide resulting from theN-acylation of dihydrosphingosine or sphingosine by ceramide synthase is inhibited by the fungal toxin fumonisin B1. The cellular level of ceramide decreased in a concentration-dependent manner to 28% of control levels in cells treated with 5–50 μm fumonisin B1for 24 h (Fig. 3 A). A parallel decrement in ceramide levels was observed in fumonisin B1-treated COS-1 cells with EIgG exposure. Simultaneously the phagocytic index increased by 52% at 30 min (Fig. 3 B). The dose dependence of ceramide depletion during treatment of cells with fumonisin B1closely paralleled the phagocytic index. These results, therefore, suggest an inverse relationship between ceramide formation and phagocytosis. Phospholipase D activity was measured during EIgG-stimulated phagocytosis to assess the consequences of reduced ceramide generation by fumonisin B1. During fumonisin B1 treatment of COS-1 cells, phospholipase D activity increased further by 62% (p < 0.02) (Fig. 4 A). EIgG red blood cell stimulated ceramide levels were significantly decreased with fumonisin B1 treatment (Fig. 4 B). Both the decrease in ceramide content and increase in phospholipase D activity correlated with increased phagocytosis as measured by the phagocytic index. The inclusion of ethanol in these experiments had no significant effect on the phagocytic index (Fig. 4 C). The activation of MAP kinase has been demonstrated previously (31Suchard S.J. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4961-4967PubMed Google Scholar) to be an early event preceding phagolysosome formation in PMNs. Ceramide also inhibits MAP kinase activation and phosphorylation in the PMN. When COS-1 cells were exposed to EIgG, a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of both p42 and p44 MAP kinase was observed (Fig. 5). Preincubation with fumonisin B1 resulted in an increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation in concert with an increase in the phagocytic index. The enhancement of MAP kinase activity by fumonisin B1 was concentration-dependent with a maximal change observed at 35 μm. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk kinase is activated by the ligation of FcγR and has also been implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis. To evaluate whether enhanced Syk phosphorylation occurs during ingestion of EIgG in COS-1 cells after fumonisin B1treatment, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting was performed on lysates of EigG-stimulated COS-1 cells. Syk phosphorylation increased 4.9-fold with increased concentrations of fumonisin B1 and increased phagocytosis (Fig. 6). There was no tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk when cells were treated with fumonisin B1 alone and not challenged with EIgG. The first step in sphingolipid synthesis is the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine in a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. l-Cycloserine blocks sphingosine and ceramide biosynthesis by inhibiting serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Cells treated for 6 h with 0.25 to 2 mm l-cycloserine showed a decline in sphingosine and ceramide levels (Fig. 7). In the presence of l-cycloserine, cellular levels of sphingosine decreased by almost 70%. The depletion of ceramide levels by 50% was also observed. Simultaneously, the phagocytic index increased more than 100%. The peak effect on phagocytosis was observed when ceramide and not sphingosine was maximally lowered. When cells were treated with fumonisin B1, a significant decrease in ceramide was observed, but no significant change in sphingosine levels was seen. The effects of exogenously added sphingosine on the reconstitution of ceramide and the impact on phagocytosis and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk were evaluated. In COS-1 cells treated with fumonisin B1 alone (25–50 μm) ceramide levels declined and the phagocytic index increased as observed previously. Treatment with sphingosine (0.5, 1, and 5 μm) resulted in increased ceramide levels and a decrease in the phagocytic index. However, the effect of sphingosine was blocked by the concomitant addition of fumonisin B1(Fig. 8 A). In samples that were immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk antibody and run on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by protein transfer to PVDF membranes, the protein phosphorylation detected by Western blot showed decreased Syk phosphorylation with increased ceramide levels (Fig. 8 B). These data are consistent with the interpretation that ceramide and not sphingosine is primarily responsible for the inhibition of phagocytosis. COS-1 cells were incubated with N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-acetyldihydrosphingosine, and sphingosine to evaluate further the role of ceramide in Syk phosphorylation. Syk phosphorylation decreased with increased C2-ceramide and sphingosine concentrations, whereas C2-dihydroceramide had no impact on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 9). In order to ascertain the potential role of Syk kinase in phagocytosis, ceramide formation, and MAP kinase activation, a selective inhibitor of Syk kinase was employed. Preincubation of cells with piceatannol (100 μm) for 30 min resulted in a marked inhibition of both Syk phosphorylation (Fig. 10 A) and phagocytosis (Fig. 10 B) in response to EIgG. Cells were next incubated with or without piceatannol (100 μm) for 30 min and then with EIgG for different times. In the absence of piceatannol, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity increased over time as measured by the appearance of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Inhibition of Syk kinase, however, blocked the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (Fig. 11 A). By contrast piceatannol had no effect on MAP kinase activation (Fig. 11 B) or ceramide formation (Fig. 11 C).Figure 11Effect of piceatannol on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MAP kinase, and ceramide formation and phagocytic index during EIgG-stimulated phagocytosis. The COS-1 cells (3.2 × 106/dish) were cultured in medium containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum. One hour before phagocytosis the media were aspirated, and the cells were kept in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mmMg2+, followed by the addition of piceatannol (100 μm) for 30 min. Control cells were incubated in parallel for equal times with no addition of piceatannol. Following the incubation COS-1 cells underwent phagocytosis with EIgG (1 × 108/ml) for different times at 37 °C. EIgG not internalized were lysed, and COS-1 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (A), MAP kinase activity (B), and ceramide levels (C) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean ± S.D. ofn = 3 (ceramide). The MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase data are representative of 3 or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study the effects of de novo synthesis of ceramides and sphingoid bases on FcγRIIA-mediated phagocytosis in COS-1 cells were studied. Four significant findings were observed. First, FcγRIIA-transfected COS-1 cells demonstrated phagocytosis and associated increases in ceramide content. Phagocytosis was accompanied by phospholipase D and MAP kinase activation. Therefore these changes recapitulate those previously observed in PMNs. Second, the increase in COS-1 cell ceramide levels was the result of de novosynthesis, a result not previously observed in PMNs. The rise in ceramide was blocked by inhibitors of ceramide synthase, fumonisin B1, and of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine synthase,l-cycloserine. Third, inhibition of ceramide formation resulted in an increase in phagocytosis as measured by the phagocytotic index. This inhibition was associated with corresponding changes in Syk, MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase D activities as well. Fourth, inhibition of Syk kinase impaired phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and phagocytosis but had no effect on ceramide generation or MAP kinase activation. These data suggest that de novo ceramide formation is not dependent on Syk kinase but that ceramide inhibits Syk kinase activity. Sphingolipids have been studied previously in signaling events in PMNs where they have been implicated as endogenous modulators of leukocyte function. Ceramide has been observed to inhibit both the respiratory burst in freshly isolated PMNs (15Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J., Wu, D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes (16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide is formed as a late response to formyl peptide in adherent PMNs. The time course of ceramide generation is consistent with the down-regulation of oxidant formation, attaining significance 90 min following fMet-Leu-Phe exposure. Ceramide levels rise during phagocytosis in PMNs exposed to EIgG. Significant changes in ceramide are observed 30 min following EIgG exposure. Ceramide accumulation correlates with the termination of both oxidant formation and the phagocytic response. The inhibitory effects of endogenous ceramide are reproduced by the addition of short chain ceramides, specifically N-acetylsphingosine. By contrast, tumor necrosis factor-α, a well characterized agonist known to stimulate ceramide formation, has been reported to stimulate sphingomyelin hydrolysis in human PMNs within minutes. In this model tumor necrosis factor-α primes PMNs at low concentrations and inhibits oxidant formation at higher concentrations. In each system ceramide changes have been correlated with the activation of a neutral sphingomyelinase. Cell fractionation studies indicate that both the sphingomyelinase and ceramide formed are localized to the plasma membrane (17Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Kjeldsen L. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Suchard S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4761-4769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although freshly isolated human PMNs provide an important model for the study of phagocytosis and oxidant formation, the use of these cells for the study of sphingolipid metabolism is problematic. PMNs cannot be cultured for prolonged periods without losing much of their functional responsiveness over the course of hours following isolation. As a result, PMNs are not amenable to study with the use of many of the inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis commonly employed, most of which require a prolonged period of preincubation. Short chain sphingolipid analogs have been used extensively for evaluating phagocytotic signaling. The use of these analogs is predicated on the assumption that they are metabolically inert. However, short chain ceramides are metabolized to their free base, and sphingosine is converted to ceramide. Inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism provide an alternative approach to using sphingolipid analogs for ascertaining the role of ceramides and sphingolipid bases in phagocytosing COS-1 cells. In contrast to short chain sphingolipid analogs, these inhibitors alter the levels of endogenous sphingolipids. During cell activation, ceramide is frequently derived from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the action of a neutral or acidic sphingomyelinase, resulting in the generation of ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Ceramide can also be formed as a result of theN-acylation of sphingosine or through de novobiosynthesis. The de novo biosynthesis of ceramide is initiated by the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, which results in the formation of 3-ketosphinganine, which is subsequently reduced to dihydrosphingosine. Dihydroceramide is formed by the addition of a fatty acid in amide linkage. Ceramides formed through this pathway usually serve as precursors for complex sphingolipids such as galactosylceramide and glucosylceramide. The accumulation of ceramide resulting from de novo synthesis was first reported by Kolesnick and colleagues (32Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) and resulted from anthracycline exposure. Phospholipase D activation is a principal signal in PMN activation and has been associated with the uptake of both complement and IgG-opsonized particles (33Della Bianca V. Grzeskowiak M. Lissandrini D. Rossi F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Fallman M. Gullberg M. Hellberg C. Andersson T. J. Biol.

Furthermore, phospholipase D has been identified as an intracellular target of ceramide during phagocytosis in PMNs (15Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K.J., Wu, D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in fibroblasts (36Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously (16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that N-acetylsphingosine blocked both phagocytosis and activation of phospholipase D in PMNs. In the present study we observed a fumonisin B1-dependent depletion of ceramide with an associated increase in phospholipase D activity, consistent with the regulation of phospholipase D by ceramide (Fig. 4). Duringl-cycloserine treatment of cells, we were unable to detect changes in phospholipase D activity, but the levels of sphingosine and ceramide decreased after 6 h of treatment of the cells, and the phagocytic index increased even more compared with cells treated with fumonisin B1. Sphingosine and ceramide are known to have different effects on cellular processes. Sphingosine is known to inhibit phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C activation and activation of phospholipase D. Sphingosine also alters levels of Ca2+, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and cAMP. An independent role for sphingosine in cell signaling remains to be proven because it is actively metabolized to other products. The mitogenic effect of sphingosine on Swiss 3T3 fibroblast is clearly independent of protein kinase C (37Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23122-23128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of the respiratory burst of human neutrophils is due to a combination of inhibition of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C (39Perry D.K. Hand W.L. Edmondson D.E. Lambeth J.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2749-2758PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time that ceramide is activating protein phosphatases and kinases and protein kinase Cζ, ceramide inhibits phospholipase D activity (40Spiegel S. Merrill A.H., Jr. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In our previous work we evaluated the effects of C2-ceramides and sphingoid bases on PEt and PA formation during phagocytosis. N-Acetylsphingosine inhibited both PEt and PA formation, but N-acetyldihydrosphingosine did not have a significant effect on either PEt or PA formation. In contrast, the sphingoid bases markedly stimulated both PEt and PA formation (16Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, even though both C2-ceramides and sphingoid bases inhibit phagocytosis they act on different signaling pathways. Even though C2-ceramide completely inhibited the phagocytosis of EIgG and phospholipase D activation, treatment of these cells with 1% ethanol only partially (50%) inhibited phagocytosis. These findings suggest that other components of the signaling pathways, in addition to phospholipase D, are susceptible to ceramide-mediated inhibition. FcγRIIA mediates several functions. Stimulation of monocyte FcγRII leads to antibody cellular cytotoxicity, superoxide production, and phagocytosis (2Schreiber A.D. Gomez F. Levinson A.I. Rossman M.D. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1989; 3: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 3Unkeless J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transfecting COS-1 cells with FcγRIIA in the absence of other FcγR renders them capable of phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes (41Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the earliest responses in PMN activation and is required for FcγR-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages (11Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 85: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two classes of protein tyrosine kinases, Src and Syk families, have been found to play a role in FcγR signaling. Syk belongs to the ZAP-70 kinase family. FcγR-transfected COS-1 cells, although phagocytic, presented lower activity levels of Syk than macrophages (43Park J.G. Schreiber A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7381-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that there was another element present in leukocytes that was important for phagocytosis. Because Syk is exclusively present in leukocytes, it was a good candidate to be this component. COS-1 cells transfected with FcγRIIA and treated with fumonisin showed 4.9 times increased Syk phosphorylation and increased phagocytosis. There was no phosphorylation of Syk in control cells pretreated with fumonisin B1 in the absence of EIgG challenge. Treating the cells with fumonisin B1 led to a depletion of ceramide content, which was restored by incubation with sphingosine for 30 min (Fig. 8 B). Sphingosine treatment led to a decrease in the phagocytic index. Protein phosphorylation detected by Western blot showed decreased Syk phosphorylation most directly correlated with increased ceramide levels. To evaluate the role of Syk kinase activation on downstream signaling, the inhibitor piceatannol was used. Inhibition of Syk kinase completely blocked EigG-mediated phagocytosis and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, but no effects on ceramide formation or MAP kinase activation were observed. Presumably a domain on the FcγRIIA receptor not associated with ITAM mediates these signals. Because most systems in which de novo ceramide formation occurs are not associated with agonist receptor interactions, this COS-1 cell system may provide a useful model for delineating the downstream signals associated with ceramide formation. Our studies have shown that cross-linking Fcγ receptors with EIgG results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Syk in COS-1 cells. High levels of ceramide and sphingosine inhibited phagocytosis and Syk activation, thus blocking activation of phagocytosis. Inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism provide an alternative approach for using sphingolipid analogs for assessing the role of ceramides and sphingoid bases in phagocytosis. They demonstrate that most of the ceramide formed during FcγRIIA activation is throughde novo ceramide synthesis and may provide a novel mechanism in the regulation of phagocytosis in COS-1 cells. COS-1 transfection with the FcγRIIA renders these cells phagocytic and recapitulates the changes in ceramide content observed in PMNs."
https://openalex.org/W1992570992,"Tn5 transposase (Tnp), a 53.3-kDa protein, enables the movement of transposon Tn5 by a conservative mechanism. Within the context of a protein and DNA synaptic complex, a single Tnp molecule catalyzes four sequential DNA breaking and joining reactions at the end of a single transposon. The three amino acids of the DDE motif (Asp-97, Asp-188, and Glu-326), which are conserved among transposases and retroviral integrases, have been shown previously to be absolutely required for all catalytic steps. To probe the effect of active site geometry on the ability to form synaptic complexes and perform catalysis, single mutations at each position of the DDE motif were constructed. The aspartates were changed to glutamates, and the glutamate was changed to an aspartate. These mutants were studied by performing in vitro binding assays using short oligonucleotide substrates simulating the natural substrates for the synaptic complex formation and subsequent transposition steps. The results indicate that the aspartate to glutamate mutations restrict synaptic complex formation with substrates resembling the natural transposon prior to transferred strand nicking. This suggests a structural model in which the donor backbone DNA, prior to nicking, occupies the same space that is invaded by the longer side chains present in the aspartate to glutamate mutants. Additionally, catalytic assays support the previous proposal that the active site coordinates two divalent metal ions. Tn5 transposase (Tnp), a 53.3-kDa protein, enables the movement of transposon Tn5 by a conservative mechanism. Within the context of a protein and DNA synaptic complex, a single Tnp molecule catalyzes four sequential DNA breaking and joining reactions at the end of a single transposon. The three amino acids of the DDE motif (Asp-97, Asp-188, and Glu-326), which are conserved among transposases and retroviral integrases, have been shown previously to be absolutely required for all catalytic steps. To probe the effect of active site geometry on the ability to form synaptic complexes and perform catalysis, single mutations at each position of the DDE motif were constructed. The aspartates were changed to glutamates, and the glutamate was changed to an aspartate. These mutants were studied by performing in vitro binding assays using short oligonucleotide substrates simulating the natural substrates for the synaptic complex formation and subsequent transposition steps. The results indicate that the aspartate to glutamate mutations restrict synaptic complex formation with substrates resembling the natural transposon prior to transferred strand nicking. This suggests a structural model in which the donor backbone DNA, prior to nicking, occupies the same space that is invaded by the longer side chains present in the aspartate to glutamate mutants. Additionally, catalytic assays support the previous proposal that the active site coordinates two divalent metal ions. transposase mutations E54K and L372P mosaic end paired ends complex donor backbone Tn5 transposase (Tnp)1 is the protein responsible for the mobility of the Tn5 transposon (1Reznikoff W.S.

Movement of the transposon occurs via a conservative “cut and paste” mechanism that is mediated by Tnp and 19-bp inverted terminal repeats. Transposition involves the complete excision of the transposon from donor DNA followed by insertion into a new location (Fig. 1). The excision and insertion involve four catalytic steps at the transposon ends: transferred strand nicking, hairpin formation, hairpin resolution, and strand transfer into target DNA (2Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37021-37029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These reactions occur within a protein-DNA complex, termed a synaptic complex, consisting of two Tnp molecules and two end sequences (3Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Steiniger-White M. York D. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Single Tnp molecules bound to single end sequences are not catalytically competent, thus restricting the transposition reactions to synaptic complexes (4Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Naumann T.A. Reznikoff W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8944-8949Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The naturally isolated Tn5 transposon transposes at a very low frequency, most likely because frequent transposition would be detrimental to the survival of the cell, constituting a selective disadvantage to a highly active transposon. The low level of transposition can be attributed to both the low activity of the Tnp protein and the suboptimal 19-bp end sequences. The low level of protein activity has been increased by the introduction of two point mutations, E54K and L372P (5Naumann T.A. Reznikoff W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8944-8949Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This mutant is termed EK/LP and is the standard for this and other studies of Tn5 Tnp. The rate of transposition is further increased by replacing the naturally occurring end sequences with a 19-bp site termed the mosaic end (ME) (7Zhou M. Bhasin A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The combination of Tnp EK/LP and ME sequences has allowed the development of an efficient series of in vitro assays used to study the individual steps of the transposition process via gel shift (3Bhasin A.

In the first and third steps, transferred strand nicking and hairpin resolution, a water molecule acts as a nucleophile to hydrolyze a DNA phosphate bond, whereas in the second and fourth reactions, hairpin formation and strand transfer, the 3′-hydroxyl group of the transferred strand acts as the nucleophile (Fig. 1). The active site contains a triad of acidic residues (Asp-97, Asp-188, and Glu-326) termed the DDE motif. This motif is believed to be conserved among all transposases and retroviral integrases. The DDE residues serve to coordinate divalent metal ions that are required for catalysis (11Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

A previous study has suggested that Asp-97 and Glu-326 contribute to the coordination of one metal ion, whereas Asp-97 and Asp-188 coordinate a second ion (15Lovell S. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.R. Rayment I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All three of the DDE residues are required for all four catalytic steps of transposition (9Naumann T.A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17623-17629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In this study point mutations were introduced at each of the DDE residues in the EK/LP background, creating three separate single mutants. These mutations consist of changing the two aspartates to glutamates and the glutamate to an aspartate, yielding D97E, D188E, and E326D. These alterations were chosen because they leave the catalytically essential carboxyl groups in place at each of the three positions, while slightly altering their spatial location within the active site. By studying the ability of these mutants to form paired ends complexes (PECs), the equivalent of synaptic complexes with short oligonucleotide substrates, we were able to predict the spatial position assumed by the nontransposon DNA adjacent to the transposon end sequences, termed donor backbone (dbb), in synaptic complexes prior to the first catalytic step of transposition, transferred strand nicking. Additionally, use of these mutants in catalytic studies lends support to the previous proposal that the DDE motif serves to coordinate two divalent metal ions in the active site (15Lovell S. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.R. Rayment I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no studies of similar chemically conservative mutations of the DDE motif in other transposases or retroviral integrases have been reported in the literature.RESULTSThree single mutants were constructed in the EK/LP background, a hyperactive version of Tnp containing mutations E54K and L372P. These mutations were made at the catalytically critical DDE motif residues. The substitution mutations (D97E, D188E, and E326D) are chemically conservative, differing by only one carbon atom in the length of the side chain. Using these mutants, which have slightly perturbed active site geometry, we were able to probe the spatial requirements for formation of paired ends complexes and catalytic activity in Tn5 transposition. The ability of each of the three active site mutants to form PECs with oligonucleotides simulating the natural substrate at all steps of transposition and to catalyze the three reactions comprising cleavage of the transposon from donor backbone (dbb) DNA was tested in vitro.It is possible to examine the individual steps of the transposition process in isolation by approximating the naturally occurring DNA substrates at different stages of the transposition mechanism using short radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the 19-bp ME sequence, which is recognized by Tnp and defines the end of the transposon. Incubation of DNA substrates with Tnp in the absence of divalent metal ions, required for catalytic activity, allows the formation of PECs containing two DNA molecules and two Tnp molecules (3Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Steiniger-White M. York D. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These PECs are analogous to the synaptic complexes that are the context of transposition. The PECs can be distinguished from free DNA by the decreased mobility of complexes in native polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Because coordination of divalent metal ions is required for catalytic activity, PEC assembly represents the ability of Tnp to form the nucleoprotein complexes within which the transposition reactions occur but not the reactions themselves. Incubation of Tnp with the same radiolabeled oligonucleotides in the presence of divalent metal ions results in Tnp-mediated processing of substrate DNA. Denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the products allows an analysis of the catalytic reactions (2Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37021-37029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Unnicked SubstrateAn unnicked substrate analogous to naturally occurring Tn5 DNA, containing both transposon DNA with an embedded ME sequence and dbb DNA, was used to investigate PEC formation and transferred strand nicking. This 60-bp substrate was radiolabeled with 32P at the 5′-end of the transferred strand. PEC formation was investigated by incubating the unnicked substrate with Tnp and determining the percentage of DNA shifted on a native gel because of decreased PEC mobility (Fig. 2). Two of the mutants, D97E and D188E, show a marked decrease in the ability to form PECs with the unnicked substrate. Without replacing the chemical group at either position, a carboxyl, the change from aspartate to glutamate in both mutants has the effect of increasing the length of the respective amino acid side chains by one additional carbon atom. This extends the carboxyl group by about 1.5 angstroms. Both of these mutants show a severalfold decrease in the ability to bind the unnicked substrate. D97E forms PECs with the unnicked substrate 30% as efficiently as EK/LP, whereas D188E forms PEC only 22% as well. The opposite change in mutant E326D, which withdraws the carboxyl group by one carbon atom by replacing the glutamate with an aspartate, shows no decrease in PEC formation ability and actually seems to increase preference for the unnicked substrate, forming PECs 170% as efficiently as EK/LP (TableI).Figure 2PEC formation assay with unnicked substrate. The efficiency of each mutant to form PECs with short radiolabeled oligonucleotides was determined by gel shift assays. Incubation of Tnp with unnicked DNA substrate results in the formation of PECs that have decreased mobility in a native polyacrylamide gel.

Open table in a new tab The activity of the first catalytic step of transposition, transferred strand nicking, was investigated by incubating the unnicked substrate with Tnp and Mn2+. Introduction of a nick by Tnp produces a labeled 40-mer. Those nicked molecules that undergo hairpin formation result in a labeled 80-mer. Finally, those hairpins that are resolved produce a labeled 40-mer (Fig. 3). Therefore, the amount of DNA that undergoes transferred strand nicking can be determined by quantitating the percentage of total DNA that migrates on a denaturing gel at both the 40-mer and 80-mer positions. The D97E mutant shows no ability to nick the substrate, whereas both D188E and E326D show decreased nicking, performing the reaction 9 and 34% as efficiently as EK/LP (Table II). It should be noted that a substantial part of the D188E decreased nicking ability is likely because of its impaired ability to form PECs with the unnicked substrate.Figure 3Transferred strand nicking assay. The ability of each mutant to catalyze the first step of transposition, transferred strand nicking, was assayed by incubating Tnp with unnicked DNA substrates in the presence of Mn+2. Nicking produces a labeled 40-mer, whereas the following two steps, hairpin formation and resolution, produce a labeled 80-mer and 40-mer, respectively. Adding the amount of substrate that migrates as 40 and 80 mers on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel accounts for all of the substrate that underwent transferred strand nicking.

Open table in a new tab Prenicked SubstrateThe same assays were performed with a prenicked substrate that simulates the substrate for the second catalytic step of the mechanism, hairpin formation. The prenicked substrate differs from the unnicked substrate only in that the transferred strand is replaced by two oligonucleotides, to simulate the transferred strand nick, and that the DNA is radiolabeled at the 5′-end of the nontransferred strand rather than the transferred strand (Fig. 4). All three of the mutants were able to form PECs with high efficiency (Table I). The introduction of a nick appears to greatly relax constrains on PEC formation. In catalytic assays, those molecules that are processed into hairpins produce a labeled 20-mer, which when quantitated via denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis accounts for all hairpin formation. None of the three mutant proteins facilitates efficient hairpin formation. E326D carries out this reaction best, with activity reduced to 37% of EK/LP, followed by D188E with 18%, and finally D97E with 8% (TableII).Figure 4PEC formation with prenicked, hairpin, and precleaved substrates, catalytic hairpin formation, and hairpin resolution assays.

A 50-mer self-complementary DNA molecule, radiolabeled at the 5′-end, was used as the preformed hairpin substrate (Fig. 4). All three mutants show excellent ability to form PECs with the preformed hairpin (Table I). In catalytic assays, resolution of the hairpin releases a labeled 28-mer, which when quantitated accounts for all hairpin resolution. D188E and E326D show a severalfold decrease in hairpin resolution activity, 32 and 27% of EK/LP, whereas D97E is completely defective at this step (TableII).Precleaved SubstrateThe final substrate used in this study was a precleaved molecule that simulates the substrate used for the final step of transposition, strand transfer. This 40-bp substrate, containing transposon DNA and ME sequence but no dbb DNA, was labeled at the 5′-end of both strands (Fig. 4). All three mutants formed PECs with high efficiency (Table I). None of these mutant proteins was able to promote transposition in a qualitative in vivo assay (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe DDE motif (residues 97, 188, 326) has been shown by crystallographic studies to coordinate the divalent metal ions necessary for the catalytic action of Tn5 Tnp (4Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Lovell S. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.R. Rayment I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that all three residues are required for every catalytic step of transposition. Replacing any of them with an alanine (9Naumann T.A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17623-17629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or switching them to their amide equivalents, aspartate to asparagine and glutamate to glutamine (data not shown), destroys all activity. Although the DDE residues are required for catalysis, they are not required for PEC formation. None of the alanine or amide substitutions substantially depresses PEC formation. In this study we analyzed the effects of substituting glutamate for Asp-97 and Asp-188, while changing Glu-326 to an aspartate. The only difference between aspartate and glutamate is an additional carbon in the glutamate side chain. This should amount to an ∼1.5-angstrom difference in the position of the catalytically important carboxyl group in any of the three single mutants. D97E and D188E should result in a slightly deeper insertion of the carboxyl into the active site at the altered residue, whereas in the case of E326D the carboxyl should be withdrawn by a similar amount. The obvious consequence of these changes is to increase crowding in the D97E and D188E mutants, while providing more space in the E326D mutant.Crystallographic studies reveal the position of DNA substrate in the active site. However, all existing structural data depicts Tnp complexed with precut transposon DNA or with DNA containing only one base of dbb DNA. Consequently, we have no knowledge about the position of dbb DNA in synaptic complexes. By allowing a comparison of how these mutations perturb PEC formation, these experiments suggest the position of dbb DNA in synaptic complexes prior to transferred strand nicking.Both of the mutations that increase side chain length of the altered residue, D97E and D188E, dramatically impair PEC formation with the 60-bp unnicked substrate, which resembles the natural substrate for synaptic complex formation, and for the first catalytic step, transferred strand nicking. Not surprisingly, the E326D mutant, in which the side chain is withdrawn from the active site, forms PECs proficiently. This suggests that the interference with PEC formation by D97E and D188E is a result of increased crowding. This observation makes it appear likely that unnicked dbb DNA is positioned such that it experiences steric interference from the mutationally extended side chains present in these two proteins.Other possible explanations, such as a general decrease in ability to interact with DNA, seem unlikely in light of the undiminished ability of these mutants to bind prenicked, hairpin, and precleaved substrates. Both D97E and D188E bind prenicked and hairpin substrates at high levels. The prenicked substrate has the same number and sequence of base pairs as the unnicked substrate. The only difference between these two substrates is the introduction of a transferred strand nick by annealing two oligonucleotides to the nontransferred strand instead of one. The introduction of the nick should have the effect of making the DNA more flexible. Increased flexibility, which could allow the dbb to avoid steric conflict introduced by either of the mutated side chains, is consistent with the observation that PEC formation is unimpaired with the prenicked substrate for all three of the mutants. The unhampered ability of all three mutants to form PECs with the hairpin and precleaved substrates, which have no dbb DNA, is also consistent with the suggestion that it is steric interactions between the dbb and the mutated residues at positions 97 and 188 that impair PEC formation with the unnicked substrate.The possibility that the mutated 97 and 188 residues clash sterically with dbb DNA suggests a model in which the dbb DNA of the unnicked substrate normally occupies space that is invaded by the extended side chains in D97E and D188E. Fig. 5 depicts the active site with the three DDE mutations overlaid on a Tn5 crystal structure (15Lovell S. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.R. Rayment I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This graphically shows the differences in side chain length between the unaltered DDE residues and those in the mutant proteins. The figure shows the mutated side chains in specific orientations, whereas in reality they can rotate and potentially occupy space differently than depicted. Consequently, all of the possible orientations may be responsible for the observed interference with dbb DNA. Because there is only a limited amount of space that the mutated side chains can occupy, the possibilities for the location of dbb DNA are also constrained to the space that can be occupied by the longer glutamate side chains but not the shorter aspartate side chains at positions 97 and 188. This indicates that dbb DNA lies directly adjacent to the active site prior to transferred strand nicking.Figure 5Tn5 active site mutations. A previous Tn5 crystal structure (15Lovell S.

Recent crystallographic evidence indicates that the DDE residues coordinate two divalent metal ions to the active site (15Lovell S. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.R. Rayment I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results of the catalytic reactions performed as a part of this study support this two metal model. Although all three mutations to the DDE motif retain the carboxyl that is critical for metal ion coordination, it is reasonable to expect that slightly altering their spatial positions in the active site would decrease the efficiency with which they perform this function, which is what was observed. None of the mutants is as catalytically competent as EK/LP at the nicking, hairpin formation, or hairpin resolution steps, suggesting that the ions are appropriately coordinated for these reactions less frequently in the mutant proteins. According to the two-metal model, Asp-97 is involved in the coordination of both metal ions, whereas Asp-188 and Glu-326, each assisting Asp-97 with a different ion, are responsible for only one. If this model is correct and Asp-97 is required for the coordination of two metal ions, it is likely that any change that perturbs its function would be more detrimental to catalytic activity than a similar change to one of the residues that is involved only in coordination of one metal ion. Of the three catalytic steps tested, D97E shows no activity at the nicking and hairpin resolution steps and a level of hairpin formation activity that is drastically reduced from EK/LP and significantly lower than that of either of the other two mutants. Both of the other mutations show activity, although reduced from EK/LP, at the nicking, hairpin formation, and hairpin resolution steps. The elimination of function at the nicking and hairpin resolution steps and the relatively more severe reduction of function at the hairpin formation step caused by the D97E mutation supports the model of an active site that coordinates two divalent metal ions. Tn5 transposase (Tnp)1 is the protein responsible for the mobility of the Tn5 transposon (1Reznikoff W.S. Bhasin A. Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Mahnke L.A. Naumann T. Rayment I. Steiniger-White M.

Movement of the transposon occurs via a conservative “cut and paste” mechanism that is mediated by Tnp and 19-bp inverted terminal repeats.

InEscherichia coli, five subunits (α2ββ′ω) form the RNAP catalytic core (E) that associates with a sigma (ς) subunit to form the holoenzyme (Eς).

Sequence comparisons reveal two unrelated families of RNAP ς factors. Members of the major family of ς factors form RNAP holoenzymes that recognize promoters and form transcriptionally competent promoter complexes in the absence of other factors or energy sources. This family, which includes most bacterial ς factors is named after the prototypical housekeeping ς of E. coli, ς70. Members of the second, minor family of ς factors, the ς54 family, form RNAP holoenzymes that recognize promoters but require additional protein factors and a source of energy in the form of ATP or GTP hydrolysis for formation of transcriptionally competent promoter complexes (4Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Google Scholar, 5Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Google Scholar, 6Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 10: 903-909Google Scholar). Despite the differences in pathways that lead to transcription-competent open promoter complexes, both classes of ς factors occupy similar positions within their respective RNAP holoenzymes and appear to utilize some common RNAP surfaces for transcription initiation (7Datwyler S.A. Meares C.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 408-414Google Scholar, 8Nechaev S. Chlenov M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25516-25522Google Scholar, 9Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A.

Binding of a ς70 family factor induces conformational changes within the core RNAP (2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Google Scholar, 11Vassylyey D.G. Sekine S.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4296-4301Google Scholar). Structural modules of the core RNAP, designated as the β′ clamp, the β flap, and the β lobes, interact with a ς70 family ς subunit (ςA) in the structures of Thermus aquaticusand Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzymes and undergo conformational changes, which orientate and position ς70DNA-binding domains within the RNAP holoenzyme to allow promoter recognition (2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Google Scholar, 3Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Google Scholar). The importance of these conformational changes is underlined by our recent observation that removal of the E. coli RNAP β flap domain abolished the ability of the mutant Eς70 to recognize promoters of the −10/−35 class (13Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Dove S.L. Rogulja D. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Heyduk T. Severinov K.S. Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Google Scholar). Eς54 recognizes and binds promoters containing conserved consensus elements centered around −24 and −12 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site at +1. These promoter elements can be considered as functional analogues of the −35/−10 consensus promoter elements recognized by Eς70class holoenzymes. The activity of ς54 promoters is strictly regulated at the DNA melting step and is dependent upon the presence of an enhancer DNA-bound activator. The maintenance of the transcriptionally silent state of the activator-independent Eς54 closed complex depends on the integrity of (i) the amino-terminal 56 amino acids of ς54 (known as Region I; Fig. 1 a) and (ii) promoter sequences at −12 (14Guo Y. Lee C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Google Scholar, 15Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Google Scholar, 16Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol.

In the closed complex, Region I localizes close to the −12 promoter element where DNA melting originates. This protein-DNA arrangement, which we called the “regulatory center,” constitutes a target for mechanochemical action of the activator (18Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P.

Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Google Scholar). Very little is known about the contribution of the core RNAP mobile modules to promoter binding and transcription initiation by Eς54. Here, we studied the properties of E. coli Eς54 reconstituted from mutant core RNAP harboring the β flap deletion, Δ885–914 (hereafter calledΔflapE), to gain insights into the contribution of a core RNAP structural module, which is critical for transcription initiation by Eς70, to enhancer-dependent transcription by Eς54 (Fig. 1 b). Our results demonstrate that the β flap domain of the RNAP has multiple roles in transcription by the Eς54. Most importantly, it appears to orchestrate the formation and organization of the regulatory center at the start site proximal promoter element at −12. Klebsiella pneumoniae ς54, mutant variants thereof (ΔR1ς54, Ala24–26, R336Aς54, Cys20ς54, and Cys46ς54), E. coli full-length PspF and PspF-(1–275) were purified as amino-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins essentially as described in Refs. 16Casaz P.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Google Scholar. Wild-type and mutant E. coli RNAP core enzymes, which contained a COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag on the plasmid-borne β subunit, were purified as follows. Plasmid pRL706 expressing wild-typerpoB, or the corresponding plasmid expressing mutantrpoB with the flap deletion were transformed in the E. coli XL1-Blue cells and cells were grown in 4 liters of LB containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown toA 600 of ∼2 without induction. Cells (∼14 g) were collected and lysed, by sonication, in 70 ml of grinding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 200 mmNaCl. The supernatant after low speed centrifugation was made 0.8% with Polymin P (Sigma), pH 8.0. The Polymin P pellet was washed twice with grinding buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and RNAP was eluted twice with 15 ml of grinding buffer containing 1000 mm NaCl. The combined 1000 mm extract was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml), the pellet was collected, dissolved in 40 ml of TG buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol), and loaded onto a 5-ml Heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TG buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with TG buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, and RNAP was eluted in TG buffer containing 600 mm NaCl. The 600 mm NaCl fraction was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) loaded with Ni2+ using the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol. The column was step-eluted with the same buffer containing 10, 20, 50, and 200 mmimidazole, pH 8.0. RNAP containing plasmid-borne, hexahistidine-tagged mutant β eluted at 50 mm imidazole in the buffer and did not contain ς70 subunit as judged by visual inspection of Coomassie-stained SDS gels and abortive initiation assays on a strong ς70-dependent promoter. RNAP was precipitated by ammonium sulfate, the pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of TG buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and loaded onto a Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TG buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 200 mm NaCl. The column was developed isocratically with the same buffer, RNAP-containing fractions were collected, concentrated on Centricon-100 (Amicon) to ∼0.3 mg/ml, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, the enzyme was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For native PAGE and footprinting assays, 32P end-labeled 88-mer (from −60 to +26) homoduplex and heteroduplex Sinorhizobium meliloti nifHpromoter probes were prepared essentially as described by Cannonet al. (21Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of core RNAP (10–400 nm) was added to 10-μl reactions containing 100 nm32P end-labeled ς54 in core binding buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl) at 37 °C. The reactions were incubated for 5 min and complexes were resolved on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel. RNAP holoenzyme complexes were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel. For core RNAP-ς54 dissociation assays, 50 nmholoenzyme complexes (at a molar ratio of 1:6 core RNAP to unlabeled ς54) were pre-formed in core binding buffer containing 200 μg/ml α-lactoalbumin in a total volume of 50 μl and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After incubation, 300 nm32P-labeled ς54 was added for 0–60 min and samples were taken and loaded on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel that was run for 2 h at 50 V. PhosphorImager analysis was used to quantify 32P-labeled ς54·RNAP complexes and the free ς54 in each sample. These were conducted essentially as described by Wigneshwerarajet al.

When required heparin (100 μg/ml) was added for 5 min prior to analysis of the complexes by native PAGE. Gels were dried and promoter complexes were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Activator binding assays were conducted as described by Chaneyet al. (18Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Google Scholar). Holoenzymes were formed by incubating 50 nm32P-labeled ς54 with 100 nm core RNAP at 37 °C in STA buffer for 5 min. 10 μm PspFΔHTH, 0.2 mm ADP, and 5 mm sodium fluoride were added to the reaction for a further 5 min; 0.2 mm aluminum chloride was then added and the reactions were further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to separation of complexes by native PAGE. Dried gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager. DNase I footprinting of closed, open, and initiated promoter complexes formed on the S. meliloti nifH homoduplex (Fig. 4 a) or early melted (Fig. 8 c) promoter probes (32P end-labeled template strand) were conducted essentially as described by Wigneshwerarajet al. (10Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Severinov K. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1067-1083Google Scholar). The 10-μl binding reactions were conducted in STA buffer; 1.75 × 10−3 units of DNase I (AmershamBiosciences) was added (for 1 min), reactions terminated, and bound and unbound DNAs were separated by native PAGE. Unbound and RNAP-bound DNA was then excised from the gels. Gel-isolated DNA was eluted into 0.1 mm EDTA overnight at 37 °C and recoveries of the isolated DNA were determined by dry Cherenkov counting. Equal numbers of counts were loaded onto a 10% denaturing gel. Dried gels were visualized and quantified by using a PhosphorImager.Figure 8Ortho-copper phenanthroline (ortho-CuOP) footprints of Eς54 andΔflapEς54 promoter complexes formed on theS. meliloti nifH (a) homoduplex and (b) early melted promoter probes.

The reactions were phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and stored overnight at −80 °C. The DNA was then pelleted and washed with 80% (v/v) ethanol. The dried DNA pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA) to which 1 μl of 0.4% (w/v) SDS and 500 μl of a 25 mg/ml stock of proteinase K were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and the DNA was precipitated and pelleted as before. The DNA pellet was then resuspended in 30 μl of H2O and the oxidized DNA was cleaved with 10% (v/v) piperidine at 90 °C for 20 min. The cleavage reaction was stopped by flash-freezing. The reaction was then dried using a speed-vacuum drier. The recoveries of DNA was quantified and analyzed by denaturing PAGE as described above for DNase I footprinting. Binding reactions were conducted essentially as described for KMnO4 footprinting. The reactions were treated with 0.5 μl of a solution of 4 mm ortho-phenanthroline and 0.92 mmCuSO4 followed by 0.5 μl of 0.116 mmercaptopropionic acid for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 28 mm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and loaded onto a 4.5% native gel. Unbound and RNAP bound DNA was then excised from the gels. Gel-isolated DNA was eluted into H2O overnight at 37 °C and processed and analyzed on a 10% denaturing gel as described above. These were performed essentially as described by Wigneshwerarajet al. (10Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Severinov K. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1067-1083Google Scholar). For the single round transcription assay, supercoiled plasmid (pMKC28 or pSLE1) containing the S. meliloti nifH or the E. coli pspA promoter, respectively, was used. Plasmids pMKC28 and pSLE1 contain a T7 early transcriptional terminator sequence downstream of the multiple cloning site. The promoter fragment is inserted into the multiple cloning site in such a way to direct transcription to generate a discrete transcript of ∼470 (for pMKC28) and ∼510 (for pSLE1) bases. 10-μl reactions contained 20 nm template, 100 nm RNAP holoenzyme (formed with 1:6 ratio of core RNAP to ς54). Where indicated 4 mm ATP or GTP and 4 μmPspF-(1–275) were added for open complex formation. The elongation mixture contained 100 μg/ml heparin, 0.1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Reactions were done at 37 °C and stopped with 4 μl of formamide dye mixture. 7 μl of the samples were run on a 6% denaturing gel and the dried gel was quantified and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Run-off transcription assays were performed using the late melted promoter probe essentially as described above. However, reactions were stopped by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recoveries of transcripts were determined by dry Cherenkov counting and equal numbers of counts were loaded onto 15% denaturing gels. Dried gels were visualized and quantified by using a PhosphorImager. Single-cysteine forms of ς54,20ς54, and 46ς54were modified with the FeBABE reagent ((p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA Fe; Dojindo Chemicals) and conjugation yield determined essentially as described by Wigneshwerarajet al. (9Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Buck M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3038-3048Google Scholar). DNA cleavage assays were performed as described by Wigneshweraraj et al. (19Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M.K. Ishihama A. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Google Scholar). Briefly, promoter complexes were formed (in 10-μl reactions) using 20 nm S. meliloti nifH early melted promoter probe (template strand32P end-labeled), 50 nm core RNAP, and 300 nm ς54 in cleavage buffer (40 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. DNA cleavage was initiated by the rapid sequential addition of 2 mm sodium ascorbate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min and quenched with 50 μl of stop buffer (0.1 m thiourea and 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The stopped reactions were phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extracted and precipitated with ethanol. Recoveries of DNA were determined by dry Cherenkov counting and equal numbers of counts were loaded onto 10% denaturing gels. Dried gels were visualized and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Previously, we have demonstrated that deletion of the β flap does not significantly affect the ability of mutant core RNAP to bind ς70 (13Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Dove S.L. Rogulja D. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Heyduk T. Severinov K.S. Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Google Scholar). We tested the ability of ΔflapE to bind ς54. For this purpose, a fixed amount of32P-labeled ς54(32P-ς54) was combined with various amounts of ΔflapE or control wild-type core RNAP and the mixtures were separated on a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 a, (i)) and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2 a (ii)) (10Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Severinov K. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1067-1083Google Scholar, 20Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 539-553Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 a, with the wild-type RNAP most of the 32P-ς54 was in the holoenzyme form (Eς54) when the molar ratio of core RNAP to ς54 reached 1:1. In contrast, a 4-fold excess ofΔflapE was required to convert32P-ς54 toΔflapEς54. Thus, it appears thatΔflapE has a reduced ability to bind ς54, suggesting that the β flap contributes to the ς54binding site. To estimate the stability of the ΔflapEς54complex, we conducted experiments in which unlabeled ς54was mixed with core RNAP at a ratio of 6:1 to allow complete conversion of mutant core RNAP into the holoenzyme form, and then added32P-ς54 to capture free core RNAP arising from dissociation of the preformed holoenzyme complex. As shown in Fig. 2 b, little formation of the 32P-labeled RNAP holoenzyme was detected 1 min after the addition of32P-ς54 to the wild-type RNAP holoenzyme (lane 1), indicating that the wild-type Eς54complex had not yet dissociated. Strikingly, ∼6-fold increased formation of 32P-labeled RNAP holoenzyme complex was observed in the case of ΔflapEς54 (Fig. 2 b, lane 2), indicating that the mutant holoenzyme dissociated much faster than did the wild-type Eς54. The presence of promoter DNA did not markedly improve the stability of ΔflapEς54 (data not shown). Overall, the data suggests that the β flap contributes to the binding of ς54 to RNAP core and the stability of the resulting RNAP holoenzyme. This observation is consistent with previous results in which a derivative of ς54 harboring a FeBABE at residue Cys198 within the major core RNAP binding surface of ς54 (residues 120–215; Fig. 1 a) cleaved the RNAP β subunit between residues 850 and 890 (9Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Buck M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3038-3048Google Scholar, 20Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 539-553Google Scholar), close to or within the β flap domain (residues 885–914). In Eς70, ς70 region 4 (which recognizes the −35 promoter consensus element) interacts with the β flap (2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Google Scholar, 13Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Dove S.L. Rogulja D. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Heyduk T. Severinov K.S. Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Google Scholar). This interaction is functionally important and is required for correct positioning of the ς70 region 4 to allow promoter complex formation on promoters of the −35/−10 class (2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Google Scholar, 13Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Dove S.L. Rogulja D. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Heyduk T. Severinov K.S. Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of the β flap domain to promoter binding by Eς54, we analyzed promoter complexes formed by ΔflapEς54 on the S. meliloti nifH promoter and its derivatives (Fig. 1 c) under activating and nonactivating conditions. Initially, ΔflapEς54 binding activity was investigated on a fully double-stranded S. meliloti nifH promoter probe (homoduplex probe; Fig. 1 c). Complex formation was investigated under three conditions that allowed the monitoring of different promoter complexes. Under nonactivating conditions, when RNAP alone or with added ATP and GTP was present in the reaction, only closed promoter complexes were expected to form. Under activating conditions, when RNAP, E. coliς54-dependent activator PspF-(1–275) (a form of PspF that lacks the enhancer DNA binding domain) 2E. coli PspF-(1–275) lacks the helix-turn-helix enhancer DNA binding domain and essentially represents the central catalytic domain of the protein. and ATP were present, open promoter complexes were expected to form. Under initiating conditions, when RNAP, PspF-(1–275), and GTP were present, RNAP could use GTP to synthesize an RNA trimer. Wild-type or mutant Eς54 were used to form promoter complexes that were then resolved by native gel electrophoresis, or were first challenged with heparin, followed by electrophoretic separation of promoter complex from free promoter probe. Acquisition of heparin stability by Eς54 promoter complex on the homoduplex promoter probe is a hallmark of either open or initiated Eς54 promoter complexes. The results were quantified and are presented in Table I. Under nonactivating conditions ΔflapEς54bound the homoduplex probe with similar activity as Eς54, and the complexes were sensitive to heparin, as expected. Promoter complex formed by the wild-type Eς54 became heparin-stable under activating or initiating conditions, as expected. In contrast, neither activation nor initiation conditions led to the acquisition of heparin stability byΔflapEς54 on the homoduplex promoter (TableI). Because in the absence of heparinΔflapEς54 and Eς54 bound the homoduplex probe equally well, we conclude that (i) the β flap contributes to DNA opening and/or engagement of single-stranded DNA by Eς54 to acquire heparin stability, or (ii) deletion of the β flap compromises the ability of the mutant RNAP to respond to activation conditions.Table IActivities of the wild-type Eς 54 and Δflap Eς 54 to bind and form heparin stable promoter complexes on the S. meliloti nifH homoduplex promoter probe and heteroduplex variants thereofDNA probeAssayEς54ΔflapEς54−NTP −PspF1-aMutant version of the ς54-specific activator E. coli PspF lacking the enhancer DNA binding domain (PspF (1–275)) was used in all assays.+ATP+GTP+ATP +PspF+GTP +PspF−NTP −PspF+ATP+GTP+ATP +PspF+GTP +PspFHomoduplex probe471-bIndicates the % of DNA in complex with RNAP.

Open table in a new tab To distinguish between the above possibilities, we performed binding and heparin stability assays on a heteroduplex promoter probe. The late-melted promoter probe contains a mismatched segment from positions −10 to −1 relative to the transcription start point and is believed to represent the conformation of promoter DNA in Eς54 open complexes (21Cannon W.

Eς54 efficiently forms heparin-stable promoter complexes on the late-melted promoter probe only under activating conditions. Initial binding assays withΔflapEς54 in the absence of heparin showed that ΔflapEς54 bound the late-melted probe with wild-type activity under all the conditions tested (Table I). Like Eς54, ΔflapEς54 was unable to form heparin-stable complexes in the absence of activation (Table I). Activation (+PspF-(1–275) and ATP) increased the heparin stability of wild-type Eς54. In contrast, activatedΔflapEς54 late melted promoter DNA complexes were heparin-sensitive (Table I). However, under activating conditions that permitted initiation (+PspF-(1–275) and GTP) a significant number of heparin-stableΔflapEς54 promoter complexes was detected (Table I), suggesting that (i) ΔflapEς54was able to respond to activation when the template strand was available as single-stranded DNA, and (ii) initiation of RNA synthesis stabilized ΔflapEς54 on the late melted promoter probe. Acquisition of heparin stability on late melted promoter probes independent of activation is a property of deregulated forms of Eς54, for example, those lacking the ς54regulatory Region I (ΔRIς54) (21Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). To further assess the ability of ΔflapEς54to engage pre-melted promoter DNA in a heparin-stable manner we conducted experiments with double mutant holoenzyme lacking the β flap and ς54 regulatory Region I. Initially, we tested whether ΔRIς54 can form holoenzyme complexes withΔflapE. The results showed that a 1:8 ratio ofΔflapE to ΔRIς54 was needed to form stable ΔflapE·ΔRIς54 complexes, consistent with the ς54 binding defects ofΔflapE (data not shown and"

In this study, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding rat FpD. Despite the demonstrated ability of this enzyme to reduce MC in vitro, a modest 5-fold level of overexpression of FpD activity in CHO cells did not increase the cytotoxicity of the drug over that seen with the parental cell line under either aerobic or hypoxic conditions. When the enzyme, which is predominantly localized in the mitochondria, was instead directed to the nucleus of cells by the fusion of the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal sequence to the amino terminus of an FpD gene that lacked the membrane anchor domain, drug sensitivity was significantly enhanced at all concentrations of MC examined (2–10 μm) under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions, with greater cell kill occurring under hypoxia. The marked increase in drug sensitivity under hypoxia at 10 μm MC corresponded to a measurable increase in total MC-DNA adducts at the same concentration. The results indicate that the cytotoxicity of MC is modulated by the subcellular location of FpD, with greater cell kill occurring when bioactivation occurs in the proximity of its target, nuclear DNA.

As a prodrug, MC can be chemically and enzymatically converted into a reactive species capable of alkylating a variety of nucleophilic molecules, including genomic DNA (5Tomasz M. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1995; 2: 575-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Specifically, the quinone moiety of MC is reduced to give unstable intermediates that are capable of further transformations to generate a reactive molecule with two electrophilic carbon centers (6Tomasz M. Chawla A.K. Lipman R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3182-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both monofunctional and bifunctional adducts are formed between MC and DNA (7Kumar G.S. Lipman R.

The majority of these lesions are monofunctional alkylations occurring on the guanine-N(2) position. These lesions are considered to be less cytotoxic than the covalent bifunctional cross-link that forms exclusively in the 5′-CpG-3′ sequence between the N-2 amino groups of two guanines in complementary strands of the minor groove. This interstrand MC-DNA cross-link prevents DNA replication, and corresponds directly with cell survival (14Syzbalski W. Iyer V.N. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 946-957PubMed Google Scholar, 15Keyes S.R.

Several enzymes have been shown to catalyze the reduction of MC to reactive intermediates using either a one-electron or a two-electron mechanism.

These enzymes convert MC to the MC hydroquinone in two, single-electron transfer steps, forming an oxygen-sensitive semiquinone anion radical intermediate (16Pan S. Andrews P.A. Glover C.J.

A bimolecular reaction between the anion radical intermediate and oxygen that regenerates the prodrug occurs that is extremely rapid, close to the diffusion-controlled rate; however, in the hypoxic regions of tumors, the low level of oxygen greatly increases the half-life of this intermediate, allowing sufficient time for disproportionation to the reactive MC hydroquinone alkylating species. Other enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.204; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase) (23Siegal D. Gibson N.W. Preush P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7483-7489PubMed Google Scholar, 24Begleiter A. Robotham E. Leith M.K. Mol.

Res. 1994; 6: 477-481PubMed Google Scholar) reduce MC directly to the MC hydroquinone in one step using a two-electron process, thereby avoiding redox cycling reactions. Of the reductases that bioactivate MC, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, and NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase have been considered to be the most important enzymes for the activation of this agent. Overexpression of these bioreductive enzymes in intact cells has lead to increased sensitivity to MC under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions, thereby confirming their importance in the bioactivation of this drug (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem.

Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell lines overexpressing the one-electron reductase, NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, display an oxic/hypoxic differential, with greater MC sensitivity occurring under hypoxia. In contrast, cell lines overexpressing the two-electron reductase, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, exhibit an increase in MC sensitivity of essentially the same magnitude under both oxic and hypoxic conditions. This latter phenomenon reflects the direct formation of an oxygen-insensitive MC hydroquinone intermediate that is not susceptible to redox cycling reactions that regenerate the relatively nontoxic MC prodrug. Studies focusing on NAD(P)H dehydrogenase are to a large extent attributable to experiments that identified higher levels of this enzyme in tumor cells compared with normal cells, which might account for preferential activation of MC in neoplastic cells (30Marı́n A.

Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, attempts to correlate NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity with drug sensitivity have led to conflicting results (31Fitzsimmons S.A. Workman P. Grever M. Paull K. Camalier R. Lewis A.D. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4752-4757PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to NAD(P)H dehydrogenase and NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, FpD is present in fairly consistent, relatively low levels in both normal and tumors cells (30Marı́n A. López de Cerain A. Hamilton E. Lewis A.D. Martinez-Peñuela J.M. Idoate M.A. Bello J. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Fitzsimmons S.A. Workman P. Grever M. Paull K. Camalier R. Lewis A.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Apparently for this reason, FpD has received considerably less attention. However, this enzyme has been shown to play a role in the activation of MC (19Hodnick W.F. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4907-4912PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme has been shown to reduce MC to a species capable of alkylating DNA in vitro. In addition, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of FpD in the cytoplasm of CHO cells by removal of the membrane binding domain enhances sensitivity to MC relative to the parental line under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further investigate the importance of the subcellular site of bioactivation to the cytoxicity of MC, FpD, an enzyme found predominantly in the outer mitochondrial membrane of CHO cells, was overexpressed in the nucleus of these cells. The effects of nuclear localization of FpD on the sensitivity of CHO cells to MC and on the formation of DNA adducts of the alkylating agent were then assessed. CHO-K1/dhfr−, the CHO-K1 cell line deficient in dihydrofolate reductase, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mmhypoxanthine, 0.01 mm thymidine, and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). Transfected cell lines were maintained in the same medium with the addition of G418 (1 mg/ml) to select for the expression vector. Cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The cDNA for rat NADH:cytochrome b 5 reductase served as the template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following oligonucleotides: 1) 5′-CGCGGTACCAAGCTTGCCACCATG GATAAAGTTTTAAACAGAGAGGAATCTTCTAGTGATGATGAGGCTACTGCTGACTCTCAACATTCTACTCCTCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAGAAGACCCCGCTAGCAAGCTGTTTCAGCGCTCCTCACCG-3′; 2) 5′-CGCGGATCCTCTAGA CTAAATACTTGGCCCTGCTTCATCATATTCTTGTT TGGATATCCACATCCCGAAGGTGAAGCATCGCTCCTTGGG-3′.

The latter primer was used in another PCR reaction with a second forward primer (3Haffty B.G. Son Y.H. Papac R. Sasaki C.T. Weissberg J.B. Fischer D. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Fischer J.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) having a sequence complementary to the amino-terminal coding region of the FpD gene to generate the membrane-bound form of the enzyme with the actin epitope: 3) 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGGGGCCCAGCTG-3′. In both forward primers, the ATG translational initiation codon is shown in bold. PCR products were subcloned into the pRC/CMV eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, Corp.) using the HindIII andXbaI restriction sites shown in italics. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1/dhfr−) were transfected with plasmids using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Stable transfectants were selected using G418 (1 mg/ml). Candidates were cloned by flow cytometric single-cell sorting and then rescreened under selection conditions. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated, six-well glass slides (500–1000 cells/well) and allowed to incubate at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for up to 48 h. After fixing in 20% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilizing in cold acetone for 5 min, cells were incubated with anti-muscle actin monoclonal antibody (HUC-1; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at a dilution of 1:125, washed, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:200. Trypsinized cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline for sonication. Spectrophometric assays were performed on crude cell sonicates at 30 °C as described previously (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, FpD activity was measured by reduction of potassium ferricyanide at 420 nm. NADPH:cytochrome c (P-450) reductase and rotenone-insensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase activities were monitored by the rate of ferricytochrome c reduction at 550 nm. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity was measured as the dicumarol-inhibitable reduction of dichloroindophenol measured at 600 nm. Total protein was determined with bicinchoninic protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in milk dilution bottles and allowed to grow at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2in a humidified incubator for 72 h. Then exponentially growing cultures were gassed through rubber septums fitted to the glass bottles for 2 h at 37 °C with 95% N2, 5% CO2(<1 ppm O2) to induce hypoxia. Graded concentrations of MC (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm) were injected through a rubber septum in volumes less than 75 μl. After 1 h of treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinization and assayed for their ability to form macroscopic colonies. Cells under aerobic conditions were treated in an identical manner in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Surviving fractions were calculated using the plating efficiencies of hypoxic and aerobic vehicle-treated controls. Suspension cultures were prepared by trypsinization of exponentially growing monolayers and were cultured at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in glass vials fitted with rubber septums and stir fleas. Cultures (2 ml) were gassed for 2 h with 95% N2, 5% CO2 to induce hypoxia or with 95% air, 5% CO2 to produce aerobic conditions. Cells were then exposed to 10 μm [3H]MC (0.18 mCi/μmol) for 2 h under hypoxic or aerobic conditions. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 1 × 107 cells using the PUREGENE DNA purification system (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer guidelines. Briefly, cell lysates were treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) overnight followed by RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were removed by precipitation. DNA was then precipitated, washed twice with 70% ethanol to reduce radioactive counts in the wash to background levels, and then dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7. Radioactivity in the samples was normalized to the total DNA concentration, as determined by absorbance measurements at 260 nm. Considerable difficulty was encountered in obtaining stable transfectants of CHO cells that overexpressed FpD either in its normal subcellular environment of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum or in the nucleus. Several hundred clones were screened before a few were found that minimally overexpressed the enzyme compared with the parental cell line. Important oxidoreductase activities of the parental line (CHO-K1/dhfr−) and the transfectants expressing either a cytosolic membrane-bound enzyme (CHO-FpD-5) or a nuclear localized form (CHO-NLS-FpD-3) are summarized in Table I. Based on the NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activities in crude cell lysates, clone CHO-NLS-FpD-3 expressed the FpD activity 3-fold over that of the parental line, whereas clone CHO-FpD-5 expressed the enzyme activity 5-fold over that of the parental line. The rotenone-insensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase assay measures the reduction of cytochrome c via endogenous cytochromeb 5. Thus, the higher activity in this assay for clone CHO-FpD-5 provides support for FpD overexpression in the cytosolic membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Compared with the parental line, the levels of other oxidoreductase activities implicated in MC bioreduction (NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase) remained unchanged in the two transfected cell lines. The activities of xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase, two additional enzymes known to reduce MC, were not determined because we have previously shown that the CHO-K1/dhfr− cell line does not express either enzyme (27Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A clone transfected with empty vector (pRC/CMV) was also characterized in terms of the various oxidoreductase activities, and was similar to the parental line (results not shown).Table IOxidoreductase activities of CHO-K1/dhfr− parental cells and NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase-transfected cell lines expressing either a mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum (CHO-FpD-5) or a nuclear (CHO-NLS-FpD-3) rat NADH:cytochrome b5reductase cDNAEnzyme activity1-aEnzymatic activities in cell sonicates were determined spectrophotometrically as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Cell lineCHO-K1/dhfr−CHO-FpD-5CHO-NLS-FpD-3nmol/min/mg total proteinNADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase1960 (100)1-bValues shown are the means of 3–12 determinations with the standard deviations given in parentheses.9460 (470)5900 (410)Rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome coxidoreductase181 (44)430 (20)140 (20)NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase15 (6)16 (3)9 (3)NAD(P)H dehydrogenase19 (6)16 (3)13 (3)a Enzymatic activities in cell sonicates were determined spectrophotometrically as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Values shown are the means of 3–12 determinations with the standard deviations given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The muscle actin epitope was included at the carboxyl terminus of the FpD gene in the plasmid constructs to allow for visual detection of the subcellular localization of the enzyme in transfected cells. Cells of the CHO-FpD-5 transfectant that expressed a form of FpD unaltered in terms of localization exhibited primarily cytosolic staining, as shown in Fig. 1 A. These results are in agreement with subcellular fractionation studies performed previously in our laboratory, which indicated that FpD is localized primarily in the mitochondria of CHO cells, with a smaller amount in the endoplasmic reticulum (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, CHO-NLS-FpD-3 cells that expressed theFpD gene fused with the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal sequence displayed fluorescence intensity that was concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). Survival curves for the parental line (CHO-K1/dhfr−), the stably transfected cell line overexpressing FpD activity in cytosolic particles (CHO-FpD-5), and the stably transfected cell line overexpressing FpD activity in the nucleus (CHO-NLS-FpD-3) are shown in Fig. 2,A and B, for aerobic and hypoxic conditions, respectively. The CHO-K1/dhfr− cell line is highly resistant to exposure to 10 μm MC for 1 h under aerobic conditions but sensitivity increases ∼10-fold at 10 μm MC under hypoxia. The survival curves for the CHO-FpD-5 transfectant, ovexpressing FpD activity by 5-fold, are virtually superimposable with those of the parental line under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. In contrast, the nuclear transfectant, CHO-NLS-FpD-3, overexpressing FpD activity by 3-fold, exhibits a small, but significant increase in MC sensitivity under aerobic conditions when compared with the other two cell lines. Furthermore, the nuclear transfectant is markedly more sensitive to MC under hypoxia, producing a readily observable oxic/hypoxic differential. Analysis of the survival data in Fig. 2 B was made by comparing the drug concentrations required for equivalent levels of survival in the transfected cell lines. The concentration of MC for 10% survival under hypoxia is ∼5.5 μm MC for the transfectant overexpressing mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum-localized FpD, and ∼3.8 μm MC for the transfectant overexpressing nuclear-localized FpD, to yield a sensitivity ratio of ∼1.4. The same analysis performed at 1% survival yields an identical sensitivity ratio. This comparison is made between cell lines that overexpress FpD activity at different levels relative to the parental cell line (3-fold overexpression for CHO-NLS-FpD-3 cells versus 5-fold overexpression for CHO-FpD-5 cells). Thus, the oxic/hypoxic differential represented by the sensitivity ratio should be expected to increase with equivalent overexpression of FpD activity in the nucleus and the mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum. Table II shows the amount of total [3H]MC-DNA adducts produced in cell lines treated with 10 μm [3H]MC under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. In these experiments, the majority of the radioactivity remained in the medium or associated with cellular debris and proteins, resulting in total MC-DNA adducts that were in the range of 3–12-fold over background. Under aerobic conditions, no statistically significant differences were found between the adduct levels of the three cell lines that were tested. In contrast, a small, but statistically significant difference in adduct levels was observed under hypoxia. Under hypoxia, the genomic DNA isolated from the nuclear transfectant, CHO-NLS-FpD-3, yielded almost twice the amount of radioactivity as the DNA from the parental line or the CHO-FpD-5 transfectant. Similar numbers of MC-DNA adducts occurred in DNA samples from the parental line and the CHO-FpD-5 transfectant under hypoxia. Based upon the survival data obtained under hypoxia, shown in Fig. 2 B, the drug sensitivity at 10 μm MC increased more than 10-fold in CHO-NLS-FpD-3 cells compared with CHO-FpD-5 cells, even though the level of overexpressed FpD activity in the nucleus of CHO-NLS-FpD-3 cells was less than the level of overexpressed FpD activity in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of CHO-FpD-5 cells. Thus, the approximate 1.8-fold increase in the total number of MC-DNA adducts at 10 μm MC for the nuclear FpD transfectant relative to both the parental cell line and the mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum FpD transfectant is much less than the approximate 10-fold increase in sensitivity estimated from the survival data at the same concentration (see Fig. 2 B).Table IIDetermination of total [3H]MC-DNA adducts in cell lines treated under aerobic and hypoxic conditionsCell lineCpm/μg DNA2-aDNA samples (200 μl) were mixed with glacial acetic acid (50 μl) prior to the determination of radioactivity.AerobicHypoxicCHO-K1/dhfr− parental0.55 (0.10)2-bThree to four determinations were made for each cell line.

Standard deviations are given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Whereas MC is a highly potent anticancer agent that is clinically used in combination with radiation and chemotherapy regimens to treat several cancers, it is extremely toxic to normal tissues. There are also several factors that limit the efficacy of the drug. The toxic interstrand cross-link between MC and DNA must compete with monoalkylation products, as well as with the less damaging oxygen radicals (i.e. superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and/or hydroxyl radical) produced in redox cycling reactions. Furthermore, the drug, once activated, is highly electrophilic and reacts readily with a host of nucleophilic cellular components including water. Consequently, only a very minor fraction of the activated drug reaches nuclear DNA. As part of an ongoing investigation to address this last issue, the subcellular site of MC bioactivation was modified by overexpression of bioreductive enzymes in the nucleus, close to the proposed target producing cytotoxicity, nuclear DNA. Little has been done to characterize the impact of bioactivation by FpD on the cytotoxicity of MC, although previous studies by workers in our laboratory (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that a cytosolic form of FpD alters the sensitivity of CHO cells to MC under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. To demonstrate that the intracellular location of the enzyme modulates cytotoxicity, we generated CHO cell lines that overexpressed FpD activity in its normal location (i.e.mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) and in the nucleus, without altering the levels of other oxidoreductases implicated in MC bioactivation (Table I). Only minimal levels of overexpression of FpD activity were achieved regardless of the enzyme location. Thus, CHO-NLS-FpD-3 overexpressed the nuclear-localized enzyme activity by 3-fold whereas CHO-FpD-5 expressed the cytoplasmic membrane-bound form by 5-fold over that of the parental line, CHO-K1/dhfr−. The difficulty in obtaining higher levels of overexpression of FpD activity despite the use of a strong promoter (cytomegalovirus) in the constructs agrees with our previous findings (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and may reflect the role of this enzyme as a member of an electron transport chain and the possible requirement for coordinate expression of a physiological partner. In the case of the mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum localized enzyme, a lack of available membrane docking sites may also limit the level of functional FpD. In both FpD overexpressing clones, localization of the enzyme was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies directed toward the muscle actin epitope fused to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme encoded on the eukaryotic expression vector (Fig. 1, A and B). Despite the relatively low level of nuclear overexpression of FpD activity, transfectant CHO-NLS-FpD-3 caused an increase, albeit modest, in the cytotoxicity of MC under aerobic conditions and a more pronounced increase in the cytotoxicity of MC under hypoxia when compared with the cytoplasmic membrane-bound form of FpD expressed at a somewhat higher level in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The slight but statistically significant increase in MC cytotoxicity under aerobic conditions in the transfectant expressing nuclear FpD activity most likely reflects the production of the reactive alkylating species closer to its DNA target. Under hypoxia, the marked increase in cytotoxicity for CHO-NLS-FpD-3 not only reflects the production of the activated species near nuclear DNA, but also the increased efficiency of the reactive species because of the absence of redox cycling reactions that occur from the one-electron reduction of MC under aerobic conditions. Whereas the increase in cell kill under hypoxia by nuclear overexpression of FpD activity is substantial, the total magnitude of the cell death is comparable with that achieved with cytosolic overexpression of the enzyme activity in a previous study in our laboratory (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, because a greater level of overexpression of enzyme activity (12-fold) was achieved in the previous study, a direct comparison between these CHO transfectants cannot be made. Nonetheless, given that a 3-fold increase in nuclear localized FpD activity produces a 10-fold increase in MC cytotoxicity, an even greater increase in cytotoxicty would be expected if greater overexpression of this enzyme activity could be attained in the nucleus. The survival curves for the cell line expressing the enzyme activity in its normal intracellular location also generates some results that conflict with our previous findings. We have previously shown that overexpression of membrane-bound FpD in CHO cells by 9-fold results in a slight decrease in MC sensitivity under aerobic conditions, whereas the sensitivity under hypoxic conditions remains equal to that of the parental cell line (36Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8875-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This protective effect was postulated to be because of the sequestering of MC electrophiles in the CHO cells, thereby decreasing nuclear DNA alkylations and reducing cytotoxicity. In the present study, no apparent change in MC cytotoxicity occurred in the transfectant overexpressing FpD activity in the mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum under either aerobic or hypoxic conditions relative to the parental cell line. Perhaps the protective effect demonstrated previously in CHO cells overexpressing FpD activity by 9-fold was not observed because the enzyme was overexpressed at a lower level of 5-fold in the present investigation. Alternatively, cell line drift may be responsible for the difference in MC sensitivities occurring in these FpD transfectants. In any case, the findings imply that activation of MC in these cytoplasmic sites limits the ability of the reactive MC hydroquinone electrophilic species to reach and interact productively with nuclear DNA. Thus, site-specific activation in the mitochondrion may lead to the alkylation of mitochondrial DNA or mitochondrial membrane components. Consequently, the alkylating species interacts with other molecules or macromolecules to produce less cytotoxic events, minimizing its diffusion into the nucleus to target DNA. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between cell survival and MC-DNA cross-links, considered to be the primary cytotoxic lesion (37Sartorelli A.C. Tomasz M. Rockwell S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study, total MC-DNA adducts, monoalkylations and cross-links, were measured using radiolabeled [3H]MC. Inconsistent with the MC survival assays under aerobic conditions, no measurable differences in total MC-DNA adducts were found for the nuclear FpD transfectant relative to the other cell lines. It is likely that the identical number of MC-DNA adducts produced in parental cells, CHO-FpD-5 cells, and CHO-NLS-FpD-3 cells under aerobic conditions is a reflection of the degree of activation by endogenous NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, a two-electron reducing system not susceptible to the redox cycling that occurs in air with the one-electron generating reducing systems NADPH:cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase and FpD. Because DNA alkylations by MC are rare events, small differences in the number of total adducts may be undetectable in the radioactivity assay, yet produce an observable effect in survival assays. Alternatively, nuclear activation of MC in aerobic cells overexpressing FpD would produce increased levels of oxygen radicals in close proximity to DNA resulting in increased DNA damage that could result in increased cell kill. The increase in total MC-DNA adducts under hypoxia in parental cells and in CHO-FpD-5 cells presumably reflects the increased generation of MC hydroquinone through one-electron reductants over that produced by NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. The statistically significant increase in total [3H]MC-DNA adducts detected under hypoxia for the transfectant overexpressing nuclear FpD activity relative to the parental line and the transfectant overexpressing cytoplasmic membrane-bound FpD is assumed to be because of activation of MC to reactive electrophiles by nuclear FpD. The finding that a small increase in total adducts is capable of producing a significant increase in cell kill is not unreasonable given that a single cross-link per bacterial genome is sufficient to produce lethality (14Syzbalski W. Iyer V.N. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 946-957PubMed Google Scholar) and very few cross-links are required to cause marked cell kill of mammalian cells (15Keyes S.R. Loomis R. DiGiovanna M.P. Pristos C.A. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, incremental changes in the level of DNA alkylations produced by MC, and in particular, the covalent MC-DNA cross-link, can have pronounced effects on the cytotoxicity of this drug. As part of a larger investigation by our laboratory to improve the efficacy of the anticancer agent MC, this study has examined the role of the intracellular location of NADH:cytochromeb 5 oxidoreductase on the bioactivation of the prodrug MC. The results of these experiments indicate that the efficacy of MC is increased significantly when bioactivation by FpD occurs in the nucleus, in close proximity to nuclear DNA. Thus, a relatively minor 3-fold increase in FpD activity in the nucleus leads to a marked increase in drug sensitivity and in total MC-DNA adducts under hypoxia. These findings, which have been determined in CHO cells, suggest that modest changes in the bioactivation of MC can significantly increase the cytotoxicity of this agent in tumor cells. Thus, FpD may play an important role in the bioactivation of MC if a method is developed to increase the expression of the enzyme in the nucleus of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1978939385,"We have characterized the role of c-Myb and B-Myb in the regulation of human type I collagen α2 chain gene expression in fibroblastic cells. We have identified four Myb-binding sites (MBSs) in the promoter. Transactivation assays on wild type and mutant promoter-reporter constructs demonstrated that c-Myb, but not B-Myb, can transactivate the human type I collagen α2 chain gene promoter via the MBS-containing region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments showed that c-Myb specifically binds to each of the four MBS; however, the mutagenesis of site MBS-4 completely inhibited transactivation by c-Myb, at least in the full-length promoter. In agreement with these results, c-<i>myb<sup>−/−</sup></i> mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) showed a selective lack of expression of type I collagen α2 chain gene but maintained the expression of fibronectin and type III collagen. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β induced type I collagen α2 chain gene expression in c-<i>myb<sup>−/−</sup></i> MEFs, implying that the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway is maintained and that the absence of <i>COL1A2</i> gene expression in c-<i>myb<sup>−/−</sup></i> MEFs is a direct consequence of the lack of c-Myb.

https://openalex.org/W2146636043,"Divergent selection in mice on fatness over 60 generations produced a fat (F) and a lean (L) line, having about 22% and 4% body fat, respectively. To elucidate the importance of the leptin regulatory feedback loop in the genetic changes produced by this selection, Lep(ob) and Lepr(db) mutations causing leptin production and leptin receptor deficiency, respectively, were introgressed individually into both lines by repeated backcrossing. The fat amount increased significantly in homozygotes for Lep(ob) or Lepr(db) in both lines, for example, in F and L males from 8.5 to 18.8 and 17.2 g (P<0.001) and from 1.25 to 18.0 and 12.7 g (P<0.001), respectively. Line differences were, however, mostly maintained after introgression. Concentrations of circulating leptin were relatively independent of the original lines but heavily dependent on the introgressed genotype. Introgression of leptin production and receptor deficiencies had separate effects from long-term selection, indicating that the genes responsible for the line divergence must act independently of the leptin regulatory system. Energy budget analysis indicated that the major line differences were in the level of energy expended on physical activity, and these differences were preserved following introgression, suggesting that multiple pathways regulate fatness, which may be independently responsive to intervention."

They not only are rapidly degraded by ClpXP but also promote degradation of the unmodified repressor (hereby called Rep to indicate the wild-type repressor). Repressor peptides marked with the ssrA tag can also promote degradation of Rep (19O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For the Mu life cycle, trans-targeting can potentially be a mechanism for promoting derepression in response to specific physiological conditions. The Mu genome is a transposable element, a property that is exploited in the establishment of lysogeny and phage DNA replication (see Ref. 20Symonds, N., Toussaint, A., van de Putte, P., and Howe, M. M. (eds) (1987) Phage Mu, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar for a review). Rep, encoded by thec gene, establishes lysogeny by shutting down Mu transposition functions A and B after the first integration event. Binding to Mu operator sequences, Rep shuts down transcription of the transposition genes (21Krause H.M. Higgins N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3744-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also competes for MuA transposase binding sites within the operator (22Leung P.C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Nature. 1989; 338: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1989; 58: 399-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Degradation of the Mu repressor induced by co-expression of Vir can trigger lytic development. Physiological conditions that promote derepression include carbon starvation and entry into stationary phase, a process termed S derepression, which is dependent upon clpX, clpP,lon, and rpoS host functions (24Lamrani S. Ranquet C. Gama M.J. Nakai H. Shapiro J.A. Toussaint A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although Mu lytic development does not proceed at optimal rates under these conditions, derepression can lead to transposase-dependent genetic rearrangements (25Shapiro J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 194: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Maenhaut-Michel G. Shapiro J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5229-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Shapiro J.A. Leach D.

Biol. 2002; 322: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Rep is stable in vivo even though it is degraded by ClpXP protease with approximately the same catalytic rate constant as that of Vir (31Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike Vir, Rep is degraded with a relatively high Michaelis constant (K m), and it becomes resistant to ClpXP in the presence of DNA. In the presence of Vir, Rep acquires the attributes of low K m and protease sensitivity in the presence of DNA. These results have suggested that a determinant recognized with high affinity by ClpX is already present in Rep but is not readily accessible, especially in the presence of DNA.trans-Targeting proteins such as Vir may function to expose such a determinant in Rep to promote its degradation. The self-associating property of repressor molecules, which exists in solution as a hexamer or higher order oligomer (32Alazard R. Ebel C. Venien-Bryan V. Mourey L. Samama J.P. Chandler M. Eur. J.

Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that such interactions may induce movement of the repressor C-terminal domain (CTD, residues Ile-170 to Val-196; see Fig. 1 A), which functions in modulating Rep degradation as well as DNA binding. Deletion of 18 residues from the C terminus (RepΔ18 encoded by thests62–1 allele; Fig. 1 C) suppresses temperature-sensitive mutations in the N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD; Lys-13 to Ser-80) and confers dominance over the viralleles (35Vogel J.L. Geuskens V. Desmet L. Higgins N.P. Toussaint A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 661-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ssrA knock-out strains, truncated repressors like RepΔ18 accumulate and block S derepression (36Ranquet C. Geiselmann J. Toussaint A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10220-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are a number of lines of evidence that indicates that the CTD includes key residues that make up the ClpX recognition determinant. Repressor mutants with an 18-residue deletion (RepΔ18) or certain single amino acid replacements in the CTD have been found to be resistant to ClpXP degradation in the presence or absence of Vir (37Mukhopadyay, B., Marshall-Batty, K. R., Kim, B. D., O'Handley, D., and Nakai, H. (2002) Mol. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, heat denaturation accelerates Rep degradation by ClpXP without Vir, while ClpXP-resistant CTD mutants cannot be degraded even after denaturation. In this paper we demonstrate that Vir promotes conformational changes in Rep, inducing movement of the CTD such that it becomes more exposed. We previously determined that the Rep C terminus is found in a relatively hydrophobic environment, whereas the Vir C terminus is found in a hydrophilic environment (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Vir can induce the Rep C terminus to enter an even more hydrophilic environment, allowing enzymes to gain access to this domain more readily. Moreover, the action of ClpX is able to reduce the number of Vir molecules needed to promote maximal accessibility. The results indicate that Vir promotes trans-targeting by exposing ClpX recognition determinants within the CTD and that ClpX can assist Vir in this process. Repressor proteins Rep and Vir3060 were overexpressed from plasmids pHS502 and pHS504, which contain the respective repressor alleles between theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11a (Novagen). Plasmids pGTN130 and pGTN206 for overproducing RepC17A and VirC17A were constructed from pHS502 and pHS504, respectively, using the Stratagene QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. Construction of plasmids pGTN204 (RepC197) and pGTN211 (VirC192), derivatives of pREP-1 (31Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and pGTN210 (RepΔ18), a derivative of pHS502, were described previously (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RepNK was overproduced from pREP-NK, which was constructed by PCR amplification of thec + gene in pJV300 (38Vogel J.L., Li, Z.J. Howe M.M. Toussaint A. Higgins N.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6568-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using an N-terminal primer that contains the coding sequence for the cAMP-dependent kinase motif (39Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The primer adds the sequence GGACTTCGAAGAGCTTCTGTTATC encoding the peptides GIRRASVI between the first two codons (Met1 and Lys2) of the repressor gene. The RepNK coding sequence was inserted at theNcoI and BamHI sites of pET-19b (Novagen), using the NcoI site at the AUG start codon and a BamHI site adjacent the stop codon. RepCK was overproduced from pREP-CK, which is a derivative of pREP-1. The sequence CTTCGAAGAGCTTCTGTTGGTUAA encoding the peptide IRRASVG was fused to the C-terminal coding sequence of the c + gene using the Stratagene ExSiteTM PCR-based mutagenesis kit. All repressor proteins (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the ClpX protein (31Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. All protein concentrations are given in equivalents of protein monomers. Thiol-specific attachment of 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS; Molecular Probes) to repressor proteins and quantitation of bound MIANS were conducted as described previously (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 3–6-fold excess of MIANS over the target repressor protein was added to each reaction mixture, which was incubated at 37 °C. In all experiments, greater than 90% of the target repressor proteins, which bear a single cysteine residue, had bound MIANS after incubation for 10 min. Fluorescence measurements were taken with an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer using a path length of 4 cm. All analyses were conducted in 25 mm HEPES-K+, 200 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mm maganesium acetate with the indicated concentrations of repressor proteins in a sample volume of 200 μl. MIANS fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm with constant stirring at 37 °C. RepNK radiolabeled to high specific activity for trypsin cleavage analysis was prepared as described previously (39Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with modifications. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 3 μm RepNK, 1.5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 3000 Ci/mmol), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 25 units catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA; New England Biolabs). Incubation was at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to 30 mm. The kinetics of phosphorylation of RepNK and RepCK was monitored under the same conditions except that the reaction mixture contained 60 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol), 8 units of PKA, and repressor proteins at the indicated concentrations. When Vir, Rep, or ClpX were present together with RepNK or RepCK, the reaction mixture was assembled and allowed to incubate 10 min at 37 °C prior to adding [γ-32P]ATP and PKA. Reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and dried down for quantitation on an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager system. Bands corresponding to the maximum incubation times were then excised, and the level of Cheronkov radiation was measured on a Beckman LS6500 Multi-purpose Scintillation Counter to determine the fraction of repressor proteins phosphorylated. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-K+ (pH 7.5), 200 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate and the indicated concentrations of32P-RepNK (10,000–13,000 cpm/pmol) and unlabeled repressor proteins. 32P-RepNK and an unlabeled repressor protein were first mixed and allowed to incubate for 10 mins at 37 °C before addition of 1 μg trypsin. Digestion was allowed to proceed at the same temperature for 1 h, and then reactions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2% (w/v) final concentration. The cleavage patterns were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried down, and subjected to autoradiography. We examined whether mutant repressors with an altered CTD can influence the conformation of Rep molecules. We first examined their influence on the conformational state of Rep using the trypsin hypersensitive site at Arg-70 as a marker (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When not bound to DNA, Rep is hypersensitive to cleavage at Arg-70, a property dependent upon the close proximity of the CTD to the DBD. Upon cleavage at Arg-70, the resulting peptides become susceptible to cleavage by trypsin at other sites. This hypersensitivity, which is lost as Rep interacts with DNA and the CTD moves away from the DBD, is absent in Vir and RepΔ18. These repressor molecules therefore remain intact under conditions that promote degradation of Rep to small fragments. We determined that both Vir and RepΔ18 could induce Rep to lose hypersensitivity at this site. Purified wild-type repressor with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase motif at the N terminus (RepNK) was radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP, mixed with an excess of unlabeled Rep, Vir, RepΔ18, or RepNK, and treated with trypsin. The susceptibility of 32P-RepNK to tryptic digestion was influenced by the properties of the excess unlabeled repressor protein in the reaction mixture.32P-RepNK in the presence of unlabeled Rep and RepNK was rapidly cleaved by trypsin (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 8). In contrast, Vir and RepΔ18 remained relatively resistant to cleavage and32P-RepNK became resistant in their presence (lanes 6 and 7). This indicates that Vir and RepΔ18 can induce conformational changes in Rep, most likely by inducing movement of the CTD with respect to the DBD. We previously determined that the Rep C terminus is in a hydrophobic environment, whereas the Vir3060 C terminus is in a relatively hydrophilic one (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We used repressor proteins with the C17A substitution and a single cysteine introduced at the C terminus, modifications that do not alter the respective properties of the protein as a ClpXP substrate (data not shown; VirC192 and RepC197; see Fig. 1 B). As demonstrated previously, when the thiol-specific fluorophore MIANS was attached to the single cysteine at the C terminus, we obtained emission maxima of 429 and 439 nm for RepC197 and VirC192, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The fluorescence intensity of VirC192-MIANS was greatly diminished in comparison with that of RepC197-MIANS, consistent with the probe at the Vir C terminus being in a more hydrophilic environment (40Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14941-14948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When MIANS was attached to RepC197 in the presence of 3-fold excess VirC17A, which has no cysteine residues, fluorescence intensity was diminished (Fig. 3 A), and the emission spectrum was red-shifted 20 nm to 449 nm (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the Rep C terminus had entered an environment even more hydrophilic than that of the Vir C terminus. Although RepC197-MIANS in the presence of Vir has an emission maximum of longer wavelength, it has a higher fluorescence intensity than VirC192-MIANS. At the C terminus of Vir, MIANS is attached to basic residues (HRR), and these residues most likely further quench its fluorescence. The presence of 3-fold excess RepC17A instead of VirC17A slightly increased the fluorescence intensity and did not change emission maximum of the attached MIANS (Fig. 3 C). The results indicate that Vir can induce movement of the Rep CTD such that it is more exposed to solvent and therefore more accessible to ClpX. Reducing the levels of VirC17A to a level equimolar to RepC197 diminished the red shift to ∼1–2 nm (data not shown). An excess of Vir was therefore needed to efficiently induce the Rep conformational change. MIANS has the convenient characteristic of becoming fluorescent only upon attachment to cysteine residues, and we used this property to examine accessibility of Rep C terminus. MIANS is attached to VirC192 at a much faster rate than it is to RepC197 (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the presence of VirC17A, the rate of MIANS attachment to RepC197 was increased to the same rate as its attachment to VirC192 (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the Vir-induced movement of the Rep CTD greatly increases its accessibility. In the attachment of MIANS to VirC192, a spike in fluorescence was reproducibly recorded at ∼200 s (34Rai S.S. O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), an anomaly not observed in the attachment of MIANS to RepC197 when VirC17A was present (Fig. 4 A). Although the cause of this transient increase in fluorescence has not been definitively demonstrated, it may reflect a transient fluctuation in the conformation of the VirC192 protein population upon becoming saturated with MIANS. Unlike its effect on RepC197, VirC17A decreased the rate of attachment of MIANS to the native C17 residue present in the DBD of Rep (Fig. 4 A). This indicates that VirC17A is not increasing accessibility of all parts of Rep. Moreover, RepC17A had no effect on the attachment of MIANS to RepC197 (Fig. 4 B). The 7-residue cAMP-dependent protein kinase motif (IRRASVG) was engineered onto the C terminus of Rep (RepCK) to examine how Vir and ClpX can influence the rate of its phosphorylation. Under the assay conditions, RepCK was phosphorylated at a very low rate, and the presence of ClpX did not significantly increase the rate of phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). However, Vir promoted a large increase in the rate of RepCK phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). Increasing the Vir to RepCK ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 progressively increased the rate of phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A–D), indicating that the Rep CTD movement induced by Vir exposes this domain and makes the attached kinase motif accessible to phosphorylation. At a Vir to RepCK ratio of 4:1, the presence of ClpX promoted only a slight increase in the phosphorylation rate; but at lower levels of Vir, ClpX did promote a significant increase in phosphorylation rates, indicating that the recognition and unfolding of protomers in repressor oligomers by ClpX can further expose the CTDs of additional Rep molecules. In contrast, Vir could not promote any increase in the low level of phosphorylation of the kinase motif at the Rep N terminus even in the presence of ClpX (Fig. 5 E), indicating that Vir and ClpX are not necessarily increasing accessibility of all domains of Rep. In addition, Rep and RepΔ18 were unable to promote any increase in the phosphorylation rate of RepCK (Fig. 5 F), indicating that these proteins do not promote exposure of the Rep CTD. These results indicate that ClpX can assist Vir in exposing the Rep CTD. The CTD of Rep plays a critical role in both Rep degradation promoted by altered forms of the repressor and the formation of the repressor-operator complex, enabling the Rep population to respond to specific physiological conditions such as carbon starvation and entry into stationary phase (19O'Handley D. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Lamrani S. Ranquet C. Gama M.J. Nakai H. Shapiro J.A. Toussaint A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mol.

Although ClpXP-sensitive Vir can promote Rep degradation, Rep does have intrinsic sensitivity to ClpXP protease by itself (31Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that it contains a ClpX recognition determinant. However, the context of this determinant influences to a large degree the efficiency with which it is recognized by ClpX. In the absence of DNA, Rep is degraded with a relatively high K m. In the presence of Vir, Rep is degraded with a lower K m that is essentially identical to that of Vir. Heat denaturation of Rep also allows it to be rapidly degraded without Vir (37Mukhopadyay, B., Marshall-Batty, K. R., Kim, B. D., O'Handley, D., and Nakai, H. (2002) Mol. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, what constitutes a ClpX recognition determinant is not simply determined by the presence of a recognition motif but also by factors such as accessibility and display of the motif. And what constitutes the minimal elements of the Rep ClpX recognition determinant remains to be defined. Nevertheless, the Rep CTD is an important part of that determinant. Cysteine replacement mutations at 8 of the last 17 C-terminal residues and a deletion of even a single residue at the C terminus result in gain of dominance over vir alleles (37Mukhopadyay, B., Marshall-Batty, K. R., Kim, B. D., O'Handley, D., and Nakai, H. (2002) Mol. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Biochemical analyses have shown that RepΔ18, and at least two CTD mutants with a single cysteine replacement (V183C and V196C) have lost intrinsic sensitivity to ClpXP even after heat denaturation, indicating that a determinant within the CTD is required for ClpX recognition. Vir can induce the movement of the Rep CTD such that it is more exposed, most likely so that it can be bound by ClpX. Thustrans-targeting can be the result of unmasking a largely inaccessible recognition determinant. Although an excess of Vir was needed to induce the conformational change, ClpX could assist in the Vir-induced exposure of the CTD. Very low levels of Vir must be effective in promoting derepression, for it is rapidly degraded in vivo and is not able to accumulate to high levels and yet it effectively promotes Rep degradation (17Geuskens V. Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Desmet L. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Vir promotes recognition of Rep molecules by ClpX, which in turn aids Vir in inducing Rep conformational changes. Recognition and unfolding of protomers may dissociate ClpXP-sensitive repressor oligomers and create interacting surfaces for conversion of additional Rep molecules to the protease-sensitive conformation. The repressor molecules that induce the conversion to the sensitive conformation may not necessarily be Vir molecules and may be Rep molecules previously converted to this conformation. If Vir and ClpX catalytically generate Rep molecules with an exposed CTD, it is likely that such Rep molecules maintain this “exposed” conformation only transiently before returning to the “unexposed” conformation. For example, at a limiting Vir concentration, ClpX promotes increased phosphorylation of RepCK at a uniform rate over a 25-min time course (Fig. 5 D). If stably exposed RepCK molecules accumulate during the time course, phosphorylation of RepCK should be accelerated in this time period. The presence of Vir and ClpX therefore appears to increase phosphorylation rates by maintaining a higher steady-state level of exposed RepCK. Less than stoichiometric amounts of Vir that efficiently promote Rep degradation in vitro (31Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are not as effective in increasing RepCK phosphorylation. However, if the recognition and unfolding of Rep protomers lead to exposure of additional ClpX recognition motifs, protein unfolding by ClpX may be coupled to its recognition of additional protomers. In this way, when a threshold of inducing molecules such as ssrA-tagged repressor peptides accumulate under certain physiological conditions, they may begin a catalytic process to promote degradation of the bulk Rep population. It is not yet clear whether the mechanism oftrans-targeting of the Mu repressor by Vir will turn out to be similar to trans-targeting by other regulator proteins that promote degradation. Unlike Vir, trans-targeting proteins UmuD, RssB, and SspB target the respective substrates without being degraded themselves by ClpXP (10Gonzalez M. Rasulova F. Maurizi M.R. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Zhou Y. Gottesman S. Hoskins J.R. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S.

Gonzalez et al. (10Gonzalez M. Rasulova F. Maurizi M.R. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) determined that an alanine stretch introduced into the UmuD N-terminal segment, which is not present on UmuD′, prevents UmuD-directed degradation of UmuD′ by ClpXP. The result suggests that this is the segment recognized by ClpX in the UmuD-UmuD′ heterodimer. UmuD as well as RssB and SspB may interact with ClpX to deliver the respective protease substrates to the active site of ClpX. Nevertheless, ClpX substrates in general have been found to contain recognition motifs, for which there is no apparent consensus sequence. Thus, it is conceivable that these regulator proteins promote exposure of a motif within the target protein. For example, ςS and phosphorylated RssB together bind with high affinity to ClpX even though neither alone do so (14Zhou Y. Gottesman S. Hoskins J.R. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); this leaves open the possibility that the complex exposes a determinant in ςS bound by ClpX. Hoskins et al. (41Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently determined that the ClpX recognition motif present at the C terminus of MuA transposase can also be recognized at an interior position of a MuA-green fluorescent protein fusion, albeit less efficiently. This raises the possibility that a trans-targeting protein might promote exposure of a recognition motif present in the interior of the target protein. Studies of prions in mammals and prion-like proteins in yeast have raised interesting questions about the dissemination of conformational states among protein molecules and whether such a mechanism is generally employed in nature (42Prusiner S.B.

While prions have been implicated in the transmission of a neurodegenerative disasease (spongiform encelopathy) in mammals, prion-like proteins in yeast have been implicated in the dissemination of heritable phenotypic traits. Although Vir is not known to promote protein-based inheritance, the way it promotes Rep degradation by inducing conformational changes reflects a prion-like mechanism at work in the dissemination of a molecular signal.

Examination of their aligned sequences revealed that most of the differences between SULT1A3 and SULT1A1 occur in two variable regions, designated Region I (encompassing amino acid residues 84–89) and Region II (including residues 143–148) (cf. Fig. 1 A). Based on the hypothesis that the differences in these two variable regions may account for the distinct properties of SULT1A3 and SULT1A1, we had prepared chimeric proteins (7Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), where these two regions were reciprocally exchanged (cf. Fig. 1 B). Characterization of these chimeras indicated that both Regions I and II were indeed critical for the specificity of SULT1A3 for dopamine and of SULT1A1 for p-nitrophenol (7Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To extend the study further, we and others (8Liu M.-C. Suiko M.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) had, by site-directed mutagenesis, exchanged amino acid residues in these two regions between SULT1A3 and SULT1A1. Results from these studies implicated residue 146 in Region II and residues 86 and 89 in Region I, as important in determining the specificity of the enzymes for their respective substrates. SULT1A3 is present in brain where it is believed to sulfate monoamine neurotransmitters (particularly dopamine) with high activity and thus to regulate their levels (5Coughtrie M.W.H. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It also serves a detoxifying function in the intestine, where it may detoxify potentially lethal dietary monoamines (12Rubin G.L. Sharp S. Jones A.L. Glatt H. Mills J.A. Coughtrie M.W.H. Xenobiotica. 1996; 26: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Besides the activity toward its physiological substrate, dopamine, for which it has a K m of 2 μm, SULT1A3 has been shown recently to display a unique Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity at higher (millimolar and sub-millimolar) concentrations of these substrates, which can be dramatically stimulated by Mn2+ (13Sakakibara Y. Katafuchi J. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Nakajima H. Liu M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, chimeras and site-directed mutants were used to explore the structural basis for the stereospecificity and Mn2+stimulation of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of SULT1A3. SULT1A3 is present as a homodimer in its native state (14Heroux J.A. Roth J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of SULT1A3 (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggested that, in the case of d-tyrosine, where a 4-hydroxyphenyl group is to be sulfated, the tyrosine-Mn2+ and tyrosine-Mn2+-tyrosine complexes may be the real and obligatory substrates. In the case of d-Dopa, where we had shown that sulfation takes place exclusively at the 3-hydroxyphenyl group (16Suiko M. Sakakibara Y. Awan-Khan R. Sakaida H. Yoshikawa H. Ranasinghe J.G.S. Liu M.-C. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the substrate-Mn2+ complexes appeared to be better substrates than d-Dopa. These kinetic data implied that Mn2+, while interacting with the carboxyl group of the Dopa/tyrosine substrate to form the complex, also coordinates with amino acid residues on the enzyme. Previous x-ray crystallography study on SULT1A3 (17Dajani R. Cleasby A. Neu M. Wonacott A.J. Jhoti H. Hood A.M. Modi S. Hersey A. Taskinen J. Cooke R.M. Manchee G.R. Coughtrie M.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37862-37868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) has suggested that residues 84–92 corresponding to the variable Region I (cf. Fig. 1 A) form a “mobile” loop. Based on the amino acid residue in SULT1A3 identified as interacting with Mn2+ in the present study, a model has been proposed, in reference to the above-mentioned mobile loop, to explain how Mn2+ exerts its stimulatory effect on the sulfation of tyrosine and Dopa by the enzyme. This study also identified the amino acid residues and regions responsible for the unusual stereospecificity of SULT1A3 for the d-enantiomers of Dopa and tyrosine. The model developed may prove useful in understanding the stereoselective action of SULT1A3 on chiral drugs (18Wilson A.A. Wang J. Koch P. Walle T.

QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and XL1-Blue Epicurian coli competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech. pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector,E. coli BL21 host cells, and glutathione-Sepharose were products of Amersham Biosciences. Carrier-free sodium [35S]sulfate and Ecolume liquid scintillation fluid were from ICN Biomedicals. Recombinant human bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase was prepared as described previously (22Yanagisawa K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Nakajima H.

All other chemicals were of the highest grades available commercially. Wild-type and chimeric SULT1A3 and SULT1A1, cloned/generated and expressed using the pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system, were purified using glutathione-Sepharose in conjunction with thrombin cleavage to separate the fusion protein, based on the procedure established previously (7Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Point-mutated SULT1A3s were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, expressed using the pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system and purified with glutathione-Sepharose followed by thrombin cleavage to separate the fusion protein, as described previously (8Liu M.-C. Suiko M. Sakakibara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13460-13464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used for the generation of deletional mutants of SULT1A3. Briefly, wild-type SULT1A3 cDNA packaged in pGEX-2TK prokaryotic expression vector was used as the template in conjunction with specific mutagenic primers. To prepare the deletional SULT1A3 mutant lacking residues 84, 85, and 86 of the mobile loop (see Introduction), the mutagenic oligonucleotide primer set, 5′-CGGGTGCCCTTCCTTGAGCCAGGGGAACCCTCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGAGGGTTCCCCTGGCTCAAGGAAGGGCACCCG-3′, was used. Similarly, a deletional mutant of SULT1A3 lacking residues 84 through 90 of the loop was prepared using the mutagenic primer set, 5′-CGGGTGCCCTTCCTTGAGTCAGGGCTGGAGACTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGTCTCCAGCCCTGACTCAAGGAAGGGCACCCG-3′. The amplification conditions were 12 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 15 min at 68 °C. The deletional SULT1A3 mutant sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52575) Google Scholar). pGEX-2TK vector harboring individual deletional SULT1A3 mutant sequence was transformed into competent XL1-Blue E. coli cells. The transformed cells, grown to A 600 nm = ∼0.5 in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature, were collected by centrifugation and processed for the purification of recombinant deletional SULT1A3 mutant enzyme using the same procedure developed previously for the wild-type SULT1A3 (7Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sulfotransferase activities of the purified wild-type and chimeric SULT1A3/SULT1A1, as well as point and deletional mutant SULT1A3s, were assayed using [35S]PAPS as the sulfonate group donor. The standard assay mixture, in a final volume of 25 μl, contained 50 mm TAPS buffer, pH 8.25, 15 μm [35S]PAPS, 5 mm d- or l-tyrosine, or 1 mm d- or l-Dopa without additions (control) or with 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MnCl2, or 5 mm EDTA plus 5 mm MnCl2. The enzyme dilutions were prepared in 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.25, containing 10% glycerol and 8 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of the enzyme preparation, allowed to proceed for 3 or 10 min (so that the reaction reached no more than 5–10% of completion) at 37 °C, and terminated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. The precipitates were cleared by centrifugation for 1 min, and the supernatant was subjected to the analysis of [35S]sulfated d- or l-tyrosine ord- or l-Dopa based on the TLC procedure established previously (24Liu M.-C. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the experiments with d- orl-tyrosine as substrate, the sulfated product was separated by ascending TLC on a cellulose TLC plate in a solvent system containing n-butanol, isopropanol, 88% formic acid, water in a 3:1:1:1 ratio by volume. In the experiments with d- orl-Dopa as substrate, the sulfated product was first subjected to high voltage (1000 volts) thin-layer electrophoresis in one dimension before performing the ascending TLC separation in the second dimension. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, together with a control without enzyme. The results obtained were calculated and expressed in nmol sulfated product formed/min/mg protein. [35S]PAPS was synthesized from ATP and carrier-free [35S]sulfate using the bifunctional human ATP sulfurylase/ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase, and its purity was determined as described previously (25Fernando P.H.P. Karakawa A. Sakakibara Y. Ibuki H. Nakajima H. Liu M.-C. Suiko M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 5: 1974-1975Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The [35S]PAPS synthesized was then adjusted to the required concentration and specific activity by the addition of cold PAPS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206896) Google Scholar). Protein determination was based on the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215243) Google Scholar).

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), there is still relatively scant information concerning the structure/function relationships of cytosolic ST enzymes. As noted earlier, SULT1A3 and SULT1A1, which are >93% identical in amino acid sequence and yet display distinct substrate specificity and other properties, provide an excellent model for studies in this regard. In contrast to SULT1A1, SULT1A3 exhibits two unique activities. The sulfating activity toward dopamine, which presumably helps to regulate the levels of this endogenous compound, has a pH optimum of ∼7.0 and aK m of 2 μm (in the physiological range) (14Heroux J.A. Roth J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar, 28Butler P.R. Anderson R.J. Venton D.L. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mn2+ stimulated this activity to a comparatively smaller extent (∼2- to 3-fold) (13Sakakibara Y. Katafuchi J. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Nakajima H. Liu M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but appeared to increase the K m for dopamine slightly (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of SULT1A3, on the other hand, has the hallmarks of a detoxifying activity, with a pH optimum between 8 and 9 (29Suiko M. Sakakibara Y. Nakajima H. Sakaida H. Liu M.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and a K m (if we consider the substrate rather than substrate-Mn2+ complex) in the millimolar or sub-millimolar range (7Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Sakakibara Y. Katafuchi J. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Nakajima H. Liu M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to the dopamine-sulfating activity, the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity can be stimulated much more dramatically by Mn2+ and, intriguingly, displays stereospecificity for the d-form Dopa/tyrosine enantiomers (13Sakakibara Y. Katafuchi J. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Nakajima H. Liu M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As discussed before, our recent kinetic studies (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggested that Dopa and tyrosine form complexes with Mn2+ (the pH dependence of the reaction forming the complex may explain the different pH optimum for the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity compared with that for the dopamine sulfation, which does not involve such a complex) that serve either as the obligatory (in the case of tyrosine) or as a better (in the case of Dopa) substrate. The log K for the formation of the tyrosine-Mn2+ complex is 1.5, whereas that for the tyrosine-Mn2+-tyrosine complex is 5.0 (30Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar,31Gergely A. Nagypal I. Kiraly B. Acta Chim. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1971; 68: 285Google Scholar). Mn2+ coordinates not only with the carboxyl group of the substrates (to form the complexes) but also with amino acid residues on the enzyme (on formation of the enzyme-substrate complex). Our previous studies using chimeric and point-mutated SULT1A3/SULT1A1s had revealed that two variable regions (cf. Fig. 1 A), and in particular residues 86, 89, and 146 therein, are important in determining the distinct substrate specificity of these two otherwise highly homologous enzymes. The current study aimed to elucidate further the structural determinants for the unique stereoselectivity and Mn2+dependence of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of SULT1A3. This was studied by testing wild-type SULT1A3 and SULT1A1 and chimeric SULT1A3/SULT1A1s (cf. Fig. 1 B) for their sulfation activities toward the Dopa and tyrosine enantiomers, in the presence or absence of Mn2+. Our previous kinetic studies (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) had confirmed that Mn2+could stimulate dramatically the sulfation activity of wild-type SULT1A3 toward the tyrosine enantiomers. Mn2+, when added at a 5 mm concentration to the assay mixture, stimulated the sulfation activity of SULT1A3 toward d-tyrosine by two orders of magnitude in comparison with the basal activity determined without Mn2+, whereas the activity towardl-tyrosine was stimulated about ten times (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The same assay conditions were used to evaluate the stimulatory effect of Mn2+ on the sulfation activities of wild-type SULT1A3 and SULT1A1 and their various chimeras. The activity data obtained (Table I) confirmed that the Mn2+-stimulated activity with d-tyrosine as substrate for wild-type SULT1A3 was about 135 times the basal activity. When l-tyrosine was used as substrate, the stimulation was 14-fold. Therefore, as in our previous findings, wild-type SULT1A3 (designated MMMM for comparison with the chimeras; cf. Fig. 1 B) showed a distinct preference for the d-form enantiomer of tyrosine relative to the l-enantiomer. Wild-type SULT1A1 (PPPP), on the other hand, showed no sulfation activity toward either tyrosine enantiomer, with or without Mn2+. The data in Table I were analyzed to pinpoint which of the four regions (the two flanking regions and the middle variable Regions I and II) in the SULT1A3 molecule are required, respectively, for the basal tyrosine-sulfating activity, the stereospecificity, and the Mn2+ stimulation. Interestingly, the PMMP chimera displayed essentially the same level of basal activity, extent of stimulation by Mn2+, and stereospecificity as wild-type SULT1A3 (MMMM), whereas wild-type SULT1A1 (PPPP) showed none of these effects. These results indicated that the variable Regions I and II of the SULT1A3 can fully account for the tyrosine-sulfating activity and Mn2+ stimulation effect. Data on the chimeras with the variable Region II derived from SULT1A1 (MPPM, MMPM, and PMPP) showed that they were all incapable of catalyzing the sulfation of tyrosine enantiomers, indicating an absolute requirement for the variable Region II of the SULT1A3 molecule for the basal tyrosine-sulfating activity. In contrast, the chimeras MPMM and PPMP showed a small basal activity with d-tyrosine as substrate but without any Mn2+ stimulation effect. With l-tyrosine as substrate, however, no activity was detected with either of these two chimeras. These latter results suggested indirectly that the variable Region I of the SULT1A3 molecule, although not absolutely required for, may contribute substantially to its d-tyrosine sulfation activity. Moreover, the data indicated that this variable Region I is essential for the Mn2+ stimulation effect withd-tyrosine as substrate.Table ISpecific activities of the wild-type and chimeric SULT1A3/SULT1A1s with d- orl-tyrosine in the presence or absence of Mn ++Substrate usedSpecific activity, nmol sulfated product formed/min/mg proteinMMMMPMMPMPMMPPMPMPPMMMPMPMPPPPPPd-p-Tyrosine + Mn++602 ± 63619 ± 73NDNDNDNDNDNDd-p-Tyrosine4.5 ± 0.56.2 ± 0.60.6 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1NDNDNDNDl-p-Tyrosine + Mn++14.5 ± 0.715.7 ± 0.4NDNDNDNDNDNDl-p-Tyrosine1.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1NDNDNDNDNDNDThe values are the calculated mean ± S.D. from three determinations.

All other assay conditions are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, not detected. A limitation in the use of tyrosine as substrate is that the basal activities detected for the wild-type and chimeric SULTs were all quite low. Although the above-mentioned data indicated that the SULT1A3 Region I is required for the Mn2+ stimulation effect, it was difficult to determine whether it is truly required for the stereospecificity of SULT1A3 for the d-form tyrosine enantiomer. To better address this issue, Dopa enantiomers were used as substrates. Our previous kinetic studies (15Pai T.G. Ohkimoto K. Sakakibara Y. Suiko M. Sugahara T. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43813-43820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that wild-type SULT1A3 displayed significantly higher basal sulfation activities toward Dopa. Although much less dramatic compared with the sulfation of tyrosine, a 2- to 3-fold stimulation (at the Dopa concentrations used) of the Dopa-sulfating activity was observed in the presence of Mn2+. Therefore, using Dopa as substrate may prove to be more useful in investigating the structural requirements for the stereospecificity and Mn2+ stimulation effect. The sulfation activities of wild-type SULT1A3 and SULT1A1 and the chimeras toward d- or l-Dopa, in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm Mn2+, were determined. The results obtained are compiled in Table II. Wild-type SULT1A3 showed a distinct preference for d-Dopa. The Mn2+-stimulated activity of wild-type SULT1A3 withd-Dopa as substrate was 1.8 times the basal activity, whereas with l-Dopa it was almost 2-fold. The data obtained with the chimeras basically reinforce the conclusions reached using tyrosine as substrate. Moreover, the chimeras with the variable Region I derived from SULT1A1 and Region II from SULT1A3 (i.e. PPMP and MPMM), while exhibiting substantial basal sulfation activities toward both d- and l-Dopa, showed a preference for the d-enantiomer, especially with the PPMP chimera where the activities were higher. There appeared to be no significant Mn2+ stimulation effects with these chimeras. Because the absence of SULT1A3 variable Region I abolished the Mn2+stimulation effect it follows that this Region I is required for the Mn2+ stimulation effect. The stereospecificity for thed-enantiomer, however, is present regardless of whether Region I is from the SULT1A3 or SULT1A1. The variable Region II of SULT1A3 may be required for its stereospecificity for thed-enantiomers. Moreover, the variable Region II of SULT1A3 is absolutely required for the basal Dopa/tyrosine"
