https://openalex.org/W2092620403,"EnvZ, a histidine kinase/phosphatase inEscherichia coli, responds to the osmolarity changes in the medium by regulating the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor OmpR, which controls the expression levels of outer membrane porin proteins OmpF and OmpC. Although both ompRand envZ genes are located on the ompB locus under the control of the ompB promoter and transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA, the expression of envZ is known to be significantly less than ompR. However, to date no accurate estimation for the amounts of EnvZ and OmpR in the cell has been carried out. Here we examined the levels of EnvZ and OmpR in the wild-type strain MC4100 by quantitative Western blot analysis using anti-OmpR and anti-EnvZc (cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ) antisera. It was observed that during exponential growth in L-broth medium there were ∼3500 and 100 molecules per cell of OmpR and EnvZ, respectively. The levels of OmpR and EnvZ in MC4100 cells grown in a high osmolarity medium (nutrient broth with 20% sucrose) were about the same as those grown in L-broth, whereas they were 1.7-fold higher than those in a low osmolarity medium (nutrient broth). With His10-OmpR, we also determined that theK d value for the EnvZc-OmpR complex formation is 1.20 ± 0.17 μm. On the basis of these results, the molecular mechanism of osmoregulation of ompF andompC is discussed.

His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system nitrilotriacetic acid nutrient broth outer membrane porin proteins 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate Bacteria primarily rely on the His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system (HAP system),1 or the two-component signal transduction system, to acclimate in response to the changes of environmental conditions (1Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The HAP system basically consists of a histidine kinase, which serves as a signal receptor, and its cognate response regulator, which regulates specific gene expression or mediates cellular locomotion (3Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One of most extensively studied HAP systems is the EnvZ/OmpR system mediating signal transduction in response to environmental osmolarity changes in Escherichia coli (4Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Pratt L. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction.

EnvZ, a histidine kinase, undergoestrans-autophosphorylation on the highly conserved His-243 residue (7Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The high energy phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the conserved Asp-55 residue of OmpR, a response regulator. Phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) serves as a transcription factor differentially modulating the expression of the major outer membrane porin genes, ompC and ompF. OmpC and OmpF form channels in the outer membrane, which allow passive diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules of less than 650 Da in size (9Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EnvZ also possesses the OmpR-P phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate OmpR-P. It has been proposed that osmotic signal regulates the ratio of the kinase to the phosphatase activity of EnvZ to modulate the level of cellular OmpR-P by primarily altering the phosphatase activity (10Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cellular OmpR-P levels reciprocally regulate the transcription ofompF and ompC. At low medium osmolarity a reduced level of OmpR-P, due to the decreased kinase/phosphatase ratio of EnvZ, favors the transcription of ompF. At high medium osmolarity an elevated OmpR-P level, resulting from the increased kinase/phosphatase ratio of EnvZ, allows the activation ofompC transcription. On the other hand, more OmpR-P molecules bind to the ompF promoter upstream region causing repression of ompF expression.EnvZ, consisting of 450 amino acid residues, exists as a dimer located in the inner cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. The cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (residues 180–450), EnvZc, also exists as a dimer and consists of the linker region (residues 180–222), domain A (or DHp domain, residues 223–289) and domain B (or CA domain, residues 290–450). It possesses both kinase and phosphatase activities similar to the intact EnvZ (11Park H. Saha S.K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6728-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The linker region is considered to play an important role in transducing the signal from the periplasmic receptor domain to the cytoplasmic catalytic domain (13Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NMR solution structures of both domain A and domain B have been solved (14Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y.

Recently it has been demonstrated that domain A by itself can serve as the OmpR-P phosphatase, and it has been proposed that the phosphatase activity of EnvZ is modulated by the spatial arrangement between domain A and domain B (16Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The response regulator OmpR consists of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver domain containing the highly conserved Asp-55 phosphorylation site and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (17Kato M. Aiba H. Tate S. Nishimura Y. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The two domains are connected by a flexible linker (18Kenney L.J. Bauer M.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the DNA binding domain shows a winged helix-turn-helix motif structure (19Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 109-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,20Kondo H. Nakagawa A. Nishihira J. Nishimura Y. Mizuno T. Tanaka I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of OmpR at Asp-55 greatly enhances its binding affinity for the regulatory sequences upstream of the ompFand ompC promoters (21Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Forst S. Delgado J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2949-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aiba H. Nakasai F.

Biol. 1996; 262: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The in vitro andin vivo footprinting studies have demonstrated that OmpR-P binds to the −100 to −38 region (C1, C2, and C3 sites) ofompC and the −380 to the −361 region (F4 site) and the −100 to −39 region (F1, F2, and F3 sites) of ompF(24Huang K.J.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These OmpR binding sites consist of 20 base pairs each sharing a consensus sequence (28Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been shown that two OmpR-P molecules bind to each site in a head-to-tail manner (28Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Harrison-McMonagle P. Denissova N. Martinez-Hackert E. Ebright R.H. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of OmpR-P to these sites are in a hierarchical order such that OmpR-P independently binds to F1 and C1 sites whereas OmpR-P cooperatively binds to other sites only after the upstream F1 and C1 sites are occupied by OmpR-P (21Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The ompB operon of E. coli is comprised of two genes, ompR and envZ, which are co-transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA from a promoter located 5′ to theompR gene (30Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been shown that significantly fewer EnvZ molecules are produced compared with OmpR molecules in a cell, and it has been estimated that there are about 1000 molecules of OmpR whereas there are only 10 molecules of EnvZ per cell (5Pratt L. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 105-107Google Scholar). In this report, we reexamined the cellular OmpR and EnvZ levels under different growth conditions by quantitative Western blot analysis. We also determined the dissociation constant of OmpR and EnvZ by using His10-OmpR and Ni-NTA-agarose. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which the EnvZ/OmpR system regulates the osmosensory pathway in E. coli.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, OmpR and EnvZ levels in E. colicells grown in L-broth at mid-log phase were determined to be 3500 and 100 molecules per cell, respectively. OmpR and EnvZ levels were almost the same from cells grown in L-broth medium or in a high osmolarity medium (NB + 20% sucrose). However, when cells were grown in a low osmolarity medium (NB), both OmpR and EnvZ levels were about 60% of those in the high osmolarity medium. The mechanism for the differential expression of the ompB locus under different osmolarities remains to be elucidated. The autoregulation of theompB locus has been reported, where the ompBexpression is regulated by OmpR, the first product of theompB operon (35Liljestrom P. Laamanen I. Palva E.T J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should be noted that under all the different growth conditions used, the ratio of OmpR to EnvZ was almost constant, and OmpR molecules existed in 30–35-fold excess over EnvZ monomers or in 60–70-fold excess compared with EnvZ dimers. It has been reported that translation of OmpR mRNA is ten times more efficient than that of EnvZ using lacZ as a reporter inSalmonella typhimurium (36Berman M.L. Jackson D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 750-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because bothenvZ and ompR genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA (30Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the expression of the two genes are differentially regulated at the level of translation initiation (36Berman M.L. Jackson D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 750-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The apparent K d value of EnvZc and His10-OmpR interaction was 1.20 ± 0.17 μm under the conditions used. Assuming the cell volume is 10−15 liters (37Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 1. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1359Google Scholar), the cellular concentrations of OmpR and EnvZ were calculated to be 6 and 0.18 μm, respectively. Therefore on the basis of the K d value thus obtained, ∼85% of EnvZ molecules in a cell are estimated to be occupied with OmpR. It is important to note that as OmpR molecules exist in concentrations 60–70-fold higher than EnvZ dimers, OmpR-P molecules formed on EnvZ dimers are always competed with free OmpR molecules in the cytoplasmic fraction. It has been demonstrated that OmpR-P has a much higher affinity for the ompF andompC promoter regions than OmpR, so that once the OmpR-P molecules released into the cytoplasm are bound to the ompFand ompC promoter regions they are readily sequestered from the EnvZ phosphatase activity (38Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar).Previous reports (27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that at low osmolarity, OmpR-P binds to the C1 site and cooperatively to F1, F2, and somewhat loosely to F3 sites resulting only in ompF expression, whereas at high osmolarity, the concentration of OmpR-P increases allowing C2, C3, and F4 sites (the repressor site for the ompF expression) to be also occupied by OmpR-P, resulting in the induction ofompC expression and repression of ompFexpression. In this fashion, the reciprocal expression ofompF and ompC is achieved depending upon the medium osmolarity. According to the footprinting experiment, F1, F2, and a significant fraction of the F3 site were protected when the OmpR-P concentrations were between 108 and 135 nm whereas all C1, C2, and C3 sites became protected only when the OmpR-P concentration reached 540 nm (27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), assuming that the OmpR added was fully phosphorylated. Assuming that these results may be applied in vivo, at low osmolarity the phosphorylation of only 3.5% (120 nm or 70 OmpR-P molecules/cell) of total OmpR molecules in a cell (2024 OmpR molecules per cell) would be enough to activate the expression of ompF, whereas at high osmolarity the phosphorylation of about 10% (580 nm or 350 OmpR-P molecules/cell) of total OmpR molecules in a cell (3500 molecules per cell) would be sufficient to promote the expression ofompC and to repress the expression of ompF. Clearly the 60 EnvZ monomers or 30 EnvZ dimers per cell at low osmolarity and 100 EnvZ monomers or 50 EnvZ dimers per cell at high osmolarity are sufficient to fulfill the effective regulation ofompF and ompC. On the basis of OmpR amounts it has been shown that the OmpR-P level at high osmolarity was about 4-fold higher than that at low osmolarity (39Forst S. Delgado J. Rampersaud A. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the cellular OmpR level is increased by more than 70% at high osmolarity than that at low osmolarity, the actual OmpR-P level could be increased more than 7-fold at high osmolarity in comparison with the level of OmpR-P at low osmolarity. In addition, the cell volume increases at low osmolarity whereas it decreases at high osmolarity resulting in even more dramatic changes in the OmpR-P concentration. This sharp change of the OmpR-P concentration appears to account well for the expression patterns of ompF and ompC at high and low osmolarity. However, the regulation of ompF andompC in the cell may be more complex, as there are cross-talks among the His-Asp phosphorelay systems (40Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and other genes besides ompF and ompC are known to be regulated by OmpR-P (41Verhoef C. Lugtenberg B. van Boxtel R. de Graaff P. Verheij H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 169: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Shin S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4696-4702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Mao W. Siegele D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).A similar quantitative Western blot analysis has been carried out with the proteins involved in chemotaxis signal transduction. The cellular contents of the total MCPs (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein), CheA, CheY, and CheW were estimated to be 6000 molecules each per cell inE. coli (44Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 45Kuo S.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However it is important to know that CheA belongs to Class II histidine kinases, whereas EnvZ belongs to Class I, the major signal transducing kinases in E. coli as 29 of 30 histidine kinases in E. coli belong to Class I (46Mizuno T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Class II kinases are involved in regulating flagella rotation whereas Class I kinases regulate transcription of specific genes (47Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S. Kihara M. Isomura M. Jones C.J. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report is the first to accurately estimate the cellular contents of a Class I kinase and its cognate response regulator, suggesting that the Class I kinase system is substantially different from the Class II kinase system in their regulatory mechanisms.The interaction between EnvZ and OmpR-P is not discussed in the present study. A recent report concerning this issue raised a question about the role of EnvZ phosphatase activity in osmoregulation (48Mattison K. Kenney L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have reexamined the OmpR-P interaction with EnvZc, and these results will be presented elsewhere. The characterization of the OmpR-P-EnvZ interaction provides important insights into the bi-functional roles of EnvZ in the osmoregulation of ompC and ompF. Bacteria primarily rely on the His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system (HAP system),1 or the two-component signal transduction system, to acclimate in response to the changes of environmental conditions (1Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The HAP system basically consists of a histidine kinase, which serves as a signal receptor, and its cognate response regulator, which regulates specific gene expression or mediates cellular locomotion (3Grebe T.W.

One of most extensively studied HAP systems is the EnvZ/OmpR system mediating signal transduction in response to environmental osmolarity changes in Escherichia coli (4Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M.

EnvZ, a histidine kinase, undergoestrans-autophosphorylation on the highly conserved His-243 residue (7Yang Y. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11057-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

At low medium osmolarity a reduced level of OmpR-P, due to the decreased kinase/phosphatase ratio of EnvZ, favors the transcription of ompF. At high medium osmolarity an elevated OmpR-P level, resulting from the increased kinase/phosphatase ratio of EnvZ, allows the activation ofompC transcription.

The phosphorylation of OmpR at Asp-55 greatly enhances its binding affinity for the regulatory sequences upstream of the ompFand ompC promoters (21Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol.

The in vitro andin vivo footprinting studies have demonstrated that OmpR-P binds to the −100 to −38 region (C1, C2, and C3 sites) ofompC and the −380 to the −361 region (F4 site) and the −100 to −39 region (F1, F2, and F3 sites) of ompF(24Huang K.J.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These OmpR binding sites consist of 20 base pairs each sharing a consensus sequence (28Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been shown that two OmpR-P molecules bind to each site in a head-to-tail manner (28Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Harrison-McMonagle P. Denissova N. Martinez-Hackert E. Ebright R.H. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of OmpR-P to these sites are in a hierarchical order such that OmpR-P independently binds to F1 and C1 sites whereas OmpR-P cooperatively binds to other sites only after the upstream F1 and C1 sites are occupied by OmpR-P (21Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ompB operon of E. coli is comprised of two genes, ompR and envZ, which are co-transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA from a promoter located 5′ to theompR gene (30Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been shown that significantly fewer EnvZ molecules are produced compared with OmpR molecules in a cell, and it has been estimated that there are about 1000 molecules of OmpR whereas there are only 10 molecules of EnvZ per cell (5Pratt L. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 105-107Google Scholar). In this report, we reexamined the cellular OmpR and EnvZ levels under different growth conditions by quantitative Western blot analysis. We also determined the dissociation constant of OmpR and EnvZ by using His10-OmpR and Ni-NTA-agarose. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which the EnvZ/OmpR system regulates the osmosensory pathway in E. coli. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, OmpR and EnvZ levels in E. colicells grown in L-broth at mid-log phase were determined to be 3500 and 100 molecules per cell, respectively. OmpR and EnvZ levels were almost the same from cells grown in L-broth medium or in a high osmolarity medium (NB + 20% sucrose). However, when cells were grown in a low osmolarity medium (NB), both OmpR and EnvZ levels were about 60% of those in the high osmolarity medium. The mechanism for the differential expression of the ompB locus under different osmolarities remains to be elucidated. The autoregulation of theompB locus has been reported, where the ompBexpression is regulated by OmpR, the first product of theompB operon (35Liljestrom P. Laamanen I. Palva E.T J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should be noted that under all the different growth conditions used, the ratio of OmpR to EnvZ was almost constant, and OmpR molecules existed in 30–35-fold excess over EnvZ monomers or in 60–70-fold excess compared with EnvZ dimers. It has been reported that translation of OmpR mRNA is ten times more efficient than that of EnvZ using lacZ as a reporter inSalmonella typhimurium (36Berman M.L. Jackson D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 750-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because bothenvZ and ompR genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA (30Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the expression of the two genes are differentially regulated at the level of translation initiation (36Berman M.L. Jackson D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 750-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The apparent K d value of EnvZc and His10-OmpR interaction was 1.20 ± 0.17 μm under the conditions used. Assuming the cell volume is 10−15 liters (37Wanner B.L. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 1. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1359Google Scholar), the cellular concentrations of OmpR and EnvZ were calculated to be 6 and 0.18 μm, respectively. Therefore on the basis of the K d value thus obtained, ∼85% of EnvZ molecules in a cell are estimated to be occupied with OmpR. It is important to note that as OmpR molecules exist in concentrations 60–70-fold higher than EnvZ dimers, OmpR-P molecules formed on EnvZ dimers are always competed with free OmpR molecules in the cytoplasmic fraction. It has been demonstrated that OmpR-P has a much higher affinity for the ompF andompC promoter regions than OmpR, so that once the OmpR-P molecules released into the cytoplasm are bound to the ompFand ompC promoter regions they are readily sequestered from the EnvZ phosphatase activity (38Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar).Previous reports (27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that at low osmolarity, OmpR-P binds to the C1 site and cooperatively to F1, F2, and somewhat loosely to F3 sites resulting only in ompF expression, whereas at high osmolarity, the concentration of OmpR-P increases allowing C2, C3, and F4 sites (the repressor site for the ompF expression) to be also occupied by OmpR-P, resulting in the induction ofompC expression and repression of ompFexpression. In this fashion, the reciprocal expression ofompF and ompC is achieved depending upon the medium osmolarity. According to the footprinting experiment, F1, F2, and a significant fraction of the F3 site were protected when the OmpR-P concentrations were between 108 and 135 nm whereas all C1, C2, and C3 sites became protected only when the OmpR-P concentration reached 540 nm (27Bergstrom L.C. Qin L. Harlocker S.L. Egger L.A. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), assuming that the OmpR added was fully phosphorylated. Assuming that these results may be applied in vivo, at low osmolarity the phosphorylation of only 3.5% (120 nm or 70 OmpR-P molecules/cell) of total OmpR molecules in a cell (2024 OmpR molecules per cell) would be enough to activate the expression of ompF, whereas at high osmolarity the phosphorylation of about 10% (580 nm or 350 OmpR-P molecules/cell) of total OmpR molecules in a cell (3500 molecules per cell) would be sufficient to promote the expression ofompC and to repress the expression of ompF. Clearly the 60 EnvZ monomers or 30 EnvZ dimers per cell at low osmolarity and 100 EnvZ monomers or 50 EnvZ dimers per cell at high osmolarity are sufficient to fulfill the effective regulation ofompF and ompC. On the basis of OmpR amounts it has been shown that the OmpR-P level at high osmolarity was about 4-fold higher than that at low osmolarity (39Forst S. Delgado J. Rampersaud A. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the cellular OmpR level is increased by more than 70% at high osmolarity than that at low osmolarity, the actual OmpR-P level could be increased more than 7-fold at high osmolarity in comparison with the level of OmpR-P at low osmolarity. In addition, the cell volume increases at low osmolarity whereas it decreases at high osmolarity resulting in even more dramatic changes in the OmpR-P concentration. This sharp change of the OmpR-P concentration appears to account well for the expression patterns of ompF and ompC at high and low osmolarity. However, the regulation of ompF andompC in the cell may be more complex, as there are cross-talks among the His-Asp phosphorelay systems (40Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and other genes besides ompF and ompC are known to be regulated by OmpR-P (41Verhoef C. Lugtenberg B. van Boxtel R. de Graaff P. Verheij H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 169: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Shin S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4696-4702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Mao W. Siegele D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).A similar quantitative Western blot analysis has been carried out with the proteins involved in chemotaxis signal transduction. The cellular contents of the total MCPs (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein), CheA, CheY, and CheW were estimated to be 6000 molecules each per cell inE. coli (44Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 45Kuo S.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However it is important to know that CheA belongs to Class II histidine kinases, whereas EnvZ belongs to Class I, the major signal transducing kinases in E. coli as 29 of 30 histidine kinases in E. coli belong to Class I (46Mizuno T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Class II kinases are involved in regulating flagella rotation whereas Class I kinases regulate transcription of specific genes (47Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S. Kihara M. Isomura M. Jones C.J. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report is the first to accurately estimate the cellular contents of a Class I kinase and its cognate response regulator, suggesting that the Class I kinase system is substantially different from the Class II kinase system in their regulatory mechanisms.The interaction between EnvZ and OmpR-P is not discussed in the present study. A recent report concerning this issue raised a question about the role of EnvZ phosphatase activity in osmoregulation (48Mattison K. Kenney L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have reexamined the OmpR-P interaction with EnvZc, and these results will be presented elsewhere. The characterization of the OmpR-P-EnvZ interaction provides important insights into the bi-functional roles of EnvZ in the osmoregulation of ompC and ompF. In the present study, OmpR and EnvZ levels in E. colicells grown in L-broth at mid-log phase were determined to be 3500 and 100 molecules per cell, respectively.

Genes encoding proteins with repeated GXY motifs have also been reported in bacteria and phages; however, it is unclear whether these prokaryotic proteins can form a collagen-like triple-helical structure. Here we used two recently identified streptococcal proteins, Scl1 and Scl2, containing extended GXY sequence repeats as model proteins. First we observed that prior to heat denaturation recombinant Scl proteins migrated as homotrimers in gel electrophoresis with and without SDS. We next showed that the collagen-like domain of Scl is resistant to proteolysis by trypsin. We further showed that circular dichroism spectra of the Scl proteins contained features characteristic of collagen triple helices, including a positive maximum of ellipticity at 220 nm. Furthermore the triple helices of Scl1 and Scl2 showed a temperature-dependent unfolding with melting temperatures of 36.4 and 37.6 °C, respectively, which resembles those seen for collagens. We finally demonstrated by electron microscopy that the Scl proteins are organized into “lollipop-like” structures, similar to those seen in human proteins with collagenous domains. This implies that the repeated GXY tripeptide motif is a structural indicator of collagen-like triple helices in proteins from such phylogenetically distant sources as bacteria and humans.

Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to contributing to the structural integrity of the tissue, collagens may also affect cell behavior, e.g. by interacting with specific cellular receptors. All collagens contain a triple-helical domain composed of three left-handed polyproline II-type chains wound around the central axis to form a right-handed superhelix (2Ramachandran G.N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The segments of the collagen polypeptide forming a triple helix contain the repeating amino acid sequence Gly-Xaa-Yaa (GXY) in which a glycine residue occupies every third position, since only glycine is small enough to be accommodated at the center of the triple helix. The three chains are linked by hydrogen bonds between the backbone group, –NH (Gly) and the backbone carbonyl group (X position) of another chain, and by water-mediated interactions. The X and Y positions are frequently occupied by the imino acids proline and hydroxyproline, respectively. Hydroxyprolines are formed by post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues and are important in stabilizing the collagen triple helix. In humans, mutations that affect collagen triple helix formation and fiber assembly have serious pathological consequences often leading to death (3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The vertebrate collagens are classified into 19 types that are grouped in two major categories known as fibrillar (types I-III, V, and XI) and nonfibrillar (IV, VI-X, and XII-XIX) collagens. In addition, a variety of other mammalian proteins have been identified that contain collagen-like triple-helical domains (1Hulmes D.J.S. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). They are often involved in host defense processes and include the complement factor C1q (4Sellar G.C. Blake D.J. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), mammalian lectins (5Reid K.B.M. Biochem. Soc.

Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). These proteins form characteristic “lollipop-shaped” structures with stalks made of their collagen-like domains and globular heads made of the noncollagenous regions. In addition to higher eukaryotes, collagens are also found in invertebrates including mussels, worms, and sponges (7Engel J. Science. 1997; 277: 1785-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA tracks encoding collagen-like sequences have been found in the genomes of bacteria (8Ferretti J.J. McShan W.M. Ajdic D. Savic D.J. Savic G. Lyon K. Primeaux C. Sezate S. Suvorov A.N.

However, these organisms appear to lack proline hydroxylases, and since hydroxyproline in the past has been considered a critical residue for triple helix formation, it is unclear if the prokaryotic GXY repeated motifs result in proteins that can form stable collagen-like triple helices. Recent studies of model synthetic peptides (13Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) demonstrate that a GXY sequence with certain so called “guest” residues other than proline and hydroxyproline in the X and Y positions are capable of forming a stable triple helix. To test the hypothesis that bacterial GXY sequences can adopt a collagen-like structure, we have examined two recently identified streptococcal collagen-like proteins, Scl1 and Scl2 as models (14Lukomski S.

Scl proteins are expressed on the cell surface of group A Streptococcus(GAS),1 a Gram-positive bacterium. Both Scl proteins have similar organization and contain amino-terminal signal sequences and at the carboxyl terminus characteristic cell wall-associated regions. The putative extracellular part of Scls consists of a variable noncollagenous region and a collagen-like region consisting of GXY repeats. Here we use several approaches such as gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and electron microscopy after rotary shadowing to analyze the structure of the Scl proteins. Our data provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of collagen-like triple-helical structures in the Scl proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first reported structural characterization of a “prokaryotic collagen.” Recombinant Scl1 and Scl2 proteins were generated using the Strep-tag II expression and purification system (IBA-GmbH). Fragments encoding sequences of the scl1.1 allele were amplified from the serotype M1 strain MGAS6708 identical to SF370 used for genome sequencing (8Ferretti J.J. McShan W.M. Ajdic D. Savic D.J. Savic G. Lyon K. Primeaux C. Sezate S. Suvorov A.N. Kenton S. Lai H.S. Lin S.P. Qian Y. Jia H.G. Najar F.Z. Ren Q. Zhu H. Song L. White J. Yuan X. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. McLaughlin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4658-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Thescl2.28 sequence was amplified from the serotype M28 strain MGAS6274 (16Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were ligated to the Escherichia coli vector pASK-IBA2, and clones were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on aStrep-Tactin-Sepharose. The identity of each purified protein was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing, and mass determinations were done by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry measurements. Western immunoblot analysis was performed with proteins separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (AmershamBiosciences) and probed with specific, affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the V region of Scl1.1 (14Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Ireland R.M. Reid S.R. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6542-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit affinity-purified immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains) (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody, and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used in signal detection. Prestained broad-range marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass standards. The ability of the Scl proteins to form oligomers was examined by gel electrophoresis. Protein samples were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and then placed on ice for 2 min before loading, whereas native protein samples were not heated and were kept at 4 °C. Denatured or native P144 and P163 proteins were electrophoretically separated in 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels with or without 0.1% SDS and visualized by staining. The resistance of triple helix collagen to trypsin digestion was used as an indicator of macromolecular structure. Native and heat-denatured samples of recombinant P144 dissolved in 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, were digested with 10 μg/ml trypsin (enzyme:protein molar ratio, 1:10) at 15 °C. Aliquots were removed after 15, 30, and 60 min, and the reaction was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using undigested P144 and P157 as size markers. Resistance of the triple-helical domain to trypsin was measured from band intensities and compared with an undigested sample. Protein samples dissolved in 1% phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, were equilibrated at the desired temperature for 20 min before taking measurements. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter in a thermostatically controlled cuvette with a 0.5-cm path length as described previously (18Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Data were integrated for 1 s at 0.2-nm intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm as described earlier. Thermal transition profiles were recorded at 220 nm as described above with a temperature slope of 20 °C/h or of 10 °C/h. A wavelength scan was performed for each protein at each end point temperature before and after unfolding or refolding. The melting temperatures (tm) were given as mean ± S.D. oftm values from several measurements. Secondary structure compositions were estimated using three deconvolution programs, CD Estima (19Yang J.T., Wu, C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), CONTIN (20Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), and SELCON (21Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), and the results were averaged. The proteins were dialyzed against 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and rotary shadowing performed as previously described (22Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, each sample (protein concentration 100 μg/ml) was mixed with glycerol to a final glycerol concentration of 70% (v/v), and 100 μl of each sample was nebulized with an airbrush onto freshly cleaved mica. The samples were dried in a vacuum and rotary shadowed with carbon/platinum using an electron beam gun tilted at an angle of 6 degrees relative to the mica surface in a Balzers BAE 250 evaporator. The replicas were then backed with carbon at 90 degrees. The replicas were floated onto distilled water and picked up onto bare 600-mesh copper grids. Photomicrographs were taken using a Philips 410 electron microscope operated at 80 KV with a 30-μm objective aperture. The microscope was calibrated using a carbon grating replica. The height of the goniometer stage was adjusted for each grid square before taking pictures, and the lenses were saturated before taking each photo. Molecule contours were traced on a digitizing tablet at a final magnification of ×181,500 and measurements generated with Bioquant software. The trimeric structure of the collagen-like region of Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 was homology-modeled using SwissModel (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar), based on the coordinates of a (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 collagen-like peptide (24Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The target-template alignment was guided by superposition of Gly residues. Energy minimization in vacuo was carried out using GROMOS96 (25Scott W.R.P. Hunenberger P.H. Tironi I.G. Mark A.E. Billeter S.R. Fennen J. Torda A.E. Huber T. Kruger P. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 3596-3607Crossref Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) to relieve short contacts and improve local stereochemistry. Interactions involving the side chains have not been modeled explicitly. Previous studies demonstrated that recombinant proteins expressed in eukaryotic systems could successfully be used to study the structure and organization of mammalian proteins with collagenous domains (26Haagsman H.P.

Biophys. 1998; 360: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we examine a series of recombinant polypeptides generated in a prokaryotic (E. coli) expression system derived from either the Scl1.1 (Scl1 protein from a serotype M1 GAS) or the Scl2.28 (Scl2 protein from a M28-type GAS) protein that contain collagen-like regions composed of continuous GXY repeats (Fig.1A). These two related proteins were selected for our structural studies because they were both expressed by the parental GAS isolates and they differed significantly in their primary amino acid sequence (14Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Ireland R.M. Reid S.R. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6542-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The collagen-like region (CL) is composed of 50 and 79 GXY repeats in Scl1.1 and Scl2.28, respectively. The amino-terminal segment of each protein, called the variable (V) region, is composed of noncollagenous sequence and consists of 67 amino acids in Scl1.1 and 73 residues in Scl2.28. To study the structural organization of Scl1, three recombinant proteins, P144, P157, and P158, were constructed representing the combined VCL regions, the CL region, and the V region, respectively (a schematic of each construct is shown in Fig. 1A). We earlier reported that the wild type streptococcal Scl1.1 migrated aberrantly in denaturing SDS-PAGE (14Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Ireland R.M. Reid S.R. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6542-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Lukomski S. Nakashima K. Abdi I. Cipriano V.J. Shelvin B.J. Graviss E.A. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, the recombinant P144 and P157 also migrated aberrantly whereas P158 did not (Fig. 1B,left). Therefore, the recombinant protein identities were confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing and their masses of 26.8, 18.5, and 9.4 kDa, respectively, were verified by mass spectrometry analyses. Furthermore, both P144 and P158 reacted with the V region-specific antibodies, whereas P157 did not (Fig. 1B,right). A recombinant protein P163 containing the combined VCL regions of the Scl2.28 was generated and purified. P163 (Mr = 33.8) also migrated aberrantly in SDS-PAGE, and its identity was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing. To assess the ability of Scl1 and Scl2 to assemble into polymeric structures, we first compared the electrophoretic mobility of P144, P157, and P163 in polyacrylamide gel run in the absence of SDS before and after heat denaturation (Fig. 2A,left panel). In each case, the native samples produced uniform higher molecular mass bands compared with their corresponding samples that were heat-denatured before loading on a gel, results suggesting that all three proteins tested formed oligomers under nondenaturing condition. The presence of multiple bands in denatured P144 and P163 suggested that these proteins partially renatured while running on a gel. In subsequent experiments, the mobility of native and heat-denatured samples of P144 and P163 were compared in SDS-PAGE using molecular mass standards (Fig. 2A, right panel). A heat-denatured P144 (Mr = 26.8) migrated as a 45-kDa band, whereas the nondenatured sample appeared as a single band with an apparent Mr of 140–160 kDa. Similarly, the heat-denatured P163 migrated as a single band of ∼43 kDa, whereas nondenatured P163 appeared heterogeneous with a predominant band that migrated in the range of 130–140 kDa. Hence, native Scl proteins form higher ordered structures and gel mobility data suggested that P144 form a stable trimer under the SDS-PAGE conditions used. Also P163 appears to form a trimer, but this putative trimer may partly dissociate in SDS-PAGE. To test the formation of triple helix by Scl proteins, the susceptibility of recombinant P144 to trypsin was examined (Fig.2B). Since triple helix is resistant to trypsin, the collagen-like domain of P144 should be protected against digestion. Native P144 was quickly trimmed to the size of the collagen-like domain corresponding to P157 and then remained relatively resistant to proteolysis. In contrast, the denatured P144 was nearly completely degraded within 15 min of the experiment. These results strongly suggested that CL region in Scl proteins is triple helical. Collagen triple helices have characteristic CD spectra with a positive ellipticity maximum at 220 nm (29Brodsky-Doyle B. Leonard K.R. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To examine the secondary structure composition of Scl1 and Scl2, recombinant proteins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy (Fig.3, A–C, solid lines). The CD spectrum of P157 at 25 °C resembled that of a collagen triple helix, with an ellipticity maximum at 220 nm in the order of 1 × 103 (degree cm2dmol−1) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the CD spectrum of P144 corresponding to the combined VCL regions also included the characteristic shoulder at 220 nm (Fig. 3A). The peak of the shoulder, however, was of a negative value probably due to the contribution of the secondary structure of the noncollagenous V domain. Similarly small amplitudes were previously reported for some mammalian proteins with collagenous domains including surfactant proteins and complement component C1q (26Haagsman H.P. White R.T. Schilling J. Lau K. Benson B.J. Golden J. Hawgood S. Clements J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L421-L429PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brodsky-Doyle B. Leonard K.R. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the Scl2.28, recombinant P163, also had the characteristics of a collagen triple helix with ellipticity maximum at 220 nm (∼2 × 103degree cm2 dmol−1) (Fig. 3C). The CD spectrum of P158 (10 μm) did not include the characteristics of a collagen triple helix (Fig.4). Deconvolution of the spectrum indicated that the recombinant V domain consisted of 25.7% (±4.3%) α-helices, 43.6 (±10.5%) β-sheets, and 30.7% (±11.3%) other secondary structure elements. When samples of P144 (8.1 μm), P157 (29.8 μm), and P163 (7.7 μm) were heated to 50 °C, the CD spectra recorded at this temperature (Fig. 3, A–C, broken lines) did not show the characteristic features of a collagen triple helix (e.g. the 220 nm maximum) but rather indicated a random coil structure, suggesting that the triple helix had unfolded. By monitoring the CD at 220 nm as a function of increasing temperature we followed the thermal unfolding of the Scl proteins. The triple-helical structure in all three proteins unfolded within a very narrow temperature range (Δt < = 6 °C), with the midpoint temperatures oftm = 36.4 ± 0.4 °C for P144 (Fig.3D), tm = 37.7 ± 0.2 °C for P157 (Fig. 3E), and tm = 37.6 ± 0.8 °C for P163 (Fig. 3F). The sharp transition and thetm values of these proteins are reminiscent of the transition from triple helix to random coil observed for a type I collagen (i.e. tm = 38 °C and Δt = 3 °C) (31Brown III, F.R. Hopfinger A.J. Blout E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The thermal unfolding of the collagen-like triple helix of P144 and P163 appears to be readily reversible. When the protein samples were cooled, the ellipticity at 220 nm gradually increased (Fig. 3,D and F), and the CD spectra of samples cooled to 4 °C again showed the characteristics of a collagen-like triple helix (Fig. 3, A and C, dotted lines). The signal intensities at 207 and 220 nm of the refolded proteins were lower than those recorded for the original proteins before melting, suggesting that the refolding was not complete. The attempts to refold P157 were unsuccessful, suggesting that the amino-terminal V regions present in P144 and P163 but absent in P157 might facilitate triple helix assembly. The above experiments were also performed with a slower temperature slope (10 °C/h), and no obvious differences were found. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed samples has been used for studying the structural organization of collagens and collagen-like mammalian proteins (28Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 32Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Haas C. Voss T. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Lu J. Thiel S. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.B.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2287-2294PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of a rotary shadowed preparation of Scl1 (recombinant P144) revealed a two-domain lollipop-like structure (Fig. 5, A andB), and ∼25% of the molecules appeared to form dimers via head-to-head interactions (Fig. 5, A and C). We hypothesized that the collagen-like region of Scl1 formed the lollipop stalk, whereas the globular head was made of the V region. Two lines of evidence supported our hypothesis. First, the recombinant P157 protein corresponded to the CL region formed rod-shaped particles (Fig.5D) and second, the anti-V specific antibody appeared to bind to the globular heads of Scl1 (Fig. 5E). Scl2 (recombinant P163) also had a two-domain lollipop-like structure (Fig.5F); however, in contrast to Scl1 preparation, Scl2 did not appear to form head-to-head dimers. The measured contour length (279 particles measured) of the collagenous tail in P144 is 45.5 (±4.3) nm. Based on a translation of 0.286 nm per residue observed in a collagen triple helix (35Traub W. Piez K.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1971; 25: 243-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), the 150-residue stretch (50 GXY repeats) in the CL region was calculated to be 43 nm long, which correlated well with the measured length. Rod-shaped particles (n = 190) of similar length 45.6 (±4.4) nm were seen in the P157 preparation, further confirming that the CL region of Scl1 alone formed a triple helix. The shape of the globular domain in P144 was more heterogenous with some molecules appearing spherical and others elongated extending along the axis of the collagenous tail. The diameter of the globular domain (n = 279) measured in the middle of the head perpendicularly to the axis of the tail was 8.9 (±2.2) nm. Considering size overestimation by 2.5 to 5 nm due to metal decoration (32Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a diameter of 3.9–6.4 nm appeared more realistic. The latter estimate was close to the theoretical value of 3.8 nm calculated for a spherically shaped protein with a molecular mass of a trimeric V region using the equation: d = 2(3vMr/4πNA)1/3(30Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), where Mr = 25,072,NA is Avogadro's number, and v= 0.73 cm3/g is the assumed partial specific volume (32Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The dimensions of P163 also agreed with theoretical predictions calculated for the Scl2.28 protein. Specifically, the measured length of the collagenous domain (n = 253) of 66.2 (±8.9) nm correlated well with the calculated value of 67.8 nm. Similarly, a diameter of the globular domain (n = 124) of 7.4 (±0.9) nm agreed with the calculated value of 3.9 nm, considering a metal decoration component. The amino acid sequence of the collagenous domains of Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 was fitted onto the structure of a regular polyGPP triple helix (Fig.6). All steric clashes between the polypeptide backbone and the newly introduced side chains were relieved by energy minimization without significant alteration of the main chain torsion angles. Moreover, the lengths of the Scl1.1CL and Scl2.28CL models, 42.3 and 67.1 nm, respectively, agreed well with the experimentally determined lengths of these regions (see above) providing further evidence supporting the validity of the models. Although the CL regions in Scl1.1 and Scl2.28 are both composed of continuous GXY repeats, they show remarkable primary sequence differences. The five most frequent triplets in Scl1.1 GEK, GPQ, GEA, GET, and GPA, account for 48% of all triplets in this protein but represent only 10% of the triplets in Scl2.28. Similarly, the GKD, GAQ, GPA, GER, and GLP triplets make up 55.9% of the collagen-like segment in Scl2.28 but account for only 16% of the triplets Scl1.1. Fifty GXY motifs of Scl1.1CL contain 21 distinct triplets, seven of which are not found in Scl2.28. Conversely, 12 out of 26 distinct triplets are specific to Scl2.28CL. In addition, those GXY motifs that are common to both Scl proteins are arranged in different orders in Scl1.1CL and Scl2.28CL. Despite the significant sequence variation in the CL region of the two proteins, these could both successfully be modeled on a polyGPP structure. Thus the ability to form a collagen-like triple helix structure is not unique to a particular Scl sequence but may be the property of other prokaryotic proteins containing repeated GXY motifs. In mammalian collagens, post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues at position Y and glycosylation of the polypeptide are considered to be essential for the assembly of a stable triple helix and the formation of collagen networks (1Hulmes D.J.S. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of known analogous modification mechanisms in prokaryotes has prompted a debate regarding whether prokaryotic proteins with extended GXY repeat regions can form stable collagen-like triple helices (11Smith M.C.M. Burns N. Sayer J.R. Sorrel J.A. Casjens S.R. Hendrix R.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies and experiments with synthetic peptides showed that prolines and hydroxyprolines can be substituted with certain amino acid residues in stable triple-helical collagen-like structures. Furthermore, Ruggiero et al. (36Ruggiero F. Exposito J.-Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that human type I collagen expressed in tobacco plants, although virtually unhydroxylated, did form triple helix. In this study, we demonstrate that regions of continuous GXY repeats found in two related proteins of group A Streptococcus do form stable collagen-like triple helices despite the absence of hydroxyproline residues. Several sequence characteristics of Scl1 and Scl2 likely promote and stabilize the triple helix folding of the CL regions of the two proteins. First, the number of continuous GXY repeats is high and often exceeds the number found in collagenous domains of mammalian proteins (37Hakansson K. Reid K.B.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, 30 and 37% of GXY repeats in Scl1.1 and Scl2.28, respectively, contain prolines, primarily at the X position. In collagens, the cyclic ring of prolines stabilizes each collagen chain by steric repulsion (2Ramachandran G.N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The proline residues in Scls may have the same effect. Third, Scl proteins have a high content of charged amino acids (32 and 29.5% in Scl1.1 and Scl2.28, respectively), especially lysine and arginine with long ionizable side chains that can directly interact with residues of a neighboring polypeptide chain (38Yang W.

Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fourth, Scls contain triplets GPR, GER, GPA, GDR, GKD, and GEK known from analyses of synthetic peptides to stabilize a triple helix (13Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Fifth, none of the GXY triplets shown to destabilize the triple helix structure of model synthetic peptides are present in the CL region of the Scl proteins. Sixth, Scls also contain triplets that stabilize the triple helix by formation of alternative hydrogen bonding and hydration patterns (42Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 43Kramer R.Z. Venugopal M.G. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

For example, the GEK triplet, which was proposed to stabilize the triple helix through formation of indirect water-mediated bridges, is the most frequent triplet in Scl1.1CL. In addition, threonines in the Y position of GET and GKT (found in both Scl1 and Scl2) may substitute for hydroxyprolines in the formation of hydrogen bonds. The lollipop-like structure of the recombinant Scl proteins resembles the observed structural organization of mammalian cell surface proteins with collagenous domains (28Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol.

Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We think that native Scl proteins also form lollipop-like structures on the surface of streptococcal cells as do the recombinant polypeptides. At this stage, we have not identified any ligands for the Scl proteins or their subdomains, although it is likely that the Scl proteins interact with molecules in the environment of the streptococci. The structural organization of the Scl proteins seems particularly suited for a ligand binding where the stalk-forming CL region projects the globular V region away from the bacterial surface, facilitating possible interactions between the V regions and their potential targets. The CL regions may themselves interact with various molecules as found with mammalian collagens and proteins with collagenous domains (27Acton S. Resnick D. Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3530-3537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Krieger M. Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions between the CL and V regions may be required in the efficient assembly of the triple helix. Streptococcal cell wall structures that molecularly mimic components of the human body have long been postulated to be a factor in postinfectious autoimmune disease such as rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (50-Google Scholar). In addition, microbial infections are presumed to play a triggering role in several other autoimmune diseases (51Gibofsky A. Kerwar S. Zabriskie J.B. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1998; 24: 237-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, autoimmune diseases are often associated with elevated levels of anti-collagen antibodies present in patients' sera (52Gioud M. Meghlaoui A. Costa O. Monier J.C. Collagen Rel. Res. 1982; 2: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, autoimmune diseases can be induced in experimental animals treated with collagen (53Cremer M.A. Rosloniec E.F. Kang A.H. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The discovery that Scl proteins have structural similarity to collagens and during infection could potentially induce antibodies cross-reacting with host collagens adds another dimension to GAS-induced autoimmunity. These possibilities will be addressed in future studies. In summary, here we show that two bacterial proteins with evolutionarily conserved GXY sequence repeats form structurally conserved triple helices providing the first demonstration of prokaryotic collagen. Our work opens new doors for research employing prokaryotic GXY sequences in function- and structure-related studies. We thank I. Abdi, B. J. Shelvin, and S. F. Tufa for technical assistance.

In this report we show that the CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetyltransferase acetylates β-catenin protein in vivo. β-Catenin is a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is of key importance in development as well as being heavily implicated in a variety of human cancers. We show that the CBP-mediated acetylation of β-catenin occurs at a single site, lysine 49. Importantly, this lysine is frequently found mutated in cancer and is in a region of importance to the regulation of β-catenin. We show that mutation of this site leads specifically to an increase in the ability of β-catenin to activate the c-myc gene but not other β-catenin-regulated genes. This suggests that acetylation of β-catenin is involved in regulating Wnt signaling in a promoter-specific fashion.

This suggests that acetylation of β-catenin is involved in regulating Wnt signaling in a promoter-specific fashion. T-cell factor lymphoid enhancer factor CREB-binding protein glycogen synthase kinase wild type p300/CBP-associated factor The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in numerous developmental processes (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), and its deregulation is implicated in the development of cancer (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Α key component in the Wnt signaling pathway is the β-catenin protein, which is responsible for transducing the Wnt signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it results in the activation of Wnt-responsive genes. β-Catenin was originally identified as a component of cell-cell adhesion complexes, connecting cadherins to the cytoskeleton (3Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a large proportion of β-catenin was shown to be localized to the cell membrane. This pool of β-catenin is thought not to be involved in Wnt signaling. The signaling pool of β-catenin is relatively small and is found free in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it activates transcription by binding and co-activating the TCF/LEF-11 family of transcription factors.One of the key aspects of the regulation of β-catenin is control of its stability, which in turn is thought to regulate its translocation into the nucleus (4Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a target of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway (5Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). When the Wnt signaling pathway is in the “off” state β-catenin is continuously ubiquitinated and degraded. It is the phosphorylation of β-catenin by the GSK3β kinase that targets it for ubiquitination. Phosphorylation occurs at three serines and a threonine residue in the N terminus of β-catenin (6Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and potentiates β-catenin binding to the F-box protein β-TrCP, which is a part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for the ubiquitination of β-catenin (7Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Upon activation of the Wnt pathway GSK3β no longer phosphorylates β-catenin due, at least in part, to the antagonizing function of the disheveled protein.Deregulation of the Wnt pathway occurs in many types of cancer and is caused by mutation of many of the Wnt signaling components (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of β-catenin it has been found that most of the mutations occur in the N terminus at or adjacent to the phosphorylated serine and threonine residues (see Fig. 1). Many of these mutations have been shown to stabilize β-catenin and thus lead to overactivation of the Wnt pathway. This overactivation is thought in part to promote oncogenesis through overexpression of TCF/LEF target genes, such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (8He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar, 9Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar).CBP/p300 are distinct but related members of a protein family that participate in many physiological processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are transcriptional co-activators (11McManus K.J. Hendzel M.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and have an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (12Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 13Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 are thought to activate transcription by relieving chromatin-dependent repression by the acetylation of histones, by acting as a scaffold for recruiting other co-activator proteins (10Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by acting as a bridge to the basal transcription machinery (14Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that β-catenin is co-activated by CBP/p300, but this effect seems to be promoter-dependent (15Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R.

A. 2000; 97: 12613-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Histone acetyltransferases are being recognized increasingly as modifiers of non-histone proteins, and there is a growing body of evidence supporting the theory that acetylation, like phosphorylation, is an important regulatory protein modification (18Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Acetylated proteins include p53 (19Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar), high mobility group I(Y) (20Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and E2F1 (21Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and these acetylation events have been shown to directly affect protein function. For instance, p53 acetylation stimulates the p53 pathway following a cell's exposure to UV radiation (22Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that β-catenin is acetylated by CBP at a lysine that is often found mutated in thyroid cancer. A β-Catenin protein, mutated at this lysine, can no longer be acetylated by CBP. In addition, we find that mutation at this site leads to an increase in the ability of β-catenin to specifically activate the c-myc gene promoter.RESULTSA large proportion of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas contain somatic mutations in the β-catenin gene (26Garcia-Rostan G. Tallini G. Herrero A. D'Aquila T.G. Carcangiu M.L. Rimm D.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1811-1815PubMed Google Scholar), which lead to changes in the primary amino acid sequence of the β-catenin protein (Fig.1). Many of these mutations occur at, or adjacent to, the well characterized regulatory serine and threonine residues in the N terminus. Interestingly, the site with the highest prevalence of mutation, lysine 49 (Lys-49), lies very close to the sites of phosphorylation. Because Lys-49 has no characterized function (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we investigated whether mutation at this residue has physiological relevance. To address this we decided to compare the ability of wild type β-catenin to activate target promoters to a β-catenin mutant containing a single lysine to arginine substitution at position 49 (K49 Mut). The TCF-responsive promoters, TOP-FLASH, cyclin D1, and c-myc (Fig. 2), were used in our analysis. Transient transfection experiments in human 293T cells showed that the K49 Mut has no significant effect upon the ability of β-catenin to activate the TOP-FLASH or cyclin D1 promoter-driven reporter constructs (Fig. 2, A andB). However, in the case of the c-myc promoter β-catenin K49 Mut shows an increased ability to activate this reporter compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that these transient transfection experiments relate to the effect of β-catenin on endogenous genes, we performed reverse transcription-PCRs to determine the relative expression levels of the endogenous c-myc and cyclin D1 genes in cells that had been transiently transfected with the different β-catenin constructs (Fig.2 D). Again we observed that the K49R mutation increased the ability of β-catenin to up-regulate the c-myc gene and not the cyclin D1 gene. We do note that in this experiment WT β-catenin is able to activate the c-myc promoter unlike in the transient transfection experiments. This discrepancy is probably due to differences in either size or chromatin context of the c-mycpromoter in these two experiments. These observations are consistent with the finding that the c-myc oncogene is often found highly expressed in thyroid anaplastic cancer (27Hashimoto T. Matsubara F. Mizukami Y. Miyazaki I. Michigishi T. Yanaihara N. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1990; 37: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Brabant G. Maenhaut C. Kohrle J. Scheumann G. Dralle H. Hoang-Vu C. Hesch R.D. von zur Muhlen A. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: R7-R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and it possibly explains the prevalence of this mutation in this type of carcinoma.Figure 2Comparison of WT β-catenin and β-catenin mutated at Lys-49 transcriptional activation properties on different promoters. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter constructs driven by the TOP-FLASH (A), cyclin D1 (B), or c-myc (C) promoters and co-transfected with either a control plasmid (pCS2+), wild type β-catenin (pCS2+MMBCmycWT) (WT), or β-catenin with lysine 49 mutated to arginine (pCS2+MMBCmycK49R) (K49 MUT). Representative examples of each experiment are shown. Levels of β-catenin were confirmed to be equal by Western blot (data not shown).

One possibility is that Lys-49 is a site of ubiquitination, and its mutation leads to stabilization of β-catenin. However, this seems unlikely as it has previously been shown that Lys-49 is not a major target of the ubiquitination machinery (5Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to focus on other potential modifications of lysine 49. Recently, the human importin-α protein Rch1 was shown to be acetylated by CBP (29Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The importin-α protein has a very similar domain structure to β-catenin (Fig. 3 A). Both proteins contain armadillo repeats at the N terminus; importin-α has a lysine (Lys-22), which is acetylated by CBP. Preceding lysine 22 is a glycine, which is indicative of a CBP-specific motif (Fig. 3 A) (29Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We noted that Lys-49 in β-catenin is also preceded by a glycine, and therefore it was considered as a candidate for acetylation by CBP. To investigate whether β-catenin is acetylated in vivo, endogenous β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells and subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes acetylated lysines. Fig.3 B shows that endogenous β-catenin is indeed acetylated.Figure 3β-Catenin is acetylatedin vivo. A, structural similarities between β-catenin and importin-α. B, β-catenin is acetylated in vivo. Endogenous β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells in IPH buffer using a specific anti-β-catenin antibody. Control immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-Myc antibody. Western blot analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitate using a specific anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Levels of β-catenin in lanes were confirmed by stripping the blot and reprobing with anti-β-catenin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To establish which acetyltransferase is responsible for acetylating β-catenin in vivo, a set of candidate acetyltransferases (CBP, hGCN5, and P/CAF) were co-transfected with Myc-tagged β-catenin into 293T cells. β-catenin was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an anti-acetylated lysine Western blot analysis (Fig.4). When CBP is co-transfected with β-catenin a dramatic increase in the level of acetylation is observed (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, co-transfection of other acetyltransferases caused no appreciable increase in the level of acetylation, indicating that β-catenin is specifically acetylated by CBP. The observation that CBP acetylates β-catenin is consistent with the fact that β-catenin and CBP/p300 interact (15Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4β-Catenin is specifically acetylated by CBP. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a construct expressing β-catenin fused to a Myc tag at the N terminus. Cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing the acetyltransferases P/CAF, CBP, and hGCN5. 36 h after transfection cells were lysed in IPH (12Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar), and β-catenin was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. Western blot analysis of precipitates was carried out using an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. β-Catenin levels were assessed by Western blot and shown to be the same in each lane (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ascertain whether β-catenin is acetylated by CBP at Lys-49, as the presence of the GK motif would suggest, full-length β-catenin with Lys-49 mutated to arginine was expressed recombinantly. As a control, β-catenin with Lys-19 mutated to arginine (K19 Mut) was also expressed. These two mutants, as well as the full-length recombinant wild type protein, were used as substrates in in vitroacetylation reactions (modified from Ref. 12Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated p300/CBP from HeLa nuclear extract was used as a source of CBP/p300 as recombinant CBP and p300 were found to acetylate β-catenin relatively inefficiently in vitro (data not shown). Fig.5 A shows that the β-catenin Lys-49 mutant is not acetylated by CBP/p300 (lane 3), whereas β-catenin mutated at Lys-19 is as good a substrate as WT (lanes 1 and 2). These results demonstrate that β-catenin is acetylated exclusively at Lys-49 by CBP/p300. To ensure that the acetyltransferase activity responsible for the acetylation of β-catenin (in Fig. 5 A) was p300 or CBP (rather than the CBP-associated factor P/CAF) specific inhibitors of CBP/p300 or P/CAF were added to the reactions (30Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolffe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows that β-catenin acetylation is abrogated in the presence of the p300/CBP inhibitor, whereas the P/CAF inhibitor had no effect on the acetylation of β-catenin. This result is consistent with the finding that CBP but not PCAF can acetylate β-catenin in vivo (Fig. 5).Figure 5β-Catenin is acetylated at lysine 49 by CBP in vitro. A, wild type full-length mouse β-catenin (WT), β-catenin with lysine 19 mutated to arginine (K19 Mut), and β-catenin with lysine 49 mutated to arginine (K49 Mut) were expressed as C-terminal His tag fusions. Purified β-catenins were then added to a standard acetylation reaction (12Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) using incubation buffer (20 m m Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing CBP/p300 immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extract (PharMingen 14991A). The products of the reaction were resolved in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to film. β-Catenin levels were shown to be the same by Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose. Lane 3 shows that β-catenin mutated at Lys-49 is not acetylated. B, acetylation reactions were preformed as above using WT β-catenin and a p300/CBP inhibitor (20 μm LysCoA) in lane 2 and a P/CAF inhibitor in lane 3 (20 μm H3-CoA-20)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that residue Lys-49 in β-catenin is the sole target for CBP in vivo, we co-expressed CBP with various β-catenin mutants to determine which mutation prevented CBP acetylation. Fig.6 shows that β-catenin mutated at Lys-49 is severely impaired for acetylation by CBP (lane 3); in contrast, mutation of Lys-19 does not affect the ability of CBP to acetylate β-catenin (lane 2). We conclude that Lys-49 is the major target for in vivo acetylation by CBP. To explore the possibility that phosphorylation by GSKIII may affect the acetylation status of β-catenin we used as a substrate a stabilized β-catenin with the four known GSKIII phosphorylation sites (Ser-33, Ser-37, Ser-45, and Thr-41 (6Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar)) mutated to alanine. CBP acetylated this stabilized form of β-catenin, suggesting that the phosphorylation of β-catenin does not affect the ability of CBP to acetylate Lys-49 (Fig. 6, lane 4).Figure 6A, β-catenin is acetylated by CBP at lysine 49 in vivo. 293T cells were transiently transfected with constructs expressing wild type and mutated β-catenin fused to Myc tags at the N terminus. Mutations within β-catenin are described in Fig. 3 except S Mut, which is β-catenin mutated to alanine at serines 33, 37, and 45 and threonine 41. Cells were co-transfected with a construct expressing CBP. 36 h after transfection cells were lysed in IPH, and β-catenin was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. Western blot analysis of the precipitates was carried out using an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Precipitated levels of β-catenin were then confirmed by stripping the blot and reprobing with anti-β-catenin antibody.Lane 3 shows that β-catenin mutated at lysine 49 is severely impaired for acetylation by CBP in vivo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIt is now apparent that control of the Wnt signaling pathway is far more complex than β-catenin simply shuttling into the nucleus and activating transcription by binding TCF/LEF DNA binding factors. A number of nuclear regulatory mechanisms of the Wnt signaling pathway have been described recently (for review see Hecht and Kemler (31Hecht A. Kemler R.

Another characterized regulator of the Wnt signaling cascade is CBP/p300, and several recent papers have shown that in mammalian systems CBP/p300 interacts with β-catenin and is able to co-activate TCF-responsive genes. This co-activation is promoter-dependent and has been shown to be independent of the acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP (16Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown that β-catenin is acetylated by CBP at lysine 49 and that mutation of this site prevents β-catenin being acetylated. We have also shown that this unacetylatable form of β-catenin is a more potent activator of the c-myc gene but not of other TCF-responsive genes. Taken together, these facts suggest that acetylation of β-catenin may act negatively to regulate transcription. The suggestion that CBP might be repressive has precedent in Drosophila where dCBP is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The mechanism of this repression involves the acetylation of TCF and disruption of the TCF/β-catenin interaction (37Walzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). There are also instances where CBP acts positively to co-activate β-catenin-dependent transcription, but in these cases its histone acetyltransferase activity is not necessary for activation (16Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The identification of a molecular mechanism by which acetylation regulates β-catenin activity remains elusive. We have analyzed the differences between wild type β-catenin and K49 Mut in areas such as protein stability, interaction with members of the Wnt signaling pathway, and nuclear localization (data not shown). No differences were detected in these assays. A greater understanding of how β-catenin mediates promoter-specific effects will help define avenues for future study of this effect.Mutation of Wnt pathway members occurs in a variety of carcinomas. The two genes found most frequently mutated are adenomatous polyposis coli and β-catenin, and these mutations generally lead to an overactivation of the Wnt pathway. This overactivation is thought to promote oncogenesis through derepression and stimulation of TCF/LEF-responsive genes. The K49R mutation in β-catenin represents an example of a mutation that up-regulates specific TCF-responsive genes, namely c-myc. This observation is consistent with the finding that the c-myc oncogene is often found highly expressed in thyroid anaplastic cancer (27Hashimoto T. Matsubara F. Mizukami Y. Miyazaki I. Michigishi T. Yanaihara N. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1990; 37: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Brabant G. Maenhaut C. Kohrle J. Scheumann G. Dralle H. Hoang-Vu C. Hesch R.D. von zur Muhlen A. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: R7-R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover c-myc overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and thyroid cell de-differentiation (41Shi Y. Zou M. Farid N.R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 39: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There is also a positive correlation between the level of c-myc mRNA and histological aggressiveness in thyroid tumors obtained at surgery (42Romano M.I. Grattone M. Karner M.P. Moiguer S. Tetelbaum F. Romano L.A. Illescas E. Padin R. Cueva F. Burdman J.A. Horm. Res. 1993; 39: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The block of c-myc protein synthesis with Myc-specific antisense oligonucleotides reduces the growth rate of the thyroid carcinoma cell lines significantly, which indicates that c-myc overexpression plays a critical role in the growth of thyroid cancer cells. Thus our observation that the β-catenin K49R mutation induces c-myc expression fits well with it being the most commonly mutated residue in thyroid anaplastic carcinoma. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in numerous developmental processes (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), and its deregulation is implicated in the development of cancer (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Α key component in the Wnt signaling pathway is the β-catenin protein, which is responsible for transducing the Wnt signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it results in the activation of Wnt-responsive genes. β-Catenin was originally identified as a component of cell-cell adhesion complexes, connecting cadherins to the cytoskeleton (3Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a large proportion of β-catenin was shown to be localized to the cell membrane. This pool of β-catenin is thought not to be involved in Wnt signaling. The signaling pool of β-catenin is relatively small and is found free in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it activates transcription by binding and co-activating the TCF/LEF-11 family of transcription factors. One of the key aspects of the regulation of β-catenin is control of its stability, which in turn is thought to regulate its translocation into the nucleus (4Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a target of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway (5Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). When the Wnt signaling pathway is in the “off” state β-catenin is continuously ubiquitinated and degraded. It is the phosphorylation of β-catenin by the GSK3β kinase that targets it for ubiquitination. Phosphorylation occurs at three serines and a threonine residue in the N terminus of β-catenin (6Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and potentiates β-catenin binding to the F-box protein β-TrCP, which is a part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for the ubiquitination of β-catenin (7Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Upon activation of the Wnt pathway GSK3β no longer phosphorylates β-catenin due, at least in part, to the antagonizing function of the disheveled protein.

P. falciparum infects both humans and mosquitoes during its life cycle, with the pathogenic part of this cycle occurring predominantly in the erythrocytes of humans. The discovery of a non-photosynthetic plastid (the apicoplast) in the Apicomplexa has opened up a new area of anti-malarial drug targets (2McFadden G.I. Roos D.S.

Update. 2001; 4: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the rational development of drugs targeting the apicoplast requires knowledge of apicoplast function. Preliminary studies indicate that the apicoplast is a site of fatty acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis (4Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.K. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F.

Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Like plant plastids, the apicoplast contains a reduced bacterial-like genome (8Wilson R.J.M. Denny P.W. Preiser P.R. Rangachari K. Roberts K. Roy A. Whyte A. Strath M. Moore D.J. Moore P.W. Williamson D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), from which a small number of proteins are expressed. The great majority of apicoplast proteins, as in plant plastids, are encoded in the nucleus and must be post-translationally targeted to the plastid. In plants, nuclear-encoded plastid proteins require a cleavable, N-terminal sequence called the transit peptide, which directs these proteins across the two membranes surrounding plant plastids (for reviews, see Refs. 9Soll J. Tien R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 191-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Bruce B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Once in the plastid stroma, this transit peptide is cleaved by a stromal-processing peptidase (SPP1; Refs. 11Schmidt G. Devillers-Thiery A. Desruisseaux H. Blobel G. Chua N.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 12Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Apicoplasts, however, are bound by four membranes (Ref. 2McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 6: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar, but see Ref.13Hopkins J. Fowler R. Krishna S. Wilson I. Mitchell G. Bannister L. Protist. 1999; 150: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and proteins targeted to this organelle have been shown to require a bipartite N-terminal leader sequence (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 14DeRocher A. Hagen C.B. Froehlich J.E. Feagin J.E. Parsons M. J.

By fusing these N-terminal leader sequences to green fluorescent reporter protein (GFP), Waller et al. (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) show that the first part of this leader functions as a signal peptide, directing proteins to the secretory pathway. The second part of the leader is necessary to direct these proteins away from the default secretory pathway and into the apicoplast (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Indeed, this second region has several similarities to the transit peptides of plants, and the transit peptide-like region of an apicoplast-targeted protein from the related speciesToxoplasma gondii is sufficient to target proteins into isolated pea chloroplasts (14DeRocher A. Hagen C.B. Froehlich J.E. Feagin J.E. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3969-3977PubMed Google Scholar).In a Western blot analysis of these apicoplast-targeted proteins, Waller et al. (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) found a prominent band whose size corresponded to that of the mature protein as well as a less abundant band slightly greater in size. In this paper, we perform a pulse-chase experiment to demonstrate that this larger band represents the apicoplast-targeted protein before cleavage of the transit peptide-like region has occurred. We then identify the site of transit peptide cleavage by N-terminal sequencing of the processed protein. Finally, we identify a putative SPP homologue in P. falciparum, which we propose is responsible for this cleavage. Interestingly, this gene shares, through alternative splicing, a putative N-terminal apicoplast-targeting sequence with a Δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD; also known as porphobilinogen synthase; EC 4.2.1.24) homologue, a protein that functions in heme biosynthesis. The evolution of this alternative splicing is considered.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes processing of the leader sequence of an apicoplast-targeted protein in P. falciparum and presents a candidate for the enzyme that performs this cleavage reaction. Together, the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 1) and the N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 2) provide direct evidence that transit peptide regions of apicoplast-targeted proteins are post-translationally removed. The pulse-chase experiment also provides information about the kinetics of the import process. The time taken for the unprocessed band to disappear over the chase corresponds to the time it takes for proteins to transport from the ER into the apicoplast, where the cleavage presumably takes place. Because a small amount of processed protein was already visible after the 45-min pulse (Fig. 1), we can infer that the minimum time from synthesis to cleavage is less than 45 min. We attempted to determine the minimum time for processing, but shorter pulses did not provide enough labeling to visualize the proteins. Nevertheless, the relative amounts of precursorversus processed protein at the various chase intervals suggests that the minimum time required for apicoplast targeting is probably around 30–40 min. The ACP leader-GFP fusion protein is under the direction of the calmodulin promoter, a promoter that is likely expressed at high levels (39Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In our estimate of processing time, we are assuming that the ACP leader-GFP fusion protein is not expressed at levels where it interferes with the apicoplast import machinery, for instance by saturating apicoplast membrane receptors or the cleavage enzyme (PfSPP). Clearly, analyzing the processing of a native protein rather than an introduced one would address this confounding variable. Attempts to purify native ACP using an anti-ACP antibody produced by Waller et al. (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful.Assuming this limitation has a minimal effect on the kinetics of apicoplast targeting, how does an apicoplast import time of about 40 min compare with plastid targeting in other organisms? Evidence suggests that less than 10 min is required for plastid targeting in plants and green algae (40Schmidt R. Gillham N. Boynton J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas around 40 min is required inEuglena gracilis (41Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 45-53Google Scholar). Like apicoplasts, the plastids ofE. gracilis are derived by secondary endosymbiosis, and nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are targeted via the secretory pathway (41Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 45-53Google Scholar). The greater time it takes for the proteins of these secondarily derived plastids to arrive at their destination compared with plant plastid proteins could, thus, be explained by their trafficking via the somewhat more circuitous secretory pathway.Cheresh et al. (42Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) recently described similar analyses of an ACP leader-GFP fusion protein, where pulse label and chase also confirmed that the putative transit peptide-bearing precursor was converted to a processed form. Whereas our ACP leader-GFP fusion protein is under direction of the calmodulin promoter (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and is maximally expressed at trophozoite and schizont stages of the erythrocyte life cycle (43Orfa Rojas M. Wasserman M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Cheresh et al. (42Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) utilized the histidine-rich protein promoter to drive ACP leader-GFP fusion protein, which results in maximal expression early on (ring stage) in the intraerythrocytic life cycle. Somewhat unexpectedly, Chereshet al. (42Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were able to immunoprecipitate significant amounts of pre-processed protein from outside the parasite (i.e. in the supernatant of the saponin lysis). They interpreted this to mean that proteins are targeted to the apicoplast via the parasitophorous vacuole, a compartment that surrounds the outside of the parasite but is still within the host erythrocyte (see review in Ref. 44Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar). We did not attempt to recover ACP leader-GFP fusion protein from the parasitophorous vacuole in our experiments because light microscopic analysis of our parasites has never indicated that GFP is targeted to this compartment. It is possible that the targeting of ACP leader-GFP fusion protein to the parasitophorous vacuole observed by Cheresh et al. (42Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is an artifact, with the apicoplast import apparatus not sufficiently well established at ring stage to cope with overexpressed apicoplast-targeted GFP, resulting in the protein exiting the cell via the default secretory pathway. No information about expression of apicoplast-targeted proteins through the erythrocyte stages is yet available, so it is unclear which promoters are suitable when studying apicoplast targeting in transgenic systems. Clearly it will be necessary to track a native apicoplast-targeted protein through the endomembrane system ofPlasmodium to resolve the exact route. Our laboratory is currently investigating the role the parasitophorous vacuole may play in apicoplast targeting.N-terminal sequencing of the processed reporter identified the cleavage motif QVNF↓LNRKN (where ↓ represents the point of cleavage). This indicates that the transit peptide domain of P. falciparumACP is 24 amino acids, consistent with Western blot analyses (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Because the fusion protein was designed to contain several amino acids that were almost certainly part of the mature ACP (5Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), the “context” of the cleavage site should have been maintained, so we believe the cleavage is faithful to the native processing. Clearly, though, it would be desirable to purify and sequence native proteins. A loosely defined cleavage motif has been identified for plant transit peptides (45Gaval Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This plant motif of (isoleucine/valine)-X-(alanine/cysteine)↓alanine (where ↓ represents the cleavage site) is clearly different from theP. falciparum ACP site (Fig. 2), suggesting such a motif is not relevant for apicoplast proteins. A more valid comparison may be to organisms whose plastid is more closely related to the apicoplast. Proteins targeted to the plastids of several other phyla require a bipartite leader similar to that of P. falciparum (see review in Ref. 46van Dooren G.G. Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. McFadden G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and evidence suggests that the apicoplast shares a common secondary endosymbiotic origin with many of these (47Zhang Z. Green B. Cavalier-Smith T. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 26-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Fast N.M. Kissinger J. Roos D. Keeling P. Mol. Biol.

The cleavage sites of a few heterokont (brown algal and diatom) and cryptomonad proteins have been identified or predicted (49Liaud M.-F. Brandt U. Scherzinger M. Cerff R. J. Mol.

Fraunholz M., Su, V. Maier U.-G. Martin W. Durnford D. McFadden G. Protist. 2000; 151: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with many containing a methionine residue in the –1 position (50Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 51Deane J. Fraunholz M., Su, V. Maier U.-G. Martin W. Durnford D. McFadden G. Protist. 2000; 151: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cleavage site of one other putative apicoplast-targeted protein, the fatty acid biosynthesis protein FabI, has been determined in P. falciparum. This protein has a methionine in the –1 position (7Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), thus conforming to the “methionine at –1” rule of other secondary endosymbionts. However, given that the ACP cleavage site lacks a methionine in this position, not all apicoplast transit peptide cleavage sites conform to this motif.Fig. 3 is, to our knowledge, the first phylogenetic tree of the pitrilysin family. The mitochondrial-processing peptidases form a clade within the pitrilysin family, with the α- and β-MPP subunits forming groups within this clade. Another subfamily seems to be represented by a clade that includes human insulysin, rat nardilysin,Eimeria SDP, and E. coli pitrilysin. The tree includes four pitrilysins from P. falciparum, two of which branch with the α- and β-MPP subunits. The food vacuole protein falcilysin (30Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) seems quite distinct from other members of the group represented on the tree. The remaining P. falciparumpitrilysin branches with plant SPPs, which together form a distinct SPP clade within the family. Indeed, the presence of a putative apicoplast-targeting leader at its N terminus suggests that PfSPP is targeted to the apicoplast. Analysis of the preliminary sequence data from a range of Apicomplexa indicates that this SPP homologue is widespread throughout the group. These putative apicomplexan SPPs are the first non-plant SPPs that have been identified. Although pitrilysin proteins probably have similar catalytic mechanisms (28Becker A. Roth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the substrates they bind to and cleave are very diverse, ranging from plastid and mitochondrial-targeting peptides, to insulin and hemoglobin fragments. An alignment of PfSPP with other pitrilysins revealed that PfSPP shares most of the conserved residues around the active site (Fig. 4). Given that homology in the group exists around the catalytic site, it might be assumed that regions where the pitrilysins do not match are important in substrate recognition. PfSPP is quite divergent to plant SPPs in these other regions. This may reflect the difference in P. falciparum transit peptides (rich in asparagine and basic residues) compared with plant transit peptides (rich in hydroxylated and basic residues) that must be recognized by their respective SPPs. Our laboratory is currently attempting to determine whether PfSPP actually functions in recognizing and cleaving apicoplast transit peptides.The Apicomplexa obtained their plastids by secondary endosymbiosis (for review, see Ref. 46van Dooren G.G. Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. McFadden G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A feature of secondary endosymbioses is that a large proportion of the genes from the nucleus of the endosymbiont are transferred to the host cell nucleus (for review, see Ref. 52McFadden G.I. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), with the genes required for plastid function targeted back to the plastid. An unexpected finding during this study was that PfSPP shares its two 5′ exons (E1 and E2 in Fig. 5), essentially its predicted apicoplast-targeting leader sequence, with a homologue of the heme biosynthesis enzyme ALAD. To our knowledge, this is the first time two plastid-targeted proteins have been shown to share a predicted plastid-targeting leader. One other example of proteins sharing a leader is known. In rice and maize, the iron-sulfur subunit of succinate dehydrogenase and the ribosomal protein S14 (rps14) share a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (53Kubo N. Harada K. Hirai A. Kadowaki K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9207-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 54Figueroa P. Holuigue L. Araya A. Jordana X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In rice, a non-functional copy of rps14 is present in the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondria, like plastids, arose via an endosymbiotic process, with much of the genetic material of the symbiont transferred to the nucleus of the host (55Henze K. Martin W. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is believed that rice rps14 is an example of how this transfer might occur. The transferred gene inserts into the nuclear genome near a protein already containing a mitochondrial-targeting sequence and uses this existing targeting sequence to get the gene product back into the organelle (53Kubo N. Harada K. Hirai A. Kadowaki K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9207-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 55Henze K. Martin W. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Alternative splicing enables PfSPP and PfALAD to share an N-terminal, organelle-targeting leader. This raises the intriguing possibility that one of the two proteins transferred from the endosymbiont nucleus (or perhaps even from the plastid genome) and inserted itself behind an already existing apicoplast leader sequence in the nuclear genome. In the case of PfALAD, this would mean inserting within PfSPP, directly behind the leader, and for PfSPP this would mean inserting behind PfALAD (Fig. 5). With the genomes of several Apicomplexa currently being sequenced, it may be possible in the near future to chart how this situation may have evolved. It is interesting to note thatP. yoelii has an ALAD homologue inserted within its SPP, whereas this in not the case for the SPP homologue of the more distantly related apicomplexan T. parva.Regardless of whether they transferred from the symbiont nucleus, the plastid genome or from another point within the host cell genome, at some point either PfALAD or PfSPP became associated with the leader sequence of the other. But simply inserting within or behind an existing apicoplast-targeted gene is not in itself sufficient for the protein to become targeted to the apicoplast. First, the transferred gene needs to be spliced in a way for it to be functionally expressed as a protein with a leader. How, then, does this splicing occur?A Northern blot indicates that the PfALAD transcript is smaller than the PfSPP transcript (Fig. 6). This is a somewhat unexpected result, since we might expect the PfALAD transcript to be larger in size than the PfSPP transcript, given that the PfSPP transcript would have the four PfALAD exons spliced out as an intron, whereas this is not the case for PfALAD. This result is best explained by the PfALAD transcript containing a different polyadenylation site to PfSPP (Fig. 5). Numerous examples are known where alternatively spliced proteins have different polyadenylation sites (for review, see Refs. 56Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar and 57Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many of these examples, the proximal (i.e. first) polyadenylation site can be regulated. This suggests that the proximal polyadenylation site at the PfSPP/PfALAD locus may be subject to regulation, with transcripts containing the proximal poly(A) site spliced to form PfALAD mRNA and transcripts containing the distal poly(A) site spliced to form PfSPP mRNA. Upon prolonged exposure of the northern blots in Fig. 6, a weak band, larger in size than the SPP band, appears on membranes incubated in both SPP and ALAD specific probes (not shown). It is possible that this band represents transcripts cleaved at the distal polyadenylation site, but where the ALAD-specific exons and introns have not been spliced out. It would be interesting to determine whether such transcripts are functional in translation or whether they represent a primary transcript (i.e. heterogeneous nuclear RNA) or indeed whether they are non-functional transcripts formed from leaky regulation at the proximal polyadenylation site.ALAD catalyzes the second step of the heme biosynthesis pathway, forming porphobilinogen from two molecules of Δ-aminolevulinic acid. Recent experiments have suggested that the majority of ALAD activity inPlasmodium spp. is derived from enzymes imported from the host erythrocyte (58Bonday Z.Q. Taketani S. Gupta P.D. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21839-21846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 59Bonday Z.Q. Dhanasekaran S. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The northern results presented here suggest that PfALAD is actively transcribed during the intraerythrocytic stage of the life cycle of P. falciparum. A recent paper, furthermore, found that PfALAD rescues an E. coli ALAD null mutant (38Sato S. Wilson R.J.M. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting the enzyme is functional in heme biosynthesis. This raises interesting questions about the role PfALAD may play in the intraerythocytic cycle. The presence of an apicoplast-targeting leader strongly suggests that PfALAD localizes to the apicoplast. Plant ALAD proteins are similarly targeted to the plastid (37Smith A.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and PfALAD appears to have a Mg2+ binding domain unique to plant ALADs (36Sato S. Tews I. Wilson R.J.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In plants, Δ-aminolevulinic acid is formed via the so-called 5-carbon pathway (for review, see Ref. 60Kumar A.M. Schaub U. Soll D. Ujwal M.L. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It is curious, however, that Δ-aminolevulinic acid in Plasmodium spp. is formed via the so-called 4-carbon pathway, a single step reaction catalyzed by Δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (61Wilson C.M. Smith A.B. Baylon R.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 62Srivastava P. Pandey V.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), an enzyme not found in plants (review in (60Kumar A.M. Schaub U. Soll D. Ujwal M.L. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar)). In other organisms, Δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase is located in the mitochondrion (63Yamauchi K. Hayashi N. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1746-1751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears then that enzymes that potentially function in de novo heme synthesis in Plasmodium spp. occur in up to three separate compartments. How the parasite coordinates heme biosynthesis and how such a composite and seemingly complex system evolved is an area that warrants further study. Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria, belong to a family of intracellular parasites called the Apicomplexa.Plasmodium infects approximately 300 million people annually, causing over 1 million deaths, the great majority of which are caused by one species, Plasmodium falciparum(1World Health Organization The World Health Report 1999.

https://openalex.org/W2095911028,"Selenoproteins that contain the rare amino acid selenocysteine in their primary structure have been identified in diverse organisms such as viruses, bacteria, archea, and mammals, but so far not in yeast or plants. Among the most thoroughly investigated families of selenoenzymes are the animal glutathione peroxidases (GPXs). In the last few years, genes encoding GPX-like homologues from Chlamydomonas and higher plants have been isolated, but, unlike the animal ones, all of them have cysteine (rather than selenocysteine) residues in their catalytic site. In all organisms investigated that contain selenoproteins, selenocysteine is encoded by a UGA opal codon, which is usually a stop codon. We report here that, in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the cDNA-cloned sequence of a GPX homologue contains an internal TGA codon in frame to the ATG. Specific mRNA expression, protein production, and enzyme activity are selenium-dependent. Sequence analysis of the peptides produced by proteolytic digestion, performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), confirmed the presence of a selenocysteine residue at the predicted site and suggest its location in the mitochondria. Thus, our data present the first direct proof that a UGA opal codon is decoded in the plant kingdom to incorporate selenocysteine."
https://openalex.org/W2316221732,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) regulate transcription of interferon genes through DNA sequence-specific binding to these targets. Using a differential display method for examining gene expression in p53-defective cells infected with adenovirus containing wild-type p53, we found that expression of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5) mRNA was increased in the presence of exogenous p53. An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay showed that a potential p53 binding site (p53BS) detected in exon 2 of the IRF-5 gene could in fact bind to p53 protein. Moreover, a heterologous reporter assay revealed that the p53BS possessed p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Expression of IRF-5 was induced in p53+/+ cells (MCF7 and NHDF), but not inp53-/- cells (H1299) when DNA was damaged by gamma-irradiation, UV-radiation, or adriamycin treatment in a wild-type p53-dependent manner. These results suggest that IRF-5 is a novel p53-target, and that it might mediate the p53-dependent immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2059798203,"Five amphipathic peptides with antimicrobial, hemolytic, and insecticidal activity were isolated from the crude venom of the wolf spider Oxyopes kitabensis. The peptides, named oxyopinins, are the largest linear cationic amphipathic peptides from the venom of a spider that have been chemically characterized at present. According to their primary structure Oxyopinin 1 is composed of 48 amino acid residues showing extended sequence similarity to the ant insecticidal peptide ponericinL2 and to the frog antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin. Oxyopinins 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d have highly similar sequences. At least 27 out of 37 amino acid residues are conserved. They also show a segment of sequence similar to ponericinL2. Circular dichroism analyses showed that the secondary structure of the five peptides is essentially α-helical. Oxyopinins showed disrupting activities toward both biological membranes and artificial vesicles, particularly to those rich in phosphatidylcholine. Electrophysiological recordings performed on insect cells (Sf9) showed that the oxyopinins produce a drastic reduction of cell membrane resistance by opening non-selective ion channels. Additionally, a new paralytic neurotoxin named Oxytoxin 1 was purified from the same spider venom. It contains 69 amino acid residue cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. Application of mixtures containing oxyopinins and Oxytoxin 1 to insect larvae showed a potentiation phenomenon, by which an increase lethality effect is observed. These results suggest that the linear amphipathic peptides in spider venoms and neuropeptides cooperate to capture insects efficiently."

Animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) have been cloned and characterized from many sources, but no plant P4H has been cloned so far. We report here that the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes six P4H-like polypeptides, one of which, a 283-residue soluble monomer, was cloned and characterized here as a recombinant protein. Catalytically critical residues identified in animal P4Hs are conserved in this P4H, and their mutagenesis led to complete or almost complete inactivation.

PCR primers 5′-GCGGGATCCCTCCTTGTTACAATTGGCCTTTA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAAGAAGTAGCTTTTTGCCTCAT-3′ were synthesized based on the gene encoding the polypeptide AAC64297 (named here At-P4H-1) and used to obtain a 783-base pair PCR product from a whole plant A. thaliana cDNA library (Stratagene). The PCR template was prepared by incubating 2 μl of the cDNA library in a 200-μl final volume in 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 55 °C for 45 min, followed by 10 min at 95 °C, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and 10 μl of the prepared template was used in a 50-μl PCR reaction. Hot-start PCR with preincubation for 5 min at 94 °C and 2 min at 72 °C before the addition of 2 μl of Pfupolymerase (Promega) was used, after which 30 PCR cycles were performed as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 2 min at 65 °C, and extension for 3 min at 72 °C. To increase the amount of the obtained PCR product, a second PCR reaction was performed with 10 μl of 1:50 diluted first PCR reaction product as the template. The PCR cycles were as above, with the exception that the annealing temperature was 58 °C. The obtained PCR fragment coding for residues Ser23–Ser283 of At-P4H-1 had BamHI restriction sites at both ends (underlined in the primer sequences) and one cytosine before the codon for Ser23, and it was cloned into a BamHI-digested baculovirus vector pACGP67-A (Invitrogen). The sequences were verified on an automated DNA sequencer (Abi Prism 377, Applied Biosystems). The recombinant vector was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were amplified (31Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System; Instruction Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Sf9 or High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate or 1 × 106/ml and infected at a multiplicity of 5 with the virus coding for the At-P4H-1. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02m phosphate, pH 7.4, and homogenized in a 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% or 1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, or in a 50% glycerol, 0.6 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m glycine, 100 μm DTT, and 0.06m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS, and aliquots of all soluble fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. PCR primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCCTTGTTACAATTGGCCTTTAT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAAGAAGTAGCTTTTTGCCTCAT-3′ were used to amplify the At-P4H-1 cDNA without the signal sequence and with flankingNdeI and BamHI sites as above, and the product was cloned into a NdeI-BamHI-digested expression vector pET15b (Novagen). The expression plasmid was transformed into the E. coliBL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 3 h after induction, suspended in 0.1 volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with or without 0.1% Triton X-100, sonicated, centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble and insoluble fractions analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Histidines 180 and 260 in the At-P4H-1 were converted individually to glutamate (codon GAA) and alanine (GCT), Asp182 to alanine (GCT) and glutamate (GAA), Lys270 to arginine (AGG) and alanine (GCG), Ser272 to alanine (GCT), and Arg278 to alanine (GCG) and histidine (CAC). The mutagenesis reactions were performed in the pET15b vector containing the full-length At-P4H-1 cDNA using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the primers with flanking BamHI sites (above), and the products were digested with BamHI and cloned into BamHI-digested pACGP67-A. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated and used to infect insect cells as above. P4H activity was assayed at 30 °C by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (32Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Poly(l-proline) was purchased from Sigma, whereas all the other synthetic peptides were from Innovagen. All the peptides except poly(l-proline) and those representing HIFα sequences were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 10 min, followed by rapid cooling before addition to the enzyme reaction mixture. In some experiments the amount of 4-hydroxyproline formed was determined by a colorimetric method in samples hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl at 120 °C overnight (33Kivirikko K.I. Laitinen O. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), and in others the partially hydroxylated (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 peptide was purified from the reaction mixture with HiTrap Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and reverse phase HPLC, hydrolyzed by the manual gas-phase hydrolysis method, and analyzed in an Applied Biosystems 421A amino acid analyzer. N-terminal sequencing of the purified (Pro-Pro-Gly)10peptide was performed in an Applied Biosystems 492 ProciseTM protein sequencer. Typically, approximately one third of the amount of proline and 4-hydroxyproline present in each sequencing cycle was carried over to the next cycle. The values obtained were corrected for this carry over, but they were not corrected for a significant background level, as this could not be quantitated accurately. K m values were determined as described previously (34Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the recombinant At-P4H-1 was analyzed by gel filtration in a calibrated HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). A sequence homology search indicated that theA. thaliana genome contains six open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 280–332 residues (Fig.1) that show an identity of 21–27% to the catalytically important C-terminal regions of the human P4H α(I) and α(II) subunits (6Annunen P.

The six polypeptides are 33–81% identical to each other (Fig. 1). The two histidines and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom at the catalytic site (34Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate in all collagen P4Hs (34Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are all conserved in the A. thalianasequences (Fig. 1). The fifth critical residue, a histidine that is probably involved in the binding of the C-1 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ atom and the decarboxylation of this cosubstrate (34Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), is conserved in five of the sequences, but is replaced by an arginine in the AAC64297 polypeptide. This position is also occupied by an arginine in a Drosophila P4H α subunit (12Annunen P. Koivunen P. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6790-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in the PBCV-1 viral P4H (26Eriksson M. Myllyharju J., Tu, H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that all six A. thaliana polypeptides are P4Hs. However, like the PBCV-1 enzyme, these polypeptides show no similarity to the peptide substrate binding domain that is located between residues 140 and 240 in the animal P4H α subunits (36Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A noncleavable signal peptide was predicted in the AAC64297 polypeptide and cleavable ones in the AAF88161, NP_197391 and AAF08583 polypeptides, whereas no signal peptide was present in AAB80790 and BAB02864 (Fig. 1). The sequence identity of the 283-amino acid polypeptide AAC64297 to the human α(I) and α(II) subunits was highest, 25 and 27%, respectively. The cDNA encoding this polypeptide, named At-P4H-1, was cloned and recombinantly expressed. At-P4H-1 has four cysteine residues, the first being conserved in all six A. thaliana P4H-like polypeptides and the fourth, in position +3 with respect to the second Fe2+-binding histidine, also being conserved in the human P4H α subunits. Two of the cysteines are not conserved in the six A. thalianapolypeptides and are present in a region that has no homologous counterpart in the PBCV-1 P4H or the human α subunits (Fig. 1). At-P4H-1 has no potential N-glycosylation sites, whereas the other A. thaliana P4H-like polypeptides have one to four such sites. A cDNA encoding At-P4H-1 residues Ser23–Ser283 was synthesized by PCR, cloned into the baculovirus vector pACGP67-A in frame with the GP67 signal sequence, and used to generate a recombinant virus. The cells infected with this virus were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The remaining pellet was further solubilized in 1% SDS, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.2). Very little of the recombinant 29-kDa polypeptide was extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2, lane 1), whereas most of it remained in the insoluble fraction and could be extracted with 1% SDS (Fig. 2, lane 4). Therefore, various means of extracting the polypeptide more efficiently were tested, including sonication, the use of buffers with high salt concentrations, various detergents, and low concentrations of urea (details not shown). A buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 slightly improved the solubility (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas a solution consisting of 50% glycerol, 0.6 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m glycine, 100 μm DTT, and 0.06m Tris, pH 7.8 (37Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was found to be the best solubilizing method among those tested (Fig. 2, lane 3), although even this solubilized only approximately 10% of the enzyme. A cDNA encoding At-P4H-1 residues Ser23–Ser283 was also cloned into the pET15bE. coli expression vector with an N-terminal histidine tag. The recombinant polypeptide expressed in E. coli remained insoluble, however, and accumulated into inclusion bodies (data not shown). To study whether the recombinantA. thaliana polypeptide expressed in insect cells had any P4H activity, 50 μl of the soluble fraction of the cell homogenate was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (32Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When 0.1 mg/ml poly(l-proline) (M r 5,000) was used as the peptide substrate, a significant amount of P4H activity was observed even in the sample homogenized in the buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (typically approximately 7000 cpm over various background values of approximately 200–300 cpm), although the recombinant enzyme could not be readily detected in the soluble fraction when analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 1). A further increase in the amount of activity was observed when the polypeptide was solubilized more efficiently, the activity levels ranging up to more than 30,000 cpm (an example is shown in Table II). Gel filtration experiments in a calibrated HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 HR column showed that enzyme activity was eluted in fractions that corresponded to a molecular weight of approximately 30,000 (details not shown). As the calculated molecular weight of the recombinant At-P4H-1 without the signal peptide is 29,252, the recombinant At-P4H-1 is a monomer.Table IIP4H activities of soluble extracts of insect cells expressing wild-type and mutant At-P4H-1 polypeptidesRecombinant enzyme2-aMutant enzymes are indicated by the numbers of the At-P4H-1 residues converted.P4H activitycpm/50 μl%At-P4H-131,500100His180 → Ala<100<1His180 → Glu<100<1Asp182 → Ala<100<1Asp182 → Glu<100<1His260 → Ala<100<1His260 → Glu<100<1Lys270 → Ala<100<1Lys270 → Arg<100<1Ser272 → Ala540017Arg278 → Ala<100<1Arg278 → His810026P4H activity values are given in cpm/50 μl of extractable cell protein with 0.1 mg/ml poly(l-proline),M r 5,000, as a substrate.2-a Mutant enzymes are indicated by the numbers of the At-P4H-1 residues converted.

As expected, the A. thaliana P4H required Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (details not shown). TheK m for Fe2+ (TableI) was close to the values reported for partially purified P4Hs from the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri (21Kaska D.D. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.

https://openalex.org/W2070792289,"MADS-box proteins are transcription factors present in different eukaryotic kingdoms. In contrast to plants, for mammalian and yeast MADS-box proteins ternary complex formation with unrelated transcription factors was reported. We show here the first identification of such ternary interaction in plants. A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening. NF-YB contains a histone fold motif, HFM,1 and is part of the trimeric CCAAT-binding NF-Y complex. OsMADS18, alone or in combination with a natural partner, interacts with OsNF-YB1 through the MADS and I regions. The mouse NF-YB also associates with OsMADS18in vivo and in vitro as a NF-YB-NF-YC dimer. Other rice MADS-box proteins do not interact in these assays, indicating specificity for the interaction. OsNF-YB1 is capable of heterodimerizing with NF-YC, but not trimerizing with NF-YA, thus precluding CCAAT binding. Mutation of the variant Asp at position 99 of the HFM α2-helix into a conserved serine recovers the capacity to interact with NF-YA, but not with DNA. This is the first indication that members of the NF-YB family work through mechanisms independent of the CCAAT box.

Plant J. 1991; 1: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The K and I are both involved in MADS-box protein dimer formation (19Davies B. Egea-Cortines M. de Andrade Silva E. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4330-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Krizek B.A. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MADS-box proteins bind in vitro to a CArG box (23Riechmann J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1079-1101Google Scholar). This conservation in the binding sites does not reflect the specific functions that different MADS-box factors seem to havein vivo. The specific regulation of target genes will be dependent on the interactions MADS-box proteins make to form homo- or heterodimers and on the interactions these dimers make with ternary proteins. Using the two-hybrid system, it was shown that theAntirrhinum MADS-box proteins DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO) exclusively interact with each other (19Davies B. Egea-Cortines M. de Andrade Silva E. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4330-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the contrary, theAntirrhinum PLENA (PLE) and Arabidopsis AGAMOUS (AG) proteins, both necessary for reproductive organ development, interact with several other MADS-box proteins (19Davies B. Egea-Cortines M. de Andrade Silva E. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4330-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Fan H.Y., Hu, Y. Tudor M. Ma H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interactions between the different MADS-box transcription factors is undoubtedly one of the mechanisms to enhance the selectivity for target gene activation. In addition, ternary complex formation between the Antirrhinum MADS-box proteins SQUAMOSA (SQUA), DEF, and GLO has been described: the DEF-GLO heterodimer is able to form a ternary complex with the SQUA homodimer via the C termini (24Egea-Cortines M. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A putative target promoter of DEF and GLO, containing two adjacent CArG boxes, showed that the ternary complex binds much stronger than the separate hetero- or homodimers. Despite this wealth of information, ternary complex formation between MADS-box proteins and unrelated polypeptides has not been described in plants. On the other hand the human MADS-box protein SRF, which activates numerous growth factor-inducible genes such as c-fos (for review, see Ref. 25Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), binds as a homodimer to the serum response element and interacts with the ternary complex factors ELK-1 and SAP-1 (26Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 27Ling Y. West A.G. Roberts E.C. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10506-10514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ternary complex factors make additional contacts with DNA at an ETS motif, which is two base pairs 5′ of the serum response element. Autonomous binding of ELK-1 and SAP-1 to the DNA is possible, however, with restricted sequence specificity compared with the ternary complex. Another transcription factor that is particularly abundant in plants is NF-Y, which interacts with high affinity and selectivity with the CCAAT box, one of the most widespread elements, present in 25% of eukaryotic promoters (28Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). NF-Y is a trimeric complex composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC; NF-YB and NF-YC form a tight dimer through a histone fold motif, HFM, that offers a complex surface for NF-YA association (for review, see Refs. 29Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar and 30Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In mammals and yeast only one gene for each subunit exists. A recent survey of transcription factors, made possible by the completion of the Arabidopsisgenome sequencing project, revealed that 10 genes each for AtNF-YA, AtNF-YB, and AtNF-YC exist (31Riechmann J.L. Heard J. Martin G. Reuber L. Jiang C. Keddie J. Adam L. Pineda O. Ratcliffe O.J. Samaha R.R. Creelman R. Pilgrim M. Broun P. Zhang J.Z. Ghandehari D. Sherman B.K. Yu G. Science. 2000; 290: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar), with hundreds of heterotrimeric combinations possible. We have cloned all of these genes and determined that some members of each subunit are expressed in a tissue-specific way, while others are ubiquitous (32Gusmaroli G. Tonelli C. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Gusmaroli G. Tonelli C. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the identification of one of the rice NF-YB proteins as an interacting partner of rice OsMADS18. It is the first example of ternary complex formation between a plant MADS-box protein and an unrelated transcription factor. Surprisingly, this NF-YB is incapable to interact with NF-YA and therefore cannot bind to the CCAAT box. A yeast two-hybrid cDNA library was made and screened following the instructions of the supplier (Stratagene) using mRNA extracted from leaves, inflorescences, and developing kernels of rice Oryza sativa var. Taipei 309. Yeast strain HF7c used for the library screening was supplied by CLONTECH (34Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The interactions between OsMADS18, OsMADS14, OsMADS13, and OsMADS6 and OsNF-YB1, the bait deletions of OsMADS18 against OsNF-YB1, and the three-hybrid assays were assayed using yeast strain PJ69–4A (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast colonies were plated on media without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The positives were subsequently tested on media without tryptophan, leucine, and adenine or histidine with increasing concentrations of 3-AT. The OsMADS18 coding sequence, excluding the initial methionine, was amplified with primers OL13 (GAATTCGGGAGAGGGCCGGTGC) and OL14 (GTCGACTCATGTGTGACTTGTCCGGAG) to introduce the cloning sites EcoRI and SalI, and the DNA fragment was cloned in pBDGAL4 (18-BD) and in pTFT (24Egea-Cortines M. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The bait deletions ofOsMADS18 were also generated by PCR, subsequently digested, and cloned in pBDGAL4. The M domain was amplified with primers OL13 and OL210 (GTCGACTCACAGTTTGAACTCGTAGACTTGCCCTTGG); the M and I domains were amplified with OL13 and OL211 (GTCGACTCAATCCAGTTTGGACTTCAAAATTCC); the I, K, and C domains with OL14 and OL207 (CGGAATTCTCCAGCCACTCCAGTATGG); the K and C domains with OL14 and OL208 (CGGAATTCGATGAATATGGAATTTTGAAGTCC); and the C domain with OL14 and OL209 (CGGAATTCAACCAGAATAATGTTCTGCAAAGC). The complete OsMADS18 coding region was also cloned in pET32a (Promega) to produce the recombinant protein (TRX-OsMADS18), using oligonucleotides OL13 and OL14.OsMADS18 was fused in-frame with thioredoxin at the N-terminal domain and with a tail of 6 histidine residues. The coding region of OsNF-YB1 was also cloned in pET32a to produce the recombinant protein TRX-OsNF-YB1. OsNF-YB1 was amplified using the oligonucleotides OL227 (CGGAATTCATGGCAGGGAACAAAAAGCGTGC) and OL317 (CCGCTCGAGCACTAGAGACTTATTGACACC), and after cloning in pGEM-T Easy (Promega), digested with EcoRI and SmaI and cloned in pET32. A PCR approach was used to mutate OsNF-YB1 into OsNF-YB1D99S. Two oligonucleotides introducing the mutation were used: OL400 (GGGTTCGTCGGCtccGAGGCCTCCGA) and OL401 (TCGGAGGCCTCggaGCCGACGAACCC). First PCR amplifications were performed with OL400 and OL227 and with OL317 and OL401. Subsequently, the two PCR products were mixed, and a second amplification was done with OL317 and OL227. The obtained template was cloned in pGEM-T Easy and sequenced, and subsequently cloned in pET32. OsMADS14 was amplified using OL11 (GAATTCGGGCGGGGCAAGCTGCAG) and OL12 (GTCGACTTACCCGTTGATGTGGC), digested with EcoRI and SalI, and cloned in the pAD vector. The same strategy was employed for OsMADS6 (6-BD) with primers OL87 (GAATTCGGGAGGGGAAGAGTTGAGC) and OL88 (GTCGACTCAAAGAACCCATCCCAGCATGAAG). pBDΔ6 was obtained by digesting 6-BD with SalI and XhoI to delete a fragment encoding 80 amino acids at the C- terminal end of the protein. This had to be done to prevent autoactivation of the reporter gene (36Moon Y.H. Kang H.G. Jung J.Y. Jeon J.S. Sung S.K. An G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Note that the M and I domains, necessary for interaction with OsNF-YB1, are present in this construct. OsMADS13 was amplified with OL174 (CGGAATTCGGGAGGGGCAGGATTGAGATCAAG) and OL175 (ACGCGTCGACGTTCATGAGGTTCAGAAGTGAG) and digested withEcoRI and SalI. OsNF-YB1 amplified with OL227 and OL317 was cloned EcoRI and SmaI in pAD-GAL4 digested EcoRI-SmaI. The mouse NF-YB subunit was amplified with OL225 (CGAATTCATGATCATGAAGACACAAATGG) and OL226 (GTCGACTCATGAAAACTGAATTTGC) and cloned in pADGAL4. The mouse conserved HFM domain contains amino acids 51–140 and was cloned asEcoRI and SalI fragments in the pADGAL4 (37Bellorini M. Lee D.-K. Dantonel J.-K. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rice variety Taipei 309 as described by Verwoerd et al.(38Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (39Colombo L. Marziani G. Masiero S. Wittich P.E. Schmidt R.J. Sari-Gorla M. Pè M.E. Plant J. 1998; 16: 355-363Crossref Google Scholar). RT-PCR reactions were performed as described previously (40Richert J. Kranz E. Lorz H. Dresselhaus T. Plant Sci. 1996; 114: 93-99Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length OsNF-YB1 cDNA, we performed according to the manufacturer's instructions a RACE experiment employing the Marathon kit (CLONTECH). TRX-OsMADS18-PET32a and TRX-OsNF-YB1-PET32a plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) plysS. To produce the recombinant proteins the overexpression system based on the T7 promoter was used (41Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The His-tagged TRX recombinant proteins were purified using an affinity Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). The immunoprecipitations of the human NF-Y trimer and TRX-OsMADS18 or of the human NF-YA/NF-YC/OsNF-YB1 combinations were performed in NDB buffer plus 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. NDB consists of 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), and 0.5 mm EDTA. The proteins were incubated on ice to interact for 2 h and subsequently incubated at 4 °C with anti-NF-YA or control anti-GATA1 antibodies (5 μg) linked to protein A-Sepharose. After 2 h, the column was washed and eluted with SDS buffer. The co-immunopreciptaion between OsMADS18 and the dimer BC was performed similarly with anti-NF-YC antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose. The anti-OsMADS18 antibodies were produced in rabbit, immunizing the animals with the C-terminal domain of the OsMADS18 protein. The polyclonal serum was purified on a Sepharose 4B-OsMADS18 affinity column (42Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F., Li, X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To detect the TRX-tagged OsNF-YB1 protein, a purified rabbit antiserum against the TRX-tag was used. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays 32P-labeled fragments, 10,000 cpm, are incubated in NF-Y buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with the indicated amounts of recombinant proteins, in a total volume of 10 μl; the samples are loaded on 4.5% polyacrylamide in 0.5× Tris, boric acid, EDTA. The following HSP40 CCAAT oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AGGGCGGCGGCGATTGGCCGGCGCCGCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCGCCGGCCAATCGCCGCCGCCCT-3′. To identify interactions between MADS-box and unrelated transcription factors in plants, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the rice MADS-box gene OsMADS18 (36Moon Y.H. Kang H.G. Jung J.Y. Jeon J.S. Sung S.K. An G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).OsMADS18 is a widely expressed gene, and its RNA can be detected in root, leaf, inflorescence, and developing kernel tissues (Fig. 1 A). Functional analysis indicated that OsMADS18 is involved in the control of the transition from vegetative growth to flowering. 2S. Masiero, F. Fornara, N. Pelucchi, M. M. Kater, and L. Colombo, manuscript in preparation. The complete OsMADS18 open reading frame was cloned in the DNA-binding domain vector GAL4-BD and transformed to yeast strain HF7c (34Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A rice cDNA expression library was constructed using RNA isolated from leaf, inflorescence, and developing kernel tissues. The cDNAs were cloned as fusions to the activation domain of GAL4 (AD), and the library was used to transform the HF7c(18-BD) yeast strain. About 6 × 106 transformants were screened, and colonies growing on medium lacking histidine supplemented with 5 mm 3-AT were selected. Approximately 50 colonies were recovered, and the pAD plasmids of those also able to activate thelacZ reporter gene were rescued. Sequence analysis of the cDNA inserts revealed that the majority of the clones encode, as expected, MADS-box protein. Among the non-MADS-box interactors, one had high homology with the CCAAT binding factor subunit NF-YB identified in mammals, yeast, and Arabidopsis (43Edwards D. Murray J.A. Smith A.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 44Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore named OsNF-YB1. The complete cDNA, encoding a putative protein of 186 amino acids, was cloned by RACE PCR. Comparison with NF-YB sequences from other species (32Gusmaroli G. Tonelli C. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 44Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) shows that OsNF-YB1 shares the highest sequence identity with Arabidopsis LEAFY COTILEDON1 (AtNF-YB9) and that the homology of proteins in different kingdoms is restricted to the evolutionarily conserved histone fold domain (Fig. 2). This domain is composed of 3/4 α-helixes separated by short loops/strand regions L1 and L2. The comparison also shows that of all NF-YB proteins, the rice protein is the most divergent, especially in the α2- and α3-helix. Despite this, a prediction of the secondary structure indicates that also OsNF-YB1 can form an α-helix. We investigated the tissue distribution of OsNF-YB1 by Northern blot analysis using RNA from roots, leaves, inflorescence containing developing flowers, and developing seeds. This analysis showed that OsNF-YB1 transcripts can only be detected in developing seed tissue (Fig. 1 A). To show that the interaction between OsMADS18 and OsNF-YB1 can occurin vivo, we investigated by RT-PCR whether their mRNAs could be detected in the same tissues of developing kernels. RNA was extracted from glumes, endosperm, and embryo tissues and used for RT-PCR analysis. This analysis (Fig. 1 B) revealed that the expression of OsMADS18 and OsNF-YB1 overlaps in the glumes and in endosperm tissue. RNA extracted from inflorescences for Northern blot analysis also include relatively low amounts of glumes tissue; however, no OsNF-YB1 transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis in this tissue, probably due to a difference in sensitivity between these two methods. Another observation from the RT-PCR analysis is that OsNF-YB1 seems to be differentially spliced in endosperm tissue, since also a smaller amplification product was detected. Future experiments are planned to study this splicing event in more detail. To investigate which of the domains of OsMADS18 are involved in the interaction with OsNF-YB1, combinations of the MIKC domains were fused to the binding domain of GAL4, resulting in 18M-BD, 18MI-BD, 18IKC-BD, 18KC-BD,and 18C-BD (Fig.3). These bait constructs were used to transform yeast strain PJ694A, which allows selection for three different markers: adenine, histidine, and lacZ (37Bellorini M. Lee D.-K. Dantonel J.-K. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Co-transformation with ADNF-YB1 and assays for activation of the adenine, histidine, or lacZ reporter genes demonstrated an interaction only with the 18MI-BD vector (Fig. 3). The observation that OsNF-YB1 does not interact with the M or IKC domains suggests that the M and I domains are both necessary and together sufficient for interaction. To test for specificity of the OsNF-YB1-OsMADS18 interaction a two-hybrid assay was performed using various MADS-box proteins as bait. In particular, three MADS-box genes all expressed in developing kernels were of interest: (i) OsMADS14 has, of all published rice MADS-box sequences, the greatest similarity with OsMADS18; (ii)OsMADS6 is one of the MADS-box proteins that forms heterodimers with OsMADS18 (36Moon Y.H. Kang H.G. Jung J.Y. Jeon J.S. Sung S.K. An G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); (iii) OsMADS13is exclusively expressed in ovules and developing kernels (46Lopez-Dee Z.P. Wittich P., Pè, E.M. Rigola D. Del Buono I. Sari-Gorla M. Kater M.M. Colombo L. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All three selected genes are divergent from each other and belong to different phylogenetic clusters. Comparing the M and I domains of these MADS-box proteins shows that they are most divergent in the I domain (Fig. 4). Except for the control pBD18-pADNF-YB1, none of the double transformants were able to activate the adenine orlacZ reporter genes. Within the limits of the members of the family tested here, these results indicate that the interaction between OsNF-YB1 and OsMADS18 is highly specific, particularly since OsMADS14, which is closely related to OsMADS18, does not interact. The two-hybrid assays described above show that OsNF-YB1 interacts with OsMADS18 but not with OsMADS6, which is one of the MADS-box proteins that physiologically interacts with OsMADS18 (36Moon Y.H. Kang H.G. Jung J.Y. Jeon J.S. Sung S.K. An G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to verify whether the MADS-box dimer composed of OsMADS18 and OsMADS6 is also able to interact with OsNF-YB1. To test this, the three proteins were co-expressed in yeast. OsMADS18 was cloned in the pTFT vector under the control of the ADH1 promoter (24Egea-Cortines M. Saedler H. Sommer H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The yeast strain PJ694A was co-transformed with pBDΔ6, pTFT-18, and pADNFY-B1, and yeast cells containing these three plasmids grow well in medium lacking histidine, whereas yeast cells containing different combinations of control plasmids only showed residual growth on the selective medium (Fig. 5). This indicates that OsMADS18, which is able to interact with both OsNF-YB1 and OsMADS6, brings the GAL4-BD and -AD domains in close vicinity, resulting in activation. These “three-hybrid” analyses prove that the MADS-box dimer is able to form a ternary complex with OsNF-YB1. InArabidopsis multiple genes encoding NF-Y subunits are identified with several of them showing tissue-specific expression (32Gusmaroli G. Tonelli C. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,33Gusmaroli G. Tonelli C. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Edwards D. Murray J.A. Smith A.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Lotan T. Ohto M. Yee K.M. West M.A., Lo, R. Kwong R.W. Yamagishi K. Fischer R.L. Goldberg R.B. Harada J.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the plethora of NF-YB genes in plants, this raised the question whether OsMADS18 is also able to interact with the distantly related NF-YB of mouse (44Li X.Y. Mantovani R. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Andre I. Benoist C. Mathis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Using the two-hybrid assay, we showed indeed that OsMADS18 interacts with wild-type mouse NF-YB and with a mutant containing only the mouse HFM, as growth was observed on histidine dropout medium containing 3 mm 3-AT. The result was also positive using the lacZ reporter gene. On the other hand, OsMADS14 scored negative in this assay (not shown). The interactions observed in vivo raised the question whether OsMADS18 also interacts with the NF-Y trimer. Investigating this with the plant trimer was not feasible, since plants encode several NF-Y A and C subunits, and therefore it was impracticable to determine the correct constitution of the trimer that binds to OsMADS18, if any. We then used recombinant NF-Y from mammals to test for the interaction with OsMADS18 in vitro. The NF-Y recombinant trimer was incubated with OsMADS18, immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-NF-YA antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OsMADS18 antibodies (Fig. 6). The results show that OsMADS18 was to some extent bound to the NF-Y trimer, whereas a control with an irrelevant antibody shows that the OsMADS18 protein can only be detected in the unbound fraction (Fig. 6). Within the NF-Y trimer, subunit B and C form a tight heterodimeric complex (47Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether such dimer can interact with OsMADS18, by performing an immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-NF-YC antibody, using equal quantities of OsMADS18 and mouse NF-YB-NF-YC. This experiment showed that OsMADS18 is capable of binding the mouse NF-YB/NF-YC dimer (Fig. 6). The interaction with the NF-YB-NF-YC dimer appears to be stronger than with the trimer, since all the OsMADS18 is found in the bound fraction. The relative divergence of OsNF-YB1 prompted us to determined whether the latter indeed binds to the CCAAT sequence. To this aim, we used EMSA with an oligonucleotide containing a high affinity NF-Y site (48Imbriano C. Bolognese F. Gurtner A. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged OsNF-YB1 was purified and a dose-response experiment performed with recombi"
https://openalex.org/W2098859322,"Cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ have been shown to differentially regulate transcription. However, the impact of spatially distinct Ca2+ signals on mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated gene expression remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ signals in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced transactivation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 using a GAL4-Elk-1 construct. EGF increased Ca2+ in both the nucleus and cytosol of HepG2 or 293 cells. Pretreatment with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator bis(2-aminophenyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid significantly reduced EGF-induced transactivation of Elk-1, indicating that EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transcriptional activity is dependent on intracellular Ca2+. To determine the relative contribution of nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ signals during EGF-mediated Elk-1 transactivation, Ca2+ signals in either compartment were selectively impaired by targeted expression of the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin to either the nucleus or cytosol. Suppression of nuclear but not cytosolic Ca2+signals inhibited EGF-induced transactivation of Elk-1. However, suppression of nuclear Ca2+ signals did not affect the ability of ERK either to become phosphorylated or to undergo translocation to the nucleus in response to EGF. Elk-1 phosphorylation and nuclear localization following EGF stimulation were also unaffected by suppressing nuclear Ca2+ signals. These results suggest that nuclear Ca2+ is required for EGF-mediated transcriptional activation of Elk-1 and that phosphorylation of Elk-1 alone is not sufficient to induce its transcriptional activation in response to EGF. Thus, subcellular targeting of parvalbumin reveals a distinct role for nuclear Ca2+ signals in mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated gene transcription. Cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ have been shown to differentially regulate transcription. However, the impact of spatially distinct Ca2+ signals on mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated gene expression remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ signals in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced transactivation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 using a GAL4-Elk-1 construct. EGF increased Ca2+ in both the nucleus and cytosol of HepG2 or 293 cells. Pretreatment with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator bis(2-aminophenyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid significantly reduced EGF-induced transactivation of Elk-1, indicating that EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transcriptional activity is dependent on intracellular Ca2+. To determine the relative contribution of nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ signals during EGF-mediated Elk-1 transactivation, Ca2+ signals in either compartment were selectively impaired by targeted expression of the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin to either the nucleus or cytosol. Suppression of nuclear but not cytosolic Ca2+signals inhibited EGF-induced transactivation of Elk-1. However, suppression of nuclear Ca2+ signals did not affect the ability of ERK either to become phosphorylated or to undergo translocation to the nucleus in response to EGF. Elk-1 phosphorylation and nuclear localization following EGF stimulation were also unaffected by suppressing nuclear Ca2+ signals. These results suggest that nuclear Ca2+ is required for EGF-mediated transcriptional activation of Elk-1 and that phosphorylation of Elk-1 alone is not sufficient to induce its transcriptional activation in response to EGF.

Although it is not completely established how Ca2+ coordinates such diverse effects, both the amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ signals have been shown to contribute to its specificity (10Li W.

Further specificity of Ca2+ signaling is achieved through differences in signaling in discrete subcellular compartments (9Webb S.E. Miller A.L.

A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, Canuc2+ is required for transcription via the cAMP response element (21Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and regulation of cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein activity (22Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), whereas Cacyt2+ activates transcription through the serum response element (21Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Thus, spatially distinct Ca2+ signals have distinct cellular effects. Although our understanding of the distinct roles of both Cacyt2+ and Canuc2+ in gene expression is limited, it is well established that protein phosphorylation in the nucleus by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) is critical for gene regulation (23Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 24Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation by the MAPK kinases (MKKs), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERKs), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases, and p38 MAPKs each translocate to the nucleus (25Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) where they transactivate various transcription factors by serine and threonine phosphorylation (23Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 24Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these transcription factors direct transcriptional activation of genes that are essential for the initiation of numerous physiological responses such as mitogenesis, differentiation, and apoptosis (26Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 27Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ip Y.T.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor stimulation results in nuclear accumulation of activated ERK, where it binds to and phosphorylates the ETS domain-containing transcription factor Elk-1 (23Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 30Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of Elk-1 is thought to increase its transcriptional activity, leading to the transcription of growth-related proteins, most notably c-Fos (32Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 33Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In addition to ERK activation, EGF and other growth factors raise intracellular free Ca2+ levels by activating phospholipase Cγ with subsequent formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (34Kamat A. Carpenter G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Nojiri S. Hoek J.B.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2951-2956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ modulates several signaling pathways that converge at various points to regulate Elk-1 transcriptional activity. Work from several groups demonstrates that growth factor- and cytokine-induced increases in Ca2+ contribute to the activation of the ERK/Elk-1 pathway via mechanisms that involve activation of signaling components such as the Src-like kinases, Pyk2, and the Ca2+-sensitive Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor (37Maloney J.A.

In addition, growth factor-induced Ca2+ increases lead to activation of other pathways such as the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases that also participate in the regulation of Elk-1 (40Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wen W. Srinivasan S. Klenk A. Cohen D. Permutt M.A. Am. J.

In contrast to the positive signaling role of Ca2+ in growth factor-mediated Elk-1 activation, Ca2+ has been proposed to play also a negative role in Elk-1 regulation by growth factors. Following stimulation the ERK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, or p38 MAPK activation of Elk-1 is inhibited by the phosphatase calcineurin (44Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,45Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, growth factor-mediated changes in Ca2+ can lead to the regulation of Elk-1 via multiple pathways in both positive and negative manners. The distinct actions of Ca2+ when localized to either the nucleus or cytosol might provide some explanation for the complexity of Elk-1 regulation in growth factor signal transduction. In this study we have investigated the relative contribution of both Cacyt2+ and Canuc2+ to the regulation of MAPK-mediated gene expression in response to stimulation with EGF by selective targeting of the Ca2+ chelator protein parvalbumin (PV) to either the cytosol or the nucleus. Using this novel approach, we have demonstrated that Canuc2+ but not Cacyt2+ is required for Elk-1 transcriptional activation in response to EGF stimulation. HepG2, SK-HEP-1, 293, and COS cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). The nuclearly targeted PV expression vector was constructed by subcloning a SalI/NotI fragment representing the full-length rat PV cDNA in-frame into the pCMV-Myc-Nuc vector (Invitrogen). This construct resulted in an in-frame fusion of PV with a Myc epitope and a triplet sequence representing the nuclear localization sequence derived from SV40 and was designated pCMV-PV-Myc-Nuc. To generate a GFP fusion of pCMV-PV-Myc-Nuc, the GFP coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pCMV-Myc-Cyto-GFP (Invitrogen) using the primers 5′-AT AAG AAT GCG GCC GCA ATG GCT AGC AAA GG-3′ and 5′-A TAA GAA TGC GGC CGC TTT GTA GAG CTC ATC-3′, which resulted in the introduction of 5′ and 3′ NotI sites. The PCR product was digested with NotI and subcloned into pCMV-PV-Myc-Nuc to yield an in-frame GFP fusion (pCMV-PV-GFP-Myc-Nuc). The final resulting fusion protein was designated PV-NLS-GFP. The cytoplasmically targeted PV expression vector was constructed by subcloning the same SalI/NotI fragment of full-length rat PV cDNA into the pCMV-Myc-Cyto vector (Invitrogen), as described for pCMV-Myc-Nuc. This construct was designated pCMV-PV-Myc-Cyto and was then used to generate a GFP fusion with PV. GFP was subcloned in-frame at the carboxyl terminus of PV using the GFP-specific primers described above. Next, the SalI site was removed from the plasmid backbone by in vitromutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis procedure as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complete coding region of the PV-GFP-Myc fusion protein was amplified using oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGG GTC GAC GCA TTA CAA AAA AAA TTA GAA GAA TTA GAA TTA GAT GAA ATG TCG ATG ACA GAC-3′ and 5′-GCG AGC TTC TAG ACT ATG CGG CCC C-3′) to introduce the nuclear exclusion signal (NES) sequence derived from the MKK1 (46Fukuda M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The NES sequence derived from MKK1 with this PV fusion encoded a short stretch of amino acids that represent residues 32–44 of MEK1, which does not contain the putative ERK binding site. These primers also introduced SalI and XbaI sites, which were used to subclone this DNA fragment into pCMV-Myc-Cyto to generate PV-NES-GFP. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to generate the mutant parvalbumins PV-NLS-CD-GFP and PV-NLS-CDEF-GFP coding for proteins in which either one or both of the functional Ca2+-binding sites (CD or EF domain) were inactivated by substituting a glutamate for a valine residue at position 12 of each Ca2+-binding loop (48Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Clark I.D. Szabo A.G. Gagne S.M. Sykes B.D. Berchtold M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20897-20903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PV-NLS-GFP DNA was used as a template for mutagenesis. The following synthetic oligonucleotides containing mismatches in codon 62 of the CD loop or in codon 101 of the EF loop were used: CD62, 5′-GC TTC ATT GAG GAG GAT GTG CTG GGG TCC ATT CTG-3′, and EF101, 5′-GGC AAG ATT GGG GTT GAAGTG TTC TCC ACT CTG GTG GCC-3′ (mutated residues are underlined). The sequences of PV-NLS-CD-GFP and PV-NLS-CDEF-GFP were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Two types of Ca2+ measurements were made. Base-line measurements of Cacyt2+ and Canuc2+ were performed with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicators indo-1 and fura-2. Measurements of agonist-induced changes in Cacyt2+and Canuc2+ over time were performed with rhod-2, fura-2, or fluo-4. In preparation for all experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected 48 h in advance with PV-NLS-GFP, PV-NES-GFP, or PV-NLS-CD-GFP. The cells were loaded with 5–6 μm of the acetoxymethyl (AM) forms of the respective indicators (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30–60 min at 37 °C. Indo-1-loaded cells were studied by two-photon microscopy, and rhod-2- or fluo-4-loaded cells were studied using confocal microscopy. A Bio-Rad MRC-1024 combined confocal and two-photon microscope was used for both of these experiments. Fura-2 fluorescence was observed by epifluorescence microscopy using a charge-coupled device camera connected to a PC-based imaging system for analysis of ratio measurements (Spectralyzer, Thomas Jefferson University, Fluorescence Imaging Laboratory, Philadelphia, PA or Axon Imaging Workbench, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For two-photon imaging, a femtosecond-pulsed Tsunami Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used as described previously (49Leite M.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 415-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, two-photon microscopy was used to excite the dual wavelength Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator indo-1 (50Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,51Xu C. Zipfel W. Shear J.B. Williams R.M. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Indo-1-loaded cells were transferred to a chamber on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert microscope, which used a 63 × 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective, and the cells were perfused with a Hepes-buffered solution. The Ti:Sapphire laser was tuned to a wavelength of 720 nm, which is optimal for two-photon excitation of indo-1 (51Xu C. Zipfel W. Shear J.B. Williams R.M. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Emission signals were detected at two wavelengths (360–430 and 445–505 nm) using custom-made external photomultiplier tube detectors (Multiphoton Peripherals, Ithaca, NY). The images were generated from the ratio of the lower wavelength image divided by the higher wavelength image. Time lapse confocal imaging was performed as described previously (52Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Ca2+ transients were evoked by perfusing with buffer containing 10 μm ATP or 0.25 μm ionomycin. Cells loaded with the single wavelength Ca2+ dye rhod-2 (53Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were first excited with the 488-snm line of a 15 mW krypton/argon laser to detect GFP fluorescent cells and subsequently with the 568-nm line to monitor rhod-2 fluorescence in these and nearby control cells. The emitted light was collected at 522/30 nm and 605/30 nm, respectively. The regions of interest were simultaneously monitored within the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected and untransfected control cells in the same field and followed over time using Bio-Rad Timecourse software. The fluorescence intensity was displayed as arbitrary units, from which background fluorescence intensity was subtracted. The amplitude of an evoked response was defined as the difference between the peak and base-line fluorescence. Most of the variability affecting fluorescent image intensity (uneven dye loading, leakage of dye, photobleaching, and differences in machine settings) was eliminated by comparing transfected cells only to untransfected controls in the same field. For the experiments involving fura-2, the fluorescent images were obtained alternately at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths with an emission wavelength of 460 to 640 nm. After correction for background fluorescence, Ca2+ transients in both nucleus and cytosol of individual cells were expressed as the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio. For parvalbumin immunofluorescence, the cells were methanol-fixed and co-labeled with propidium iodide. For triple labeling experiments, 293 cells were serum-starved for 24–48 h and then left unstimulated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for at least 2 h or overnight. The primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-phospho-Elk-1 (1:100; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and polyclonal anti-phospho-pERK1/2 (1:100; Cell Signaling). Monoclonal antibodies to the HA (1:1000) and FLAG (10 μg/ml) epitopes were obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ) and Sigma, respectively. Primary antibodies were detected by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). To determine the phosphorylation status of ERK, 293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pCG-HA-ERK2, and either 9 μg of pCMV-Myc-Cyto-GFP (GFP), 6 μg of PV-NLS-GFP, 9 μg of PV-NES-GFP, 9 μg of PV-NLS-CD-GFP, or 6 μg of pMT2-H-Ras (V12) as indicated. 293 cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm NaVO3, and 50 mm NaF). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein concentration was determined using Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). Approximately 0.5–1 mg of cell lysates were incubated overnight with 5 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The immune complexes were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (containing 2 mm NaVO3 and 5 mm NaF), followed by two washes with 500 μl of ice-cold ST buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 2 mmNaVO3 and 5 mm NaF). The immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ERK and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The effects of Elk-1 phosphorylation were determined by transiently transfecting 293 cells with 1 μg of Elk-1-FLAG (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Sharrocks, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), and 5 μg of GFP, 3 μg of PV-NLS-GFP, 5 μg of PV-NES-GFP, 5 μg of PV-NLS-CD-GFP, or 3 μg of H-Ras (V12) as indicated. GFP was used as filler DNA to normalize the total amount of transfected DNA. The cells were then either left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF or 0.25 μm ionomycin for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of 1× sample buffer. The cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho(Ser383)-Elk-1 (Cell Signaling) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies. Immunoblots were controlled for protein loading by Ponceau S staining of transferred proteins on the Immobilon membrane. Primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Elk-1 luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system kit from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293 or HepG2 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of Elkc-GAL4 (Elkc), 0.5 μg of 5X-GAL4-Luc, 0.5 μg of SV-40 β-galactosidase, and either 5 μg of GFP, 3 μg of PV-NLS-GFP, 5 μg of PV-NES-GFP, or 5 μg of PV-NLS-CD-GFP as indicated. Serum-starved 293 cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with either 10 ng/ml EGF or 0.25 μm ionomycin for 5 h. HepG2 cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml EGF or 0.5 μm ionomycin for 4 h. To determine the requirement of intracellular Ca2+ for EGF-induced Elk-1 transactivation, HepG2 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Elkc, 0.5 μg of 5X-GAL4-Luc, 0.5 μg of SV-40 β-galactosidase, and 3 μg of GFP. The cells were pretreated with either vehicle control (Me2SO) or BAPTA-AM (30 μm) (Molecular Probes) for 20 min prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 4 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined, and the luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase. The data are given as the mean values ± S.E. Groups of data were compared using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance or one-way analysis of variance. When significant overall effects were found, post-test comparisons between selected groups were made using the Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences. Statistical analyses were performed with the PRISM statistical software program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Previous experiments designed to selectively block Ca2+ signaling in the nucleus have utilized microinjection techniques to deliver a nondiffusible Ca2+chelator into this subcellular compartment (21Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 22Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We took an alternative approach to block Ca2+ in distinct subcellular compartments by using the Ca2+-binding protein PV fused to targeting sequences that direct its subcellular localization to either the nucleus or cytosol. Although PV has been demonstrated to inhibit Ca2+ signaling when expressed in mammalian cells (54Andressen C. Gotzos V. Berchtold M.W. Pauls T.L. Schwaller B. Fellay B. Celio M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 55Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), targeted expression of PV to discrete subcellular compartments to locally buffer Ca2+ has not been reported. Nuclear expression of PV was established by generating an in-frame fusion of PV with the nuclear localization signal derived from the SV40 large T antigen (56Fischer-Fantuizz L. Vesco C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). Cytosolic expression of PV was established by generating a fusion protein of PV with the NES derived from the MKK1 (46Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 47Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Subcellular localization and expression of the nuclear and cytosolically targeted PV proteins were detected by fusion with GFP. Immunoblotting for PV in PV-NLS-GFP and PV-NES-GFP COS-1 transfectants confirmed expression of the appropriate molecular weight PV fusion proteins, whereas controls showed no immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B). Confocal imaging of PV-NLS-GFP- and PV-NES-GFP-transfected HepG2 cells verified nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of PV-NLS-GFP and PV-NES-GFP proteins, respectively (Fig. 1C). To determine whether targeted PV selectively buffers Ca2+ in either the nucleus or cytosol, we examined the effects of PV expression on ATP-induced Ca2+ increases in both the nucleus and cytosol of HepG2 cells. ATP elicits a robust increase in intracellular free Ca2+ via activation of purinergic P2Y receptors and subsequent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation (57Dubyak G.R. el-Moatassim C. Am. J.

ADM has been shown to be induced by tamoxifen in the endometrium and to be a growth factor for endometrial endothelial cells in vitro. We have now shown ADM to be strongly angiogenic in the mouse subcutaneous sponge angiogenesis assay. To examine the role of ADM in tumor growth, the ADM cDNA was transfected into endometrial carcinoma cells followed by xenografting into athymic mice. Two endometrial cancer cell lines were employed, those in which transfection and expression of ADM resulted in no effect on growthin vitro (Ishikawa cells) and those in which expressionof exogenous ADM stimulated in vitro growth (RL95.2 cells). A clear enhancement of tumor growth was seen with both cell lines but the effect was far greater with the RL95.2 cells. We conclude that ADM is pro-tumorigenic by stimulating either angiogenesis alone or by stimulating angiogenesis and carcinoma cell growth directly. The combined activities lead to a striking increase in tumor growth. These results provide the first direct evidence of tumorigenic activity of ADM and provide further support for ADMs involvement in tamoxifen induced endometrial neoplasia."

In response to all-trans retinoic acid (RA), the human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line, NT2/D1, differentiates toward a neuronal lineage with associated loss of cell growth and tumorigenicity. Through the use of cDNA-based microarrays we sought to identify the early downstream targets of RA during differentiation commitment of NT2/D1 cells. A total of 57 genes were induced and 37 genes repressed by RA. RA regulated genes were restricted at 8 h with 27 genes induced and five repressed. The total number of RA-responsive transcripts increased at 24 and 48 h and their pattern of expression was more symmetrical. For a given time point less than 1% of the 9128 cDNAs on the expression array were regulated by RA. Many of these gene products are associated with developmental pathways including those of TGF-beta (Lefty A, NMA, follistatin), homeo domain (HoxD1, Meis2, Meis1, Gbx2), IGF (IGFBP3, IGFBP6, CTGF), Notch (manic fringe, ADAM11), Hedgehog (patched) and Wnt (Frat2, secreted frizzled-related protein 1) signaling. In addition a large cassette of genes induced by RA at 24-48 h are associated with cell adhesion, cytoskeletal and matrix remodeling, growth suppression and intracellular signaling cascades. The majority of repressed genes are associated with protein/RNA processing, turnover or metabolism. The early induced genes identified may play a regulatory role in RA-mediated growth suppression and terminal differentiation and may have physiologic or pharmacologic importance during normal human development and retinoid-based cancer therapy or prevention."

Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ sensitization is thought to reflect an inhibition of SMPP-1m via a G-protein-linked mechanism (4Somlyo A.P.

This contraction correlates with an increase in myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation at Ser19 and Thr18 (12Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J.

A great deal of attention has recently been focused on identifying the kinase or kinases responsible for this myosin phosphorylation in the absence of changes in [Ca2+] i . The results of recent efforts have identified both zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and integrin-linked kinase (13Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myosin phosphatase activity of SMPP-1m is believed to be regulated by phosphorylation of the MYPT1 subunit. Several phosphorylation sites have been identified on MYPT1, including an inhibitory site of phosphorylation by an endogenous kinase identified as Thr695 (in the chicken M133 isoform, equivalent to Thr654 in the chicken M130 isoform) (17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism through which activation of G-proteins inhibits SMPP-1m activity is not well established. Evidence suggests that the recently identified endogenous smooth muscle SMPP-1m-associated kinase (MYPT1 kinase) may be implicated in this pathway (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In support of this, MYPT1 kinase and MYPT1 are colocalized in smooth muscle, and MYPT1 kinase is phosphorylated and activated in response to treatment with calcium-sensitizing agents (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).To elucidate the mechanism through which MYPT1 kinase acts, the following study was initiated. The following data show that introduction of a constitutively active recombinant MYPT1 kinase (rMYPT1K) into β-escin-permeabilized smooth muscle provokes a Ca2+-independent contraction. We report that this Ca2+-independent contraction is associated with an inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity caused by phosphorylation at the Thr695 inhibition site.DISCUSSIONSubstrate specificity in signal transduction is often conferred to a common catalytic subunit through a unique targeting subunit (reviewed in Ref. 26Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The targeting subunits themselves may be targets of signaling pathways that can modulate the activity of the enzyme toward its specific substrate. The smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. In the current study, we have provided evidence for a mechanism regulating the activity of MYPT1. There is substantial evidence that smooth muscle Ca2+ sensitization reflects an inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity (reviewed in Refs. 3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar and 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of SMPP-1m inhibition remains unclear. Several theories have now been described: inhibition by CPI-17, a 17-kDa phosphatase inhibitor and protein kinase C substrate protein that becomes a potent inhibitor of SMPP-1m following phosphorylation by protein kinase C (27Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); dissociation of the SMPP-1m holoenzyme through arachidonic acid interaction (29Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and phosphorylation of MYPT1 by an endogenous kinase (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or by ROK (30Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar).Previous studies reported that phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr695 by an endogenous kinase caused inhibition of SMPP-1m activity (17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified this endogenous kinase that copurifies with the holoenzyme of myosin phosphatase as MYPT1 kinase (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which shows significant sequence homology to the previously described ZIPK (31Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The data presented above indicate that MYPT1 kinase phosphorylates MYPT1 in situ in rabbit ileal smooth muscle and that this MYPT1 phosphorylation is correlated with a Ca2+-independent contraction. Our data suggest that MYPT1 is indeed a target of smooth muscle MYPT1 kinase contributing to calcium sensitization.We previously reported that MYPT1 kinase phosphorylates the inhibitory Thr695 site of MYPT1 (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the presence of three additional MYPT1 phosphorylation sites, two of which we have identified. Ser854 in Rat3 MBS was previously reported to be a phosphorylation site specific to ROK and was proposed to be an effective indicator of ROK activation in vivo (25Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser849, equivalent to Ser854in Rat3 MBS, did not have an inhibitory effect on SMPP-1mactivity (18Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified Ser808, which corresponds to Ser854 in Rat3 MBS and Ser849 in chicken M133, as a minor MYPT1 kinase phosphorylation site. Our data indicate that Ser854phosphorylation is not unique to ROK and suggest a renewed examination of the role of ROK in SMPP-1m regulation. We also identify Thr675 as a minor MYPT1 phosphorylation site. The role of this newly identified phosphorylation site in the regulation of SMPP-1m remains unknown.Native MYPT1 kinase was recovered from the cytosolic fraction of bladder smooth muscle following homogenization in the absence of any detergent. Native MYPT1 kinase was previously isolated from a Triton-solubilized fraction consisting of myofilament and cytoskeletal components (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of two distinct subcellular fractions of MYPT1 kinase in smooth muscle. Presumably, it is the myofilament-associated pool of MYPT1 kinase that would associate with and phosphorylate myosin phosphatase in vivo. An additional substrate for MYPT1 kinase that may be important in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction is myosin. It was previously reported that a full-length smooth muscle ZIPK phosphorylated myosin at both Ser19 and Thr18 (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have also observed that rMYPT1K phosphorylates RLC and whole myosin on its regulatory light chains in vitro (data not shown). The change in calcium sensitivity associated with rMYPT1K treatment may therefore reflect two distinct phosphorylation mechanisms, i.e. MYPT1 and myosin. This possibility will require further investigation. Current procedures for investigating the contribution of MYPT1 phosphorylation in the calcium sensitization of force development involve the indiscriminate use of MLCK inhibitors (i.e.ML-9). It should be noted that this commonly used MLCK inhibitor also inhibits the activity of MYPT1 kinase in vitro at levels below those required for full MLCK inactivation (IC50 for MYPT1 kinase: ∼150 μm ML-9). Researchers who use MLCK inhibitors to investigate GTPγS- or ATPγS-induced force enhancement should be aware that they may be inadvertently influencing different signaling pathways.It is unclear why the phosphorylation results obtained with native MYPT1 kinase and rMYPT1K in our studies (this paper and Ref. 1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) are different from those recently reported by Niiro and Ikebe (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, they have suggested that MYPT1 phosphorylation by native MYPT1 kinase may be physiologically irrelevant because in their hands MYPT1 is a poor substrate for recombinant ZIPK. It is possible, as suggested by Richards et al. (32Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), that ZIPK (and native MYPT1 kinase) only phosphorylates the M133 isoform of MYPT1 (i.e.Thr695 site) and not the shorter, spliced-out M130 isoform (i.e. Thr654 site). The expression of MYPT1 isoforms is both developmentally regulated and tissue-specific (3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), thereby raising the possibility that MYPT1 isoforms could modulate the magnitude of agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization (32Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although we have not completed a comprehensive examination of the phosphorylation kinetics for the M130/M133 isoforms, our preliminary studies (Fig. 3) have shown that both the M130 and M133 isoforms are phosphorylated by MYPT1 kinase.We have now identified three substrates for the smooth muscle MYPT1 kinase that could be involved in regulating calcium sensitization: MYPT1 (Ref. 1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar and present data), myosin (present data), and the protein kinase C-activated peptide inhibitor (CPI-17) (33MacDonald J.A. Eto M. Borman M.A. Brautigan D.L. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have established the sites of phosphorylation of MYPT1, which include the known inhibitory site (Thr654), a site previously thought to be unique to ROK (Ser808), and a newly identified phosphorylation site whose role in SMPP-1m regulation has not been established (Thr675). We have also demonstrated that a constitutively active fragment of MYPT1 kinase induces contraction in β-escin permeabilized ileal smooth muscle and that this Ca2+ sensitization is correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of SMPP-1m at Thr654. If this occurs in vivo, it would likely be under conditions where MLCK activity is reduced, i.e. at low calcium concentrations. This would clearly necessitate a signal other than calcium to activate MYPT1 kinase. Contractile activity in smooth muscle is primarily controlled by the level of free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i ) and the level of phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chains (RLC).1 The phosphorylation level of myosin is mediated by the activity of two enzymes, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (2Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and a Ca2+-independent myosin light chain phosphatase (SMPP-1m) (3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M.

Contractile stimuli that cause an increase in [Ca2+] i result in Ca2+ binding to calmodulin and activation of MLCK. MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chains at Ser19 (reviewed in Refs. 2Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res.

Science. 1979; 204: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Relaxation follows a return of [Ca2+] i to resting levels, the subsequent inactivation of MLCK, and dephosphorylation of myosin catalyzed by SMPP-1m (3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle contraction may also occur in the absence of changes in [Ca2+] i following agonist stimulation or by activation of G-proteins with GTPγS or AlF4 (4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ sensitization is thought to reflect an inhibition of SMPP-1m via a G-protein-linked mechanism (4Somlyo A.P.

It is possible to elicit a Ca2+-independent contraction by completely inhibiting SMPP-1m activity with phosphatase inhibitors,e.g. microcystin (9Gong M.C. Cohen P. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. Masuo M.

This contraction correlates with an increase in myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation at Ser19 and Thr18 (12Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J.

A great deal of attention has recently been focused on identifying the kinase or kinases responsible for this myosin phosphorylation in the absence of changes in [Ca2+] i . The results of recent efforts have identified both zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and integrin-linked kinase (13Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as kinases responsible for Ca2+-independent myosin phosphorylation and contraction in smooth muscle. SMPP-1m is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a 37-kDa catalytic subunit (PP-1cδ), a 110–130-kDa regulatory myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1), and a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function (10Shirazi A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myosin phosphatase activity of SMPP-1m is believed to be regulated by phosphorylation of the MYPT1 subunit. Several phosphorylation sites have been identified on MYPT1, including an inhibitory site of phosphorylation by an endogenous kinase identified as Thr695 (in the chicken M133 isoform, equivalent to Thr654 in the chicken M130 isoform) (17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism through which activation of G-proteins inhibits SMPP-1m activity is not well established. Evidence suggests that the recently identified endogenous smooth muscle SMPP-1m-associated kinase (MYPT1 kinase) may be implicated in this pathway (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In support of this, MYPT1 kinase and MYPT1 are colocalized in smooth muscle, and MYPT1 kinase is phosphorylated and activated in response to treatment with calcium-sensitizing agents (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism through which MYPT1 kinase acts, the following study was initiated. The following data show that introduction of a constitutively active recombinant MYPT1 kinase (rMYPT1K) into β-escin-permeabilized smooth muscle provokes a Ca2+-independent contraction. We report that this Ca2+-independent contraction is associated with an inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity caused by phosphorylation at the Thr695 inhibition site. DISCUSSIONSubstrate specificity in signal transduction is often conferred to a common catalytic subunit through a unique targeting subunit (reviewed in Ref. 26Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The targeting subunits themselves may be targets of signaling pathways that can modulate the activity of the enzyme toward its specific substrate. The smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. In the current study, we have provided evidence for a mechanism regulating the activity of MYPT1. There is substantial evidence that smooth muscle Ca2+ sensitization reflects an inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity (reviewed in Refs. 3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar and 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of SMPP-1m inhibition remains unclear. Several theories have now been described: inhibition by CPI-17, a 17-kDa phosphatase inhibitor and protein kinase C substrate protein that becomes a potent inhibitor of SMPP-1m following phosphorylation by protein kinase C (27Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); dissociation of the SMPP-1m holoenzyme through arachidonic acid interaction (29Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and phosphorylation of MYPT1 by an endogenous kinase (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or by ROK (30Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar).Previous studies reported that phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr695 by an endogenous kinase caused inhibition of SMPP-1m activity (17Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified this endogenous kinase that copurifies with the holoenzyme of myosin phosphatase as MYPT1 kinase (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which shows significant sequence homology to the previously described ZIPK (31Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The data presented above indicate that MYPT1 kinase phosphorylates MYPT1 in situ in rabbit ileal smooth muscle and that this MYPT1 phosphorylation is correlated with a Ca2+-independent contraction. Our data suggest that MYPT1 is indeed a target of smooth muscle MYPT1 kinase contributing to calcium sensitization.We previously reported that MYPT1 kinase phosphorylates the inhibitory Thr695 site of MYPT1 (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the presence of three additional MYPT1 phosphorylation sites, two of which we have identified. Ser854 in Rat3 MBS was previously reported to be a phosphorylation site specific to ROK and was proposed to be an effective indicator of ROK activation in vivo (25Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser849, equivalent to Ser854in Rat3 MBS, did not have an inhibitory effect on SMPP-1mactivity (18Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified Ser808, which corresponds to Ser854 in Rat3 MBS and Ser849 in chicken M133, as a minor MYPT1 kinase phosphorylation site. Our data indicate that Ser854phosphorylation is not unique to ROK and suggest a renewed examination of the role of ROK in SMPP-1m regulation. We also identify Thr675 as a minor MYPT1 phosphorylation site. The role of this newly identified phosphorylation site in the regulation of SMPP-1m remains unknown.Native MYPT1 kinase was recovered from the cytosolic fraction of bladder smooth muscle following homogenization in the absence of any detergent. Native MYPT1 kinase was previously isolated from a Triton-solubilized fraction consisting of myofilament and cytoskeletal components (1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of two distinct subcellular fractions of MYPT1 kinase in smooth muscle. Presumably, it is the myofilament-associated pool of MYPT1 kinase that would associate with and phosphorylate myosin phosphatase in vivo. An additional substrate for MYPT1 kinase that may be important in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction is myosin. It was previously reported that a full-length smooth muscle ZIPK phosphorylated myosin at both Ser19 and Thr18 (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have also observed that rMYPT1K phosphorylates RLC and whole myosin on its regulatory light chains in vitro (data not shown). The change in calcium sensitivity associated with rMYPT1K treatment may therefore reflect two distinct phosphorylation mechanisms, i.e. MYPT1 and myosin. This possibility will require further investigation. Current procedures for investigating the contribution of MYPT1 phosphorylation in the calcium sensitization of force development involve the indiscriminate use of MLCK inhibitors (i.e.ML-9). It should be noted that this commonly used MLCK inhibitor also inhibits the activity of MYPT1 kinase in vitro at levels below those required for full MLCK inactivation (IC50 for MYPT1 kinase: ∼150 μm ML-9). Researchers who use MLCK inhibitors to investigate GTPγS- or ATPγS-induced force enhancement should be aware that they may be inadvertently influencing different signaling pathways.It is unclear why the phosphorylation results obtained with native MYPT1 kinase and rMYPT1K in our studies (this paper and Ref. 1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) are different from those recently reported by Niiro and Ikebe (14Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, they have suggested that MYPT1 phosphorylation by native MYPT1 kinase may be physiologically irrelevant because in their hands MYPT1 is a poor substrate for recombinant ZIPK. It is possible, as suggested by Richards et al. (32Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), that ZIPK (and native MYPT1 kinase) only phosphorylates the M133 isoform of MYPT1 (i.e.Thr695 site) and not the shorter, spliced-out M130 isoform (i.e. Thr654 site). The expression of MYPT1 isoforms is both developmentally regulated and tissue-specific (3Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), thereby raising the possibility that MYPT1 isoforms could modulate the magnitude of agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization (32Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although we have not completed a comprehensive examination of the phosphorylation kinetics for the M130/M133 isoforms, our preliminary studies (Fig. 3) have shown that both the M130 and M133 isoforms are phosphorylated by MYPT1 kinase.We have now identified three substrates for the smooth muscle MYPT1 kinase that could be involved in regulating calcium sensitization: MYPT1 (Ref. 1MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar and present data), myosin (present data), and the protein kinase C-activated peptide inhibitor (CPI-17) (33MacDonald J.A. Eto M. Borman M.A. Brautigan D.L. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have established the sites of phosphorylation of MYPT1, which include the known inhibitory site (Thr654), a site previously thought to be unique to ROK (Ser808), and a newly identified phosphorylation site whose role in SMPP-1m regulation has not been established (Thr675). We have also demonstrated that a constitutively active fragment of MYPT1 kinase induces contraction in β-escin permeabilized ileal smooth muscle and that this Ca2+ sensitization is correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of SMPP-1m at Thr654. If this occurs in vivo, it would likely be under conditions where MLCK activity is reduced, i.e. at low calcium concentrations. This would clearly necessitate a signal other than calcium to activate MYPT1 kinase. Substrate specificity in signal transduction is often conferred to a common catalytic subunit through a unique targeting subunit (reviewed in Ref. 26Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

We have established the sites of phosphorylation of MYPT1, which include the known inhibitory site (Thr654), a site previously thought to be unique to ROK (Ser808), and a newly identified phosphorylation site whose role in SMPP-1m regulation has not been established (Thr675). We have also demonstrated that a constitutively active fragment of MYPT1 kinase induces contraction in β-escin permeabilized ileal smooth muscle and that this Ca2+ sensitization is correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of SMPP-1m at Thr654. If this occurs in vivo, it would likely be under conditions where MLCK activity is reduced, i.e. at low calcium concentrations. This would clearly necessitate a signal other than calcium to activate MYPT1 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2032129663,"Angiogenesis is important for growth and progression of ovarian cancers. Squalamine is a natural antiangiogenic sterol, and its potential role in treatment of ovarian cancers with or without standard cisplatin chemotherapy was assessed. Since HER-2 gene overexpression is associated with cisplatin resistance in vitro and promotion of tumor angiogenesis in vivo, the response of ovarian cancer cells with or without HER-2 gene overexpression to squalamine and cisplatin was evaluated both in tumor xenograft models and in tissue culture. Ovarian cancer cells with or without HER-2 overexpression were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Animals were treated by intraperitoneal injection with control vehicle, cisplatin, squalamine or cisplatin combined with squalamine. At the end of the experiment, tumors were assessed for tumor growth inhibition and for changes in microvessel density and apoptosis. Additional in vitro studies evaluated effects of squalamine on tumor and endothelial cell growth and on signaling pathways in human endothelial cells. Profound growth inhibition was elicited by squalamine alone and by combined treatment with squalamine and cisplatin for both parental and HER-2-overexpressing ovarian tumor xenografts. Immunohistochemical evaluation of tumors revealed decreased microvessel density and increased apoptosis. Although HER-2-overexpressing tumors had more angiogenic and less apoptotic activity than parental cancers, growth of both tumor types was similarly suppressed by treatment with squalamine combined with cisplatin. In in vitro studies, we found that squalamine does not directly affect proliferation of ovarian cells. However, squalamine significantly blocked VEGF-induced activation of MAP kinase and cell proliferation in human vascular endothelial cells. The results suggest that squalamine is anti-angiogenic for ovarian cancer xenografts and appears to enhance cytotoxic effects of cisplatin chemotherapy independent of HER-2 tumor status."

Pulse-chase experiments in 293T cells using antisera specifically recognizing its N- and C-terminal regions demonstrated that Ig-Hepta is core-glycosylated cotranslationally and proteolytically processed into a two-chain form in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by maturation of oligosaccharide chains and dimerization. The cleavage occurs at two highly conserved sites: one in a “SEA” module (a module first identified in sperm protein, enterokinase, andagrin) near the N terminus and the other in the stalk region preceding the first transmembrane span, generating ∼20-, 130-, and 32-kDa fragments. The latter two remain tightly associated non-covalently even after cleavage as revealed by immunoprecipitation of native and myc-tagged Ig-Hepta constructs that were transiently expressed in 293T cells. The dimer consisting of four chains, (130 kDa + 32 kDa)2, is linked by disulfide bonds.

They share a common basic structure of seven transmembrane spans (TM7) with extracellular N and intracellular C termini. Mammalian GPCRs have been classified into three major groups on the basis of their sequence similarity to rhodopsin (class I or type A), secretin receptor (class II or type B), and metabotropic receptor (class III or type C) (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). During the past few years, a subgroup of the class II GPCRs has emerged whose members have unusually large N-terminal extracellular domains that contain a number of well-defined protein modules (2Stacey M.

Despite these variations in the membrane-distal region of the extracellular domain, their membrane-proximal regions or stalks are highly conserved. Namely, they contain a characteristic Cys-box motif close to the extracellular face of the membrane, suggesting a common role. For the α-latrotoxin receptors, it has been shown that proteolytic cleavage takes place immediately downstream to the conserved Cys-box (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis subsequently demonstrated that mRNA transcripts are expressed abundantly in the lung and significantly in the kidney (15Abe J. Suzuki H. Notoya M. Yamamoto T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated alveolar wall and intercalated cell localizations in the rat lung and kidney, respectively (15Abe J. Suzuki H. Notoya M. Yamamoto T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One striking and unusual feature of the Ig-Hepta molecule is that it exists as a disulfide-linked dimer; although there are a growing number of GPCRs that can be detected as homo- or heterodimers, many of them are non-covalently associated except the disulfide-linked dimers between calcium-sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors (16Romano C.

Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). While performing Western blot analysis of mature Ig-Hepta to characterize the nature of the dimer, we noticed that N- and C-terminal-directed antisera stained distinct bands of ∼130 and ∼32 kDa, respectively, suggesting that Ig-Hepta undergoes proteolytic processing during the biosynthetic process. In the present study, therefore, we performed pulse-chase experiments to confirm this possibility. We further determined the site of cleavage and found it is located in the highly conserved stalk region mentioned above, implying that similar processing also occurs in other members of the LNB-TM7 family. N-terminal sequencing of Ig-Hepta also revealed another proteolytic processing occurring at a “SEA” module that is located close to the N terminus. The SEA module was first described as a motif present in an ectodomain of a number of mucin-like membrane proteins and so named after the first three proteins in which it was identified (sperm protein, enterokinase, andagrin). The number of SEA module-containing proteins now exceeds 73 (available at dylan.embl-heidelberg.de/). The function of the SEA module is not clear, but it serves as a site for proteolytic cleavage (21Parry S. Silverman H.S. McDermott K. Willis A. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P.

Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have proposed a mechanism whereby a combination of ligand and receptor is generated from a single precursor molecule by its SEA module-mediated cleavage. The significance of the cleavage of Ig-Hepta at its SEA module is discussed in relation to this hypothesis. Restriction enzymes were from Takara, Kyoto, Japan; Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitrocell-labeling mix and protein G-Sepharose were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden; Complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany; BL21(DE3)pLysS was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; pcDNA3, pSecTag, pRSET, pZErO-2, Zeocin, and LipofectAMINE Plus were from Invitrogen, San Diego, CA; anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; brefeldin A (BFA) was from Sigma Chemical Co., Munich, Germany; Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore, Tokyo, Japan; nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen, Valencia, CA; BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit was from Pierce, Rockford, IL. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Expression vectors encoding wild type Ig-Hepta and Ig-Hepta-ECD were described previously (15Abe J. Suzuki H. Notoya M. Yamamoto T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To generate the C-terminally myc-His6-tagged full-length Ig-Hepta constructs, the transmembrane sequence of Ig-Hepta without the stop codon was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase with the primers IgH7TMF and IgH7TMR shown below, digested byApaI restriction enzyme, and ligated into theEcoRV and ApaI sites of pSecTag-Ig-Hepta-ECD, in-frame at the 3′-end of the extracellular domain (amino acid residues 25–1016) of Ig-Hepta. DNA sequencing was used to verify the sequence. The expression vector encoding an Ig-Hepta-GFP fusion protein (pEGFP-N3-Ig-Hepta) was generated by ligating a 4.0-kbSpeI/KpnI fragment of pcDNA3-Ig-Hepta-myc comprising the full-length Ig-Hepta into the NheI/KpnI site of pEGFP-N3. To generate expression vector for the soluble rat Ig-Hepta-human immunoglobulin Fc chimera (sIg-Hepta-Fc), the Fc region of human IgG1 were amplified from human spleen cDNA with the primers hIg-G1FcF (EcoRV) and hIg-G1FcR (ApaI) shown below, and cloned into pZErO-2 cloning vector and verified by sequencing. A cDNA cassette encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 was inserted between the EcoRV and ApaI sites of pSecTag-Ig-Hepta-ECD, in-frame at the 3′-end of the extracellular domain (residues 25–1016) of Ig-Hepta. The primers used for constructing the expression vectors were as follows: IgH7TMF (EcoRV), 5′-ATCATTTCTTACATCGGGTT-3′; IgH7TMR (ApaI), 5′-GCGCGGGCCCGTTGAGCAATGAGTAAGCAC-3′; hIg-G1FcF (EcoRV), 5′-ATCAAATCTTGTGACAAAACTCA-3′; and hIg-G1FcR (ApaI), 5′-GGGCCCTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGG-3′. Transient transfections were performed with the LipofectAMINE Plus system according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 293T cells at 80% confluence in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of DNA, 6 μl of Plus reagent, and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM medium for 3 h. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For pulse-chase analysis, transiently transfected 293T cells were starved in cysteine/methionine-free DMEM with dialyzed 5% FBS for 30 min, labeled for 15 min in the same culture medium supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine. After the pulse, the radiolabeling medium was removed, the cell surface was washed three times with 5 ml of DMEM, and cells were chased with DMEM supplemented with 5 mm cysteine/methionine and 5% FBS. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris and precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with antibodies on ice for 2 h and then with protein G-Sepharose beads for another 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293T cells transiently transfected with Ig-Hepta cDNA were pretreated with BFA (5 μg/ml) for 1 h and metabolically labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 1 h with cold media in the continued presence of BFA. Cells were then washed with BFA-free medium three times and chased for additional 6 h. The cells were lysed at each time point and immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-NIg-Hepta and anti-CIg-Heptapolyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and the radioactive bands were visualized. Membrane proteins from 293T cells transiently transfected with Ig-Hepta were solubilized with 0.5% SDS (w/v), and the extracts (20 μg of protein) were boiled for 3 min in 20 μl of 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After cooling to room temperature, Nonidet P-40 was added to give a final concentration of 1%. To the extracts, 2 milliunits of PNGase F (EC 3.5.1.52, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. A control incubation was carried out in which 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer was added in place of the enzyme. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by immunoblotting as described above. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer without proteinase inhibitors for three times and eluted from the beads by incubation in 30 μl of denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Treatment with PNGase F was performed for 3 h at 37 °C as described above. Samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide. For antibody production, DNA fragments encoding the C-terminal cytosolic domain of Ig-Hepta (residues 1268–1349) and the N-terminal extracellular domain of Ig-Hepta (residues 571–1016) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pRSET, and the constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and used for fusion protein production. Fusion proteins were insoluble and purified under denaturing conditions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin columns. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies using the recombinant proteins were produced as previously described (15Abe J. Suzuki H. Notoya M. Yamamoto T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To establish cell lines that express sIg-Hepta-Fc, the expression vector encoding sIg-Hepta-Fc was linearized byScaI restriction enzyme and transfected into exponentially growing 293T cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus method. Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by adding 500 μg/ml Zeocin into the medium. After 3 weeks, Zeocin-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded to obtain stable cell lines. Expression of sIg-Hepta-Fc was determined by Western blotting of cell supernatants. Stably transfected cells were grown for 7 days in serum-free Opti-MEM medium, and the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged (10,000 × g, 1 h), filtered through a 0.22-μm filter membrane to remove cell debris and membranes, and loaded as 40-ml aliquots onto 1-ml columns of protein G-Sepharose equilibrated in PBS. The columns were washed with 10 ml of PBS and eluted with 2.5 ml of 50 mm citric acid. The eluates were neutralized with 1 m Tris base and concentrated using Centriprep-10 concentrators. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and the purity of the samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal sequencing, 5 μg of purified sIg-Hepta-Fc was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein band of interest was excised from the membrane, and N-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation using a PPSQ-21 sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A single Thr (ACG) to Ala (GCG) mutation at proteolytic cleavage site (P1′, residue 994) was introduced into pEGFP-N3-Ig-Hepta by PCR-based mutagenesis using mutated synthetic oligonucleotides. Briefly, a DNA fragment was amplified using the forward primer T994A-Xho-F shown below and the antisense mutant primer T994A-Nru-R, and an overlapping fragment was amplified using the sense mutant primer T994A-Nru-F and the downstream reverse primer T994A-Apa-R. Both fragments were gel-purified, cut withNruI, ligated, and re-amplified with the Pfu DNA polymerase with the T994A-Xho-F and T994A-Apa-R primers. The product was digested using Aor51HI-Bpu1102I restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and subcloned into pEGFP-N3-Ig-Hepta to replace the target segment. DNA sequencing was used to verify the sequence. The following primers were used for constructing the above mentioned point mutations (the underlined sequences indicate the mutated bases): T994A-Xho-F 5′-gcgcctcgcgagcttctccattctcatgtcc-3′; T994A-Nru-R 5′-gcgcgctcgcgaggtggttacacttgcagaa-3′; T994A-Nru-F 5′-gcgcctcgcgagcttctccattctcatgtcc-3′; T994A-Apa-R 5′-GCGCGGGCCCGTGCTGTCTCCCAGCTCGAG-3′. Cell extract was equilibrated with Laemmli sample buffer and kept at room temperature for 5 min. Ten μg were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis at 4 °C, and fluorescent bands were detected by exposing the gel to Bioimage Analyzer FLA2000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) at 473-nm excitation and 510-nm emission. While characterizing antisera, anti-NIg-Hepta and anti-CIg-Hepta, raised against the N- and C-terminal domains of rat Ig-Hepta, respectively, we noticed that they recognize distinct bands on Western blot analysis of Ig-Hepta (Fig.1 A). When extracts of 293T cells transiently expressing Ig-Hepta were analyzed, anti- NIg-Hepta antiserum reacted with broad bands of 30–160 kDa and their dimers (lanes 1 and 2), whereas anti-CIg-Hepta antiserum detected a band of 32-kDa and its dimer (lanes 3 and 4). In both cases, the dimer bands disappeared upon reduction (data not shown). The broad bands of 130–160 kDa can be explained by glycosylation; treatment with glycosidase PNGase F, which cleaves both high mannose and complexN-linked oligosaccharides, reduced their sizes to ∼95 kDa (1B, lane 3). These results suggest that Ig-Hepta is proteolytically processed into a mature two-chain form composed of the fully glycosylated 150-kDa N-terminal fragment and the 32-kDa C-terminal fragment. To see whether this proteolytic processing is a general property of Ig-Hepta, we next performed Western blot analysis using whole detergent extracts of the rat lung. Although anti-NIg-Hepta detected 130- to 160-kDa bands corresponding to the N-terminal fragment, anti-CIg-Hepta yielded only a faint band of 32 kDa that was difficult to distinguish from nonspecific staining (data not shown). We therefore enriched the C-terminal fragment by immunoprecipitation and subjected it to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C), which demonstrated the presence of the processed C-terminal fragment of 32 kDa in the lung (lane 5) as well as in 293T cells (lane 4). To determine the time course of the post-translational modification of Ig-Hepta, we performed pulse-chase experiments. 293T cells expressing rat Ig-Hepta were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased for 0–120 min (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation of labeled products with either N- or C-terminal domain-directed antiserum revealed that rat Ig-Hepta is synthesized as a 170-kDa precursor and is rapidly cleaved into two chains: a 130-kDa N-terminal fragment (Fig.2 A, upper panel, arrowhead) and a 32-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The size of the C-terminal fragment remained unchanged during the 2-h chase time. However, the size of the N-terminal fragment increased from 130 to 150 kDa after 1 h of chase (Fig.2 A, arrow) because of modification of oligosaccharide chains as demonstrated by deglycosylation of the pulse-chased products (Fig. 2 B). Deglycosylation experiments also showed that the initial glycosylation (attachment of a commonN-linked oligosaccharides or core-glycosylation) occurs almost cotranslationally as seen by a marked reduction (∼20 kDa) in size of the 170-kDa band as well as the band of 130 kDa (Fig. 2,A and B). The time courses of processing indicate that the cleavage occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before the late steps in the processing of oligosaccharide chains is completed in the Golgi complex. To confirm this speculation, we performed the following experiment using BFA, an inhibitor that prevents the ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking. The identity of an ∼150-kDa band maximally seen at 20 min of chase (Fig. 2 A, double arrowhead on the left) will be addressed later. 293T cells were transiently transfected with an Ig-Hepta expression vector, preincubated for 1 h with BFA to achieve complete inhibition, pulse labeled for 15 min in the presence of BFA, and chased for 1 h in a medium containing BFA. BFA was then removed, the chase was further continued for 6 h, and cell lysates were assayed for the molecular species of Ig-Hepta accumulated during the chase by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.3, Ig-Hepta that accumulated in ER in the presence of BFA was the proteolytically processed form consisting of the 130-kDa N-terminal fragment (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4, upper panel) and 32-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 3, lower panel). However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the cleavage could be occurring due to the presence of enzymes normally found in the cis-Golgi, because some of the enzymes normally found in the early part of the Golgi are known to be present in ER through retrograde transport. On removal of BFA, the 130-kDa N-terminal extracellular domain was gradually converted to the fully glycosylated higher molecular weight species (lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the complete maturation of the sugar chains occurs at a later stage in the Golgi. From the sizes of the cleaved fragments, the site of cleavage is predicted to be located in a juxtamembrane region of the N-terminal extracellular domain. The degree of cleavage was monitored by constructing a fluorescent derivative of Ig-Hepta termed Ig-Hepta-GFP that has a GFP tag at its C terminus. Because GFP is stable, if not heated, in the Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, this construct allowed us to detect the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment by using a fluorescence gel scanner (Fig.4). A single band of ∼50 kDa was seen when extracts of 293T cells were transiently transfected with the Ig-Hepta-GFP construct (lanes 2 and 5,WT-GFP). The absence of higher molecular weight unprocessed species indicates that the processing occurs highly efficiently. Despite the efficient cleavage of the N-terminal extracellular domain of Ig-Hepta during its post-translational modification, the cleaved extracellular domain was not released into the culture medium (Fig. 5 A,lane 1) and was rather recovered from membrane fractions (lane 3). As expected, when a truncated form covering only the extracellular domain of Ig-Hepta (Ig-Hepta-ECD) was expressed in the same expression system, it was secreted and recovered from the culture medium (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). These pieces of experimental evidence suggest that the N-terminal fragment is tightly associated with certain membrane component(s), most likely with its C-terminal fragment. To explore this possibility, we prepared Ig-Hepta that has an myc tag at its C terminus (Ig-Hepta-myc) and performed immunoprecipitation analysis using a commercially available anti-myc monoclonal antibody. The anti-myc antibody precipitated the myc-tagged C-terminal domain together with the N-terminal fragment (Fig.5 B). These results clearly demonstrate non-covalent association of the cleaved N- and C-terminal fragments. In an attempt to determine the proteolytic cleavage site of Ig-Hepta, we first tried immunoaffinity purification of the 32-kDa C-terminal fragment. Such studies, however, have been hampered because of its membrane-bound nature, and hence, difficulties result in obtaining sufficient amounts for sequencing. As an alternative approach, we constructed a chimeric protein that contains a candidate cleavage site sequence and is easy to purify. The chimera was composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of rat Ig-Hepta and the Fc domain of human IgG1 and named sIg-Hepta-Fc (s for soluble). When the chimeric construct was expressed in 293T cells, similar proteolytic processing occurred, yielding a 38-kDa fragment corresponding to the C-terminal Fc portion (Fig.6 A). The C-terminal fragment was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose and found to have the following N-terminal sequence by amino acid sequencing: TSFSILMSPD (Fig.6 B, upper sequence). This result strongly indicates that the cleavage site is Leu993-Thr994, which is located in a juxtamembrane region of the N-terminal extracellular domain (23 amino acid residues N-terminal to the first transmembrane span; Figs.6 B and 7).Figure 7Protein sequence alignment of the juxtamembrane region of LNB-TM7 family members.

https://openalex.org/W1982852897,"Up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is critical for the loss of growth control in a variety of human cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Stimulation of EGFR results in activation of mitogenic signaling pathways including Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). Stat5 activation has been primarily demonstrated in hematopoietic malignancies. Gene disruption studies suggest potentially distinct functions of the Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a and Stat5b, which are encoded by two genes closely linked on human chromosome 17. To determine the function of Stat5 in SCCHN growth control, we studied the expression and constitutive activation of Stat5a and Stat5b in normal and transformed human squamous epithelial cells. Increased constitutive activation of Stat5 was detected in transformed compared with normal squamous cells. Blockade of TGF-alpha or EGFR, abrogated Stat5 activation. Targeting of Stat5b using antisense oligonucleotides inhibited SCCHN growth. In addition, SCCHN cells stably transfected with dominant negative mutant Stat5b failed to proliferate in vitro. In contrast, targeting of Stat5a using either antisense or dominant negative strategies had no effect on cell growth. These results suggest that TGF-alpha/EGFR-mediated autocrine growth of transformed epithelial cells is dependent on activation of Stat5b but not Stat5a."

The underlying mechanism for these critical activities of gelatinase A resides in the ability of this enzyme to degrade multiple components of basement membranes, including type IV and V collagens and laminin. In some cases, the cleavage products generated by gelatinase A have intrinsic biologic activity. For example, incubation of laminin-5 with gelatinase A generates peptide products that facilitate breast epithelial cell attachment and motility (5Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O.

Several in vivo studies have substantiated a critical role for gelatinase A in growth, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix turnover.

The importance of these elements is underscored by the finding that they represent evolutionarily conserved analogs that bind the same set of transcription factors (31Mertens P.R.

In addition, a unique property of YB-1 was observed upon binding to the RE-1, involving DNA conformational changes, opening of the DNA double helix, and stabilization of single-stranded DNA templates (27Mertens P.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) demonstrated specific binding andtrans-activation of the human gelatinase A enhancer element by the tumor suppressor protein p53. The p53 DNA consensus recognition sequence consists of two copies of a 10-bp motif, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′, that are separated by 0–13 bp. In the human gelatinase A enhancer element r2, a homologous sequence to this motif is present. Within the rat RE-1 sequence, the p53 recognition motif shows a perfect match with the exception of one base at the 3′-end. Alignment of the p53, AP2, and YB-1 binding motifs within the rat gelatinase A RE-1 sequence reveals that they are contiguous (Fig.1), raising the question of whether more complex patterns of cooperative/competitive nucleoprotein binding exist. In this report, DNA binding studies were performed with the respective recombinant proteins using both double-stranded and single-stranded RE-1 templates. The results provide evidence for complex DNA binding patterns of the three transcription factors. The results from transient transfection of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with a series of gelatinase A luciferase reporter constructs were in accordance with these binding patterns. Less than additivetrans-activation of reporter gene transcription through p53 and YB-1 was found, whereas AP2 and p53 enhanced gelatinase A gene transcription synergistically. A major increase in RE-1-dependent gene transcription and protein synthesis was observed with the combination of all three transcription factors. Both YB-1 and p53 synthesis are induced by multiple genotoxic stresses, including exposure to ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation (34Ko L.J. Prives C.

Double-stranded probes were prepared by digesting pT4-Luc RE-1 withAsp718 or BglII; the resultant overhanging 5′-ends were dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and end-labeled by means of T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Single- and double-stranded probes were purified on acrylamide gels and eluted, and 2 × 104cpm (2 fmol) of labeled probe were included in each binding reaction. Concentrations and combinations of transcription factors AP2, p53, and YB-1, as detailed in the figure legends, were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), containing 300 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as carrier, in a total volume of 25 μl. The samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide, 5% glycerol gels in a buffer containing 1× Tris borate/EDTA, followed by autoradiography. Recombinant AP2 protein (Promega) employed for the DNA-binding experiments was renatured by step dialysis through urea and purified by DNA affinity chromatography. A pRSET vector (Invitrogen) containing an insert coding for a hexahistidine-T7 epitope-YB-1 fusion protein was a kind gift from Dr. K. Chien (University of California, San Diego, CA). For expression inEscherichia coli, bacteria were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, followed by the addition of M13/T7 helper phage encoding T7 polymerase. Expressed protein was released by sonication, and the purification of recombinant YB-1 was performed with Ni2+ affinity columns as outlined by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Purity of the expressed YB-1 fusion product was ascertained by analytic SDS-PAGE. The recombinant p53 wild type protein used was produced in insect cells infected with a baculovirus vector carrying human p53 cDNA and purified through DNA affinity chromatography (29Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations used are as indicated in the figure legends. HepG2 and Hep3B cells were transfected using CaPO4 as described (43Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For each quadruplicate transfection, 3 μg of the corresponding luciferase construct (pGL2prom, pT4-Luc RE-1, or pT4-Luc1807) and 3 μg of pSV40-β-gal were used. Co-transfection experiments were performed by inclusion of expression plasmid pSG5-AP2, pCos-p53, or pSG5-YB-1, as indicated. Titration experiments were performed with variable amounts of expression plasmid pSG5-p53, as detailed in the figure legends. The amount of total DNA was equalized in each reaction by inclusion of pSG5 plasmid DNA. The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to account for variations in the efficiency of transfection, as described (18Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells at 50–60% confluence in six-well culture plates were washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and calcium phosphate precipitates were added. Medium was removed and replaced with normal culture medium after 6 h. Cells were grown for another 42 h, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 400 μl of Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4) on ice for 30 min, followed by measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase assays were performed with 100 μl of the lysates as previously described (31Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a commercial chemiluminescence assay (Promega). All transfections were performed in triplicate to quadruplicate and were repeated at least three times. Transfection results were averaged and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. To determine the effects of endogenous p53 stimulation by etoposide, cells were transiently transfected with construct pT4-Luc1807, pT4-Luc RE-1, or the promoterless pGL2basic vector (Promega) and expression plasmids as detailed above. At 24 h prior to harvest, the controls were given fresh medium, and the experimental p53 induction group was given fresh medium containing 10 μm etoposide. Harvest and quantitative determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were as detailed above. Cells were transfected with the various expression plasmids as above. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin was added. The media were conditioned for 24 h and cleared by centrifugation for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. Aliquots (15 μl) were loaded on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mg/ml gelatin and separated by electrophoresis. Processing of gels was as described (44Mertens P.R. Espenkott V. Venjakob B. Heintz B. Handt S. Sieberth H.G. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The major gelatinolytic activity with approximate size of 66 kDa was quantified by laser densitometry and standardized using serial dilutions of known quantities of purified gelatinase A. Statistical significances were determined for paired comparisons using Student's t test or by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Prior efforts have focused on the characterization of potent enhancer elements (denoted RE-1 and r2, respectively) located in the near 5′ regions of the rat and human gelatinase A genes and have demonstrated that specific interactions of AP2 and YB-1 drive high level gelatinase A transcription (27Mertens P.R.

Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Given the observations by Bian and Sun (29Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) concerning the specific interaction of the p53 protein with the human r2 element, we set out to determine whether more complex interactions of these three transcription factors occur and whether such interactions affect gelatinase A gene transcription and protein synthesis in defined hepatocarcinoma cell lines. The first set of experiments used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to examine the binding properties of various combinations of purified transcription factors AP2, p53, and YB-1 to the RE-1. With the double-stranded RE-1 probe, individual binding of all three transcription factors, AP2, p53, and YB-1, was detected, although with significantly different affinities (Fig.2). Recombinant YB-1 was used in a higher concentration (16 ng) than that chosen for the AP2 and p53 proteins (2 ng). The higher concentration of YB-1 used for the double-stranded binding studies is based on our prior demonstration of a relatively low binding affinity of this protein for double-stranded as opposed to single-stranded templates (30Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). With the combination of AP2 and YB-1 (Fig. 2, lane 7), an additional band (labeled 7>) with lower mobility appeared, which represents AP2/YB-1 heterodimers, as previously demonstrated (27Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AP2 facilitated YB-1 binding to the double-stranded RE-1 template, as reported (27Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,cf. lanes 6 and 7). The combination of AP2 and p53 yielded two bands with the same mobilities as AP2 alone (cf. lanes 1and 8). However, the binding affinity was increased by greater than 20-fold as determined by densitometry (cf. lanes 4 and 8). Antibody supershift studies indicated that the prominent bands in lane 8 consisted of AP2/p53 heterodimers (data not shown). The inclusion of p53 protein in the binding reaction significantly decreased YB-1 binding to the double-stranded RE-1 template (cf. lanes 6 and 9). The combination of all three transcription factors resulted in a major change in the binding pattern (lane 10). The band with the lowest mobility observed with the AP2 and YB-1 combination (labeled 7> in lane 7) was diminished, as were all bands corresponding to YB-1 mono- and multimers (lanes 3 and 7). In contrast, the high affinity binding pattern observed with AP2 and p53 was conserved. These changes indicate that transcription factor binding patterns to the RE-1 are complex and can be modified by the presence or absence of any one of the three proteins examined. In general, the EMSA studies indicate that p53 decreases YB-1 binding to the double-stranded template and augments AP-2 binding. Protein titration experiments were performed to further characterize the cooperative AP2/p53 and competitive p53/YB-1 binding interactions. As shown in Fig.3 A, AP2 binding alone to the double-stranded RE-1 oligonucleotide was not detectable at the chosen concentration and exposure time (8 h, lane 1), whereas there was a faint band apparent with recombinant p53 alone (labeled 1> in lane 2). The addition of p53 protein ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 ng to a fixed, 2-ng amount of AP2 yielded a major increase in total shifted RE-1 oligonucleotide consisting of three discrete shifted complexes of diminishing mobilities (2>, 3>, and 4>, respectively). Complex formation was maximal at an AP2/p53 protein ratio of 2:1 and was virtually absent at an AP2/p53 ratio of 1:2. These experiments indicate that p53 increases the binding affinity of AP2 for the RE-1 oligonucleotide in a concentration-dependent manner. The interactions of p53 and YB-1 within the context of the RE-1 were examined in a similar series of experiments. YB-1 multimerization was evidenced by a ladder (labeled 1> through 4>) of bands of decreasing mobilities, as determined previously (30Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lov"
https://openalex.org/W2324992856,"Acquisition of resistance to anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis) is considered to be a requirement for transformed intestinal epithelial cells to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs. Increased Src kinase activity, which is a feature of a large proportion of colorectal cancers, has been identified as one of the factors that can contribute to anoikis resistance. However, the molecular mechanism by which high levels of Src activity contribute to anoikis resistance in intestinal epithelial cells is unknown. Here we show that high Src activity confers resistance to anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells, at least in part, by inducing Bcl-xL overexpression, and that this induction is mediated by the MEK/MAPK pathway. Based on the findings reported here, and on our previous study showing that Bcl-xL plays a critical role in ras-induced resistance to anoikis, we propose that the increased Bcl-xL levels found in colorectal cancers play a significant role in the induction of resistance to anoikis during the progression of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2119419671,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) and Akt are two multifunctional kinases involved in many cellular responses. Although Akt and Ca2+ signals have been implicated in NF-κB activation in response to certain stimuli, these results are still controversial, and the mechanism(s) involved remains unknown. In this study, we show the roles that CaMKK and Akt play in regulating interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced NF-κB signaling. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, IL-1β induces IκB kinase β (IKKβ) activation, IκBα degradation, NF-κB transactivation, and weak Akt activation. A CaMKK inhibitor (KN-93) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) do not inhibit IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. However, IL-1β-induced NF-κB activity is attenuated by increased intracellular calcium in response to ionomycin, UTP, or thapsigargin or by overexpression of CaMKKc and/or Akt. Ionomycin and CaMKKc overexpression increases Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 and enzyme activity. Under these conditions or upon overexpression of wild type Akt, IL-1β-induced IKKβ activity is diminished. Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of Akt abolishes IKKβ inhibition by CaMKKc and ionomycin, suggesting that Akt acts as a mediator of CaMKK signaling to inhibit IL-1β-induced IKK activity at an upstream target site. We have also identified a novel interaction between CaMKK-stimulated Akt and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which plays a key role in IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. CaMKKc and Akt overexpression decreases IRAK1-mediated NF-κB activity and its association with MyD88 in response to IL-1β stimulation. Furthermore, CaMKKc and Akt overexpression increases IRAK1 phosphorylation at Thr100, and point mutation of this site abrogates the inhibitory effect of Akt on IRAK1-mediated NF-κB activation. Taken together, these results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-1β signaling and suggest that CaMKK-dependent Akt activation inhibits IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation through interference with the coupling of IRAK1 to MyD88.

Different receptors are known to use distinct combinations of intracellular proteins to initiate NF-κB activation; however, some signaling pathways converge downstream into a common pathway that leads to activation of the IκB kinase (IKK)1 complex and the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) (3DiDonato J.A.

Although several serine/threonine kinases have been suggested to activate IKK, the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) has been identified as the upstream kinase (6Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar).

Many of these responses are activated by the rapid activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following signal transduction by IL-1β bound to the type I IL-1 receptor (9Siebenlist U. Franzoso G.

Activation of the type I IL-1 receptor leads to recruitment of IRAK to the receptor complex via its association with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (10Huang J.N. Gao X., Li, S. Cao Z.D. Proc.

Upon recruitment, IRAK is highly phosphorylated and subsequently dissociates from the receptor complex to interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (14Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), which in turn is involved in NIK and NF-κB activation (6Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase controlled by membrane phospholipid inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and its downstream activating target, Akt, have been identified in many cell types and are implicated in a wide variety of biological responses (16Duronio V.

Alternatively, overexpression of kinase-dead Akt abrogated platelet-derived growth factor- and TNF-α-induced IKK and NF-κB activation (25Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M.

One conclusion of these studies is that Akt does not act alone to stimulate NF-κB, and signals from other pathways are required (17Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.L. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that wortmannin can increase lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or cytokine-induced expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene, whose regulation definitely requires NF-κB activation (33Xie Q.W. Kashiwabar Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diaz-Guerraet al. (34Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Castrillo A. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. J.

Despite both positive and negative control on NF-κB activity having been proposed, some studies have ruled out the involvement of the PI3K signal cascade in NF-κB activation by TNF-α, IL-1 (22Pan Z.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8865-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulatory role of the PI3K/Akt signal cascade in NF-κB activity appears to be cell- and ligand-specific. Another possible explanation to account for the discrepancies discussed above might be the existence of multiple targeting molecules within the signaling cascades for transduction of NF-κB activity being controlled by the PI3K/Akt pathway in different manners. Thus far, the most clearly characterized target for the positive regulatory role of PI3K/Akt is IKKα. The results from Ozes et al. (25Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) revealed that IKKα, but not IKKβ, can serve as a phosphorylation target for Akt at the Thr23 residue and that this phosphorylation-dependent activation of IKKα contributes to NF-κB activation by TNF-α. The results from Sizemore et al. (29Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

However, another recent report from Madrid et al. (19Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin A.S. Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Akt, functioning through IKKα, IKKβ, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, stimulates the p65 subunit of NF-κB, in turn stimulating the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. This action of Akt is independent of NF-κB translocation, IκB phosphorylation, and degradation (18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, a recent finding implies that the involvement of the PI3K pathway in IκB-independent NF-κB activation is not related to stimulation of IKKs (40Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). In addition to the action of PI3K/Akt, calcium-mediated signaling pathways, in particular those involving the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and calcineurin (PP2B), have been implicated in NF-κB regulation. In the case of the CaMKs, we demonstrated previously that increased calcium mobilization in mouse macrophages enhanced the responses of LPS in IKK activation (41Chen B.C. Lin W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Chen B.C. Chou C.F. Lin W.W. J. Biol.

These potentiating effects initiated by the calcium signal are susceptible to inhibition by the general CaMKs inhibitor, KN-93. Supporting this notion is the finding by Hughes et al. (45Hughes K. Edin S. Antonsson A. Grundstrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36008-36013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that CaMKII mediates T cell receptor/CD3- and phorbol ester-induced IKK activation. Another indication of positive control by the calcium signal is the observation that histamine-stimulated increase in NF-κB reporter gene activity is dependent on the oscillating intracellular calcium frequency (46Hu Q. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33995-33998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As well as acting through IKK activation (41Chen B.C.

In the case of calcineurin, a serine/threonine phosphatase controlled by cellular calcium, although its role in regulating NF-κB-dependent transcription has been studied, conflicting data have been obtained suggesting that it may act in a cell-specific manner (48Frantz B. Nordby E.C. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C.V. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 9: 861-870Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 49Conboy I.M. Manoli D. Mhaiskar V. Jones P.P.

It was recently demonstrated that Akt is also activated following the phosphorylation of Thr308 by CaMKKα, a CaMK kinase, whose activity also depends on the presence of calcium/calmodulin (51Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluate the roles that PI3K/Akt and CaMKK play in IL-1β-induced signaling. We present evidence showing that upon intracellular calcium up-regulation by ionomycin, UTP, or thapsigargin, IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation was concomitantly decreased in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. This involves the sequential activation of CaMKK and Akt through a Thr308phosphorylation step, which leads to phosphorylation of IRAK1 and a reduction in its association with MyD88 in response to IL-1β. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. IL-1β was obtained from PeproTech (London, UK). KN-93 and calcineurin substrate (RII phosphopeptide) (catalog number 207008) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection agent were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for IκBα, IKKβ, NIK, Akt, IRAK1, MyD88, CaMKKα, protein A/G beads, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Akt phosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473 were from Cell Signaling & Neuroscience (St. Louis, MO). Plasmid pGEX-IκBα (amino acids 5–55) was provided by Dr. Frank S. Lee (Pennsylvania Medical Center). Plasmid pGEX-CaMKIV was a kind gift from Dr. A. R. Means (Duke University, Durham, NC). Plasmid PGEX-p65 (amino acids 354–551) was provided by Dr. H. Sakurai (Tanabe Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan). FK506 was a kind gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan). Histone H2B was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All of the materials for SDS-PAGE were obtained from Bio-Rad. All of the other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). pGL2-ELAM-Luc, which is under the control of one NF-κB-binding site, and pBK-CMV-Lac Z were provided by Dr. S.-L. Hsieh (Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan). Constitutively active CaMKK (CaMKKc) and dominant negative (DN) CaMKK were kind gifts from Dr. Thomas R. Soderling (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). The expression vectors encoding dominant negative mutant IKKα (pRK-Myc-IKKα, K44A), wild type IKKβ (pRK-Myc-IKKβ), dominant negative mutant IKKβ (K44A), wild type NIK, dominant negative mutant NIK (KK429–430AA), wild type IRAK1 (in pRK5 expression vector), and kinase-dead IRAK1 (K239S) were gifts from the Tularik Corp. (San Francisco, CA). Wild type and kinase-dead Akt were provided by Dr. James R. Woodgett (Toronto, Canada). Constitutively active calcineurin catalytic subunit (CNc), which is designed to mimic proteolyzed forms and have calcium independence, was a gift from Dr. G. R. Crabtree (Stanford, CA). For these assays, 5 × 105 293 cells were seeded into 6-well (35-mm) plates. The cells were transfected on the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 0.5 μg of pGL2-ELAM-Luc and 1 μg of pBK-CMV-LacZ and, when needed, other expression constructs at the amounts indicated. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for another 24 h before harvesting. To assess the effects of several inhibitors, drugs were added to the cells 20 min before IL-1β stimulation. Luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and was normalized on the basis of LacZ expression. The level of induction of luciferase activity was determined as a ratio in comparison with cells with no stimulation. 293 cells grown on glass slides were loaded with 3 μmFura-2/acetoxymethylester (AM) and pluronic F-127 (0.02% v/v) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 45 min. The fluorescence was monitored on a PTI M series spectrofluorometer with dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i ) was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, using aK d value of 224 nm for the Fura-2/Ca2+ equilibrium, as described by Grynkiewiczet al. (52Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After treatment with the indicated agents or after transfection with the indicated plasmids, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5. To detect the increased phosphorylated form of Akt, the cells transfected with wild type Akt and with or without CaMKKc were allowed to sit for 1 day before treatment with IL-1β or ionomycin for the indicated times. The samples of equal amounts of protein (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated in TBST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.02% Tween, pH 7.4) containing 1% nonfat milk. The proteins were visualized by specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions. 293 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody against IKKβ, Akt, CaMKKα, or IRAK1 in the presence of A/G-agarose beads overnight. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl 2 , 2 mm DTT). The kinase reactions were performed by incubating immunoprecipitated beads with 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. For the IKKβ kinase assay, 2.5 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IκBα (amino acids 5–55) was added as a substrate. For CaMKKα kinase assay, 2 μg of bacterially expressed GST-CaMKIV was added as a substrate. For Akt and IRAK1 kinase assays, 100 μg/ml histone H2B and 50 μg/ml of myelin basic protein were added as the substrates, respectively. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12% (IKKβ), 8% (CaMKKα), or 15% (Akt or IRAK1) SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To assess IRAK1 as the Akt phosphorylation target, IRAK1 and Akt proteins were obtained by immunoprecipitation from 293 cells overexpressing IRAK1 and Akt, respectively. Kinase assays were performed with IRAK1- and Akt-conjugated beads in 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. 293 cells plated on 60-mm dishes were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-β, 100 nm ionomycin, or both for 20 min. The cells were then harvested, lysed in 1 ml of PD buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 300 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm DTT), and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody against Akt or MyD88 in the presence of A/G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated beads were then washed three times with PD buffer. The samples were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with IRAK1 antibody. Calcineurin activity was measured by the malachite green assay system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Briefly, confluent cells on 35-mm dishes were washed three times with physiological saline solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11 mmglucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After this preincubation, the cells were incubated with or without FK506 (100 ng/ml) for 20 min and then treated with 100 nm ionomycin for another 5 min. The cells were washed three times with physiological saline solution without KH2PO4, collected on ice, and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was immediately used for calcineurin activity assay. Free phosphate released from calcineurin substrate was determined in the reaction buffer (200 mm Tris, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, and 500 nm okadaic acid) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding malachite green/Tween solution for another 20 min, and then the OD620 was measured. Calcineurin activity was determined as pmol/min/mg protein using different concentrations of KH2PO4 as standard. The values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Analysis of variance was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In HEK 293 cells, treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-1β induced IKKβ activity in a time-dependent manner, beginning after 5-min incubation and reaching a maximum after 30 min (Fig. 1 A). IκBα is targeted for IKK-specific phosphorylation followed by ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation and thus results in the dissociation of NF-κB from IκB and its transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in parallel with the rapid onset of IKK activation, IκBα degradation was apparent after 5 min of incubation with IL-1β and displayed a time-depend"

Mutations in the epidermal keratin genes, keratin 5 or keratin 14 lead to the disruption of keratin filament assembly, resulting in an autosomal dominant inherited blistering skin disease, epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). We investigated a large EBS kindred who exhibited a markedly heterogeneous clinical presentation and detected two distinct keratin 5 mutations in the proband, the most severely affected. One missense mutation (E170K) in the highly conserved helix initiation peptide sequence of the 1A rod domain was found in all the affected family members. In contrast, the other missense mutation (E418K) was found only in the proband. The E418K mutation was located in the stutter region, an interruption in the heptad repeat regularity, whose function as yet remains unclear. We hypothesized that this mutated stutter allele was clinically silent when combined with the wild type allele but aggravates the clinical severity of EBS caused by the E170K mutation on the other allele. To confirm this in vitro, we transfected mutant keratin 5 cDNA into cultured cells. Although only 12.7% of the cells transfected with the E170K mutation alone showed disrupted keratin filament aggregations, significantly more cells (30.0%) cotransfected with both E170K and E418K mutations demonstrated keratin aggregation (p < 0.05). These transfection assay results corresponded to the heterogeneous clinical findings of the EBS patient in this kindred. We have identified the first case of both compound heterozygous dominant (E170K) and recessive (E418K) mutations in any keratin gene and confirmed the significant involvement of the stutter region in the assembly and organization of the keratin intermediate filament network in vitro.

This domain exists in four segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) interrupted by three non-helical linkers (L1, L12, and L2) and a so-called, stutter region (6Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev.

The stutter region is an interruption in the regularity of the heptad repeat substructure, which generates a helix phase reversal near the middle of the 2B rod domain segment and is considered to be the result of a deletion of three residues at the junction of two heptads (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D. Parry D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although the stutter region is highly conserved among all IF (7Conway J.F.

Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene, which encode the epidermal keratins K5 and K14, respectively, lead to the epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), the majority of which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are characterized by intraepidermal blister formation (9Fuchs E.V. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD1999: 280-299Google Scholar). According to the clinical severity of blister formation, EBS can be subdivided into three major subtypes (10Fine J.D. Eady R.A. Bauer E.A. Briggaman R.A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Christiano A.

We have studied an EBS family in which the affected individuals showed a variable phenotype and have identified two distinct KRT5mutations in the proband, the most severely affected member. He is compound heterozygous for both a dominant mutation in the helix initiation peptide (HIP) and a recessive mutation in the stutter region of K5. To confirm whether the stutter mutation exacerbated the clinical severity of EBS caused by the dominant mutation on the other allele, we examined cultured cells transfected with the mutated KRT5cDNA corresponding to the proband's mutations. Here we show evidence that the stutter region plays an important role in the organization of the KIF network. The proband (Fig. 1, III:4) was a 22-year-old man with blistering over his entire body from birth and was given a diagnosis of EBS-K. Although the blistering on the trunk improved with age, he continued to get severe blisters and erosions on the hands and feet after minor trauma with a worsening of symptoms during the summer months (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy of the proband showed that cytolysis occurred within the basal keratinocytes consistent with EBS, although apparent clumping of keratin filaments was not observed (data not shown). His family had several affected members (Fig. 1). An older brother (III:6) also presented with blistering over the whole body since birth, with similar clinical findings to the proband, but died in a traffic accident in childhood. In contrast, his deceased father (II:6), deceased grandmother (I:2), and his paternal uncle (II:2) developed few blisters that were restricted to the soles only after extensive walking. They seldom exhibited blisters with increasing age; therefore, they were unaware that they had any disease. All of them were given the diagnosis of EBS-WC, not EBS-K. Thus the markedly heterogeneous clinical presentation in this dominantly inherited EBS family could not be explained by a single dominant keratin mutation (Fig. 1).Figure 2Clinical features of the proband. The proband continues to get occasional blisters and erosion on the soles and palms, particularly in areas of trauma. Old and new blisters and erosion with crusting are seen on the soles, heels, and dorsum of toes. The other affected family members have never presented any similar clinical findings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was used as a template for PCR amplification. The KRT5and KRT14 genes were amplified by the methods previously reported (25Stephens K. Ehrlich P. Weaver M., Le, R. Spencer A. Sybert V.P. J. Invest.

Specifically, for amplification of the 407-bp DNA fragment comprising the 339-bp exon 1 of KRT5 (nucleotides 216–555 in the cDNA; GenBankTM accession number NM000424) containing the paternal mutation E170K, the following primers were used; 5′-GAGGATATCCATCAGCACTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTTCTTTCTCTCTTTGGC-3′ (reverse). For amplification of the 558-bp DNA fragment comprising the 221-bp of exon 7 of KRT5(nucleotides 1219–1440 in the cDNA; GenBankTMaccession number NM000424) containing the maternal mutation E418K, the following primers were used; 5′-GAGAGCCGAGATTGACAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGAGCAGCCTCGCTTTATC-3′ (reverse). Fifty-microliter reactions containing 250 ng of DNA, 200 μm of each dNTP, 450 nm of each primer, 2 units of Amplitaq polymerase, and 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer with 1.5 mm MgCl2(PerkinElmer Life Sciences, San Francisco, CA) were initially denatured at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. DNA sequencing of all the PCR products was carried out using a Genetic Analyzer 310A automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences-ABI, Foster City, CA). Because there was no proper restriction enzyme to verify each mutation, we created restriction enzyme sites recognized by BsrBI. The genomic template was amplified by PCR under the same conditions with the following primers: for amplification of the 333-bp DNA fragment containing the E170K mutation and changing the base from A to G at base 512 in exon 1, forward primer 5′-GTGGTGCCGGTAGTGGATT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGTTGAGGGTCTTGATCCGC-3′ were used. For amplification of the 321-bp DNA fragment containing the E418K mutation and changing an A to G at base 1256 in exon 7, forward primer 5′-GAAAGAGGGCAAGGAAGGGGCCTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTGAGGGCCAGCTCCCCACGCCGC-3′ were used. Both mutations (G to A substitutions) resulted in the loss of the restriction enzyme site for BsrBI. Using human keratinocyte cDNA as a template, full-length human KRT5was amplified by PCR with primer pairs to generate artificialBamHI and HindIII sites and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. After digestion with these enzymes, the full-length KRT5 cDNA insert was ligated into pCMV-tag vectors with a FLAG sequence (pK5F) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which allows FLAG epitope tagging of the C terminus of the K5 protein. The point-mutated KRT5 cDNAs corresponding to the E170K and E418K mutations were generated with the use of the site-directed mutagenesis system Mutan-Super Express kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and subcloned into the same vectors (pK5E170KF and pK5E418KF). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence of 5% CO2. The day before transfection, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated into a four-welled chamber coverglass at 105 cells per well. Four different transfections, including the wild type KRT5 cDNA alone (pK5F), the combinations with an equimolar ratio of the wild type KRT5cDNA and the mutated KRT5 cDNA (pK5F/pK5E170KF or pK5F/pK5E418KF), and the combinations with an equimolar ratio of the two mutated KRT5 cDNA (pK5E170KF/pK5E418KF) were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen-BRI, Bethesda, MD) according to the distributor's recommendation. At 24 h after transfection, MDCK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton-X for 10 min. To detect transfected cells, an anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to recognize the FLAG tag as a primary antibody (1:100 dilution), and fluorescein-conjugated goat IgG against mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody. All cells were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV300). The cells with keratin aggregates were counted in three different areas, two from each experimental replicate, and the results obtained from six counts were expressed as the mean ± S.D. KRT5 and KRT14, including all the exons and exon-intron borders, were amplified using the proband's genomic DNA and PCR primers and directly sequenced. There was no mutation in KRT14, whereas two novel heterozygous point mutations were found in KRT5. One mutation was a G to A transversion at base 508, leading to the exchange of a glutamic acid to lysine at residue 170 (E170K) in the 1A domain (Fig. 1 A). Another mutation was a G to A transversion at base 1252, leading to the same amino acid substitution at residue 418 (E418K) in the 2B domain (Fig. 1 B). To verify each mutation,KRT5 was amplified by PCR with primers generating new restriction enzyme sites recognized by BsrBI (Fig. 1,D and E). Both mutations (G → A substitutions) resulted in the loss of the restriction enzyme site forBsrBI. These mutations were not found among 100 normal alleles, suggesting that they are not polymorphisms within the normal Japanese population. The altered glutamic acid at residue 170 is within the second residue of the HIP, a well conserved motif among all IF types. Notably, another mutated glutamic acid at residue 418 in the stutter region of the 2B domain was also highly conserved among all types of IF (Fig. 3). Analysis of KRT5 of the proband's relatives (II:2, II:7, III:5, III:7) revealed that the E170K mutation was on the paternal allele and the E418K mutation on the maternal allele. His affected uncle (II:2), who showed a milder clinical phenotype (EBS-WC) than the proband's (EBS-K), had only the E170K mutation, while his mother (II:7) and his brother (III:7) with the E418K mutation were clinically normal (Fig. 1 C). We therefore hypothesized that the E170K mutation caused the EBS-WC phenotype in the family, and we suggest that the proband's clinical phenotype was aggravated by the E418K mutation consistent with the proband being a compound heterozygote for dominant and recessive mutations. Although we could not perform mutational analysis with DNA from his deceased older brother (III:6), the similar clinical severity of EBS suggests that he might also be a compound heterozygote for dominant (E170K) and recessive (E418K) mutations. We examined whether the clinical heterogeneity of the EBS family could be demonstrated in a cell culture system. Three mammalian expression vectors containing the wild type KRT5 (pK5F), the mutatedKRT5 correspondent with the E170K mutation (pK5E170KF), and the E418K mutation (pK5E418KF) were constructed. Four distinct gene transfections using the MDCK cells were performed, including the pK5F alone, a combination with equimolar ratio of pK5F and either of pK5E170KF or pK5E418KF, and a combination with equimolar ratio of the two mutated KRT5 cDNA (pK5E170KF and pK5E418KF). We chose MDCK cells for the transfection study, because they do not express endogenous K5 and K14 (27Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1477-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and previous studies have demonstrated that MDCK cells transfected with the human KRT9gene could readily incorporate K9 into their endogenous KIF network (28Kobayashi S. Tanaka T. Matsuyoshi N. Imamura S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against the tag sequence, FLAG, was used to detect the KIF network derived from transfected KRT5. The cells transfected with pK5F alone showed fine bundles of keratin filaments extended throughout the cytoplasm without disturbing the cells' morphology (Fig. 4,A–C), whereas cells cotransfected with the wild type and mutated KRT5 gene (pK5E170KF/pK5F), (pK5E418KF/pK5F), or both mutated KRT5 (pK5E170KF/pK5E418KF) exhibited small ball-like filament aggregates indicating a disruption in the keratin network (Fig. 4, D–I). The percentage of the cells with keratin clumping in each transfection assay was as follows, pK5F (1.5 ± 1.8), pK5F/pK5E418KF (4.4 ± 1.7), pK5F/pK5E170KF (12.7 ± 4.3), and pK5E170KF/pK5E418KF (30.0 ± 3.1) (Fig.5). Statistical analysis showed that significantly more clumped cells were observed in cells cotransfected with pK5E170KF/pK5E418KF than those with pK5F/pK5E170KF (p < 0.05). These results suggested that the compound heterozygous mutations (E170K and E418K) within the keratin genes resulted in a more severe keratin network disturbance than the heterozygote for dominant mutation (E170K) alone in vitro. This is concordant with the markedly variable severity of EBS phenotype in this family. We have presented the first case of a compound heterozygote with both dominant and recessive mutations, and have demonstrated that the recessive stutter region mutation (E418K) in KRT5exacerbated the disruption in the KIF network caused by the dominant mutation (E170K). Although most cases of EBS are autosomal dominant and are caused by missense mutations (9Fuchs E.V. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD1999: 280-299Google Scholar), whether they are fully or partially dominant is still not clear. For example, a partial dominantKRT14 mutation was found in an EBS family with consanguineous marriage, in which homozygotes had a more severe clinical phenotype than heterozygotes (29Hu Z.L. Smith L. Martins S. Bonifas J.M. Chen H. Epstein E.H., Jr. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 360-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Usually, compound heterozygous genotypes involve different recessive alleles at the same locus; nevertheless, in some diseases compound heterozygotes with one dominant allele and one recessive allele are known (30Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 3-45Google Scholar). In these cases, although the heterozygous individuals with a recessive allele are phenotypically normal, heterozygotes for the dominant allele develop the disease, and compound heterozygotes usually manifest more severe symptoms than heterozygotes due to the dominant allele (30Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 3-45Google Scholar). For instance, we recently reported such cases of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa in which type VII collagen was the defective gene (31Shimizu H. McGrath J.A. Christiano A.M. Nishikawa T. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 119-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Heterozygotes with a dominant glycine substitution mutation in COL7A1 presented with only toe nail dystrophy without skin fragility, whereas compound heterozygotes for this dominant and recessive mutation led to dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with marked skin fragility (32Shimizu H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Hatta N. Nishikawa T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 419-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Sato-Matsumura K.C.

In this study, the mother and brother who were heterozygous for the E418K mutation were clinically normal, however, it was difficult to demonstrate such a subclinical abnormality in vivo. We examined how the E418K mutation would influence KIF formation in vitro using a transfection assay, for which several studies have been done to examine how EBS mutations perturb the KIF assembly (27Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1477-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,34Livingston R.J. Sybert V.P. Smith L.T. Dale B.A. Presland R.B. Stephens K. J. Invest.

In cultured EBS keratinocytes, keratin aggregates were observed in the majority of EBS-DM keratinocytes but in only a few of the EBS-K cultures (19Letai A. Coulombe P.A. McCormick M.B., Yu, Q.C. Hutton E. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with a mutated keratin gene corresponding to each type of EBS showed similar results (19Letai A. Coulombe P.A. McCormick M.B., Yu, Q.C. Hutton E. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transfection assay correlated well with the clinical severity of EBS and to the degree to which a particular mutation perturbed filament assembly. In our study, the keratin aggregate formation was observed in significantly more cells when cotransfected with E170K and E418K mutations, which was concordant with the clinical findings. This indicates that the E418K mutation exacerbates KIF disruption, similar to the proband phenotype. The locations of these EBS mutations in the keratin gene structure are known to correlate with the disease severity. We know that the ends of the rod domain, HIP and helix termination peptide (HTP), where most EBS-DM mutations are situated, are important areas in which K5 and K14 assemble into filaments (11Coulombe P.A. Hutton M.E. Vassar R. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1661-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Lane E.B. Rugg E.L. Navsaria H. Leigh I.M. Heagerty A.H. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Eady R.A.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 240-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent research has suggested a role for each region of keratin proteins in heterodimer formation, helix stabilization, and filament assembly (36Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M., Ku, N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 37Herrmann H. Strelkov S.V. Feja B. Rogers K.R. Brettel M. Lustig A. Haner M. Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. Burkhard P. Aebi U.

Biol. 2001; 306: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), nevertheless, much about IF structure and function remains unknown. Particularly, the functions of the IF stutter region have yet to be fully elucidated. The fact that the stutter region is highly conserved among all IFs (7Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) indicates its importance in IF structure and function. Two computer-based molecular models of the stutter region have been proposed. Steinert and North et al. (39Steinert P.M. North A.C. Parry D.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 19S-24SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,40North A.C. Steinert P.M. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1994; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) concluded that the stutter was limited to a very short distance and, therefore, did not cause a significant interruption or kink in the coiled-coil α helix structure. Conversely, Brown et al.(41Brown J.H. Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1996; 26: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) proposed that the unwound coiled-coil model, in which the stutter is located, may contribute to filament flexibility, suggesting that it has a profound effect on the structure and can modify both the assembly and interactions of these protein. The relatively important contribution of the stutter region in IF formation was shown by Hermann et al. (36Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M., Ku, N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 42Herrmann H. Aebi U. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 319-336PubMed Google Scholar) using the “stutterless” recombinant type III IF, vimentin. This stutterless vimentin assembled into seemingly normal “uni-length” fibrils, whose formation was the first important step in the assembly, but elongation of these short IFs into longer filaments was slowed down considerably (36Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M., Ku, N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 42Herrmann H. Aebi U. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 319-336PubMed Google Scholar). It suggested that the stutter region might play specific roles in the elongation of IFs. Although glutamic acid at residue 418 in the stutter region has been extremely highly conserved among different IFs (Fig. 3), only a few cells cotransfected with pK5E418K/pK5F exhibited keratin clumping in this study. One reason for this is that, because both glutamic acid and lysine are polar amino acids, this substitution doesn't influence the irregularity of the heptad repeats in the stutter, resulting in a limited influence on KIF formation. Another possibility is that the stutter region may contribute to the elongation of KIFs rather than the coiled-coil heterodimer formation as Hermann suggested (42Herrmann H. Aebi U. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 319-336PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations affecting the early stage of KIF assembly would be expected to have the most severe effects on the KIF network for assembly causing EBS-DM, whereas mutations in areas involved in the higher order KIF assembly processes might have more subtle effects similar to EBS-WC. However, the fact the E418K mutation can exacerbate KIF disturbance when combined with a pathogenic mutation on the other allele suggests the stutter region plays some role in the KIF network organization. In conclusion, we have shown that a compound heterozygote for a dominant and a recessive KRT5 mutation can result in a more severe disturbance in KIF assembly than a heterozygote for a dominant mutation in vitro. We confirmed the fact that the recessive mutation found in the stutter region of the K5 molecule exacerbated this KIF disturbance. These results and transfection assay data emphasize the sensitivity and importance of the stutter region in the structural alterations and organization of the KIF network.

Through incompletely elucidated mechanisms, TF serves additional functions in tumor-associated angiogenesis and metastasis. We have studied interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a possible link between TF-FVIIa complex formation and subsequent processes. Recombinant human FVIIa induced the up-regulation of both IL-8 mRNA and protein in a FVIIa dose- and time-dependent fashion. A neutralizing antibody to TF reduced this induction by 93 ± 5%. Active site-inhibited FVIIa had no stimulatory effect and completely blocked that of FVIIa. This confirms that the increased IL-8 production was dependent on the formation of TF-FVIIa complexes and the proteolytic activity of FVIIa. The IL-8 promoter contains DNA binding sites for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). In response to FVIIa, the DNA binding activity of both NF-κB and AP-1 was enhanced in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, theIL-8 promoter was transcriptionally activated both in a luciferase reporter system and a nuclear run-off assay. Moreover, IL-8 mRNA stability was significantly enhanced by FVIIa-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38.

These processes are reduced by the use of TF antibodies (6Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the mechanisms by which TF-FVIIa enhances angiogenesis and metastasis remain poorly understood. One mechanism by which TF-FVIIa complex formation may function in these processes is through intracellular signaling events.Intracellular signal transduction pathways induced by the TF-FVIIa complex have been extensively studied. This group first reported FVIIa-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (12Rottingen J.A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that TF-FVIIa signaling activated MAPKs (p38, ERK1/2, JNK) (13Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recently, activations of Src-like kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) were suggested to be important in TF-FVIIa signaling (16Versteeg H.H. Hoedemaeker I. Diks S.H. Stam J.C. Spaargaren M. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. van Deventer S.J.H. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28750-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At present, it has not been fully elucidated how these cellular signals relate to TF effects under conditions such as metastasis and angiogenesis. One possibility is that TF-FVIIa signaling can induce the expression of growth regulators affecting downstream cellular processes. Therefore we employed cDNA arrays to study the alterations in gene expression in response to FVIIa in HaCaT cells. Up-regulation (>2×) of more than 25 genes was seen (15Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), one of which was interleukin-8.IL-8, a member of the CXC chemokine family, was originally identified as a neutrophil chemoattractant (17Walz A. Peveri P. Aschauer H. Baggiolini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and has later been shown to be a potent proangiogenic factor inducing corneal vascularization (18Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Elner V.M. Martonyi C.L. Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Elner S.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 1279-1284PubMed Google Scholar) and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (19Koch A.E. Polverini P.J.

Takayama K. Kawasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Hara N. Hayashi S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 120: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IL-8 production correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells (21De Larco J.E. Wuertz B.R. Rosner K.A. Erickson S.A. Gamache D.E. Manivel J.C. Furcht L.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Basal production of IL-8 is normally low or undetectable but can be rapidly induced by different stimuli such as cytokines, viruses, and reactive oxidants and is then secreted from a variety of cells, including keratinocytes. IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are the strongest known stimuli for IL-8 expression in most cell types (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This rapid induction is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by binding of inducible transcription factors to the IL-8 promoter. The IL-8 promoter contains a single transcriptional initiation site with a consensus TATA box. The 5′-regulatory region of the IL-8 gene (−1 to −133), containing binding sites for NF-κB, NF-IL-6, and AP-1 (23Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 24Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is essential and sufficient to regulate the IL-8 expression. Several AU-rich elements (AREs) located in the 3′-untranslated region have been reported to be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-8 expression (25Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar).In light of the involvement of TF and IL-8 in angiogenesis and metastasis and the up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA by formation of the TF-FVIIa complex (15Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), it is of interest to study how the mRNA is up-regulated. We report here that the major part of the increase is caused by post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization and is followed by significantly increased expression of IL-8 protein.DISCUSSIONBesides its primary function in coagulation, TF has other functions in cellular processes, such as angiogenesis and metastasis. Although it has been shown that TF-FVIIa triggers intracellular signaling, it is still unclear how these specific events influence downstream biological functions. We report here that IL-8 production in HaCaT cells was significantly induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner by rhFVIIa stimulation. No other clotting factors were included in our system. The inhibitors hirudin (for thrombin) (15Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and rTAP (for FXa) failed to suppress the FVIIa–induced accumulation of IL-8. DEGR-inactivated FVIIa had no stimulatory effect on IL-8 production. We conclude that IL-8 induction is dependent on the proteolytic activity of the TF-FVIIa complex but independent of components of the coagulation pathway below TF-FVIIa. This is in contrast to VEGF, the only other protein hitherto reported to be induced by the TF-FVIIa complex at the protein level, where FXa was recently shown to be necessary (37Ollivier V. Bentolila S. Chabbat J. Hakim J. de Prost D. Blood. 1998; 91: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ollivier V. Chabbat J. Herbert J.M. Hakim J. de Prost D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Bio. l. 2000; 20: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Neither inactivated FVIIa nor FVIIa affected VEGF production (39Abe K. Shoji M. Chen J. Bierhaus A. Danave I. Micko C. Casper K. Dillehay D.L. Nawroth P.P. Rickles F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8663-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Regulation of VEGF synthesis must therefore be mediated at least in part through another pathway than that utilized for IL-8.It has previously been shown that IL-8 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sica A. Matsushima K. Van Damme J. Wang J.M. Polentarutti N. Dejana E. Colotta F. Mantovani A. Immunology. 1990; 69: 548-553PubMed Google Scholar). TheIL-8 promoter contains a distal AP-1 binding site and a proximal element containing binding sites for NF-κB and NF-IL-6. NF-IL-6 and AP-1 have been shown to physically interact with NF-κB, suggesting that their functional cooperation is critical for effective regulation of IL-8 gene expression (23Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). By using a luciferase reporter gene assay and a nuclear run-off assay we found that the IL-8 promoter was transcriptionally activated to a moderate degree in response to FVIIa. The NF-κB binding site was the predominant cis-acting element in IL-8 gene expression, because point mutation of the NF-κB binding site in theIL-8 promoter abolished 90% of the luciferase activity, whereas mutation in the AP-1 binding site was not as influential. The effects of FVIIa were essentially equal (∼30–40% increase of reporter gene synthesis) in cells transfected with mutant and wild typeIL-8 promoter constructs. FVIIa also enhanced the binding activity of nuclear transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 to their DNA binding sites in EMSA. Thus, both transcription factors were activated and apparently functioned together in IL-8 up-regulation driven by the FVIIa signaling pathway.In resting cells, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm by binding to its inhibitor IκB. In response to various cellular stimuli, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded, leading to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds DNA and activates transcription (41Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). We have found that both subunits p65 and p50 of NF-κB were translocated to the nucleus in response to FVIIa, confirming the significance of NF-κB in FVIIa-induced IL-8 expression. We have also found that TF-FVIIa signaling results in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. 2X. Wang and H. Prydz, unpublished results.AP-1 activity is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (42Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Most of the genes that encode AP-1 components behave as “immediate-early” genes in which increased transcription is rapidly induced upon cell stimulation and which do not require prior protein synthesis. Because we have previously reported that both c-Fos and IL-8 mRNA are up-regulated as an immediate-early response by FVIIa binding to TF in HaCaT cells (15Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the increased c-Fos binding in EMSA observed here cannot be due tode novo protein synthesis and must be due to c-Fos activation. Regulation of AP-1 activity at the post-transcriptional level has been shown to be mediated by phosphorylation (42Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). FVIIa-activated MAPKs may also contribute to the enhanced AP-1 activity through phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of JunD, thereby potentiating its transactivation function on the FVIIa-stimulated IL-8 promoter.In conclusion, IL-8 gene up-regulation is in part caused by recruitment of the inducible transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB in response to FVIIa stimulation. The expression of other genes may also be affected in a similar manner, because the DNA binding activity of both NF-κB p65/p50 and the AP-1 c-Fos/JunD to their consensus binding sequences was also enhanced in EMSA (data not shown). This is in accordance with our previous results, where the expression of 25 immediate-early response genes was up-regulated in response to FVIIa (15Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Twelve of these were NF-κB and AP-1 target genes, such asIL-8, c-fos, c-myc, fra-1, collagenase 1 (MMP1), collagenase 3 (MMP13),uPAR, and gadd45.The transcriptional activation demonstrated to occur cannot account for more than a minor fraction of the total FVIIa-induced IL-8 mRNA increase. Investigating IL-8 mRNA half-life under various conditions, we have observed an increase from 40 min in untreated HaCaT cells to 140 min after FVIIa addition. This effect was mediated via MAPK signaling, because blocking ERK1/2 and p38 separately or together reduced the half-life. This regulation has been ascribed to several AREs in the 3′-untranslated region of IL-8- and ARE-binding proteins. A similar effect of PD98059 and SK&F 86002 (p38 inhibitor) (43Lee J.C. Badger A.M. Griswold D.E. Dunnington D. Truneh A. Votta B. White J.R. Young P.R. Bender P.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 149-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) resulted in destabilization of the transcripts of IL-1β and GRO. These effects strongly correlated with the increased binding of ARE-binding protein AUF1 and transcripts. AUF1 has been shown to destabilize transcripts (44Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Holtmann et al. (45Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) documented that MAPK p38 strongly stabilized IL-1-induced IL-8 transcripts through phosphorylating and activating p38 MAP kinase-activated protein kinase MK2. It remains to be determined how these phosphorylation pathways influence ARE recognition and association with different proteins to regulate IL-8 mRNA stability. Our data show that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in FVIIa-induced IL-8 up-regulation.Local tumor growth is strictly dependent on vascularization (46Folkman J. Cotran R. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1976; 16: 207-248PubMed Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is also required for tumor metastasis. Angiogenic factors responsible for tumor neovascularization may be derived from tumor cells themselves or from the responding inflammatory cells (47Leek R.D. Harris A.L. Lewis C.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). IL-8 has been shown to be a potent activator of corneal vascularization (18Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Elner V.M. Martonyi C.L. Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Elner S.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 1279-1284PubMed Google Scholar) and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (19Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). IL-8 production correlates strongly with metastatic potential in many tumors (21De Larco J.E. Wuertz B.R. Rosner K.A. Erickson S.A. Gamache D.E. Manivel J.C. Furcht L.T. Am. J.

It can induce tumor growth either through its angiogenic properties or as an autocrine growth factor (51Arenberg D.A. Kunkel S.L. Polverini P.J. Glass M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 52Schadendorf D. Moller A. Algermissen B. Worm M. Sticherling M. Czarnetzki B.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2667-2675PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of TF have been reported in a variety of tumor cells; metastatic human melanoma cells have, for example, been shown to express a 1000-fold higher level of TF than their non-metastatic counterparts (6Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11832-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The expression of TF correlates with the potential for metastasis (53Ueno T. Toi M. Koike M. Nakamura S. Tominaga T. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 54Seto S. Onodera H. Kaido T. Yoshikawa A. Ishigami S. Arii S. Imamura M.

Surg. 1999; 86: 890-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis (26Koomagi R. Volm M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the proteolytic activity of FVIIa is crucial in TF-dependent metastasis (5Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawashe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have shown that up-regulation of the synthesis of IL-8 protein depends on the proteolytic activity of the TF-FVIIa complex. When TF is highly expressed in tumor cells or in host endothelial cells, high and specific local TF-FVIIa proteolytic activity may be achieved, thus leading to efficient induction of IL-8 production in the microenvironment and promoting the process of TF-dependent metastasis and angiogenesis.In summary, FVIIa binding to TF, the initiation of blood coagulation, generates signals that increase the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and AP-1 and stimulate the expression of IL-8 protein by enhancing IL-8 mRNA synthesis and its stability. These cellular events may affect processes like angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo. The binding of factor VIIa (FVIIa)1 to its membrane receptor tissue factor (TF) initiates the blood coagulation cascade, leading to the activation of factor IX and X and generation of thrombin (1Martin D.M. Wiiger M.T. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1998; 90: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, TF plays an important role in tumor-associated angiogenesis (3Shoji M. Hancock W.W. Abe K. Micko C.

Madison J.F. Pawashe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These processes are reduced by the use of TF antibodies (6Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11832-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and active site-inhibited FVIIa (7Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a human melanoma cell line expressing a TF mutant, which prevents the binding of FVIIa, had significantly reduced metastatic ability when introduced into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (8Bromberg M.E. Sundaram R. Homer R.J. Garen A. Konigsberg W.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicating that formation of the TF-FVIIa complex is required for the full metastatic effect of TF. Several studies have emphasized the importance of catalytically active FVIIa binding in TF-dependent metastasis (5Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawashe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RT–PCR analysis and immunohistochemical investigation confirmed expression of H-REV107-1 in normal ovarian epithelial cells but down-regulation in high grade ovarian carcinomas. H-REV107-1 is also strongly expressed in immortalized rat and human ovarian epithelial cells in vitro, but suppressed in transformed cells by two different mechanisms. KRAS-transformed rat ovarian cells and PA1 teratocarcinoma cells, reversibly repress H-REV107-1 via MAP/ERK signaling. In contrast, treatment of A27/80 and OVCAR-3 epithelial ovarian cancer cells with IFNγ stimulated H-REV107-1 expression. In NIH3T3 cells harbouring an estrogen-inducible IRF-1, H-rev107-1 is directly induced after activation of IRF-1, indicating that H-rev107-1 is a target of IRF-1. Stimulation of H-REV107-1 expression was also observed in ovarian epithelial cells suggesting that IRF-1 is involved in H-REV107-1 regulation in human ovarian epithelium. In the IFNγ-sensitive cell line A27/80, H-REV107-1 suppresses colony formation. A27/80 and OVCAR-3 cells overexpressing H-REV107-1 protein underwent apoptosis. These results demonstrate down-regulation of the class II tumour suppressor H-REV107-1 in human ovarian carcinomas and suggest an involvement of H-REV107-1 in interferon-dependent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2329536997,"Loss of DNA mismatch repair has been found in tumors associated with the familial cancer predisposition syndrome HNPCC (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) and a subset of sporadic cancers. MSH2 deficiency abolishes the action of the mismatch repair system, resulting in a phenotype which is characterized by an increased accumulation of base substitutions and frameshifts, enhanced recombination between homologous but non-identical DNA sequences, and tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents. In this study we describe an embryonic stem cell line in which the level of MSH2 protein is 10-fold reduced compared to that in wild-type cells. Remarkably, these MSH2-low cells were as resistant to killing by methylating agents as cells completely lacking MSH2, while they had retained almost maximal mismatch repair capacity as judged from their anti-mutagenic and anti-recombinogenic capacity and the absence of microsatellite instability. In contrast, MSH2-low cells were highly sensitive to methylation-damage induced mutagenesis. Thus, 10-fold reduced MSH2 protein levels render cells resistant to the toxic and highly sensitive to the mutagenic effects of methylating agents. This condition is not manifested by microsatellite instability and may have implications for both the etiology and treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1997644559,"In a search for a basic carboxypeptidase that might work in concert with the major virulence factors, the Arg- and Lys-specific cysteine endoproteinases of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a novel 69.8-kDa metallocarboxypeptidase CPG70 was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture fluid of P. gingivalis HG66. Carboxypeptidase activity was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry using peptide substrates derived from a tryptic digest of hemoglobin. CPG70 exhibited activity with peptides containing C-terminal Lys and Arg residues. The k cat/K m values for the hydrolysis of the synthetic dipeptides FA-Ala-Lys and FA-Ala-Arg by CPG70 were 99 and 56 mm−1s−1, respectively. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by the Arg analog (2-guanidinoethylmercapto)succinic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline. High resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry demonstrated that 1 mol of CPG70 was associated with 0.6 mol of zinc, 0.2 mol of nickel, and 0.2 mol of copper. A search of the P. gingivalis W83 genomic data base (TIGR) with the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined for CPG70 revealed that the enzyme is an N- and C-terminally truncated form of a predicted 91.5-kDa protein (PG0232). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length protein revealed an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a pro-segment, a metallocarboxypeptidase catalytic domain, three tandem polycystic kidney disease domains, and an 88-residue C-terminal segment. The catalytic domain exhibited the highest sequence identity with the duck metallocarboxypeptidase D domain II.

This bacterium produces extracellular and cell-associated Arg- and Lys-specific proteolytic enzymes (RgpA, RgpB, and Kgp), which are major virulence factors implicated in disease pathogenesis because of their ability to degrade a variety of host proteins, dysregulate host defense, and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in tissue destruction and alveolar bone resorption (3Potempa J.

The RgpA and Kgp polyproteins are proteolytically processed to form noncovalently associated complexes of Arg- and Lys-specific endoproteinases and adhesins (6Bhogal P.S. Slakeski N. Reynolds E.C. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that a Lys-specific carboxypeptidase is involved in C-terminal processing of some of the proteins of the RgpA-Kgp complexes (7Veith P.D. Talbo G.H. Slakeski N. Dashper S.G. Moore C. Paolini R.A. Reynolds E.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, RgpA and Kgp have been shown to be important in the assimilation of nutrient peptides byP. gingivalis from host protein substrates, such as hemoglobin (8Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the comprehensive characterization of these endoproteinases, little is known about P. gingivalis carboxypeptidases (CPs).1 CPs can be classified into at least three different types: serine and cysteine CPs, which have a catalytic Ser or Cys residue, respectively; and metallocarboxypeptidases, which have a Glu active site residue and a tightly bound zinc atom important for catalytic action (9Skidgel R.A.

Based on sequence homology and overall structure, the M14 family can be grouped into the two subfamilies CPA and CPE (also named CPH). Within each subfamily, 25–63% amino acid sequence identity is found, but it decreases to only 15–25% between subfamilies (14Garcı́a-Sáez I. Reverter D. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6906-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The two subfamilies also differ in the length of their catalytic domains. The CPE/H subfamily has a conserved catalytic domain of ∼400 residues, comprising a second smaller β-sandwich subdomain following the ∼300-residue catalytic subdomain (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Companys V. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The β-sandwich subdomain is topologically related to transthyretin and sugar-binding proteins (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Companys V. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The members of the CPE/H subfamily are designated basic metallocarboxypeptidases as they only cleave C-terminal Arg and Lys residues and include the regulatory enzymes CPD, CPM, CPN, and CPZ (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Companys V. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Regulatory CPs are generally involved in physiological processes that require a high specificity such as prohormone processing, regulation of peptide hormone activity, and alteration of protein-protein or protein-cell interactions (9Skidgel R.A.

Using a tryptic digest of human hemoglobin as peptide substrate and MALDI-MS analysis, we have identified a novel, Arg- and Lys-specific metallocarboxypeptidase involved in virulence ofP. gingivalis. P. gingivalis HG66 (18Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Kordula T. Pavloff N. Pemberton P.A. Chen W.C. Travis J. Potempa J. Biol.

Pike (Monash University, Victoria, Australia) and P. gingivalis W50 was obtained from the culture collection of the School of Dental Science, University of Melbourne (Melbourne, Australia). The P. gingivalis mutant W50CPG was created for this study (see below). The bacteria were maintained by routine passage (< 10 passages) on lysed horse blood agar plates (19McKee A.S. McDermid A.S. Baskerville A. Dowsett B. Ellwood D.C. Marsh P.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 349-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in an MK3 anaerobic work station (Don Whitley Scientific Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) at 37 °C. Escherichia coli JM109 was grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. P. gingivalis HG66 colonies were selected from a plate and used to inoculate 40 ml of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, England) supplemented with 5 μg/ml hemin, 0.5 mg/ml l-cysteine, and 1 μg/ml menadione. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C in the anaerobic work station, the 40 ml culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of the same broth and incubated for another 2 days anaerobically. The A 650 nm of the 2-day culture ranged from 3.5 to 3.7. Cell-free culture fluid (1900 ml) was obtained by centrifuging (6000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) 2 liters of a 2-day culture to remove cells. The supernatant was concentrated to 100 ml using a Sartocon Mini cross-flow filtration device (Sartorius, Victoria, Australia) equipped with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off filter cassette (3031463901E-SG, Sartorius), and buffer-exchanged in the same device using TC buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2) with 50 mm NaCl. After centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), a 50-ml sample was applied onto a 25-ml Q Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences, Sydney, Australia); the bound proteins were eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in TC buffer at a flow rate of 1.6 ml/min using anÄKTAexplorer 100 automated liquid chromatography system (AmershamBiosciences); and 2-ml fractions were collected. The column fractions that eluted at 150 mm NaCl and contained mainly a 70-kDa protein exhibiting basic carboxypeptidase activity were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, New South Wales, Australia). The concentrate (0.2 ml) was applied onto a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TC buffer containing 25 mm NaCl, and 0.25-ml column fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Purified CPG70 was precipitated by 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, prior to heating at 100 °C for 5 min in reduced SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% w/v bromphenol blue). The protein was then analyzed on a Novex 12% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, Victoria, Australia) by electrophoresis at room temperature at 125 V in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% w/v SDS, pH 8.3). Low molecular weight standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were also applied to the gel. Purified CPG70 (50 pmol) in TC buffer containing 25 mm NaCl was sequenced by Edman degradation for 20 cycles using a Hewlett Packard G1005A automated protein sequencer (Agilent Technologies, Victoria, Australia). The purified protein was also analyzed using a Voyager-DE MALDI-MS (Applied Biosystems, Victoria, Australia) using the following procedure. Nitrocellulose dissolved in acetone (2 mg/ml) was saturated with the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 0.8 μl of this solution was spotted on the target to form a thin film. The protein fraction (0.3 μl) was applied to the film and dried in air. After being washed twice with 0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid (0.8 μl) to remove salts, 0.3 μl of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in aqueous 33% (v/v) acetonitrile/1% (v/v) formic acid was added and dried in air prior to analysis. Human hemoglobin (Sigma Aldrich, New South Wales, Australia) at 10 μm was digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, New South Wales, Australia) for 18 h at 37 °C in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mm CaCl2, at an enzyme to substrate molar ratio of 1: 13. The resulting hemoglobin tryptic fragments were used as peptide substrates for measuring basic carboxypeptidase activity. Purified CPG70 in TC buffer with 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, was added to 10 volumes of the above peptide substrate mixture at a molar ratio of 1: 8 and incubated at 37 °C. At various time points, a sample of the digest was added to aqueous formic acid (final concentration 1% v/v) to terminate the reaction. This sample was then analyzed by MALDI-MS (Voyager-DE, Applied Biosystems) using the matrix, saturated 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) in aqueous 33% acetonitrile, 1% (v/v) formic acid. The acceleration voltage and delay time were set at 20 kV and 100 ns, respectively. The instrument was internally calibrated using two known sample peaks to improve the standard external calibration. Using this method, average mass resolution and a mass accuracy below 0.04% were obtained. The identity of the different hemoglobin tryptic fragments in the digests were assigned by matching the measured MH+ values to those calculated for the predicted tryptic fragments of human hemoglobin α and β chains. CPG70 was pre-incubated with either various protease inhibitors at their effective concentrations or NH4HCO3 buffer (control) for 20 min at room temperature before being added to the peptide substrate mixture as described previously. The same concentration of the inhibitor was maintained in the reaction. After various time periods, a sample of the digest was removed and analyzed by MALDI-MS as described previously. The inhibitors used in the study included the Arg analog GEMSA, 1,10-phenanthroline, EGTA, EDTA, benzylsuccinic acid, leupeptin, PMSF, TLCK, E-64, iodoacetamide, and pepstatin A; all were from Sigma except for GEMSA and EDTA, which were purchased from Fluka and BDH, respectively. The pH of the inhibitors was adjusted to pH 7.5 before use. The hydrolysis of FA-Ala-Lys and FA-Ala-Arg (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) by CPG70 was measured in a Hewlett Packard 8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Victoria, Australia) using the chromogenic substrate at concentrations in the range of 0.025–1 mm in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.75, and 250 mm NaCl in a total volume of 500 μl at 37 °C (20Plummer T.H., Jr. Hurwitz M.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 108: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The initial rate (AU/s) was calculated using the software HP UV-Visible ChemStations and the amidolytic activity expressed in units, where unit = μmol of substrate converted min−1. TheK m and k cat constants were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the method of nonlinear least squares. For inhibition/activation studies, CPG70 was incubated with the inhibitor or metal ion in HEPES buffer, pH 7.75, at 37 °C for 10 min before adding FA-Ala-Lys to the reaction at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Metal element content of purified CPG70 was determined using an ELEMENTTMhigh resolution inductively coupled plasma double-focusing mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) (Thermo Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). The nebulizer was used at a 0.1 ml/min aspiration rate with a water jacket cooled cyclonic spray chamber (both manufactured by Glass Expansion, Victoria, Australia). The sample was freely aspirated into the chamber and was analyzed for the appropriate metals. ICP-MS Multi-element Calibration Standards (Merck, Victoria, Australia) were dissolved in 5% nitric acid and analyzed at a range of 5–50 ppb prior to sample analysis. Deionized water was used in between to remove residual ions. The sample aerosol was carried by argon gas directly to the ICP torch (Finnigan quartz torch, 1.5-mm aperture) and was ionized by the argon plasma. The buffer in which the sample was prepared was also analyzed by ICP-MS as a control. The cpg gene sequence was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research web site (www.tigr.org), based on a sequence alignment with the determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of CPG70. A 2.05-kb PCR-derived fragment encoding cpggenerated from P. gingivalis W50 genomic DNA using primers 5′-GTTTGACCCCGTAACCAATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCACTATGTCCTCGACACTGTCA-3′ was purified and ligated into pGEM-TEasy (Promega) to generate pGEM-TEasy::cpg. A 2.65-kb EcoICRI fragment, encoding a Bacteroides thetaiotamicrontetracycline resistance gene (tetQ) isolated from plasmid pNJR12 (21Maley J. Shoemaker N.B. Roberts I.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 15: 75-81Crossref Google Scholar), was ligated into the BglII site of pGEM-TEasy::cpg and transformed into E. coli JM109 by heat shock. The pGEM-TEasy::cpgwas linearized with ScaI and electroporated into P. gingivalis W50. The procedure for transformation and preparation of cells was essentially according to the procedure of Fletcheret al. (22Fletcher H.M. Schenkein H.A. Morgan R.M. Bailey K.A. Berry C.R. Macrina F.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that transformed cells were grown to anA 650 = 0.1 and selected on HB agar containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline after 7–10 days of incubation at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. The murine lesion model experiments were approved by the University of Melbourne Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation and were conducted essentially as described previously (23O'Brien-Simpson N.M. Paolini R.A. Reynolds E.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4055-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old; 15 animals/group) were challenged with 3.5 × 109 viable cells of P. gingivalis strain W50 or mutant W50CPG by subcutaneous injection (100 μl) in the dorsum and abdominal lesion size measured over 14 days as described previously (23O'Brien-Simpson N.M. Paolini R.A. Reynolds E.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4055-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Three separate experiments were conducted. P. gingivalis W50 and W50CPG were grown anaerobically as described above at 37 °C on lysed horse blood agar plates supplemented with 5 μg/ml hemin and 0.5 mg/ml cysteine. After 3–4 days, colonies were used to inoculate BHI medium containing 5 μg/ml hemin and 0.5 mg/ml cysteine. Batch cultures were grown anaerobically, and cells were harvested during exponential growth by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Cell inocula were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in BHI containing 0.5 mg/ml cysteine in the anaerobic work station. The number of viable cells in each inoculum was verified by enumeration on horse blood agar. The sizes of the maximum abdominal lesions developed were recorded and statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction for type I error (24Norusis M. SPSS for Windows: Base System User's Guide, Release 6.0. SPSS Inc., Highland Park, IL1993Google Scholar). CPG70 was purified from the cell-free culture fluid of a 2-day P. gingivalisHG66 culture using a two-column procedure involving Q Sepharose HP (Fig. 1 A) and Superose 12 (Fig. 1 B) column chromatography. A pre-column Sartocon Mini (Sartorius) concentration (× 19) and buffer exchange procedure was used to remove excess hemin pigments, salts, and other low molecular mass material from the culture fluid. The purified enzyme exhibited a single band at 70 kDa upon SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A) and a measured mass of 69.8 kDa using MALDI-MS (Fig. 2 B). Edman degradation of the purified enzyme revealed the N-terminal sequence, YEWNAYPTYEAYISMMEEFQ (Fig. 3). A search of the P. gingivalis W83 genomic data base available from the TIGR CMR web site (www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR2/GenomePage3.spl?database=gpg) with the N-terminal sequence produced a match (100% identity) with an internal sequence (residues 112–131) of a predicted protein at TIGR locus PG0232. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 821 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 91.5 kDa. The purified enzyme represented an N-terminally truncated form of this predicted protein with the first 111 amino acid residues removed (Fig. 3).Figure 2SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS analyses of CPG70.CPG70 purified by Q Sepharose HP and Superose 12 chromatography was analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (A).

Its domain structure contains a signal peptide (S), a pro-segment (Pro), a CPD-like catalytic domain, three PKD repeat domains, and an 88-residue C-terminal segment. CPG70, a truncated, secreted form of CPG, contains the catalytic domain and the three PKD domains.

The N-terminal segment of the predicted protein that was not present in the truncated CPG70 includes a 24-residue signal peptide as determined using the SignalP version 1.1 program (25Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and an 87-residue pro-segment ending with a Lys at the processing site to release the mature enzyme. Another truncation at the C terminus is predicted, as the measured mass (69.8 kDa) of CPG70 was significantly lower (∼9 kDa) than the calculated mass of 78.7 kDa corresponding to the N-terminally truncated CPG with 710 amino acid residues (Fig.3). CP activity was measured by MALDI-MS using a tryptic digest of human hemoglobin as peptide substrates. The three MALDI-MS spectra shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate the presence of a dominant Lys-specific CP activity upon the addition of CPG70 for 5 min (Fig. 4, compare A with B). Peptides with the C-terminal Lys or Arg residue removed are indicated by an asterisk or a box, respectively, in Fig. 4. Notably, only a relatively small amount of Arg-specific CP activity was found even after a 60-min incubation with CPG70 (Fig. 4 C). A detailed list of the identified 21 hemoglobin tryptic peptides (T1–T21) is shown in Table I. The identified peptides were derived from either hemoglobin α or β chain. Among them, T5, T15, T18, and T21 were partially digested by trypsin. Two of them, T5 and T18, have an internal basic residue, Arg and Lys, respectively. The other two peptides, T15 and T21, are identical to T13 and T20, respectively, except that they contain one more residue, Lys, at the N terminus. Because they also have a C-terminal Lys, the C-terminal Lys cleaved product of T15 or T21 would have the same mass as the substrate peptides T13 or T20, respectively (see the underlined mass values in Table I). To overcome this problem, the corresponding Lys-specific CP activities were presented as the following peak height ratios T13-K:(T13 + T15-K):T15 and T20-K:(T20 + T21-K):T21 in Table I.Table IMALDI-MS analyses of effects of protease inhibitors on CPG 70 activity using hemoglobin tryptic peptides as substrates3-a Incompletely trypsin-digested hemoglobin fragment.3-b Other protease inhibitors, including 2 mM EGTA or EDTA, 1mM PMSF, TLCK, benzylsuccinic acid, E-64, and iodoacetamide, 100 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin A, did not show significant effects on the CPG70 activity under the specified conditions.3-c CPG70 digestion time.3-d The relative activity was calculated based on the “% product” difference between the control (100%) and the inhibitor-treated sample under identical conditions. “% product” = Peak heightTx-K/R/(Peak heightTx-K/R + Peak height Tx) × 100%; values represent the means of at least three separate determinations with an average coefficient of variation at 10%.3-e nd: No activity detected without inhibitor.3-f The cleavage of these peptides are expressed as peak height ratios due to the partial overlapping of substrate/product MH+ masses as underlined in the table.

Our previous expression profiling analysis of a highly metastatic lung cancer cell line, NCI-H460-LNM35, and its parental low metastatic line, NCI-H460-N15, revealed significant up-regulation of both known and unknown genes in LNM35. In this study, we describe the isolation and detailed characterizations of a novel gene, named CLCP1, which corresponds to one of such expression sequence tags with up-regulated expression in LNM35. The CLCP1 gene was found to encode a protein with 775 amino acids with structural similarities to, but distinct from neuropilins, cell surface receptors for VEGF165 and semaphorins. Notably, CLCP1 was shown to be up-regulated not only in LNM35 in association with its acquisition of metastatic phenotype during in vivo selection, but also in a significant fraction of lung cancers in vivo with high frequency in metastatic lesions, warranting future studies for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2027487939,"Neuroblastoma (NB), a malignant childhood tumor deriving from the embryonic neural crest, is sensitive to the growth-stimulating effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Aggressive cases of this disease often acquire autocrine loops of IGF production, but the mechanisms through which the different components of the IGF axis are regulated in tumor cells remain unclear. Upon conditional expression of c-Myb in a NB cell line, we detected up-regulation of IGF1, IGF1 receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) expression. Analysis of the IGFBP-5 promoter revealed two potential Myb binding sites at position −59 to −54 (M1) and −429 to −424 (M2) from the transcription start site; both sites were bound by c-Myb and B-Mybin vitro and in vivo. Reporter assays carried out using the proximal region of the human IGFBP-5 promoter demonstrated that c-Myb and B-Myb enhanced transcription. However, site-directed mutagenesis and deletion of the Myb binding sites coupled with reporter assays revealed that M2 but not M1 was important for Myb-dependent transactivation of the IGFBP-5promoter. The double mutant M1/M2 was still transactivated by c-Myb, suggesting the existence of Myb binding-independent mechanisms ofIGFBP-5 promoter regulation. A constitutively active AKT transactivated the IGFBP-5 promoter, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 suppressed it. Moreover, the kinase dead dominant negative K179M AKT mutant was able to inhibit transcription from the M2 and M1/M2IGFBP-5 mutant promoters. Deletion analysis of theIGFBP-5 promoter revealed that the AKT-responsive region lies between nucleotides −334 and −83. Together, these data suggest that the Myb binding-independent transactivation of theIGFBP-5 promoter was due to the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway likely mediated by IGF1 receptor-dependent signals. Finally, IGFBP-5 was able to modulate proliferation of NB cells in a manner dependent on its concentration and on the presence of IGFs.

NB cells derive from the neural crest and maintain gene expression profiles and differentiation potentials that are reminiscent of their embryonic origin (5Abemayor E. Sidell N. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of NB is the expression of trk receptors on the cell surface that mediate the differentiation signals sent by neurotrophins (6Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Expression of trkA (7Kogner P. Barbany G. Dominici C. Castello M.A. Raschella G. Persson H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2044-2050PubMed Google Scholar) and trkC (8Yamashiro D.J. Liu X.G. Lee C.P. Nakagawara A. Ikegaki N. McGregor L.M. Baylin S.B. Brodeur G.M. Eur. J.

Ikegaki N. Liu X.G. Brodeur G.M. Klin. Paediatr. 2000; 212: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As for many other neoplasms, the molecular mechanisms of NB aggressiveness are not fully understood. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN and loss of genetic material at chromosome 1p36 are powerful markers of poor outcome (10Brodeur G.M. Pritchard J. Berthold F. Carlsen N.L. Castel V. Castelberry R.P., De Bernardi B. Evans A.E. Favrot M. Hedborg F. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 11: 1466-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms through which these alterations exert their detrimental effects in tumor cells are largely unknown. The growth of NB cells is dependent on the supply of certain growth factors that, in the most aggressive forms, are frequently produced in an autocrine fashion. NB metastases occur in tissues where a paracrine support of IGF2 is available (11el Badry O.M. Helman L.J. Chatten J. Steinberg S.M. Evans A.E. Israel M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Non-IGF2-producing tissues are invaded only by NBs that can autonomously produce IGF2 (12el Badry O.M. Romanus J.A. Helman L.J. Cooper M.J. Rechler M.M. Israel M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,13el Badry O.M. Meyers M.B. Spengler B.A. Chang T.D. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 366: 257-266PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inappropriate expression of some oncogenes can conceivably lead to the development of growth factor independence via activation of growth factors or growth factor-regulated pathways. The biological activity of IGF1 and IGF2 is mediated by a large group of proteins that constitute the so-called IGF axis composed of receptors, intracellular substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2), and transducers that relay the signal to the nucleus (14Valentinis B. Baserga R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the extracellular compartment, another family of proteins, the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), modulates the action of IGFs. IGFBPs can function as carriers to transport IGFs in the bloodstream in a ternary complex of 150 kDa with the acid labile protein (15Baxter R.C. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the interstitial space, IGFBP-3 and -5 can bind the extracellular matrix, decrease their affinity for the IGFs, and exchange them with the IGF1R (16Parker A. Clarke J.B. Busby W.H., Jr. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13523-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In other settings, high concentrations of IGFBPs can inhibit the action of IGFs by sequestering them from the receptor and cause the onset of apoptosis (17Tonner E. Allan G. Shkreta L. Webster J. Whitelaw C.B. Flint D.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of IGFBP-5 in modulating the activity of IGFs is well recognized in bone and vascular smooth muscle cells (18Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E283-E288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 was also described as an IGF-independent growth factor in bone cells (21Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), acting through its putative receptor (22Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of IGFBP-5 expression is finely tuned by a network of stimuli acting through different transduction pathways (23Gabbitas B. Pash J.M. Delany A.M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9033-9038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Dong Y. Canalis E.

Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Noticeably, in smooth muscle cells, IGF1 is a potent stimulant of IGFBP-5 synthesis through a transcriptional mechanism involving a signal transduction cascade dependent on the activation of IGF1R and PI3K/AKT (27Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The nuclear effector(s) and the DNA sequences on the IGFBP-5 promoter involved in the PI3K/AKT-dependent transactivation of IGFBP-5 expression are unknown, but it has been hypothesized that an important role is played by a GC-rich region located between nucleotides −147 and −134 from the transcription start (27Duan C.

Myb genes (A-myb, B-myb, and c-myb) are a family of transcription factors whose expression has been implicated in the control of proliferation and differentiation of normal and transformed cells (29Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott W.J., Jr. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 30Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For example, c-Myb has been shown to be essential for the proliferation of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells (31Calabretta B. Gewirtz A.M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) and for the proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells (32Davies J. Badiani P. Weston K.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of c-Myb is predominant in the hematopoietic system, it is also expressed in other normal tissues (34Rosenthal M.A. Thompson M.A. Ellis S. Whitehead R.H. Ramsay R.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 961-967PubMed Google Scholar) and in nonhematopoietic tumors (35Biroccio A. Benassi B. D'Agnano I. D'Angelo C. Buglioni S. Mottolese M. Ricciotti A. Citro G. Cosimelli M.

Altavista P. Tonini G.P., De Bernardi B. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of IGF1 and IGF1R is stimulated by c-Myb at the transcription level in fibroblasts (37Reiss K. Ferber A. Travali S. Porcu P. Phillips P.D. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5997-6000PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of A-Myb and B-Myb occurs in cells of different embryonic origin (38Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma cells, c-Myb and B-Myb expression is down-regulated during in vitro differentiation (39Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Raschella G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Suppression of c-Myb expression leads to the inhibition of cellular proliferation (41Raschella G. Negroni A. Skorski T. Pucci S. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Romeo A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4221-4226PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of all members of the myb family is frequent in NB (36Raschella G. Cesi V. Amendola R. Negroni A. Tanno B. Altavista P. Tonini G.P., De Bernardi B. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar), but only that of B-myb appears to be associated with poor clinical outcome independent of MYCNamplification and age at diagnosis (36Raschella G. Cesi V. Amendola R. Negroni A. Tanno B. Altavista P. Tonini G.P., De Bernardi B. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that genes of the myb family are important in the establishment and maintenance of the tumorigenic state of NB cells. However, information on the cellular targets through which myb genes exert their function is still scarce. The antiapoptotic ApoJ-1 protein appears to be a direct transcriptional target of B-Myb in proliferating neuroblastoma cells (42Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G. Tanno B. Ventura A. Mancini C. Sevignani C. Calabretta B. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21055-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Conversely, an atypical role ofc-myb and B-myb in evoking cell death has been recently described in postmitotic neuronal cells (43Liu D.X. Greene L.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, normal and transformed neural cells express myb genes that may have different effects, depending on the physiological or pathological context. In this study, we investigated whether myb genes regulate the expression of members of the IGF axis in neuroblastoma cells. Using a model of c-Myb conditional expression, we found that c-Myb up-regulated the expression of IGF1, IGF1R, and IGFBP-5. c-Myb and B-Myb transactivated the IGFBP-5 promoter through binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These findings are discussed in the light of the effects of IGFBP-5 on the proliferation of NB cells. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (LAN-5 cells) (40Raschella G. Negroni A. Sala A.

For stable transfections, LAN-5 cells were grown at 70% confluence. Cells were transfected with the tet-responsive vector pBPSTR1 (46Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. J.

Puromycin (Sigma) selection (1 μg/ml) and doxycycline (DOX) (Sigma) treatment (5 ng/ml) was started 48 h after transfection. Single clones were expanded after 21 days and tested for inducible c-Myb expression after removal of DOX. For transient transfection, murine N1E-115 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 expression plasmids containing full-length c-mybor B-myb cDNAs or with the empty vector. 48 h later, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted for analysis. Luciferase assays were carried out co-transfecting LAN-5 cells with reporter vectors pGL3-IGFBP-5-prom wt, M1mut, M2mut, and M1/M2mut (2 μg) and pcDNA3-c-myb or -B-myb (1 μg unless otherwise indicated) in the presence or absence of the mutant K179M AKT plasmid (1 μg) using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. The amount of DNA transfected in each plate was kept constant by adding the appropriate quantity of empty vector (pcDNA3). 6 h before transfection, RPMI 1640 medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After transfection, fetal calf serum was reduced to 2%, and luciferase assays were performed 36 h later using a detection kit (Promega). The DNA binding domain of humanc-myb was obtained by PCR using a set of primers containing the initial ATG (upstream primer) and a stop codon (downstream primer) after the hemagglutinin tag in-frame with the mybsequence. The PCR product was then cloned in the EcoRV site of the pcDNA3 vector. The DNA binding domain of B-mybwas produced in bacteria from vector pGEX-2T-B-myb (42Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G.

The region from nucleotide −459 to +59 from the transcription start was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR. The 518-bp product was cloned at the SmaI site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The sequence of the cloned region was controlled by dideoxy sequencing. Deletion mutants spanning the regions from nucleotides −334 to +59 (Δ3), −209 to +59 (Δ2), and −83 to +59 (Δ1) were generated using the pGL3-IGFBP-5-prom as template and the following primers: Δ3 upstream, 5′-GTGTTCACCCTGCTCCGAAGA-3′; Δ2 upstream, 5′-GAGGGGAGAGGGCGCTGT-3′; and Δ1 upstream, 5′-GTTGGGAAGCTCAAATTGCAGC-3′. The common downstream primer for the three deletion mutants was 5′-TTCCAGCGGATAGAATGGCGC-3′. This primer anneals to nucleotides 121–141 in the pGL3-basic vector. The PCR-amplified products were digested with HindIII restriction enzyme and cloned in aHindIII/SmaI-digested pGL3-basic vector using standard cloning procedures.

Tryptophan was introduced at positions 113 and 131, which correspond to those naturally present in vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin, as well as position 129 that is also close to the adenine binding site. Nucleotide (ATP and ADP) binding was accompanied by a large quench in protein fluorescence in the case of the tryptophans at 129 and 131 but a small enhancement for that at 113. None of these residues was sensitive to the subsequent open-closed transition that is coupled to hydrolysis (i.e. ADP and ATP induced similar fluorescence changes). The kinetics of the fluorescence change with the F129W mutant revealed at least a three-step nucleotide binding mechanism, together with formation of a weakly competitive off-line intermediate that may represent a nonproductive mode of nucleotide binding. Overall, we conclude that the local and global conformational changes in myosin IIs induced by nucleotide binding are similar in myosins from different species, but the sign and magnitude of the tryptophan fluorescence changes reflect nonconserved residues in the immediate vicinity of each tryptophan. The nucleotide binding process is at least three-step, involving conformational changes that are quite distinct from the open-closed transition sensed by the tryptophan Trp501 in the relay loop.

Nonhydrolyzable nucleotides (e.g. ADP) cause a smaller enhancement than hydrolyzable ones (e.g. ATP), indicating that part of the fluorescence change observed with ATP may be associated with the hydrolysis step itself. The kinetics of binding saturate at high nucleotide concentrations, indicating that the process is at least two-step (1Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under some conditions, the fluorescence change associated with hydrolysis was resolved from a faster isomerization step (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A more precise mechanism (Reaction FR1) for the fluorescence enhancement associated with hydrolysis has recently been proposed using a Dictyostelium discoideummyosin construct containing a single tryptophan residue at position 501 in the relay loop, some 3 nm from the active site (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that tryptophan at this position shows a small quench on nucleotide binding (10–20%) followed by a large enhancement (50–80%) associated with a major conformational change (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), presumably equivalent to the open-closed transition identified by x-ray crystallography (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The latter step is freely reversible and slightly favors the open state (low fluorescence M†·ATP) in the presence of ATP under ambient conditions, but coupling to the hydrolysis step pulls the equilibrium over to the more stable M*ADP·Pi state with enhanced fluorescence (5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, under most conditions, the kinetics of Trp501 enhancement upon interaction with ATP provide a measure of the hydrolysis reaction, in line with earlier schemes (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although relaxation methods reveal these processes to be distinct events (5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The quench in Trp501 fluorescence that precedes the enhancement is related to the binding process, but details of this step are not easy to characterize because the signal is small and is obscured by the subsequent open-closed transition. In the present study, we have made constructs containing single tryptophan residues near the active site with the aim of probing the initial binding step(s) without any contribution from the conformational changes that are coupled to hydrolysis.The D. discoideum motor domain lacks tryptophan residues near the nucleotide site equivalent to positions Trp113 and Trp131 in vertebrate skeletal myosin. This finding has led to the suggestion that the enhancement seen upon ADP binding to vertebrate skeletal myosin may arise from specific perturbation of the tryptophan residues near the active site (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle myosin, Trp131 lies in the vicinity of the adenine ring of the bound nucleotide, whereas the Trp113 side chain could be sensitive to nucleotide binding via interaction with the conservative Lys130 residue. We therefore have explored this idea by making the appropriate single tryptophan constructs in the D. discoideum motor domain. We previously showed that substitution of all of the naturally occurring tryptophan residues with phenylalanine in the D. discoideum motor domain had a fairly limited effect on the kinetic pathway (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and hence adding back a single tryptophan residue as a site-directed probe at locations throughout the molecule is a potentially viable approach.DISCUSSIONDespite the long history (1Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the assignment of tryptophan fluorescence changes to specific steps in the vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin and actomyosin ATPase pathways has been controversial and difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. At 20 °C, the rapid isomerization steps are lost within the dead time of the stopped flow apparatus, and only the fluorescence change associated with hydrolysis is clearly resolved. At lower temperatures, additional steps were resolved, which suggested that there are at least two binding isomerizations that are distinct from the hydrolysis step (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the presence of actin, there are further complications arising from the potential of tryptophans in actin to contribute to the signal change, perturbations of myosin tryptophans that are sensitive to actin binding (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the technical difficulty of the effect of light scattering changes on the measured fluorescence signal (26Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Use of D. discoideum myosin II constructs has the advantage that tryptophan residues can be added or removed by mutagenesis to probe specific regions of the myosin motor domain. Here we focus on the response of tryptophan residues located near the myosin nucleotide binding site. We show that a tryptophan residue at position 129 or 131 responds with similar kinetics (after allowing for species differences) as previously characterized for rabbit skeletal myosin (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although the fluorescence change is in the opposite direction. The cause of the fluorescence enhancement on nucleotide binding seen with vertebrate myosins has therefore not been unambiguously identified. There are several candidates for the source of the signal change in vertebrate myosins. First, the two tryptophans in the vicinity of the binding site (Trp113 and Trp131 in rabbit skeletal myosin), which are conserved only among skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms, are likely to be sensitive to nucleotide binding (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although their local environments may be different from those in D. discoideum myosin to give a net enhancement rather than quench. Park and Burghardt (21Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) isolated Trp131 emission in skeletal muscle subfragment 1 by means of elimination of its fluorescence contribution using site-specific chemical modification. Their data show that this side chain indeed responds with a ∼20% enhancement upon binding of nucleotide, but they excluded Trp131 as the tryptophan sensitive to ATP hydrolysis on the basis that the signal was similar in different nucleotide states. Based on structural data, Trp113 also cannot be excluded as a potential candidate responsible for nucleotide binding-induced signal changes. The contribution of these residues to the signal change is also indicated by the fact that wild-type D. discoideum myosin II, which lacks Trp131 (and Trp113), does not respond with a significant change in fluorescence on nucleotide binding (8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Kuhlman P.A. Bagshaw C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The single tryptophan residues of the D. discoideum myosin mutants presented in this study (Trp113, Trp129, and Trp131) were insensitive to the events of the ATPase cycle other than nucleotide binding. However, the combined contributions of Trp113 and Trp131 would lead to a net quench rather than enhancement on nucleotide binding.The conservative tryptophan residue in the relay loop of the motor domain (Trp510 in skeletal, Trp512 in smooth muscle, and Trp501 in D. discoideummyosin), which is sensitive to the open-closed transition, also shows a fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding. Skeletal and smooth muscle myosin relay loop tryptophans show 38 and 30% enhancement upon ADP addition, respectively (21Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the W501+ single tryptophanD. discoideum myosin mutant, a 15–20% quench can be detected on this step (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that other tryptophans are involved (e.g. the conserved Trp432 in D. discoideum, Trp440 in skeletal myosin) because the W501F and W501Y mutants show almost no fluorescence change upon adding nucleotide (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,20Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our data therefore indicate that (i) both the tryptophan(s) near the binding site and the relay loop residue contribute to the fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding prior to the open-closed transition, and (ii) the direction and extent of the fluorescence change of the responsive tryptophans is largely determined by the nonconservative environment surrounding the tryptophan side chain. Thus, we conclude that the global conformational changes undertaken by these myosins are conserved (on the basis of similar rate profiles and functional properties), and even the local movement of particular tryptophan residues could be similar, but the environment experienced by the tryptophan side chains during such movements will vary because of nonconserved residues around them.The acrylamide quenching experiments indicate that a tryptophan residue at position 129 is solvent-exposed, as expected from the crystal structures (17Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 18Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, time-resolved anisotropy measurements indicate that this side chain is not freely mobile, and interconversion between rotamer states occurs on a time scale slower than net rotation of the motor domain, as was also noted for Trp501 (16Málnási-Csizmadia A. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Botchway S.W. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding is accompanied by a protection of Trp129 from collisional quenching by agents in solution, but this residue is now subject to increased static quenching, possibly by direct association with the adenine moiety.Regardless of the specific origin of the fluorescence change, the large quench observed on nucleotide binding to W129+ allows a more precise analysis of the mechanism than has hitherto been possible with wild-type proteins. Furthermore, the signal from Trp129 is not sensitive to the open-closed transition, which removes some of the ambiguity in the analysis. This is particularly important because much of the earlier data exploited analogs such as AMP-PNP and ATPγS to mimic the nonhydrolyzed ATP state, but it is now known that these analogs induce the closed state to a limited extent (4Málnási-Csizmadia A.

J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is therefore the simplest nucleotide with which to explore the initial binding steps.In accordance with this concept, the overall profiles of different nucleotides binding to the W129+ construct were similar in character to that observed by Trybus and Taylor (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for ADP binding to skeletal myosin at 5 °C (at higher temperatures, the isomerization steps with skeletal myosin are too fast to resolve). The profiles of skeletal andD. discoideum myosins differ in detail in the near loss of the slow phase at high [nucleotide], which indicates that the M†1·L and M†2·L states have nearly the same fluorescence yield in D. discoideum myosin (hence at saturating [nucleotide], step 2b is optically silent). Furthermore, the k obs of the fast phase appeared to extrapolate back to give a large intercept value (250–1000 s−1), whereas it was close to zero in the Trybus and Taylor (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) data. This aspect is difficult to characterize with accuracy, However, it can be accounted for by an additional weak but competitive nonproductive binding mode of the nucleotide as in ReactionFR2. Here, M#·L might represent a nucleotide bound to the active site in a noncompetent orientation that must dissociate and reassociate (or rearrange while bound) before forming the tightly bound form M†2·L.The fluorescence transients from the double tryptophan construct, W129+/W501+, show a clear distinction between the nucleotide binding steps and the open-closed transition that is coupled to hydrolysis, because the signals have opposite signs (cf. skeletal myosin, where they both give enhancements). Furthermore, the effective hydrolysis rate is slowed to 8 s−1 at 20 °C, which may be useful for developing conformationally resolved single molecule ATPase assays because the transition occurs on the time scale appropriate for video acquisition (27Bagshaw C.R. Conibear P.B. Single Mol. 2000; 1: 269-275Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Although the aim of this work was to characterize the tryptophan residue(s) in the motor domain that respond to the nucleotide binding steps and to exploit the fluorescence signal to delineate the elementary steps of this process, it is of interest to relate these steps to those that occur in the presence of actin. Previous studies have estimated that the ATP-induced dissociation of acto-D. discoideum motor domain is limited by a first order step of 150–450 s−1 at 20 °C (8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Kuhlman P.A. Bagshaw C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is thus comparable with the slower of the two isomerization steps revealed by Trp129 fluorescence. We confirm that the acto-W129+ construct dissociates with a maximum rate constant of 150 s−1 at saturating [ATP]. The conformational changes sensed by the tryptophan residues near the active site (Trp129 and Trp131) are therefore likely to occur before or are coincident with the ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation reaction. This is in agreement with thermodynamic arguments that require coupling with an effectively irreversible step (step 2b with ATP) in the binding mechanism to provide sufficient energy to drive the actomyosin dissociation reaction. We find no evidence of a slower tryptophan fluorescence change sensed by Trp129 after actin dissociation, but previous reports with skeletal myosin where this was observed may reflect a contribution from the open-closed transition (26Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Single tryptophan-containing constructs will provide a valuable tool for further delineating communication pathways between the actin site, nucleotide site, and converter region of myosins. Interaction of nucleotides with vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin is accompanied by an enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence that has long been exploited to determine the mechanism of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (1Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nonhydrolyzable nucleotides (e.g. ADP) cause a smaller enhancement than hydrolyzable ones (e.g. ATP), indicating that part of the fluorescence change observed with ATP may be associated with the hydrolysis step itself. The kinetics of binding saturate at high nucleotide concentrations, indicating that the process is at least two-step (1Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under some conditions, the fluorescence change associated with hydrolysis was resolved from a faster isomerization step (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A more precise mechanism (Reaction FR1) for the fluorescence enhancement associated with hydrolysis has recently been proposed using a Dictyostelium discoideummyosin construct containing a single tryptophan residue at position 501 in the relay loop, some 3 nm from the active site (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that tryptophan at this position shows a small quench on nucleotide binding (10–20%) followed by a large enhancement (50–80%) associated with a major conformational change (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), presumably equivalent to the open-closed transition identified by x-ray crystallography (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The latter step is freely reversible and slightly favors the open state (low fluorescence M†·ATP) in the presence of ATP under ambient conditions, but coupling to the hydrolysis step pulls the equilibrium over to the more stable M*ADP·Pi state with enhanced fluorescence (5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, under most conditions, the kinetics of Trp501 enhancement upon interaction with ATP provide a measure of the hydrolysis reaction, in line with earlier schemes (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although relaxation methods reveal these processes to be distinct events (5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The quench in Trp501 fluorescence that precedes the enhancement is related to the binding process, but details of this step are not easy to characterize because the signal is small and is obscured by the subsequent open-closed transition. In the present study, we have made constructs containing single tryptophan residues near the active site with the aim of probing the initial binding step(s) without any contribution from the conformational changes that are coupled to hydrolysis. The D. discoideum motor domain lacks tryptophan residues near the nucleotide site equivalent to positions Trp113 and Trp131 in vertebrate skeletal myosin. This finding has led to the suggestion that the enhancement seen upon ADP binding to vertebrate skeletal myosin may arise from specific perturbation of the tryptophan residues near the active site (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle myosin, Trp131 lies in the vicinity of the adenine ring of the bound nucleotide, whereas the Trp113 side chain could be sensitive to nucleotide binding via interaction with the conservative Lys130 residue. We therefore have explored this idea by making the appropriate single tryptophan constructs in the D. discoideum motor domain. We previously showed that substitution of all of the naturally occurring tryptophan residues with phenylalanine in the D. discoideum motor domain had a fairly limited effect on the kinetic pathway (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and hence adding back a single tryptophan residue as a site-directed probe at locations throughout the molecule is a potentially viable approach. DISCUSSIONDespite the long history (1Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the assignment of tryptophan fluorescence changes to specific steps in the vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin and actomyosin ATPase pathways has been controversial and difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. At 20 °C, the rapid isomerization steps are lost within the dead time of the stopped flow apparatus, and only the fluorescence change associated with hydrolysis is clearly resolved. At lower temperatures, additional steps were resolved, which suggested that there are at least two binding isomerizations that are distinct from the hydrolysis step (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the presence of actin, there are further complications arising from the potential of tryptophans in actin to contribute to the signal change, perturbations of myosin tryptophans that are sensitive to actin binding (2Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Yengo C.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14515-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the technical difficulty of the effect of light scattering changes on the measured fluorescence signal (26Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Use of D. discoideum myosin II constructs has the advantage that tryptophan residues can be added or removed by mutagenesis to probe specific regions of the myosin motor domain. Here we focus on the response of tryptophan residues located near the myosin nucleotide binding site. We show that a tryptophan residue at position 129 or 131 responds with similar kinetics (after allowing for species differences) as previously characterized for rabbit skeletal myosin (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although the fluorescence change is in the opposite direction. The cause of the fluorescence enhancement on nucleotide binding seen with vertebrate myosins has therefore not been unambiguously identified. There are several candidates for the source of the signal change in vertebrate myosins. First, the two tryptophans in the vicinity of the binding site (Trp113 and Trp131 in rabbit skeletal myosin), which are conserved only among skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms, are likely to be sensitive to nucleotide binding (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although their local environments may be different from those in D. discoideum myosin to give a net enhancement rather than quench. Park and Burghardt (21Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) isolated Trp131 emission in skeletal muscle subfragment 1 by means of elimination of its fluorescence contribution using site-specific chemical modification. Their data show that this side chain indeed responds with a ∼20% enhancement upon binding of nucleotide, but they excluded Trp131 as the tryptophan sensitive to ATP hydrolysis on the basis that the signal was similar in different nucleotide states. Based on structural data, Trp113 also cannot be excluded as a potential candidate responsible for nucleotide binding-induced signal changes. The contribution of these residues to the signal change is also indicated by the fact that wild-type D. discoideum myosin II, which lacks Trp131 (and Trp113), does not respond with a significant change in fluorescence on nucleotide binding (8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Kuhlman P.A. Bagshaw C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The single tryptophan residues of the D. discoideum myosin mutants presented in this study (Trp113, Trp129, and Trp131) were insensitive to the events of the ATPase cycle other than nucleotide binding. However, the combined contributions of Trp113 and Trp131 would lead to a net quench rather than enhancement on nucleotide binding.The conservative tryptophan residue in the relay loop of the motor domain (Trp510 in skeletal, Trp512 in smooth muscle, and Trp501 in D. discoideummyosin), which is sensitive to the open-closed transition, also shows a fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding. Skeletal and smooth muscle myosin relay loop tryptophans show 38 and 30% enhancement upon ADP addition, respectively (21Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the W501+ single tryptophanD. discoideum myosin mutant, a 15–20% quench can be detected on this step (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that other tryptophans are involved (e.g. the conserved Trp432 in D. discoideum, Trp440 in skeletal myosin) because the W501F and W501Y mutants show almost no fluorescence change upon adding nucleotide (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,20Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our data therefore indicate that (i) both the tryptophan(s) near the binding site and the relay loop residue contribute to the fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding prior to the open-closed transition, and (ii) the direction and extent of the fluorescence change of the responsive tryptophans is largely determined by the nonconservative environment surrounding the tryptophan side chain. Thus, we conclude that the global conformational changes undertaken by these myosins are conserved (on the basis of similar rate profiles and functional properties), and even the local movement of particular tryptophan residues could be similar, but the environment experienced by the tryptophan side chains during such movements will vary because of nonconserved residues around them.The acrylamide quenching experiments indicate that a tryptophan residue at position 129 is solvent-exposed, as expected from the crystal structures (17Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 18Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, time-resolved anisotropy measurements indicate that this side chain is not freely mobile, and interconversion between rotamer states occurs on a time scale slower than net rotation of the motor domain, as was also noted for Trp501 (16Málnási-Csizmadia A. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Botchway S.W. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding is accompanied by a protection of Trp129 from collisional quenching by agents in solution, but this residue is now subject to increased static quenching, possibly by direct association with the adenine moiety.Regardless of the specific origin of the fluorescence change, the large quench observed on nucleotide binding to W129+ allows a more precise analysis of the mechanism than has hitherto been possible with wild-type proteins. Furthermore, the signal from Trp129 is not sensitive to the open-closed transition, which removes some of the ambiguity in the analysis. This is particularly important because much of the earlier data exploited analogs such as AMP-PNP and ATPγS to mimic the nonhydrolyzed ATP state, but it is now known that these analogs induce the closed state to a limited extent (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R.

The conservative tryptophan residue in the relay loop of the motor domain (Trp510 in skeletal, Trp512 in smooth muscle, and Trp501 in D. discoideummyosin), which is sensitive to the open-closed transition, also shows a fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding. Skeletal and smooth muscle myosin relay loop tryptophans show 38 and 30% enhancement upon ADP addition, respectively (21Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the W501+ single tryptophanD. discoideum myosin mutant, a 15–20% quench can be detected on this step (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that other tryptophans are involved (e.g. the conserved Trp432 in D. discoideum, Trp440 in skeletal myosin) because the W501F and W501Y mutants show almost no fluorescence change upon adding nucleotide (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,20Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our data therefore indicate that (i) both the tryptophan(s) near the binding site and the relay loop residue contribute to the fluorescence change upon nucleotide binding prior to the open-closed transition, and (ii) the direction and extent of the fluorescence change of the responsive tryptophans is largely determined by the nonconservative environment surrounding the tryptophan side chain. Thus, we conclude that the global conformational changes undertaken by these myosins are conserved (on the basis of similar rate profiles and functional properties), and even the local movement of particular tryptophan residues could be similar, but the environment experienced by the tryptophan side chains during such movements will vary because of nonconserved residues around them. The acrylamide quenching experiments indicate that a tryptophan residue at position 129 is solvent-exposed, as expected from the crystal structures (17Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, time-resolved anisotropy measurements indicate that this side chain is not freely mobile, and interconversion between rotamer states occurs on a time scale slower than net rotation of the motor domain, as was also noted for Trp501 (16Málnási-Csizmadia A. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Botchway S.W. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding is accompanied by a protection of Trp129 from collisional quenching by agents in solution, but this residue is now subject to increased static quenching, possibly by direct association with the adenine moiety. Regardless of the specific origin of the fluorescence change, the large quench observed on nucleotide binding to W129+ allows a more precise analysis of the mechanism than has hitherto been possible with wild-type proteins. Furthermore, the signal from Trp129 is not sensitive to the open-closed transition, which removes some of the ambiguity in the analysis. This is particularly important because much of the earlier data exploited analogs such as AMP-PNP and ATPγS to mimic the nonhydrolyzed ATP state, but it is now known that these analogs induce the closed state to a limited extent (4Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R.

J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and hence have a contribution from the signal traditionally assigned to the M*·ADP·Pi state (M**·ADP·Pi in skeletal myosin). ADP has less or no tendency to induce the closed state (5Málnási-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is therefore the simplest nucleotide with which to explore the initial binding steps. In accordance with this concept, the overall profiles of different nucleotides binding to the W129+ construct were similar in character to that observed by Trybus and Taylor (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for ADP binding to skeletal myosin at 5 °C (at higher temperatures, the isomerization steps with skeletal myosin are too fast to resolve). The profiles of skeletal andD. discoideum myosins differ in detail in the near loss of the slow phase at high [nucleotide], which indicates that the M†1·L and M†2·L states have nearly the same fluorescence yield in D. discoideum myosin (hence at saturating [nucleotide], step 2b is optically silent). Furthermore, the k obs of the fast phase appeared to extrapolate back to give a large intercept value (250–1000 s−1), whereas it was close to zero in the Trybus and Taylor (3Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) data. This aspect is difficult to characterize with accuracy, However, it can be accounted for by an additional weak but competitive nonproductive binding mode of the nucleotide as in ReactionFR2. Here, M#·L might represent a nucleotide bound to the active site in a noncompetent orientation that must dissociate and reassociate (or rearrange while bound) before forming the tightly bound form M†2·L. The fluorescence transients from the double tryptophan construct, W129+/W501+, show a clear distinction between the nucleotide binding steps and the open-closed transition that is coupled to hydrolysis, because the signals have opposite signs (cf. skeletal myosin, where they both give enhancements). Furthermore, the effective hydrolysis rate is slowed to 8 s−1 at 20 °C, which may be useful for developing conformationally resolved single molecule ATPase assays because the transition occurs on the time scale appropriate for video acquisition (27Bagshaw C.R. Conibear P.B. Single Mol. 2000; 1: 269-275Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although the aim of this work was to characterize the tryptophan residue(s) in the motor domain that respond to the nucleotide binding steps and to exploit the fluorescence signal to delineate the elementary steps of this process, it is of interest to relate these steps to those that occur in the presence of actin. Previous studies have estimated that the ATP-induced dissociation of acto-D. discoideum motor domain is limited by a first order step of 150–450 s−1 at 20 °C (8Kurzawa S. E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Kuhlman P.A. Bagshaw C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is thus comparable with the slower of the two isomerization steps revealed by Trp129 fluorescence. We confirm that the acto-W129+ construct dissociates with a maximum rate constant of 150 s−1 at saturating [ATP]. The conformational changes sensed by the tryptophan residues near the active site (Trp129 and Trp131) are therefore likely to occur before or are coincident with the ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation reaction. This is in agreement with thermodynamic arguments that require coupling with an effectively irreversible step (step 2b with ATP) in the binding mechanism to provide sufficient energy to drive the actomyosin dissociation reaction. We find no evidence of a slower tryptophan fluorescence change sensed by Trp129 after actin dissociation, but previous reports with skeletal myosin where this was observed may reflect a contribution from the open-closed transition (26Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Single tryptophan-containing constructs will provide a valuable tool for further delineating communication pathways between the actin site, nucleotide site, and converter region of myosins.

We have previously shown that it disrupts nuclear factor of κB (NFκB)-DNA complexes in vitro. In this study, we demonstrated that in HeLa cells native myotrophin/V-1 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus during sustained NFκB activation. Three-dimensional alignment studies indicate that myotrophin/V-1 resembles a truncated IκBα without the signal response domain (SRD) and PEST domains. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that myotrophin/V-1 interacts with NFκB proteinsin vitro; however, it remains physically associated only with p65 and c-Rel proteins in vivo during NFκB activation. In vitro studies indicate that myotrophin/V-1 can promote the formation of p50-p50 homodimers from monomeric p50 proteins and can convert the preformed p50-p65 heterodimers into p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of myotrophin/V-1 resulted in elevated levels of both p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers exceeding the levels of p50-p65 heterodimers compared with Adβgal-infected cells, where the levels of p50-p65 heterodimers exceeded the levels of p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers. Thus, overexpression of myotrophin/V-1 during NFκB activation resulted in a qualitative shift by quantitatively reducing the level of transactivating heterodimers while elevating the levels of repressive p50-p50 homodimers. Correspondingly, overexpression of myotrophin/V-1 resulted in significantly reduced κB-luciferase reporter activity. Because myotrophin/V-1 is found at elevated levels during NFκB activation in postnatal cerebellum and in failing human hearts, this study cumulatively suggests that myotrophin/V-1 is a regulatory protein for modulating the levels of activated NFκB dimers during this period.

In the postnatal rat cerebellum, the cellular level of soluble Myo/V1 was found to be transiently up-regulated immediately after birth and later declined displaying a unique pattern of expression among 120 soluble proteins, implicating its role during postnatal cerebellum development (2Taoka M.

Bilgin B. Eickemeier S. Hipskind R. Singh M. Szamel M. Resch K. Biofactors. 1995; 5: 169-174PubMed Google Scholar,22Udalova I.A. Richardson A. Denys A. Smith C. Ackerman H. Foxwell B. Kwiatkowski D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9113-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, thus far the underlying molecular mechanism for the generation and dynamic reorganization of NFκB dimers during chronic activation is unknown. Here, for the first time, we show that Myo/V1 acts as a “zipper chaperone” protein to generate NFκB homodimers from monomeric p50 proteins and with its “unzipping” function converts the transcriptionally active p50-p65 heterodimers to transcriptionally repressive homodimers in HeLa cells, thus attenuating NFκB-mediated transcription. Recombinant Myo/V1 protein was expressed inEscherichia coli in two different forms (∼12-kDa full-length and histidine-tagged ∼14-kDa fusion protein) using pET expression vectors as described before (3Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sil P.C. Sen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2812-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The following mammalian expression plasmids were constructed by recombinant DNA methods. For pcDNA-AM1.1-Myo/V1, because of the poor translation initiation Kozak site in the Myo/V1 mRNA, we engineered a heterologous highly efficient Kozak site into 5′-untranslated region of Myo/V1 so that Myo/V1 is expressed at high levels in mammalian cells. In vitro transcription and translation with pcDNA3-AM1.1-Myo/V1 template DNA confirmed the synthesis of 12-kDa Myo/V1 protein at higher levels than the native Myo/V1 mRNA (data not shown). For pκB-tk-luc, the parent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and two κB enhancer sites was obtained and replaced with the coding region of luciferase enzyme. pRSV-RelA vector expressing p65 was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The expression plasmid is from Dr. Gary Nabel and Dr. Neil Perkins. The recombinant adenoviruses expressing Myo/V1 and β-galactosidase were constructed as follows. For AdMyo/V1/Adβgal, the respective expression plasmids pcDNA3-AM1.1-Myo/V1 and pcDNA3-βgal were incorporated into Ad5 adenovirus through allelic recombination. Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated, purified, and titered as previously reported (46Vallejo J.G. Knuefermann P. Mann D.L. Sivasubramanian N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (ATCC-CCL2) were maintained in minimal essential medium. Cell fixation and indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed as previously described (47Sivasubramanian N. Nayak D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Plasmid DNA transient transfection experiments were performed using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche). Luciferase assays were conducted with reagents from Promega Inc. The protein concentration was determined by BCA method using Pierce reagents. HeLa cells were treated for 2 h with TNF (50 ng/ml) to induce NFκB. For superinduction of NFκB, cells were further treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). After 2 h of treatment, cells were harvested and subcellular fractionation for cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were carried out as previously described (48Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were harvested at 150 × g and Dounce-homogenized in a hypotonic lysis buffer (buffer A; Ref. 49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), and nuclei were collected at 4300 × g. The nuclei were extracted with buffer C (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and were used for GSA and Western blot analysis. After the removal of the nuclei, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for isolating mitochondrial fractions. The remaining cytosolic supernatant was further concentrated by acetone precipitation. Identical amounts of cytosolic (40 μg), nuclear extract (30 μg), and mitochondrial proteins (35 μg) were fractionated on a 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and processed for Myo/V1 ECL immunoblotting. Pure recombinant p50 protein was obtained from Promega Inc., and pure truncated recombinant p65Δ (p65 RHRs) protein was obtained from Dr. Gaurishankar Ghosh (50Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The p65Δ contains only the Rel DNA binding domain (∼31 kDa; aa 19–291) of p65, and the carboxyl terminus containing the transactivating domain of p65 has been removed (50Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Monomeric p50 (2.5 ng in 50 μl; 2 nm) and p65Δ (0.5 μg in 50 μl; 7 μm) proteins were separately incubated with increasing concentrations of Myo/V1 (0–100 ng) and the resulting κB-DNA complexes from these reactions were analyzed by GSA (3Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sil P.C. Sen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2812-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Vallejo J.G. Knuefermann P. Mann D.L. Sivasubramanian N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because p50 and p65 proteins exhibit high affinity to each other, equimolar concentrations of p50 (16 pmol; 0.8 μg) and p65Δ (16 pmol; 0.5 μg) proteins were mixed and incubated in a binding buffer at 4 °C to preform the p50-p65Δ heterodimers. Later, increasing concentrations of 12-kDa Myo/V1 protein (0–56 pmol; 0–800 ng) were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the radiolabeled κB oligonucleotides (25,000 cpm) were added and incubated for another 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting κB-DNA complexes from these reactions were analyzed by GSA (3Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sil P.C. Sen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2812-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Vallejo J.G. Knuefermann P. Mann D.L. Sivasubramanian N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mobility patterns of the p50-p65Δ, p50-p50, and p65Δ-p65Δ dimers on GSA exactly resemble the previously published patterns for these dimers (43Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Chen F.E. Kempiak S. Huang D.B. Phelps C. Ghosh G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 52Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the nature of Myo/V1-generated NFκB dimers, antibodies to p50 (#sc114x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and p65 (#ab243, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added to preformed heterodimers (equimolar mixture of p50 (80 ng) and p65Δ (50 ng) proteins) with increasing concentrations of Myo/V1 (0, 100, 400 ng), and its effects were studied on GSA. This experiment was also repeated with preformed p50-p65Δ heterodimers with 100-fold excess p65Δ protein (5 μg). We developed a more accurate method to quantify NFκB dimers in mammalian cell nuclear extracts. We chose three κB sites from native genes, which have been previously well characterized to exhibit high affinity to individual NFκB dimers. The rationale behind this approach is with varied amounts of activated NFκB dimers in the mammalian cell, using a single κB oligo, which exhibits high affinity to one dimer, and not to others and using it to quantify the various NFκB dimers will yield erroneous results. Moreover, the ideal κB oligo, which exhibits equal affinity toward all NFκB dimers with varied mobilities on GSA to distinguish them, does not exist. Therefore, the conventional κB-Igκ/HIV oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to quantify only p50-p65 heterodimers because it exhibited high affinity only toward p50-p65 heterodimers. Because this κB site exhibited lower affinities toward p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers (5- and 15-fold, respectively) (53Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Malek S. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24392-24399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we chose two other κB oligonucleotides κB#SeqB (44Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and κB#u-iNOS (45Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which were previously shown to exhibit high affinity and exclusive specificity toward p50-p50 and p65-p65 homodimers (44Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Marks-Konczalik J. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The κB#SeqB (5′-GTAGGGGGCCTCCCCGGCTCGAGATCCTATG-3′) and κB#u-iNOS (5′-GTACCGGAAATTCCGGGCTCGAGATCCTATG-3′) oligonucleotides were custom synthesized (Synthetic Genetics, CA) and used for quantifying respective NFκB homodimers. To determine the relative levels of various NFκB dimers, nuclear extracts (∼20 μg) from AdMyo/V1- and Adβgal-infected cells were incubated with radiolabeled individual κB oligonucleotides (κB-Igκ, #SeqB; #u-iNOS; 25,000 cpm with similar specific activities), and the resulting DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on the same 4% PAGE. Radiographic images of the gels were captured using a STORM 860 imager (Molecular Dynamics, CA) and quantified using ImageQuant 4.2 software. NFκB antibody supershifts were done as described previously; however, p65 antibody from Geneka Biotechnology (Montreal, Canada) was used in these experiments. Additionally, heterologous chase experiments were done to further confirm the nature of the NFκB dimers. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were conducted to locate the native Myo/V1 protein in HeLa cells. Under basal conditions (Fig. 1 A), Myo/V1 was predominantly observed in a wide area of the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus. Further analysis with confocal microscopy revealed that native Myo/V1 was also present in the nucleus to a lesser extent (spotted green fluorescence in Fig.1 C). Upon treatment with TNF for 1 h, Myo/V1 was found to cluster around the perinuclear region in the cytoplasm. Additionally, Myo/V1 was found to increase slightly within the nucleus (green FITC masking the blue DAPI nuclear staining, resulting in pale blue nucleus) suggesting migration of Myo/V1 to the nucleus (Fig.1 B). Because TNF is known to reorganize the cytoskeleton (54Koukouritaki S.B. Vardaki E.A. Papakonstanti E.A. Lianos E. Stournaras C. Emmanouel D.S. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 382-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Yan S.R. Fumagalli L. Dusi S. Berton G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 58: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 56De Vos K. Goossens V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9673-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the present observation of increased perinuclear clustering and nuclear migration of Myo/V1 in TNF-treated HeLa cells (Fig.1 B) suggests that Myo/V1 might be associated with the cytoskeleton and its associated organelles and might participate in the signal transduction process from these locations. Cellular partitioning studies were performed to determine the location of Myo/V1 under the NFκB inducing conditions. Cells were treated with TNF or TNF plus CHX for 2 h. Cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear extracts were prepared and immunoblotted for Myo/V1 protein (Fig.2). Under basal conditions the majority of Myo/V1 was present in the cytoplasmic fraction (lane 5 in Fig. 2 B) and only a small quantity in the nuclear fraction (lane 3 in Fig. 2 B). After TNF stimulation for 2 h, Myo/V1 levels in the cytoplasmic fraction did not change significantly (data not shown). However, with TNF plus CHX stimulation, the levels of Myo/V1 reduced significantly in the cytoplasmic fraction compared with control (lanes 5 and 6 in Fig.2 B). Additionally, a simultaneous increase in the levels of Myo/V1 was observed in the nucleus (lane 4 in Fig.2 B), indicating that the translocated Myo/V1 migrated from cytoplasm. We did not observe any Myo/V1 in mitochondrial fractions (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that, under acute stress conditions, a major relocalization of Myo/V1 first occurs within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B), following which Myo/V1 is translocated to the nucleus. To confirm that Myo/V1 physically interacts with NFκB proteins, co-immunoprecipitation studies were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. Fig.3 A shows that, in vitro, p50, p65, and c-Rel proteins strongly interacted with Myo/V1 protein (lanes 2–4). To further confirm these physical interactions in vivo, HeLa cells were treated with diluent (lanes 8–10 in Fig. 3 B), TNF plus CHX (lanes 5–7 in Fig. 3 B), or phorbol ester (lanes 11–13 in Fig. 3 C) for 2 h or infected with AdMyo/V1 for 12 h (lanes 14and 15 in Fig. 3 C), cellular extracts were prepared, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted. In control diluent-treated cells, Myo/V1 did not associate with any of the NFκB proteins (lanes 8–10 in Fig. 3 B). However, in TNF plus CHX- or AdMyo/V1-treated cells, Myo/V1 predominantly associated with p65 protein (lane 7 in Fig.3 B and lane 15 in Fig. 3 C) but not with p50 protein (lane 6 in Fig. 3 B andlane 14 in Fig. 3 C). In phorbol ester-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 3 C), Myo/V1 co-immunoprecipitated with c-Rel and p65 protein (lanes 11 and12 in Fig. 3 C) compared with p50 protein (lane 13 in Fig. 3 C). Because our earlier studies indicated that Myo/V1 disrupts and induces the formation of new NFκB-DNA complexes (3Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sil P.C. Sen S. J. Biol.

GTPase-activating protein GAL4 DNA-binding domain human Aurora/Ipl1-related kinase Src homology 3 Src homology 2 polyclonal antibody monoclonal antibody human Drosophila melanogaster Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum Ras proteins play a key role in the control of proliferation and differentiation (1Hall A. Science. 1990; 249: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The function of Ras in mammalian cells depends upon the activities of guanine exchange factors, which catalyze the exchange of GDP/GTP (2Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and the activities of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 such as RasGAP and neurofibromin (3Xu G.F. O'Connell P. Viskochil D. Cawthon R. Robertson M. Culver M. Dunn D. Stevens J. Gesteland R. White R. Cell. 1990; 62: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). RasGAP was first identified as a cytosolic protein able to stimulate the GTP hydrolysis of GTP bound to p21 ras (4Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Allard W.J. Sigal I.S. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5026-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and is thus essentially described as a negative regulator of Ras. In the case of cells expressing oncogenic forms of Ras, RasGAP is no longer able to deactivate Ras. However, in these cells, RasGAP acts as a Ras effector, displaying functions associated with proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis independently of its GAP activity (5Tocque B. Delumeau I. Parker F. Maurier F. Multon M.C. Schweighoffer F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These effects may be transduced by unknown RasGAP partners. RasGAP displays its GAP activity via its COOH-terminal domain (6Marshall M.S. Hill W.S., Ng, A.S. Vogel U.S. Schaber M.D. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Its NH2-terminal region appears to be essential to trigger downstream signals (7Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Martin G.A. Yatani A. Clark R. Conroy L. Polakis P. Brown A.M. McCormick F. Science. 1992; 255: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly the NH2-terminal region contains several domains involved in interactions with different proteins in vitro, notably an SH3 domain flanked by two SH2 domains. These SH2 domains can associate with phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors (platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor), v-Src, and two phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, p62 and p190RhoGAP (9Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 10Molloy C.J. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Aaronson S.A.

SH3 domains are about 60 amino acids long and mediate interactions with proline-containing motifs within their partners (12Musacchio A. Gibson T. Lehto V.P. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The RasGAP SH3 domain is unusual as no proline-rich sequences able to bind this SH3 domain have been found. Several studies have shown that the RasGAP SH3 domain is important in oncogenic Ras signaling pathways (13Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Leblanc V. Tocque B. Delumeau I. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1992; 256: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, the microinjection of a monoclonal antibody directed against the RasGAP SH3 domain specifically induces cell death by apoptosis in tumor cells but not in normal cells (13Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The RasGAP SH3 domain is also involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, and the induction of gene expression in a Ras-dependent manner (14Leblanc V. Tocque B. Delumeau I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5567-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Medema R.H. de Laat W.L. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1992; 256: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RasGAP associates with the GAP SH3-binding protein and an unknown 14-kDa protein through its SH3 domain (17Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Hu K.Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the RNase GAP SH3-binding protein was not related to the known roles of RasGAP in the previous effects (19Guitard E. Parker F. Millon R. Abecassis J. Tocque B. Cancer Lett. 2001; 162: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Gallouzi I.E. Parker F. Chebli K. Maurier F. Labourier E. Barlat I. Capony J.P. Tocque B. Tazi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our aim was to identify proteins that interact with the RasGAP SH3 domain to further improve our understanding of its role in cell division and apoptosis. We used a two-hybrid approach to identify one such a protein, which was shown to be the Ser/Thr kinase Aurora. Finally we showed that RasGAP and Aurora form a ternary complex with the survivin protein in vivo. A rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the RasGAP COOH-terminal SH2 domain (G12930 and G12920, respectively) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The mouse mAb directed against FLAG (M2) and the pAb directed against survivin (FL-142) were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The rabbit immune serum directed against HsAIRK-1 was a gift from Aventis Pharma. DNA sequences corresponding to the SH3 domain of human RasGAP (Hs GAP SH3, residues 275–342), the SH3 domain of Drosophila melanogaster RasGAP (Dm GAP SH3, residues 176–252), and the SH2-SH3-SH2 region of human RasGAP (GAP SH2-3-2, residues 170–440) were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) in pGBT10. Human RasGAP cDNA was a gift from Aventis Pharma. For expression in mammalian cells, the cDNAs encoding HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2 were amplified by PCR, and the products were inserted in-frame with the NH2-terminal FLAG and COOH-terminal Myc tags in p3X-FLAG-Myc-CMV-24 (referred to as p3XFLAG vector hereafter, Sigma). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mutation (W317K) was introduced into the pGAL4BD-Hs GAP SH3 vector using oligonucleotides based on the published human RasGAP cDNA sequence. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Yeast two-hybrid procedures were carried out using a mating approach with HF7 and Y187 yeast strains (21Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of the D. melanogaster RasGAP was fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pGAL4BD-Dm GAP SH3) and used as the bait to screen an oligo(dT)-primed D. melanogaster0–24-h embryo cDNA library cloned in pACTII (a gift from S. Elledge). Plasmids from positive clones were rescued, and their specificity was tested with Dm GAP SH3, Hs GAP SH3, GAP SH2-3-2, Hs GAP SH3 mutant (W317K), human Grb2, and human Nck baits containing irrelevant SH3 domains. COS cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto culture dishes (100-mm diameter) and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The DEAE-dextran method was then used to transfect cells with 1 μg of p3XFLAG vector with or without the cDNA encoding HsAIRK-1 (GenBankTM accession numbers GI:4507278) or HsAIRK-2 (GI:4759177). After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h before being lysed with the appropriate buffer for further analysis. Exponential phase HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. For G1/S synchronization, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 18–24 h, released for 8–10 h, and then treated with thymidine for 16–18 h. For G2/M synchronization, cells were submit to double-block thymidine, released for 6–8 h with DMEM, 10% FCS, and finally incubated in the presence of 400 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16–18 h. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, phosphatase inhibitor (1 mm Na3VO4), kinase inhibitor (10 mm NaF), and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and CompleteTMprotease inhibitors mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was collected, solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Sigma). Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies coupled to either protein G- or protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with HNT buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and solubilized in 25 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Superblock buffer (Pierce) and blotted for 1 h at room temperature with the corresponding primary antibodies: mAb GAP SH2 (1:1000), anti-FLAG (1 μg/ml) antibody, or anti-survivin (1:500) antibody. After secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Amersham Biosciences) incubation for 30 min at room temperature, immunoreactive bands were detected by use of the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell lysates were prepared as previously described for the immunoprecipitation experiments. RasGAP was precipitated by use of the PALpYAEPLDSL (where pY is phosphotyrosine) peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. This peptide is derived from the p62 dok protein and binds to the RasGAP NH2-terminal SH2 domain. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed as previously described using the following primary antibodies: mAb GAP SH2 (1:1000) and anti-HsAIRK-1 serum (1:10,000). Assays were performed in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 5,000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences), and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). After 10 min at 30 °C with shaking, 25 μl of the sample was withdrawn and placed on a piece of p81 Whatman paper (0.5 × 1.5 cm). The paper was washed three times with 5% orthophosphoric acid (2 ml/sample), and the radioactivity was counted. The results are expressed as the means of three to five independent transfection experiments and normalized according to the optical density of the immunoprecipitated proteins from the Western blotting experiments. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with the RasGAP SH3 domain. cDNA corresponding to amino acids 176–252 of the D. melanogasterRasGAP (Dm GAP SH3) was fused to the GAL4BD and used as the bait to screen a two-hybrid D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library. We obtained 6 × 106 transformants including 150 His+/LacZ+ double-positive clones. To analyze the specificity of their interactions, the 150 plasmids were isolated, retransformed into yeast Y187, and mated with the HF7 strain expressing either the GAL4BD alone or fused to Hs GAP SH3, Dm GAP SH3, GAP SH2-3-2 (containing the Hs GAP SH3 domain flanked with the two SH2 domains), the Hs GAP SH3 mutant (W317K), human Grb2, and human Nck (Fig. 1). This led to the identification of two preys that 1) allowed robust growth on histidine-free plates and displayed strong β-galactosidase activity when co-expressed with baits containing the wild-type GAP SH3 domain, 2) yielded no growth in the presence of Grb2 or Nck, which contain two and three SH3 domains, respectively, and 3) produced no growth in the presence of RasGAP SH3 W317K, which carries a mutation in a position known to disrupt SH3 domain interactions (Fig. 1). One of these two preys is a truncated Dm Aurora protein (GenBankTM accession number GI:603534) that lacks the first 19 amino acids and is in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. The human Aurora kinase orthologs, HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2, are ubiquitously expressed proteins, whereas HsAIRK-3 is expressed only in the testis (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our two-hybrid assay confirmed that HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2 orthologs interact with the Dm GAP SH3 domain (Fig. 1 A). The same results were obtained with the Hs GAP SH3 domain (data not shown). For in vivo studies, HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2 were cloned into the p3XFLAG vector and expressed in COS cells. The in vivo interactions between RasGAP and HsAIRK-1 or HsAIRK-2 were studied by immunoprecipitation experiments performed on transfected COS cell lysates (Fig.2). When endogenous RasGAP was immunoprecipitated in lysates from p3XFLAG-HsAIRK-1- or p3XFLAG-HsAIRK-2-transfected COS cells, RasGAP and the kinases were co-precipitated. Two truncated versions of Aurora were generated in an attempt to locate the region involved in the binding of Aurora to the RasGAP SH3 domain (Fig.3 A). The NH2-terminal (residues 1–152) and the COOH-terminal (residues 153–411) domains were cloned independently into the pACTII vector, and mating experiments were carried out to determine whether these domains interacted with the RasGAP SH3 domain. The RasGAP SH3 domain bound to the COOH-terminal domain of Aurora but not to the NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the conserved interaction between RasGAP and the Aurora/HsAIRKs proteins and with the fact that the COOH-terminal kinase domain is highly preserved throughout evolution (identity/similarity 58/68% between Aurora and HsAIRK-1). Interestingly this minimal interaction domain does not contain any proline-rich consensus sequences. This is in accordance with 1) the lack of a recognition platform required for the preferential binding to a proline-rich consensus sequence in the RasGAP SH3 domain and 2) the fact that no consensus proline-rich motif has been shown to bind to the RasGAP SH3 domain (23Yang Y.S. Garbay C. Duchesne M. Cornille F. Jullian N. Fromage N. Tocque B. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We investigated whether RasGAP modulated the kinase activity of HsAIRK proteins. The p3XFLAG-HsAIRK-1 and p3XFLAG-HsAIRK-2 were expressed in COS cells, and the kinase activity was measured after immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG or anti-RasGAP antibodies (Fig.3 C). Results are normalized with optical density of immunoprecipitated proteins from the Western blot. When expressed in the p3XFLAG vector, HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2 were highly expressed and active, whereas they were inactive when they were co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-RasGAP antibody. These results suggest that the kinase activity of HsAIRK proteins is inhibited by bound RasGAP. HsAIRK proteins are mainly expressed at the G2/M transition and during mitosis (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we confirmed that HsAIRK-1 is highly expressed at G2/M transition compared with G1/S transition, whereas RasGAP is similarly expressed in G1/S and G2/M transitions (Fig 4 A). As the RasGAP/HsAIRK-1 interaction could not be observed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Aurora immune serum, it was analyzed during the cell cycle using a RasGAP pull-down assay (Fig.4 A). Under these conditions, RasGAP precipitation is observed and reproducible. The RasGAP/HsAIRK-1 interaction increases in G2/M transition compared with G1/S transition, and this increase correlates with the cell cycle-dependent expression of HsHAIRK-1 protein. Otherwise yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays showed that survivin, a 16-kDa protein, interacts with HsAIRK-2 (24Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To determine whether RasGAP forms a complex with these proteins, we studied the capacity of survivin to precipitate with RasGAP. As expected, survivin co-immunoprecipitated with HsAIRK-1 and HsAIRK-2 when they were expressed as FLAG fusion proteins in COS cells (Fig. 4 B). HsAIRK and survivin proteins are mainly expressed during the G2/M transition and during mitosis (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the co-immunoprecipitation of RasGAP and survivin in G2/M nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells. In these conditions, survivin was co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against RasGAP (Fig. 4 C). Conversely RasGAP co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against survivin (Fig.4 C). These results show that the existence of a ternary complex between the RasGAP, HsAIRK-1/HsAIRK-2, and survivin proteins. We identified the mitotic “Aurora/Ipl1-related” kinases (referred to as Aurora hereafter) as specific in vivopartners of RasGAP, a protein involved both in the negative regulation of Ras and in Ras oncogenic activity (5Tocque B. Delumeau I. Parker F. Maurier F. Multon M.C. Schweighoffer F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This interaction involves the kinase domain of Aurora and the RasGAP SH3 domain. Aurora kinase is modulated in vivo by its interaction with RasGAP. This interaction is conserved between flies and humans. Moreover, the RasGAP/HsAIRK-1 interaction increases in G2/M transition compared with G1/S transition, and this increase correlates with the cell cycle-dependent expression of HsHAIRK-1 protein. The members of the Aurora kinase family are required for the completion of mitotic events (centrosome separation, bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome separation, and cytokinesis) and are often overexpressed in tumor cells (25Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K., Ng, L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The interaction between RasGAP and Aurora may be involved in the regulation of cell division and therefore in tumor cell proliferation. The expression and activity of HsAIRK are cell cycle-dependent (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Aurora family proteins are produced during G2/M transition and mitosis. Their activation, deactivation, and degradation by the proteasome are regulated by phosphorylation (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and dephosphorylation (protein phosphatase 1) processes (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). RasGAP may regulate HsAIRKs by recruiting them together with kinases and phosphatases, which are necessary for their activation or their inactivation and further degradation. Our results also showed that RasGAP co-immunoprecipitated with survivin in G2/M synchronized HeLa cells. Survivin is an Aurora-binding protein from the inhibitory apoptotic protein family (24Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Survivin is a bifunctional protein that suppresses apoptosis, regulates cell division, and is overexpressed in tumor cells (27Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Survivin, a 16-kDa protein, could be the unknown p14 protein that co-precipitates with RasGAP SH3 domain in glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays (18Hu K.Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RasGAP can generate anti-apoptotic signals through its NH2-terminal region in particular by means of its SH3 domain (13Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that survivin may be the RasGAP SH3 domain target that transduces the anti-apoptotic effect of RasGAP in cancer cells. This effect may be transmitted or modulated via Aurora. The phosphorylation of survivin is crucial for its ability to direct cells toward division or death by apoptosis particularly in association with caspase-9 (29O'Connor D.S. Grossman D. Plescia J., Li, F. Zhang H. Villa A. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13103-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The question remains as to whether survivin directly binds and inhibits caspase-9. We suggest that RasGAP and Aurora proteins are involved in the recruitment of survivin to p34 cdc2 , a kinase known to regulate survivin function (29O'Connor D.S. Grossman D. Plescia J., Li, F. Zhang H. Villa A. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13103-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is in accordance with the finding that RasGAP is a caspase-3 and -9 substrate and the finding that an NH2-terminal-generated fragment, including the SH3 domain, is involved in anti-apoptotic signaling (28Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally RasGAP was shown to be involved in the maturation ofXenopus oocytes at the G2/M transition. The microinjection of an antibody directed against the RasGAP SH3 domain inhibits the maturation of Xenopus oocytes by preventing the activation of the maturation-promoting factor complex (cyclin B-p34 cdc2 ) by activated Ras (30Pomerance M. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Pierre M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The anti-RasGAP SH3 antibody also induces an apoptotic response when injected into tumor cells (13Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the one hand, survivin is required for mitosis execution and is thought to be involved in the targeting of HsAIRK to its correct location on mitotic chromosomes and on the mitotic spindle apparatus. Survivin is also a mitotic substrate of p34 cdc2 -cyclin B1, and its subsequent phosphorylation is crucial for the survivin-mediated regulation of apoptosis during cell division (29O'Connor D.S. Grossman D. Plescia J., Li, F. Zhang H. Villa A. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13103-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Prigentet al. (22Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that p34 cdc2 is involved in the regulation of Aurora kinases during G2/M. All of these data suggest the existence of a multiprotein complex involving RasGAP, Aurora, survivin, p34 cdc2 , and caspase-9 proteins. This complex is probably involved in the balance between cell progression and apooptosis at the cell cycle G2/M checkpoint. This is the first study to propose a new RasGAP signaling pathway involving the formation of a ternary complex between RasGAP, Aurora/HsAIRK, and survivin. The analysis of these protein interactions will further improve our understanding of their respective roles in signal transduction. Our results open the way for studies on the RasGAP-dependent biological effects involved in Ras oncogenic transformation and tumor progression.

https://openalex.org/W2079208303,"Stimulation of cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers NF-kappaB1 p105 proteolysis, releasing associated Rel subunits to translocate into the nucleus and modulate target gene expression. Phosphorylation of serine 927 within the p105 PEST region by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex is required to promote p105 proteolysis in response to TNFalpha stimulation. In this study, the role of the p105 death domain (DD) in signal-induced p105 proteolysis is investigated. Endogenous p105 is shown to interact with the IKK complex in HeLa cells, and transient transfection experiments in 293 cells indicate that each of the catalytic components of the IKK complex, IKK1 and IKK2, can bind to p105. Interaction of p105 with both IKK1 and IKK2 is substantially reduced by deletion of the p105 DD or introduction of a specific point mutation (L841A) into the p105 DD homologous to the lpr mutation in Fas. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p105 on serine 927 by purified recombinant IKK1 or IKK2 protein in vitro is dramatically reduced in both DD mutants relative to wild type. Furthermore, both of the DD mutations significantly impair the ability of low concentrations of IKK2 to induce p105 serine 927 phosphorylation and proteolysis in transiently transfected 3T3 cells. However, high levels of transiently expressed IKK2 bypass the requirement for the p105 DD to induce p105 serine 927 phosphorylation. Finally, p105 serine 927 phosphorylation by the endogenous IKK complex after TNFalpha stimulation and subsequent p105 proteolysis is blocked in both p105 DD mutants when stably expressed in HeLa cells. Thus, the p105 DD acts as a docking site for IKK, increasing its local concentration in the vicinity of the p105 PEST region and facilitating efficient serine 927 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1983954145,"Using the yeast one-hybrid approach to screen a human breast tissue hybrid cDNA expression library, we have found that four orphan/nuclear receptors, ERRα-1, EAR-2, COUP-TFI (EAR-3), and RARγ, bind to the silencer (S1) region of the human aromatase gene. S1 down regulates promoters I.3 and II of the human aromatase gene. In this study, the interaction of EAR-2, COUP-TFI, and RARγ with S1 was confirmed by DNA mobility shift analysis. In contrast to the findings that ERRα-1 behaves as a positive regulatory factor, these three nuclear receptors were found, by mammalian cell transfection experiments, to act as negative regulatory factors by binding to S1. Furthermore, the negative action of these three nuclear receptors could override the positive effect of ERRα-1. RT–PCR analysis of 11 cell lines and 55 human breast tumor specimens has shown that these nuclear receptors are expressed in human breast tissue. Since EAR-2, COUP-TFI, and RARγ are expressed at high levels, it is likely that S1 is a negative regulatory element that suppresses aromatase promoters I.3 and II in normal breast tissue. In cancer tissue, S1 may function as a positive element since ERRα-1 is expressed, but EAR-2 and RARγ are only present in a small number of tumor specimens. This hypothesis is sustained by the finding that there is a weak inverse correlation between the expression of COUP-TFI and that of aromatase in breast tumor tissue. Our studies have revealed that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) can also bind to S1, in a ligand-dependent manner. By binding to S1, ERα down-regulates the aromatase promoter activity. These results demonstrate that nuclear receptors play important roles in modulating aromatase expression in human breast tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2025024262,"The binding of certain growth factors and cytokines to components of the extracellular matrix can regulate their local availability and modulate their biological activities. We show that mesenchymal cell-derived keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a key stimulator of epithelial cell proliferation during wound healing, preferentially binds to collagens I, III, and VI. Binding is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by denatured single collagen chains and collagen cyanogen bromide peptides. This interaction is saturable with dissociation constants of ∼ 10−8 to 10−9m and estimated molar ratios of up to three molecules of KGF bound to one molecule of triple helical collagen. Furthermore, collagen-bound KGF stimulated the proliferation of transformed keratinocyte or HaCaT cells. Ligand blotting of collagen-derived peptides points to a limited set of collagenous consensus sequences that bind KGF. By using synthetic collagen peptides, we defined the consensus sequence (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n as the collagen binding motif. We conclude that the preferential binding of KGF to the abundant collagens leads to a spatial pattern of bioavailable KGF that is dictated by the local organization of the collagenous extracellular matrix.

Interestingly, the biological activity of collagen-bound platelet-derived growth factor, HGF, interleukin 2, and oncostatin M was not abolished by binding to collagens, suggesting that these abundant matrix proteins may represent an important biological reservoir for these growth factors. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)/fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7) is a highly specific mitogen for various epithelial cells. KGF promotes proliferation and migration and was found to induce angiogenesis and stabilize endothelial barriers (10Werner S.

The known interactions of the FGFs with heparin or heparan sulfate moieties of cell membranes and extracellular proteoglycans can differentially modulate their activities. For example, heparan sulfate proteoglycans potentiate the biological activity of FGF-1 but strongly inhibit the activity of KGF/FGF-7 (31Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D.

Here we describe the specific interaction of KGF/FGF-7 predominantly with the abundant collagens I, III, and VI and their constituent chains. We define a minimal consensus collagen binding motif for KGF, study the effect of collagen-bound KGF in cell culture, and discuss the implications of this interaction for wound healing and epithelial regeneration.

Native collagens, collagen chains, and CNBr peptides were immobilized on polystyrene microtiter wells at concentrations of 2 μg/100 μl/well and 300–600 ng/100 μl/well, respectively, for binding studies and at 10-fold lower concentrations for inhibition experiments. Immobilization was done in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C followed by three washes with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaureate) for 1 h at room temperature for binding studies and with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for inhibition studies. Coating efficiencies for 2 μg/well native collagens and collagen chains ranged between 21 and 48% (7Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol.

KGF was radiolabeled with the [125I]Bolton-Hunter reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. [125I]KGF was separated from free iodine by a Sepharose G25 column (PD10, Amersham Biosciences) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 as described previously (7Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol.

The precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v) in the presence of 200 μg of BSA/200 μl usually yielded 90–96% of protein-bound radioactivity. The purity of radiolabeled KGF was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (data not shown). For binding studies, 1–2 ng of [125I]KGF in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 was added to the collagen-coated wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and finally after three washes in binding buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), radioactivity bound to the collagen-coated wells was measured in a γ-counter (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). For ligand blots 2 μg of collagen I, single collagen chains α1(I), α2(I), CNBr peptides of chain α1(I), and pepsin-resistant triple helical fragments of collagens IV and VI were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in binding buffer, and incubated with approximately 50 ng of [125I]KGF diluted in 10 ml of binding buffer (100,000 cpm/ml) for 2 h at room temperature followed by three washes with binding buffer before air-drying and autoradiography. As a control, a parallel blot was stained with Amido Black after electrophoretic transfer. For dot blots, serial dilutions of collagen I, chain α1(I), CNBr peptide α1CB6, and the collagen mimetics (GPO)10, (GPP)10, GFOGER-GPP, and GFOGER-GAP were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes at concentrations of 0.02–4 μg/dot. BSA was used as a negative control. Blocking, incubation, and autoradiography were done as described for the ligand blots. 1–2 ng of [125I]KGF and increasing concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/100 μl) of single chains of collagen types I and VI, CNBr peptides of collagen type I, collagen mimetics ((GPO)10, (GPP)10, GFOGER-GPP, and GFOGER-GAP)), high molecular weight heparin, or hepatocyte growth factor (0–200 ng/100 μl) were preincubated in a total volume of 350 μl for 2 h at room temperature in detergent-blocked polypropylene tubes. 100 μl of the mixture was then added in triplicate to microtiter wells precoated with collagen or collagen chains. After an additional 2 h of incubation and three washes with PBS, bound radioactivity was measured as described above. For saturation binding studies, increasing amounts of unlabeled KGF (0–300 ng) were added to 2 ng of the labeled growth factor in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in microtiter wells, which were precoated with 200 ng/100 μl/well of native triple helical collagens. Bound [125I]KGF was determined as described above after subtraction of the radioactivity bound to BSA-coated wells, which ranged from 8 to 17%. Collagens IV and VI, the α1 and α2 chains of collagen type I, and the CNBr peptides of α2(I) were immobilized at 2 μg/100 μl/well on microtiter plates and incubated with 1 ng/100 μl of 125I-labeled KGF under the following conditions. Solutions were adjusted by increasing amounts of NaCl (50–1500 mmol/liter) in a buffer of 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, resulting in osmolalities between 120 and 3020 mosm. The binding of [125I]KGF to precoated collagens was performed as described for inhibition experiments. To determine the biological activity of collagen-bound KGF, a modified KGF bioassay was used. Spontaneously immortalized HaCaTs, kindly provided by N. Fusenig (Heidelberg, Germany), were cultured in 80-cm2 flasks containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm glutamine supplemented with penicillin (107 units/liter), streptomycin (10 mg/liter), and 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) under standardized conditions (37 °C, 8% CO2) in a humidified atmosphere. The α1 chain of collagen type I was coated on microtiter plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) at a concentration of 2 μg/100 μl/well (0.3 cm2) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h followed by extensive washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. KGF in PBS was added to the wells at increasing concentrations and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After 2 h, unbound KGF was removed by washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 followed by three washes with PBS. 100 μl of trypsinized HaCaT cells in the logarithmic growth phase (100,000 cells/ml medium) was plated on the collagen-coated wells to which different amounts of KGF had been bound. Soluble KGF added to already seeded HaCaT cells served as a positive control. Cells were then cultured for 72 h, and cell numbers were measured by a colorimetric assay, sulforhodamine B (SRB), as described previously (35Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J.

Radiolabeled KGF bound specifically to all immobilized native and heat-denatured collagens tested. The binding to collagens I, II, and IV and single chains of collagens I, III, and IV ranged between 7 and 11% after the subtraction of nonspecifically bound radioactivity and reached 16–27% for collagens III and VI and single chains of collagen VI. KGF also bound to immobilized CNBr peptides of α1(I) (in the order CB8 → CB6 → CB7 → CB3) and to the CNBr peptides of α2(I) (Fig.1). KGF binding was confirmed by ligand blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, [125I]KGF highlighted the chains of collagens I, IV, and VI after separation by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. In comparison to protein staining, the autoradiography showed strong binding to all chains and CNBr peptides but reduced the binding to α1(I)CB3 and α1(VI), for example, supporting the results of the microtiter well assays. Because these results suggested common or similar binding sites on the collagens under investigation and because most of the collagen fragments bound KGF, we used minimal collagen mimetics with and without the characteristic collagenous triple helical structure. A dot blot analysis revealed strong binding to the minimal triple helical peptide (GPO)10, whereas (GPP)10 showed reduced but still detectable binding (Fig. 3). However, collagen mimetics containing an inserted sequence (GFOGER-GPP) or alanine-residues (GFOGER-GAP) that disrupt the triple helical structure did not interact with KGF. These results suggest that between 5 and 10 triplets of the structures (GPO) and (GPP) are essential for KGF binding, although binding is especially favored by having hydroxyproline in the X′ position of the (GXX′)n-collagenous structure. To further prove specificity of the KGF-collagen interaction, inhibition experiments were performed. The binding of radiolabeled KGF to “immobilized” collagens, collagen chains, or collagen fragments (CNBr peptides) could be inhibited by “soluble” collagen chains (Fig.4, A andB), CNBr peptides (Fig. 4C), or collagen mimetics (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4A, the soluble α1(I) chain could strongly inhibit KGF binding to the immobilized α1(I) chain with half-maximal inhibition at a 1:1 molar ratio, taking into account a coating efficiency of 40%. To further define the KGF binding sequences on the α1(I) chain, α1(I)CNBr fragments were used in inhibition experiments, which demonstrated primarily α1(I)CB6 and α1(I)CB8 as inhibitors of KGF binding to α1(I) (Fig.4C). The binding to collagen VI and the inhibition of KGF binding to immobilized collagen I chains, collagen IV, and collagen VIr/a by soluble collagen VI chains (Fig. 4B, CVI r/a) demonstrate the cross-inhibitory potential of different collagens and chains. In line with the binding assays, the collagen mimetics (GPO)10 and (GPP)10 were the best inhibitors of KGF in this setting, whereas GFOGER-GPP had a somewhat lower inhibitory potential and non-helical control GFOGER-GAP had no inhibitory potential (Fig. 4D). Similarly, when KGF was reacted with immobilized α1(I)CB6, (GPO)10 was the best inhibitor (data not shown). To determine the binding affinities of the KGF-collagen interaction, saturation binding studies were performed. Increasing amounts of unlabeled KGF were incubated with a constant amount of [125I]KGF (∼1 ng = 0.04 pmol/well), reaching a saturation of 5–7 pmol of added KGF/100 μl on 200 ng/well (∼0.65 pmol) of immobilized collagen types I (Mr = ∼300,000) (Fig.5A), III (Mr = ∼300,000) (Fig. 5B), and VI (Mr = ∼320,000) (Fig. 5C) with preestablished coating efficiencies between 30 and 40%. Scatchard analysis yielded binding sites of comparable affinity on the tested collagens with dissociation constants (KD) between 10-8 and 10-9 mol/liter. Based on these data, 1m immobilized native interstitial collagens I or III was estimated to bind approximately 1 m KGF, microfibrillar collagen VI, and 3 m KGF. KGF binding to collagens I, IV, and VI could be partly inhibited by preincubation with heparin (Fig.6A). KGF as a heparin binding growth factor could not be displaced completely from collagen by heparin with still 50–70% KGF bound at maximal heparin concentrations (10 μg/100 μl/well). In comparison to the inhibition by collagen mimetics that left only 30% KGF bound (Fig. 4D), these data suggest collagen-binding domains on KGF that are different from the heparin binding region. Because we previously showed that HGF is a collagen binding as well as a heparin binding growth factor, we investigated the competition of HGF and KGF for binding to collagens type I, III, and VI. As indicated in Fig.6B, a 17–27-fold molar excess of HGF over KGF resulted in 50% inhibition of KGF binding to collagens I, III, and VI. Maximal inhibition (∼90%) of KGF binding to collagens type I and III was achieved by a 100–120-fold molar excess of HGF over KGF, whereas only 50% of the microfilamentous collagen VI could be displaced by an even 140-fold molar excess of HGF. These results clearly point to consensus binding sites for both cytokines on interstitial collagens I and III, whereas the microfibrillar collagen VI may contain additional binding sites. Fig.6C demonstrates that KGF binding to collagens and collagen chains can be disrupted by ionic forces. The binding was reduced to 50% at osmolalities of ∼100–150 mosm for collagen IV and the α1(I) chain and at 200 mosm for the α2(I) chain, whereas 250–300 mosm were needed for a 50% reduction of binding to collagen VI and the CNBr peptides of α2(I). Background levels for all collagens were reached at 1500 mosm. Collagen-bound KGF induced a strong proliferative response on HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig.7), reaching maximal stimulation when 25–30 pmol of KGF had been preincubated in α1(I)-coated wells. Because ∼12% preincubated KGF was bound to the α1(I) chain under these conditions (Fig. 1), the biological activity of collagen-bound KGF was equivalent to the activity of the same amount of KGF in solution (Fig. 7). We demonstrated that KGF binds to immobilized collagens in the order type VI → III → I → II → IV in vitro. Furthermore, collagen-bound KGF is biologically active as shown by HaCaT proliferation assay. The interaction of KGF with native and denatured collagens could be inhibited by single collagen chains and smaller collagen chain fragments. Saturation binding experiments yielded dissociation constants of approximately 10-8 to 10-9m, which are in the range of other growth factor collagen interactions (6Somasundaram R. Ruehl M. Tiling N.

The disruption of the interaction by an increase in osmolality shows that this binding is mediated mainly by ionic forces, which has been demonstrated for other collagen binding (7Somasundaram R.

However, this is very likely an underestimation of the available binding sites in vivo, because experiments were performed with collagens immobilized on plastic, which may limit accessibility. Cross-inhibition and ligand blot experiments suggested collagenous consensus binding motifs for KGF. This was proven by using synthetic collagen peptides containing the sequences (GPO)10 and (GPP)10 that spontaneously form a collagen-like triple helix (33Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J.

The preferred binding of KGF to (GPO)10over (GPP)10 indicates that the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline makes an important contribution to the interaction. The slightly weaker interaction with GFOGER-GPP, a triple helical peptide with a run of 10 GPP triplets interrupted by an integrin binding motif (34Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), suggests that a minimal number of “consecutive” GPP/GPO stretches is necessary for the KGF-collagen interaction. Binding does not occur to the analogous non-helical peptide GFOGER-GAP, suggesting that the native triple helical structure defined by stretches of GPP/GPO is necessary for effective binding of KGF to collagen. As shown in Fig. 2, the cyanogen bromide peptides α1(I)CB6, CB7, and CB8 but not α1(I)CB3 bound KGF. Upon closer inspection, the sequence of α1(I)CB3 comprises only four isolated GPP or GPO triplets compared with 12, 12, and 9 triplets partly in sequence for CB6, CB7, and CB8, respectively. The peptide α1(I)CB6 harbors a stretch with more than two triplets of GPP or GPO (five in sequence), whereas α1(I)CB7 and α1(I)CB8 contain only one or two GPP or GPO triplets. Thus, the larger number of GPP/GPO motifs in CB6, CB7, and CB8 suggests that even in the longer CNBr peptides (149, 264, 271, and 279 amino acids for peptides CB3, CB6, CB7, and CB8, respectively), a minimal number of sequential GPP or GPO triplets are required for binding of KGF. KGF as a member of the FGF family binds also to heparin and heparan sulfate (31Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol.

Because heparin led to a 50% inhibition of the KGF-collagen interaction (Fig. 6A), a maximal binding to the extracellular matrix (and also the KGF receptor) appears to necessitate a combined KGF-collagen and KGF-heparin/heparan sulfate interaction. HGF, another mesenchyme-derived heparin as well as collagen binding epithelial growth factor, differs from KGF in that HGF-collagen binding is almost completely inhibited by heparin (8Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because an excess of HGF could partly displace KGF from collagen (Fig.6B), both growth factors may have similar binding sites for heparin/heparan sulfate and collagens. The binding and storage of biologically active KGF by the collagenous extracellular matrix as shown by our in vitro and cell culture experiments may play an important role in the local availability and activity of this growth factor. It is well documented that KGF is up-regulated in the mesenchyme-underlying areas of epithelial lesions, such as those occurring after skin injury, in the intestine, or the liver to promote epidermal, intestinal, and hepatic reepithelialization, wound healing, and regeneration (10Werner S.

In support of this finding, the local application of KGF in several rodent models of gastrointestinal and lung injury (chemotherapy- and/or radiation-induced) has led to a significant reduction of mortality in KGF-treated animals (22Farrell C.L. Bready J.V. Rex K.L. Chen J.N. DiPalma C.R. Whitcomb K.L. Yin S. Hill D.C. Wiemann B. Starnes C.O. Havill A.M., Lu, Z.N. Aukerman S.L. Pierce G.F. Thomason A. Potten C.S. Ulich T.R. Lacey D.L.

In the intestine, this is accompanied by enhanced crypt cell proliferation and rapid reepithelization without scarring. Therefore, KGF may have therapeutic potential for the gastrointestinal tract and in a similar way for the liver, the lung, or skin (24Potten C.S. O'Shea J.A. Farrell C.L. Rex K. Booth C. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xia Y.P. Zhao Y. Marcus J. Jimenez P.A. Ruben S.M. Moore P.A. Khan F. Mustoe T.A. J.

Especially in chronic lesions, e.g. from cutaneous wounds or Crohn's disease, where fibrogenesis, i.e. an up-regulation of extracellular matrix production, is observed (43Matthes H. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Stallmach A. Milani S. Stein H. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the binding of KGF to collagens may enhance (local) epithelial regeneration by its short term storage followed by release from abundant collagens,e.g. by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). The activation of MMPs and their ability to cleave native and denatured collagens may enhance the availability of collagen-bound KGF, which as shown by our cell culture experiments, maintains its biological activity. In this context, it is of interest that KGF was shown to induce the production of MMP-1, MMP-9, and the plasminogen activator uPA in epithelial cell lines from human prostate or porcine periodontal ligament (44Ropiquet F.

Another more targeted approach to release KGF from the collagenous matrix may be the use of synthetic collagen mimetics based on the sequence (GPO)10. In conclusion, our finding of the specific interaction of KGF with collagens via the binding motif (GPO)n opens a novel approach to enhance and modulate the local availability and activity of KGF at the site of active lesions. In vivo experiments are needed to show how far GPO-containing peptides can be used to promote epithelial wound healing in inflammatory and repair processes, such as that found in the damaged skin, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, the lung, and other epithelial systems.

https://openalex.org/W2083528409,"The N-terminal domain of c-Myc plays a key role in cellular transformation and is involved in both activation and repression of target genes as well as in modulated proteolysis of c-Myc via the proteasome. Given this functional complexity, it has been difficult to clarify the structures within the N terminus that contribute to these different processes as well as the mechanisms by which they function. We have used a simplified yeast model system to identify the primary determinants within the N terminus for (i) chromatin remodeling of a promoter, (ii) gene activation from a chromatin template in vivo, and (iii) interaction with highly purified Gcn5 complexes as well as other chromatin-remodeling complexes in vitro. The results identify two regions that contain autonomous chromatin opening and gene activation activity, but both regions are required for efficient interaction with chromatin-remodeling complexes in vitro. The conserved Myc boxes do not play a direct role in gene activation, and Myc box II is not generally required for in vitro interactions with remodeling complexes. The yeast SAGA complex, which is orthologous to the human GCN5-TRRAP complex that interacts with Myc in human cells, plays a role in Myc-mediated chromatin opening at the promoter but may also be involved in later steps of gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2136116190,"The inappropriate expression of TGFalpha in growth arrest contributes to malignant progression in human colon carcinoma cells. Early stage, non-progressed colon tumor cells show a down-regulation of TGFalpha in growth arrest and require both nutrients and growth factors for re-entry into the cell cycle. In contrast, highly progressed cells up-regulate TGFalpha during growth arrest and require only nutrients for re-entry. Given the importance of TGFalpha in malignant progression, this work addressed the regulation of TGFalpha expression in the early stage colon carcinoma cell line, FET. Growth-arrested FET cells down-regulated the expression of TGFalpha, EGFr and, in turn, EGFr activation. These quiescent cells continued to express high levels of IGF-IR protein, but IGF-IR activation was undetectable. Cell cycle re-entry required exogenous growth factor activation of the IGF-IR by insulin or IGF-I. This IGF-IR activation resulted in S phase re-entry and was accompanied by an approximate threefold induction of TGFalpha expression along with EGFr activation at 1 h following release from growth arrest. Activation of IGF-IR occurred within 5 min of cell-cycle re-entry. Previously identified DNA binding proteins which bind to a unique TGFalpha/EGF response element within the TGFalpha promoter were similarly induced following IGF-IR activation. The addition of EGFr neutralizing antibodies abolished the activated IGF-IR stimulated S phase re-entry. Moreover, disruption of the growth arrest associated down-regulation of TGFalpha in FET cells by constitutive TGFalpha expression abrogated the requirement for IGF-IR activation for cell cycle re-entry. Consequently, this study indicates, for the first time, that IGF-IR activation up-regulates components of the TGFalpha autocrine loop resulting in TGFalpha-mediated EGFr activation which was critical for IGF-IR mediated re-entry into the cell cycle from the growth-arrested state."

With the goal of determining the minimum structure of the Na+ channel permeation pathway, we created two stable cell lines expressing the voltage-dependent rat skeletal muscle Na+channel (μ1) with a polyhistidine tag on the C terminus (μHis) and pore-only μ1 (μPore) channels with S1–S4 in all domains removed. Both constructs were recognized by a Na+ channel-specific antibody on a Western blot. μHis channels exhibited the same functional properties as wild-type μ1. In contrast, μPore channels did not conduct Na+ currents nor did they bind [3H]saxitoxin. Veratridine caused 40 and 54% cell death in μHis- and μPore-expressing cells, respectively. However, veratridine-induced cell death could only be blocked by tetrodotoxin in cells expressing μHis, but not μPore. Furthermore, using a fluorescent Na+ indicator, we measured changes in intracellular Na+ induced by veratridine and a brevotoxin analogue, pumiliotoxin. When calibrated to the maximum signal after addition of gramicidin, the maximal percent increases in fluorescence (ΔF) were 35 and 31% in cells expressing μHis and μPore, respectively. Moreover, in the presence of 1 μm tetrodotoxin, ΔF decreased significantly to 10% in μHis- but not in μPore-expressing cells (43%).

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Their essential functional features include highly selective permeation of Na+ and voltage-dependent gating (2Marbán E. Yamagishi T. Tomaselli G.F. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Armstrong C.M. Hille B.

The principal functional unit of the Na+ channel is the α subunit, which consists of four internally homologous domains (labeled DI–DIV),1each containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and resembling a single α subunit of a voltage-dependent K+channel (6Noda M. Shimizu S. Tanabe T. Takai T. Kayano T. Ikeda T. Takahashi H. Nakayama H. Kanaoka Y. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Raftery M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 312: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). These four homologous domains are pseudosymmetrically arranged around a central pore whose structural constituents determine the selectivity and conductance properties of the channel. While the fourth transmembrane segment S4, studded with positively charged residues, confers voltage-sensitive gating (7Stühmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), the S5 and S6 segments and the S5-S6 linker or the pore-lining (“P”) segment line the permeation pathway. Such a structure, while complex and asymmetrical, hints that essential features of the pore may be separable from those that confer gating. MacKinnon and coworkers (8Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar) have solved the crystal structure of an inwardly rectifying bacterial K+ channel (KcsA) channel. This important advance provides a framework for testing hypotheses concerning the pore structure of related channels. With only two transmembrane segments and a P segment in each subunit, KcsA channels function perfectly well as K+-selective ionophores. Compared with KcsA and other Kir-like channels, voltage-dependent channels, sharing the same transmembrane topology of the core segments, have evolved four additional transmembrane segments (S1–S4) in each domain with S4 responsible for voltage gating and S1–S3 presumably insulating hydrophilic S4 from the lipid bilayer. In this view, the functional pore might be fully encoded by the S5-P-S6 fragments, while the rest of the protein is required only for effecting voltage-dependent conformational changes (Fig.1 B). Therefore, it is logical to ask whether a Na+ channel comprised only of S5-P-S6 from each domain will contain the minimal determinants of a functional pore. In this study, we stably expressed poly(His)-tagged wild-type and pore-only μ1 channel constructs in mammalian cell lines and characterized them biophysically, biochemically, and functionally. The main goal was to test whether the pore-only μ1 channel is functional as an ionophore and as a high affinity toxin-binding scaffold. Such a reduced construct, if functional, would simplify structural determination of the pore region. Materials were from the following sources. Saxitoxin (STX) dihydrochloride was kindly provided by Dr. Sherwood Hall (Federal Drug Administration); [3H]STX was from Amersham Biosciences;N-methyl-d-glucamine, veratridine, and tetrodotoxin (TTX) were obtained from Sigma; PbTx-3 (pumiliotoxin) was from Calbiochem; HEK293 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); CoroNa Red sodium indicator and gramicidin A were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); anti-Na+ channel antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and Geneticin (G418 Sulfate) was from Invitrogen. A DNA fragment containing a c-Myc epitope and a polyhistidine tag from pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was inserted into the XbaI site at the 3′-end of the skeletal muscle Na+ channel (μ1) to generate μ1 His-tagged DNA (μHis). μHis DNA, coupled with a green fluorescent protein reporter gene, was then cloned in a polycistronic IRES vector, allowing independent translation of two separate proteins from a single mRNA. The pore-only μ1 DNA (μPore) was generated by deleting S1–S4 of each domain (Fig. 1, A and C). Specifically, Leu128–Lys228 in domainI, Leu567–Leu680 in domainII, Ile1020–Glu1137 in domainIII, and Phe1342–Leu1465 in domainIV were deleted by PCR using primers with bases covering regions adjacent to the sections of the channel that were deleted (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing. For mRNA generation, these constructs were cloned into pSP64T vector, and mRNA was transcribed from the SP6 promoter (Ambion, Inc.) All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Linearized DNA of μHis and μPore were transfected into HEK293 cells, respectively, using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were serially diluted with the addition of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin to select for transfected cells. Colonies were screened initially by epifluorescence and further characterized by whole-cell current measurements and Western blot analysis. Positive clones were again sorted by green fluorescent protein signals using a FACStar Plus cell sorter. For functional assays, 0.5 million cells were seeded and grown overnight in a 35-mm dish. Veratridine was first dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 150 mm and then in culture medium. For blocking experiments, cells were incubated with TTX for 1 h before adding veratridine. Cell death was determined by counting the percentage of floating cells and trypsinized attached cells that failed to exclude trypan blue. Patch clamp and two electrode voltage-clamp were performed as described previously (9Chen Z. Ong B.H. Kambouris N.G. Marbán E. Tomaselli G.F. Balser J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All recordings were carried out at room temperature (∼21 °C). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, resuspended in 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH = 8.0) with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and homogenized. The homogenate was brought up in a final concentration of 300 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmHepes-Tris (pH = 7.5) and homogenized again before centrifuging at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and homogenization and centrifugation were repeated on the pellet. The supernatants were then mixed to a final concentration of 0.6 m KCl. The mixture was stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C before centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-Tris (pH = 7.0) and homogenized using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Protein concentration was determined by a Lowry assay (10Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For rat brain membrane vesicle preparation, rat brains were immersed in cold 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH = 7.4), homogenized using a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and then subjected to the previously described cell membrane vesicle isolation protocol. Normally one rat brain yields about 80 mg of total membrane protein. The [3H]STX binding assay was performed as described previously by Vélez et al.(11Velez P. Sierralta J. Alcayaga C. Fonseca M. Loyola H. Johns D.C. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. Suárez-Isla B.A. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 250 μg of membrane vesicles were incubated on ice for 1 h with buffer containing 2.5 nm [3H]STX, 30 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, and a range of cold STX from a concentration of 0 to a maximum of 4 μm in a 250-μl reaction volume. Free [3H]STX was removed by passing each reaction mixture through a glass filter. The filter was washed twice and counted using a scintillation counter. For optimal dye loading, cells were incubated with 1 μm CoroNa Red Na+ indicator (from a freshly dissolved 1 mm stock Me2SO solution, Molecular Probes) in 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were plated on 15-mm glass coverslips and mounted on a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, PH4) that was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted fluorescence microscope. A 20× Nikon oil immersion lens was used, and all experiments were done at room temperature. The fluorescence cube in the microscope consisted of a 540 ± 15 nm excitation filter, a 565LP dichroic mirror, and a 620 ± 30 nm emission filter. A 12-bit monochrome cooled CCD camera (5 MHz readout rate, MicroMax, Princeton Instruments) was used to collect 650 × 514 pixel 16-bit grayscale images once every minute with either a 100- or 200-ms exposure time. Experiments were performed during continuous perfusion of buffers and drugs at 0.6–1.0 ml/min. A run was initiated after a stable fluorescence signal was obtained during perfusion of control solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. At least 10 images were obtained in each condition. Addition of PbTx-3, an analogue of brevotoxin, and veratridine elicited a slow increase of fluorescence that usually reached steady state within 10–15 min. Normally only one addition of toxin could be done per run. The chamber was then perfused with control solution to dilute the added toxin, and the calibration sequence was initiated. In this case, perfusion was interrupted, and 1 ml of 2 μm gramicidin dissolved in control solution was directly added to the chamber. After development of maximal fluorescence, typically 6–10 min, perfusion was restarted, and the calibration sequence was completed by the consecutive addition of buffers containing different sodium concentrations. At least five regions of interest covering all the cells were measured in each experiment. Average fluorescence intensity of each region of interest was analyzed by ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The percent changes for fluorescence signal, corresponding to the intracellular Na+ changes, were calibrated with gramicidin and calculated using the following formula: (F −F min)/(F max −F min) × 100%, where F is the fluorescence signal, F min is the control signal in normal 140 mm Na+ buffer, andF max is the maximum signal in the presence of gramicidin. At least five points in the plateau were averaged for each treatment. Data were further analyzed and plotted using Origin (Microcal Software, Inc.) We created two HEK293 stable cell lines expressing either wild-type μ1 channels with a c-Myc epitope and a polyhistidine (μHis) tag fused to the C terminus or pore-only μ1 (μPore) channels with S1–S4 in all domains removed (Fig.1 C). The stably transfected cells all had a normal morphology under basal conditions. Membrane vesicles prepared from both cell lines were recognized by a Na+ channel-specific antibody directed to the retainedIII-IV interdomain linker (SP19). μHis channels, with a calculated molecular mass of 212 kDa, ran at 240 kDa, while μPore, with a calculated molecular weight of 159 kDa, ran at 210 kDa on a Western blot (Fig. 2). Antibodies raised to the c-Myc and poly(His) tags both recognized μPore and μHis channels (data not shown), indicating that the entire constructs were faithfully expressed. Using a polycistronic IRES vector, we found that the reporter green fluorescent protein and the channel construct were independently expressed and co-localized. In cells expressing either μHis or μPore channels, confocal microscopy indicated that the green fluorescent protein signals were detected at the cell surface membrane (data not shown). These results indicated that μPore channels were expressed at the surface membrane. Channel activity of the μHis and μPore channels was functionally characterized using the patch clamp technique. Whole-cell currents from cells stably expressing μHis channels exhibit the same electrophysiological properties as wild-type μ1 channels (Fig. 3 A), indicating they are fully functional. In contrast, μPore failed to conduct measurable time-dependent, Na+-selective currents despite expression of the protein (Fig. 3 B). In addition, no currents were observed in either mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes or transiently transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). One explanation is that μPore channels may not be able to fold properly to form an ionophore; alternatively, μPore channels may generate a pore that favors a closed conformation. Since the voltage-sensing S4 segments are not present in μPore channels, voltage changes may not be able to generate conformational changes necessary to open μPore channels. Nevertheless, we explored the possibility that such channels might retain toxin sensitivity. TTX and STX block the Na+channels at neurotoxin receptor site 1, which is localized near the extracellular opening of the pore. High affinity STX binding requires a highly stereotypical three-dimensional structure with crucial contributions from numerous pore residues present in the extracellular linkers, including those from the P segments (12Satin J.

We performed STX binding assays on membrane vesicles of rat brain, stable cell lines expressing μ1 and μPore channels, and non-transfected HEK293 cells. Control HEK293 cells did not bind STX. In contrast, rat brain membrane vesicles exhibited strong [3H]STX binding with a total concentration of the binding sites (B max) of 0.86 pmol of [3H]STX binding/mg of total membrane protein in agreement with previous reports (17Yotsu-Yamashita M.

Rogart R.B. Fozzard H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 153-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles containing μ1 channels exhibited specific [3H]STX binding with a B max of 0.46 pmol/mg of protein (Fig. 4 A). However, the [3H]STX binding signal of membrane vesicles containing μPore channels was indistinguishable from background. In addition, in [3H]STX displacement assays using non-radioactive STX, rat brain membrane vesicles and membrane vesicles containing μ1 channels exhibited specific [3H]STX binding (Fig.4 B), but again μPore channels did not exhibit any [3H]STX displacement. These data suggest that μPore channels did not preserve a Na+ channel structure that specifically binds to STX. Nevertheless, we tested whether μPore channels remained sensitive to other Na+ channel toxins that bound to sites distinct from the STX binding site. Veratridine causes persistent opening of Na+ channels and elevates intracellular Na+ concentration, which perturbs ion homeostasis sufficiently in neurons and astroglia to trigger cell death (19Takahashi S. Shibata M. Fukuuchi Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 372: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi S. Shibata M. Gotoh J. Fukuuchi Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 408: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If our cells contained any toxin-activable Na+ channels, they may likewise die during exposure to veratridine. Thus, we determined whether veratridine affected cell viability in our stable cell lines. Control (non-transfected) HEK293 cells and cells expressing μPore and μHis channels were incubated with various concentrations of veratridine for 20 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell death was assayed by the inability to exclude trypan blue (Fig.5 A). In the absence of veratridine, none of the three cell lines exhibited measurable cell death. However, at veratridine concentrations of 200 μmor higher, cells expressing μHis and μPore channels showed significantly more cell death than did control HEK293 cells. At 225 μm veratridine, in control HEK293 cells, only 16% of cells were killed, but 40 and 54% of cells expressing μHis and μPore channels died, respectively (Fig. 5 B). This effect was specific as the proapoptotic agents staurosporine and etoposide did not cause more cell death in μPore cells than in μHis cells (data not shown). When STX/TTX binding is intact, TTX potently blocks the action of site 2 toxins. Therefore, TTX should block the veratridine-induced cell death in μHis cells (19Takahashi S. Shibata M. Fukuuchi Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 372: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but not in μPore cells if μPore channels do not bind TTX. Under the same conditions, veratridine-induced cell death was significantly decreased in cells expressing μHis in 50 and 200 μm TTX (Fig. 5 B), confirming that TTX indeed blocked Na+ influx through μHis channels induced by veratridine. In addition, no significant changes were observed in control HEK293 cells (15 and 12% of cell death in 50 and 200 μm TTX, respectively). However, TTX did not reduce veratridine-induced cell death in cells expressing μPore channels, with cell death rates of 50 and 49% in 50 and 200 μmTTX, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, while blocking Na+ channels and antagonizing veratridine-induced cell death in μHis cells, TTX failed to block veratridine-induced cell death in μPore cells. Taken together, the findings were consistent with the idea that μPore channels retain veratridine sensitivity but lose the ability to bind TTX and STX. To obtain additional independent evidence for a toxin-recruitable ionophore, we measured intracellular Na+ in cells expressing μHis and μPore channels. If a μPore channel forms a veratridine-recruitable ionophore, one would expect an acute increase of Na+ influx when μPore is activated by veratridine. When veratridine alone was applied to cells expressing μPore channels, there was no consistent activation of Na+-selective currents in patch clamp recordings (data not shown), perhaps due to the small density and time-independent nature of the currents. The lack of TTX sensitivity also made it impossible to use toxin sensitivity as a tool to specifically isolate the current. Therefore, we developed an alternative strategy to assay intracellular Na+ changes in response to the opening of channels induced by toxin treatment. CoroNa Red, a Na+-specific fluorescent dye, exhibits sensitive responses to Na+ concentration in the thin layer of fluid at the surface of large airways (21Jayaraman S. Song Y. Vetrivel L. Shankar L. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we used CoroNa Red Na+indicator to measure intracellular Na+ changes generated by Na+ influx through Na+ channels elicited by activating toxins. The intracellular Na+ concentration changes were detected by changes in the CoroNa Red fluorescence using a CCD camera. These signals were normalized to the percent increase in fluorescence (ΔF) relative to the maximum signal after the addition of gramicidin when intracellular and extracellular Na+ had presumably reached equilibrium. In all experiments, gramicidin elicited an average 2.6-fold increase over the background signal. Veratridine alone did not induce a significant increase in ΔF in either μHis or μPore cells at least in the short term (over ∼30 min, data not shown). Therefore, we used a combination of PbTx-3 and veratridine to activate these channels, exploiting the fact that PbTx-3 may allosterically stimulate veratridine-induced Na+ flux. Fig. 6 A shows representative data for μPore and μHis channels with summary plots shown in Fig.6 B. In control HEK293 cells, PbTx-3 and veratridine only generate an average of a 2.5% increase in ΔF (Fig.6 B). In cells expressing either μHis or μPore channels, addition of the mixture of PbTx-3 and veratridine elicited a ΔF increase of 35 and 31%, respectively, suggesting that there was a significant increase of intracellular Na+ due to Na+ influx through toxin-activated μHis or μPore channels. Furthermore, preincubation of 1 μm TTX significantly decreased ΔF in μHis cells but not in μPore cells. Thus, PbTx-3 and veratridine activated both μPore and μHis channels and resulted in Na+ influx through the activated channel pore. The Na+ influx in activated μPore channels is resistant to block by TTX, further confirming the insensitivity of μPore channels to TTX. In a quest for a “minimal” Na+ channel structure, we trimmed the channels of all but those core segments that would be absolutely required for permeation. Based on the structure of KcsA and other Kir family K+ channels, we reasoned that the S5-P-S6 segments of a voltage-dependent Na+ channel might retain some aspects of a functional pore. Through biochemical and physiological characterizations, we found that S5-P-S6 segments of μ1 channels do form functional ionophores, albeit ones that lack full fidelity when compared with the parent channels. Key structural motifs of Na+ channels are missing in μPore channels in that they fail to bind TTX or STX functionally and biochemically. Nevertheless, μPore ionophores can be activated by the Na+ channel toxins veratridine and PbTx-3 as gauged by Na+ fluorescence measurements and cell viability assays. The following considerations support the notion that the fluorescence increases induced by PbTx-3 reflect the stimulation of Na+influx through Na+ channels. First, in situcalibration curves (not shown) indicated that CoroNa Red can track sodium very specifically regardless of whether the remaining salt in the solution is N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride or KCl. Second, we also have excluded potassium as a measurable interfering cation from examination of the in situcalibration curves that show that CoroNa Red fluorescencedecreases in the presence of high K+concentrations (NaCl/KCl buffers) as compared with the values obtained in the absence of K+ at the same Na+concentration (i.e. in NaCl/N-methyl-d-glucamine buffers). Due to the dye structure, the coordination of negative ions should be excluded from the crown moiety that coordinates sodium. The same would be the case for divalent cations, although there could be some competition as CoroNa Red is derived from EDTA-like moieties. Third, the fluxes were only seen when PbTx-3 was added to cells expressing Na+ channels. The signals were not observed after high K+ depolarization of HEK293 cells expressing Na+ channels or in control HEK cells with any of the treatments. The fluxes were also detected when cells expressing Na+ channels were exposed simultaneously to PbTx-3 and veratridine dissolved in a 45 mm K+buffer, but they were similar to those in PbTx-3 and veratridine in a normal low K+ buffer for both μpore and μHis cells. This treatment did not induce a fluorescence increase in control HEK293 cells, indicating that, during toxin activation, the fluxes are not affected in a measurable way by changes in the electrochemical gradient for potassium. If K+ efflux were to co-exist in μPore but not in μHis cells, a measurable difference would have been expected in the fluorescence changes. Finally, during toxin activation in normal 140 mm Na+ buffer, potassium would be leaking out, and therefore the proportion of K+-dye complexes should, if anything, decrease, producing a decrease in F if K+ were indeed a serious contaminant. For these reasons, we believe that the toxin-activated fluorescence signals reflect Na+ flux through Na+ channels. The pore of Na+channels exhibits a high degree of conformational flexibility and is involved in channel gating. The domain III-IV linker of Na+ channels is a prime determinant of rapid inactivation (7Stühmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inactivation mechanisms should be preserved in μPore channels as these structural elements are still intact. Indeed, like wild-type Na+ channels, μPore channels predominately are in closed or inactivated conformations at rest; otherwise, persistent Na+ influx at rest might be expected to kill cells expressing μPore. Since the voltage sensor is not present, μPore channels cannot be activated by depolarization. However, non-voltage-dependent activation appears to exist in μPore channels. Our results indicate that μPore channels can be activated by Na+ channel-opening toxins. Veratridine and PbTx-3 are Na+ channel openers that bind to site 2 and site 5, respectively, on the α subunit of the Na+ channel (27Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 15-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Site 2 neurotoxins, including the alkaloids batrachotoxin, veratridine, aconitine, and grayanotoxin, cause persistent activation of Na+ channels (28Khodorov B.I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1985; 45: 57-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Sutro J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that veratridine and batrachotoxin share a common binding site in DI-S6 and DIV-S6 (30Linford N.J. Cantrell A.R., Qu, Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In wild-type channels, veratridine binds to open Na+ channels (32Barnes S. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 421-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), blocking inactivation, shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more negative membrane potentials, and reducing selectivity. TTX and STX potently counteract the action of veratridine. Site 5 toxins brevotoxin and PbTx-3, lipid-soluble polyethers, bind to a receptor site located near the transmembrane interface between DI and DIV near the extracellular side of the DIV-S5 segment and the extracellular end of the DI-S6 segment of the α subunit (33Trainer V.L. Thomsen W.J. Catterall W.A. Baden D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar, 34Trainer V.L. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19904-19909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction causes a shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation to more negative potentials and inhibits channel inactivation. In addition, the oxygen-rich nature of the brevotoxin backbone interacts with the channel in a manner that stabilizes the open configuration (35Jeglitsch G. Rein K. Baden D.G. Adams D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 516-525PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, site 2 and site 5 lipid-soluble toxins are allosteric modulators of channel function. PbTx-3 allosterically stimulates Na+ influx generated by site 2 toxins including veratridine and batrachotoxin (36Sharkey R.G. Jover E. Couraud F. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wada A. Uezono Y. Arita M. Yuhi T. Kobayashi H. Yanagihara N. Izumi F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1347-1351PubMed Google Scholar). As segments S5 and S6 are preserved in the μPore construct, the binding sites of veratridine and PbTx-3 might still be intact on μPore channels. Our functional data showed that the interactions of veratridine and PbTx-3 on μPore channel resulted in activation of the ionophore in a non-voltage-dependent fashion. In an effort to define the minimal structure required to create a functional Na+ channel pore, we have found that the S5-P-S6 segments of the μ1 Na+ channel suffice to form a toxin-activable ionophore. Unfortunately, the reduced construct does not provide a compelling platform for further protein purification and structure prediction as it does not retain key biochemical markers (viz. STX binding) that would enable tracking of the protein during enrichment and purification. Nevertheless, our observations are conceptually valuable as they identify the minimal determinants for two key features of pore function (Na+ flux and toxin activation)."
https://openalex.org/W2315145305,"We have previously shown that expression of active Rac1 and Cdc4Hs inhibits skeletal muscle cell differentiation. We show here, by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cyclin D1 expression, that the expression of active Rac1 and Cdc42Hs but not RhoA impairs cell cycle exit of L6 myoblasts cultured in differentiation medium. Furthermore, expression of activated forms of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs elicits the loss of cell contact inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth as measured by focus forming activity and growth in soft agar. RhoA was once again not found to have this effect. We found a constitutive Rac1 and Cdc42Hs activation in three human rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cell lines, one of the most common causes of solid tumours arising from muscle precursors during childhood. Finally, dominant negative forms of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs inhibit cell proliferation of the RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. These data suggest an important role for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42Hs in the generation of skeletal muscle tumours."

To study the role of Pms2 in the maintenance of in vivo genomic integrity in somatic cells, we characterized Aprt mutations in T cells and fibroblasts of 129 x C3H Pms2-/-Aprt+/- mice. The spontaneous frequency of DAP-resistant T lymphocytes, as a consequence of APRT-deficiency, was increased threefold. Point mutation, which accounted for less than 20% of the DAP(r) mutant clones in Pms2+/+ mice, was predominant in the mutant T cell clones from Pms2-/- mice. These point mutations were predominantly TA to CG transitions. Fibroblasts of Pms2-/- mice exhibited only a modest increase in the frequency of clones with point mutations, such that mitotic recombination was still the primary cause of APRT deficiency. Thus, the mutator phenotype as a consequence of PMS2 deficiency is tissue-dependent, which may be related to the tissue-specific tumor proneness of Pms2-/- mice."

Lieb W. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Anesthetics interact with many transmembrane ion channels and soluble proteins, often causing unwanted side effects. Gaining a detailed understanding of the motifs governing anesthetic-protein interactions is a critical step both in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying general anesthesia and in developing more selective anesthetic agents. However, little progress can be made until such sites have been unequivocally identified. Unfortunately, this has proved to be a difficult task. Most structural information has been obtained in soluble proteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, adenylate kinase, luciferase, human serum albumin, and insulin (2Schoenborn B.P. Watson H.C.

These surrogate targets are being used because the structures of membrane proteins, the likely physiological targets of general anesthetics, are difficult to determine. Photoaffinity labeling is an alternative method for locating sites that can be applied to any protein (8Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Typical general anesthetics are relatively small drugs that include hydrocarbons, ethers, and alcohols making aliphatic diazirines an attractive choice for developing general anesthetic photolabels. Despite the early fears about the photochemistry of aliphatic as opposed to aromatic diazirines (9Brunner B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Bayley H. Work T.S. Burdon R.H. Photogenerated Reagents in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

We, therefore, recently developed a novel photoreactive aliphatic diazirine-containing general anesthetic, 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-n-pentyldiazirine (3-azioctanol) (13Husain S.S. Forman S.A.

In this work, we introduce two new strategies to increase the information yielded by photolabeling. First, to explore the orientation and conformation of the bound ligand and the extent of its binding pocket, we used a pair of geometric isomers (3- and 7-azioctanol, Fig.1). This appears to be the first application of this strategy (15Addona G.H. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (Abstr. 1311): 314Google Scholar). Second, to investigate the role of ligand size, we halved the length of the aliphatic chain while keeping the relationship between the hydroxyl and diazirine groups constant (3-azioctanol versus 3-azibutanol). We chose first to explore an unknown anesthetic site in a protein whose structure is well established to provide a stringent test of the strategies before applying them to excitable membrane proteins, which are the likely targets of general anesthetic action. Adenylate kinases catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group by the reaction ATP·Mg2+ + AMP ⇔ Mg2+ + 2ADP (16Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their structures have been intensively studied, and the conformational changes that accompany catalysis are well characterized (17Schulz G.E.

They have a central domain (CORE) consisting of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, an α-helical nucleotide monophosphate binding domain, and a region that covers the active site during catalysis (LID) (17Schulz G.E.

At ∼22 kDa, the small variant adenylate kinases are considerably smaller than the much studied surrogate anesthetic target, luciferase (molecular mass ∼ 72 kDa), allowing us to apply the full power of mass spectrometry. This technique can directly yield the mole fraction of even the smallest covalently incorporated ligands, such as nitric oxide (19Ferranti P. Malorni A. Mamone G. Sannolo N. Marino G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and it allows the identification of sites of photoincorporation without the necessity for synthesizing radiolabeled ligands.

The 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran2 was prepared as described in Schniepp and Geller (21Schniepp L.E. Geller H.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946; 68: 1646-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hydroxy-3-octen-7-one 4 was synthesized from 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran by the Wittig reaction with phosphoniumtriphenyl-2-oxopropylide. A suspension of 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran (3.2 g, 31.4 mmol) and phosphoniumtriphenyl-2-oxopropylide (10 g, 31.4 mmol) in anhydrous benzene (100 ml) was refluxed for 5 h and then stirred overnight at room temperature. After removing the solvent by rotary evaporation, the residue was extracted with hexane (3 × 100 ml). The combined extract was applied to a column of silica gel (70 g), equilibrated with hexane/ethyl acetate (9.5:0.5, v/v), and eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1, v/v) to give hydroxy-3-octen-7-one (2.2 g, 48% yield). TLC silica gel R f 0.49 (hexane/ethyl acetate, 7:3). Analysis of C8H14O2 showed 67.57% (calculated) and 67.25% (experimental) carbon and 9.92% (calculated) and 10.24% (experimental) hydrogen. Hydroxyoctan-7-one 5was prepared by reduction of hydroxy-3-octen-7-one (1 g, 7 mmol) with hydrogen in the presence of 5% Pd-carbon (1 g) in dry ethyl acetate (30 ml) for 24 h. The 7-azioctanol 6 was synthesized in 39% yield from hydroxyoctan-7-one essentially by the procedure described for the synthesis of 3-azioctanol (13Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The UV spectrum in dichloromethane had a λmax of 348 nm, characteristic of the diazirine group (20Church R.F.R. Weiss M.J. J. Org. Chem. 1970; 35: 2465-2471Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A mixture of adenylate kinase (100 μm; 50 μl) and 3-[3H]azioctanol (100 μm) was preincubated for 10 min and then exposed for 15 min to UV irradiation at 365 nm at a distance of 2 cm with a model UVL-56 20 W Blak-Ray handheld lamp (Upland, CA). A control sample was also prepared without UV irradiation. After precipitation with 200 μl of ethanol, samples were centrifuged for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were suspended in ethanol and centrifuged again. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant counts dropped to a constant background. The pellets were then dissolved in 50 μl of 10% SDS and tritium-assayed by scintillation counting. A control lacking protein was also used to determine the background associated with the 10% SDS treatment. Samples containing the two-substrate mimicking inhibitor Ap5A were preincubated with 10 mminhibitor for 5 min before the addition of photoreactive general anesthetic and subsequent irradiation. Adenylate kinase (12 nmol/sample) was mixed with either 3-azioctanol, 7-azioctanol, or 3-azibutanol (100 μm), incubated for 10 min in the dark, and then irradiated for 15 min at 365 nm. An aliquot (1 μl) of each mixture was diluted 1:200 with 0.1% acetic acid to yield a 1 pmol/μl solution. Aliquots (1 μl) of these diluted samples were applied to a microcapillary POROS 10R2 chromatography column (75 × 360 μm; Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) packed to 15 cm, butt-connected to a fused silica nanospray tip (5 μm), and eluted with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 15 min at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min into an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (LCQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 300 to 2000 with a maximum ejection time of 400 ms. Molecular masses of modified and unmodified adenylate kinase were calculated from the resulting charge envelopes with an error of not more than 1 Da. Briefly, the charge state of an ion was determined by subtracting two adjacent ions from each other, with the reciprocal of this difference multiplied by the ion of lower mass/charge minus one. This result is the charge state of the ion with the higher m/z values of the two adjacent peaks. To calculate the unprotonated molecular mass, the determined charge state was multiplied by the ion mass/charge, then the charge state was subtracted from the product. Samples similar to those above were prepared containing a 3-[3H]azioctanol tracer, added to solutions containing 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate to a final volume of 300 μl, and digested overnight at room temperature with trypsin at a ratio of 1:35 protease/protein. The digested samples were stored at −20 °C. Peptides generated by the trypsin digest of either tritiated or nontritiated 3-azioctanol-labeled adenylate kinase were separated in identical fashion on a Beckman reverse-phase HPLC. Fifty-microliter samples were injected onto a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted with a 40-min gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluent was monitored at 214 nm, and 1-ml fractions were continuously collected. Tritium-containing samples were assayed by scintillation counting; all others were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described below. The non-tritiated HPLC fractions corresponding to the radioactive fractions from the digests above were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and peptide molecular masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Perceptive Biosystems, DE-STR). In the case of 3-azioctanol, HPLC fractions generated offline were analyzed by automated LC/MS/MS on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. For 7-azioctanol- and 3-azibutanol-photolabeled samples, 0.5 μl of the 30 μl of concentrated digest was loaded on the same POROS column described above and analyzed using online LC/MS/MS. Peptides were eluted directly into the mass spectrometer with a two-step gradient of 5–65% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid for 25 min followed by 65–90% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid for 5 min at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. Collision-activated MS/MS spectra were obtained under automatic acquisition of the most intense ion from each MS scan. Data were deconvoluted using Finnigan's Bioworks module of the Xcalibur software. Residues are numbered according to the alignment of Yan and Tsai (16Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photoincorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol was complete within 1 min of light exposure under our standard conditions. Analysis of the [3H]azioctanol titration curve from 0 to 3 mm3-[3H]azioctanol yielded a half-maximal binding concentration of 180 ± 17 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.8 ± 0.32 using a non-linear least-square fit to the logistic function (13Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Maximum fractional photoincorporation of tritium into adenylate kinase was 0.18 (see Fig. 4). UV-independent incorporation was less than 10% of the total even at 1 mm anesthetic. Inclusion of a nucleophilic scavenger, 10 mm glutathione, in the reaction mixture did not interfere with either UV-induced photoincorporation or UV-independent adenylate kinase labeling by 3-azioctanol. Stoichiometry of photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into adenylate kinase was determined using online microcapillary liquid chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Although complete separation of unlabeled and labeled adenylate kinase was not achieved on the HPLC column, peak heterogeneity does not prevent molecular mass determination of the co-eluted proteins because of their unique charge envelopes. The ion chromatogram for this reaction mixture can be seen in Fig. 5 A. Fig. 5 Bshows the charge envelope eluting between 8.8 and 12.0 min. This is obtained by summing the spectra acquired approximately every second during this time period. Deconvolution of the mass/charge ratios yields a main peak with maximum molecular mass of 21,595, corresponding to unmodified adenylate kinase, and a secondary peak of molecular mass 21,723 Da (Fig. 5 C). The difference of 128 Da is the mass shift consistent with photoincorporation of a single molecule of 3-azioctanol carbene into each photolabeled adenylate kinase. There is also a rather broad signal of low intensity that includes the molecular mass corresponding to a stoichiometry of 2:1. This peak probably does not represent photoincorporation of a second azioctanol because it was not observed consistently, sometimes being absent even at 1 mm azioctanol, and because only a single tryptic peptide bearing 3-[3H]azioctanol was detected by HPLC. Photoincorporation of 7-azioctanol into adenylate kinase was determined similarly (Fig. 6). Deconvolution of the charge envelope eluting between 8.3 and 11.0 min clearly showed that 7-azioctanol is also photoincorporated into adenylate kinase at a mole ratio of 1:1. Once again there is a broad peak of weak intensity including the molecular mass equivalent to a stoichiometry of 2:1. Photoincorporation of 3-azibutanol into adenylate kinase was also determined by microcapillary LC/MS with electrospray ionization as described above. The charge envelope was deconvoluted to yield a series of peaks. The first corresponded to unlabeled adenylate kinase, and the succeeding peaks were shifted successively by 72 Da from 21,667 to 21,954 Da, revealing photoincorporation at mole ratios up to 5:1 (Fig.7). When the 3-azibutanol concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mm, deconvolution yielded five peaks all with ion currents higher than the unlabeled peak, suggesting very efficient photolabeling. Under these conditions a peak corresponding to a mole ratio of 6:1 was just detectable (Fig. 7). Preincubation of adenylate kinase with 10 mm Ap5A before UV irradiation in the presence of 1 mm 3-[3H]azioctanol resulted in a reduction of photoincorporation to 0.34 ± 0.10 (S.D.) of the control value (n = 12). The absorption spectra of Ap5A alone showed no intensity at 365 nm. Thus, the reduction in photoincorporation most likely originates in changes in the binding pocket. To identify the sites of photoincorporation, parallel samples of adenylate kinase were photolabeled with either 3-azioctanol or 3-[3H]azioctanol, digested with trypsin, and fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. The digest yielded three major peaks of radioactivity: peak A, fraction 15, 2150 cpm; peak B, fraction 19, 3000 cpm; and peak C, fraction 29, 8100 cpm. In the absence of protein, unmodified 3-[3H]azioctanol in buffer ran with peak B, whereas peaks A and C were observed when 3-[3H]azioctanol in buffer was irradiated. All HPLC fractions coincident with tritium peaks but from the parallel non-tritiated sample above were screened by MALDI-TOF to obtain the molecular masses of any peptides present. The fraction corresponding to peak B contained a dominant peptide with a molecular mass of 1623 Da, consistent with a peptide generated by tryptic cleavage following Lys-31 and Arg-44 (YGYTHLSTGDLLR; 1495 Da) and incorporating a single azioctanol. Although other fractions contained peptides, none were consistent with the mass shift expected if 3-azioctanol had been photoincorporated. This conclusion was confirmed by online LC/MS with electrospray detection (see below). Fig. 8 shows the collision-activated dissociation mass spectrum of the 1623-Da peptide with azioctanol photoincorporated (m/z 811.5) that was identified above. In this type of experiment, peptides eluted online are ionized, selected by mass/charge ratio, and randomly fragmented along the peptide bond ions of fragments containing the intact N terminus (N-terminal fragments) are called “b” ions, and those containing the intact C terminus of the peptide (C-terminal fragments) are called “y” ions. The numbers after these letters denote the number of residues remaining in each fragment. The fragmentation pattern with major peaks assigned is shown in the lowerthree panels of Fig. 8. All ion fragments containing the unknown azioctanol-modified amino acid will have a mass shift of 128 Da. In the b series, all fragments from b5 (m/z750) through b13 were identified and found to incorporate azioctanol. Thus, the site of incorporation must be within b1–5. The unmodified b3 ion is observed at a m/z of 384, suggesting that either His-36 or Thr-35 is the site of incorporation. In the y series, modified singly and doubly charged C-terminal fragments containing His-36 as their N terminus (y9) are observed atm/z of 1139 and 570. His-36 is flanked by two ions that gave robust signals. The doubly charged y8 fragment, with Leu-37 at its N terminus, was unmodified, whereas the singly charged y10 fragment containing Thr-35 at its N terminus was modified. Thus, the only residue that is modified in both the b and y series is His-36. No other fractions from online chromatography showed mass shifts, consistent with azioctanol incorporation. Mass spectral sequence analysis of all other offline HPLC fractions coinciding with the presence of tritium also failed to reveal any other modified peptides. Taken together, these observations confirm that His-36 is the only residue in adenylate kinase that photoincorporates 3-azioctanol. Adenylate kinase photolabeled with 7-azioctanol was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide mixture was analyzed directly by LC/MS/MS. Two LC fractions were found to contain modified peptides, each with a m/z of 811.5, again assignable to the sequence YGYTHLSTGDLLR. In the major fraction the collision-activated dissociation mass spectrum (MS/MS) showed that b ions up to Ser-38 (b7) are clearly unmodified, indicating that His-36 is not the site of photoincorporation (Fig. 9). Thr-39 (b8) and Gly-40 (b9) are not observed. The series b10 to b12 is observed to be modified, having the spacing and absolute position observed previously (Fig. 8). The y3 ion with Leu-42 at its N terminus is observed to be unmodified, whereas y4 (m/z 642.6) and all observed higher ions are modified. Thus, this site of photoincorporation is at Asp-41. In the minor fraction, His-36 was identified as the site of attachment (data not shown). For example, the doubly charged y9 ion (m/z 569) and the singly charged b5 ion (m/z 749.5) were both modified by 128 Da. The tryptic digest of adenylate kinase photolabeled with 3-azibutanol was also analyzed by online LC/MS/MS monitoring for ions withm/z of 784. Three fractions with modified peptides were resolved. The MS/MS spectrum in each case revealed a doubly charged ion (m/z 784) that was identified as the familiar amino acid sequence YGYTHLSTGDLLR with a mass shift of 72 Da resulting from 3-azibutanol photoincorporation. The fragmentation pattern for one fraction (Fig. 10) identifies Tyr-32 as the site of 3-azibutanol labeling. The b2 (m/z 293) and all of the subsequently observed b ions contain a mass shift of 72 Da, indicating that either Tyr-32 or Gly-33 is modified. The absence of an observed mass shift for all y ions from 5 to 12 excludes Gly-33. Thus, only the N-terminal residue (Tyr-32 for this peptide) is labeled by azibutanol. In the other fractions Tyr-34 and His-36 were identified as sites of 3-azibutanol photoincorporation (data not shown). The 3-azioctanol photoincorporated into His-36 selectively with an apparent dissociation constant of 180 μm (Fig. 4), which is remarkably close to the concentration causing general anesthesiain vivo (160 μm (13Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). This was unexpected because in earlier studies on adenylate kinase activity, volatile anesthetics acted only at supraclinical concentrations (22Marjanen L.A. Denborough M.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 122: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). One mole of 3-azioctanol was photoincorporated per mole of adenylate kinase with a yield of 18%. The facility with which mass spectrometry provided the mole ratio of photoincorporation is encouraging because the low affinity of general anesthetics makes such estimates difficult. In serum albumin, for example, binding studies estimated the general anesthetic propofol to have many saturable sites (23Mazoit J.X. Asamii K. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 35-42Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas subsequent structural determination found only two (6Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, there are some limitations to the mass spectrometric method. In particular, as the efficiency of photoincorporation decreases it becomes increasingly difficult to rule out the occurrence of mole ratios higher than 1 because the probability of observing them would be the product of the probabilities of observing the singly labeled species. Even at 1 mm, only 18% of the kinases photoincorporated 1 mol of [3H]azioctanol, and it was difficult to entirely rule out photoincorporation of a second azioctanol. In contrast, azibutanol clearly photoincorporated at several mole ratios (Fig. 7), and raising its concentration to 1 mm skewed the distribution even further toward the higher ratios. The strategy of placing diazirine groups on both the 3- and 7-positions of octanol was remarkably successful, leading to the identification of two amino acids separated by four residues. A three-dimensional structure of chicken adenylate kinase is not available, but the high resolution structure of porcine adenylate kinase (24Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) can serve as a good model because the two enzymes have high sequence identity (86.4%) and can be expected to assume almost identical structures (16Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Byeon I.J. Yan H. Edison A.S. Mooberry E.S. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12508-12521Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the following analysis is based on the structure of the unliganded porcine enzyme and uses the numbering scheme of that protein. All residues discussed herein are identical in the porcine and chick enzymes. Inspection of the crystal structure shows the distance between the α-carbons of His-36 and Asp-41 to be about 10 Å and the closest approach of their side chains to be ∼5 Å (Fig.11 A). The maximum distance between the third and seventh carbons of a fully extended aliphatic chain is 5.2 Å (Fig. 1). The matching of these distances suggests that the octanol chain binds in a mostly extended conformation with its third carbon near His-36 and its seventh carbon near Asp-41. This observation defines the orientation of the octanol backbone relative to the structure of adenylate kinase. Apparently, the hydroxyl interacts strongly enough with residues in the binding pocket to ensure that both the 3-azialkanols photolabel only the histidine. Inspection suggests two locations where the alkanol hydroxyl might hydrogen-bond to the protein. These are the backbone carbonyl of Tyr-34 (Fig.11 A) and both Glu-26 and Asp-93 (Fig. 11 B). On the other hand, the hydrophobic end of the azioctanol is less well constrained, allowing 7-azioctanol to sometimes label the histidine as well as the aspartate. Both the residues in the octanol binding site (His-36 and Asp-41) are very highly conserved in all mammalian adenylate and uridylate kinases (16Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-36 is part of the CORE domain and is located in strand 2 at the edge of the five-stranded central β-sheet (Fig. 2) (16Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tian G.C. Sanders C.R. Kishi F. Nakazawa A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Asp-41 is on the first turn of the second α-helix and belongs to the nucleotide monophosphate binding domain. Thus, this anesthetic site is located in a cleft between two structural domains. The conformational changes accompanying the catalytic cycle of adenylate kinase are structurally well characterized (17Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A useful ligand employed in many of these studies is the substrate-mimicking inhibitor, Ap5A. This symmetrical inhibitor connects AMP and ATP by a fifth phosphate, mimicking both bound substrates (25Byeon I.J. Yan H. Edison A.S. Mooberry E.S. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12508-12521Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Abele U. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When it is bound, both the LID and the nucleotide monophosphate binding domains move toward the CORE domain, partially covering the active site of the enzyme. The Ap5A-induced rotation of the Asp-41-containing nucleotide monophosphate binding domain relative to the His-36-containing CORE domain (28Muller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) alters the topography of the anesthetic binding pocket, probably accounting for the decreased photoincorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol in the presence of Ap5A. A low resolution difference Fourier map of a halothane-adenylate kinase complex (4Sachsenheimer W. Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 79: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that halothane (CF3·CHClBr) bound to the CORE domain between the central β-sheet (strands 1, 4, and 5) and helix α1, in an area distant from the alkanol binding site identified in this work. Thus, halothane and alkanols appear to target distinct sites in adenylate kinase. Interestingly, separate sites for these two anesthetics have also been observed in acetylcholine receptors (14Pratt M.B. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29441-29451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,29Chiara D.C. Eckenhoff R.G. Dangott L.J Cohen J.B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (Abstr. 2125): 360Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies suggest that anesthetics bind in well defined pockets that have relatively rigid size constraints and that exclude larger agents that could only fit if more than slight rearrangements of their amino acid side chains occurred (2Schoenborn B.P. Watson H.C. Kendrew J.C. Nature. 1965; 207: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Schoenborn B.P. Nature. 1965; 208: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Schoenborn B.P.

Consequently, one would expect that the number of anesthetic binding pockets on a given protein would tend to increase as the size of the agent decreases (6Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar,32Eckenhoff R.G. Chan K. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (Abstr. 1402): 335Google Scholar, 33Prange T. Schiltz M. Pernot L. Colloc'h N. Longhi S. Bourguet W. Fourme R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Otting G. Liepinsh E. Halle B. Frey U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 396-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results with 3-azibutanol are consistent with this hypothesis because it incorporated with a much higher stoichiometry than the azioctanols. In addition to binding the pocket at His-36, 3-azibutanol also photoincorporated into both Tyr-32 and Tyr-34 in the CORE domain (Fig. 2). These residues form a small aromatic pocket at the base of the enzyme, between helices α1 and α8 (Fig 2), that plausibly might exclude azioctanols. The amphipathic character of these anesthetic binding pockets is consistent with crystallographic studies of other general anesthetic binding pockets. For example, in firefly luciferase, one of the binding pockets for the anesthetic bromoform includes histidine, arginine, threonine, and two glutamic acids (5Franks N.P. Jenkins A. Conti E. Lieb W.R. Brick P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2205-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our results are in partial agreement with a recent analysis that concluded that alcohol binding sites possess a hydrogen bond acceptor in a turn or loop often located near the N-terminal end of an α-helix (35Dwyer D.S. Bradley R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The location of anesthetic sites at the interface between two structural domains has been noted in some other cases (6Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 36Eckenhoff R.G. Petersen C.E., Ha, C.E. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30439-30444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and may prove to be a common motif for general anesthetic binding sites. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that geometric isomers of aliphatic diazirines can be used to delineate ligand binding pockets in proteins. On adenylate kinase, 3- and 7-azioctanol identified two residues separated by 5 Å, corresponding to the distance between the third and seventh carbon of an extended aliphatic chain (Fig. 11). These residues are in different domains that move relative to each other when a substrate is bound. The strategy should be applicable to other likely targets of general anesthetics such as excitable membrane proteins. We thank Carol Gelb and Enrique Arevalo for assistance."

Experiments based on plasmid transfection in vitroand electroporation in vivo validated several predictions of the bioinformatic analysis, yielding a picture of synergistic interaction between proximal and distal promoter elements in controlling developmental stage-specific gene activation. Of particular interest for future studies of heterologous gene expression is a 650-base pair construct containing modules from the proximal and distal human embryonic myosin heavy chain promoter that drives extraordinarily powerful transcription during muscle differentiation in vitro. myosin heavy chain analysis of variance group of overlapping clones conserved human embryonic MyHC element muscle regulatory factor honestly significant difference Throughout metazoan evolution, the range of molecular mechanisms used to achieve functional diversity in muscle partially reflects the anatomic complexity of the species under consideration. In vertebrates, the maximal contractile speed and energy utilization rate of individual muscle fibers is largely controlled by the structure of the motor protein myosin (reviewed in Ref. 1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The conventional myosins of striated muscle are hexameric proteins composed of paired trimers of myosin heavy chain (which contains the ATP-splitting motor domain) and one each of the essential and regulatory light chains. The human genome has at least 11 distinct striated myosin heavy chain (MyHC)1 genes (2Desjardins P. Burkman J. Shrager J. Allmond L. Stedman H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 4: 375-393Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), six of which are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and are tandemly linked at a single locus on chromosome 17 (3Leinwand L.A.

Rubinstein N. Stedman H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The members of the human skeletal MyHC locus have 38 coding exons and two 5′ noncoding exons. Unlike striated MyHC isoform diversification inDrosophila, which reflects a complex pattern of alternative exon splicing (6Hastings G.A. Emerson C.P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Bernstein S. Milligan R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the process in vertebrates relies on sequential activation of a family of distinct genes, each encoding a single MyHC (8Mahdavi V. Strehler E.E. Periasamy M. Wieczorek D. Izumo S. Grund S. Strehler M.-A. Nadal-Ginard B. Emerson C.F.D. Nadal-Ginard B. Siddique M.A. Molecular Biology of Muscle Development. Alan R. Liss, New York1986: 345-361Google Scholar). By virtue of the extraordinary abundance of these proteins (35% of muscle protein), a large body of experimental data on MyHC isoform switching was assimilated before isolation of the encoding genes (9Whalen R. Sell S. Butler-Browne G. Schwartz K. Bouveret P. Pinset-Harstom I. Nature. 1981; 292: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). During embryonic myogenesis in mammals, the transcriptionally 5′-most gene in the skeletal MyHC locus is activated first. During fetal muscle development, the perinatal gene is selectively activated in a large proportion of the muscle cells with progressive down-regulation of the embryonic gene until birth. During subsequent postnatal growth, the perinatal MyHC is progressively replaced by the three “type II” (adult fast twitch) MyHCs. Throughout adult life, reversible transitions are possible in response to cycles of degeneration and regeneration or alterations in the hormonal environment, innervation, and pattern of locomotive recruitment of individual muscle fibers (1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar,10Pette D. Staron R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sixth gene at the skeletal MyHC locus is expressed only in selected extraocular and laryngeal muscle fibers (11Wieczorek D. Periasamy M. Butler-Browne G. Whalen R. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The order of sequential activation during development contrasts with the physical order of the linked genes: 5′-embryonic, IIa, IId/x, IIb, perinatal, extraocular-3′. A seventh MyHC abundantly expressed in type I (slow twitch) skeletal muscle fibers is encoded by the physically unlinked cardiac β MyHC. At all times, the stoichiometry of myofibril assembly must be maintained such that inactivation or down-regulation of one skeletal MyHC gene must be precisely offset by activation or up-regulation of another. Two exceptional attributes of the mammalian skeletal MyHC locus, size and tandem gene number, have limited the study of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms within this gene family. Predating the modern era of general information about transcription factor binding sites, studies of a 1.4-kb region of genomic DNA upstream from the rat embryonic MyHC gene suggested a complex pattern of regulation by counteracting cis-elements (12Bouvagnet P.F. Strehler E.E. White G.E. Strehler-Page M.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4377-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Studies of a large number of other single copy genes expressed during myogenesis have more recently defined roles and binding specificities for several transcription factors, providing a basis for general models of promoter and enhancer function during commitment and terminal differentiation. Transcription factors of the MyoD/MRF and MEF-2 families play pivotal and synergistic roles in the activation and maintenance of the myogenic differentiation pathway (13Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 14McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which these factors achieve transcriptional activation remain unclear, there is increasing evidence for a central role of histone modification and chromatin remodeling. In addition to MRF and MEF-2, numerous ubiquitous and muscle-specific transcription factors have been found to play important roles in gene up-regulation during terminal myogenesis. A partial list reflecting the extent of characterization includes AP1, AP2, GR, Oct-1, SRF, Sp1, TEF, and TR (15Andreucci J.J. Grant D. Cox D.M. Tomc L.K. Prywes R. Goldhamer D.J. Rodrigues N.

Factors traditionally associated with other cell lineages (e.g. GATA and hematopoeisis) have also been found to play important roles in the expression of some muscle-specific genes (21McGrew M.J. Bogdanova N. Hasegawa K. Hughes S.H. Kitsis R.N. Rosenthal N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For all of the factors listed above, information about binding specificities has been incorporated into publicly available nucleotide weight matrices (22Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The sequence specificity of transcription factors and the recruitment of these proteins into multisubunit complexes dictate intriguing patterns of evolutionary sequence conservation in noncoding DNA. In recent years, a number of World Wide Web-based tools have been developed to facilitate the comparative analysis of DNA sequence emerging from the various genome projects. Although the publicly available murine genome sequence currently consists of highly fragmented files in draft form, islands of synteny with the human genome allow reconstruction of orthologous gene alignments that expedite the prospective identification of transcriptional control regions. As currently implemented, “percentage identity plot” analysis provides a low resolution snapshot of large genomic regions (23Schwartz S. Zhang Z. Frazer K.A. Smit A. Riemer C. Bouck J. Gibbs R. Hardison R. Miller W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), whereas “Bayesian phylogenetic footprinting” allows a detailed look at regions of up to 2 kb (24Wasserman W.W. Palumbo M. Thompson W. Fickett J.W. Lawrence C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The latter approach has been applied to other muscle-specific promoters with the finding that the majority of relevant transcription factor binding sites are concentrated within the small percentage of total sequence that has the highest probability of alignment (i.e. meets the most stringent criteria for conservation). The complementary use of transcription factor matrices to screen phylogenetically conserved DNA sequence for high affinity binding sites has the capacity to yield a detailed annotation of putative cis-acting regulatory domains. Hypotheses generated on the basis of this annotation can provide a useful basis for the experimental study of gene regulation in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we use draft murine genome sequence from several fragmented draft files, initially identified on the basis of BLAST (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) comparisons with the human genome, to reconstruct a working model for the complete murine skeletal MyHC locus. Each of the six human MyHC promoter regions is analyzed in detail using bioinformatic tools, as exemplified by those cited above, to yield annotated maps reflecting both the level of sequence conservation and the precise location of matches to transcription factor matrices. Regions of strong conservation between the orthologous human and murine MyHC promoters occur in patches scattered throughout at least 2 kb immediately upstream of the transcriptional start sites. Paralogous promoter comparisons reveal surprisingly strong homology within 300 bp of the transcriptional start sites, providing evidence for a conserved proximal “core” promoter domain. Transfection of myotubes in vitro and electroporation of myofibers in vivo are used to further dissect the relevant domains of four of these promoters with the findings that 1) isolated proximal promoter regions can retain developmental stage specificity despite homology to a core consensus sequence and 2) an E box-rich distal region of the human embryonic MyHC promoter dramatically amplifies the in vitroactivity of all of the proximal core promoters tested incis. These findings suggest several testable hypotheses regarding potential short and long range interactions between transcriptional control elements within the skeletal MyHC tandem gene locus. Deduced full-length cDNA sequences derived from an annotated version of the human skeletal myosin heavy chain locus (2Desjardins P. Burkman J. Shrager J. Allmond L. Stedman H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 4: 375-393Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were used to query the high throughput genomic DNA sequence databases accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information Homepage (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Species-specific repeats in the reconstructed human locus were identified using the REPEATMASKER algorithm as implemented on the Washington University server (ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker). As soon as draft sequences appeared online to confer complete coverage of all six of the genes at the murine locus, we ordered the draft sequence fragments to correspond to the order of the orthologous human sequences. A reconstructed murine sequence draft spanning the entire locus was annotated, initially by using GENSCAN as implemented on the MIT server (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN) and later by cross-checking with the human annotated sequence to verify exon splice site predictions. We next used sequence from our full-length cDNA clones to prospectively identify the transcriptional start sites for four of the genes at the human locus. These predictions were confirmed and extended to include all six genes by using the Promoter Prediction by Neural Network program as implemented on the Berkeley Drosophila Genome server (www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html). Orthologous regions were easily identified in the annotated murine MyHC locus. Regions upstream of the predicted human and murine transcriptional start sites were analyzed with the several programs in the MacVector package (version 6.0.1; Oxford Molecular Group) as implemented on the Mac OS platform and as cited throughout. In addition, these regions were analyzed using the TESS and Bayesian Phylogenetic Footprint Homepage programs, as implemented on the University of Pennsylvania (www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess?SEA-FR-Query) and Wadsworth servers (bayesweb.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/bayes_align12.pl), respectively. The outputs from the latter analyses were merged by importing the results into Microsoft Word files and reproducing the color coding of the nucleotide sequence to identify phylogenetically conserved regions. The complete files are available on request form the corresponding author. Only the general results have been integrated into the figures in this paper. All of the promoter constructions were made in the pGL3-basic plasmid, a promoterless gene encoding the firefly luciferase (Promega). The different promoters were cloned using theNheI and BglII sites of the pGL3-basic plasmid. For this purpose, all of the promoters were amplified by 30 cycles of PCR using the proofreading Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All primers were designed to have a 58 °C annealing temperature and to contain the NheI site in 5′ or the BglII site in 3′ as showed in Table I to allow a unidirectional cloning. The plasmid CMV-βGal (CLONTECH) was used for the quantification of transfection efficiency. The hybrid plasmids between the embryonic and the IIb promoters (KNX, KNF) were obtained by the ligation of two PCR fragments through a SalI site introduced into the primer (Table I). The KOF insert was obtained by a recombinant PCR to join both independent PCR fragments.Table ISequences of primers used for the cloning of the different deleted or mutated promotersPrimersSequence 5′ → 3′PlasmidEmbryonic promoter PCR.ProE/Nhe1-SensGGGGGCTAGCGAACGGAGGTGKNE, KNS, KNM PCR.ProE/Bgl2-AntiGGGGAGATCTCCGGGGCTTTTATAGEmbryonic cis-elements PCR-EmbF13-sensTTCCTCTGCGTCTTCTCGAAGCKLZ, KNS, KLT, KMA PCR-EmbB25-antiTCTATGCTGCCAGCTCGTATTCC PCR-EmbF12-sensATGCGTCTGTAGCATCCACAGGACKLY PCR-EmbB24-antiAGGGGGGGCTGTCTAACAAATG PCR-Emb1064/Kpn1-sensGGGGGGTACCAACCACAGGGTGCCCKOQ PCR-EmbB25/Sst1-antiGGGGGAGCTCTCTATGCTGCCAGCTCG PCR-Emb1064/Kpn1-sensGGGGGGTACCAACCACAGGGTGCCCKOP PCR-EmbE5E6.Sst1-antiGGGGGAGCTCGGAAAGACCAGCTGCTG PCR-EmbE5/Kpn1-sensGGGGGGTACCTCTGCAGGCCACCKOT PCR-EmbB25/Sst1-antiGGGGGAGCTCTCTATGCTGCCAGCTCGSite-directed mutagenesis1-aThe introduced mutations are underlined.

Open table in a new tab The C2C12 cell line proliferates at low density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 20% fetal calf serum. The differentiation into myotubes was induced by replacing the proliferation medium by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% fetal calf serum + ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenium from Roche Molecular Biochemicals at 5 μg/ml each). These cells were transfected using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, at day 1, myoblasts were plated at 200,000 cells/well in a six-well plate. At day 2, 2 h prior to the transfection, the medium was removed and replaced by differentiation medium. Transfection was achieved by incubating 6 μl of FuGene6 in 94 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at room temperature. After 5 min, 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of CMV-βGal plasmid were then incubated for another 15 min. The transfection mixture (100 μl) was added to the cell drop by drop. Cells were collected at day 5 for luciferase assay using 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer per well according to the luciferase assay system (Promega). We used 10 μl of cell extracts for the determination of the luciferase activity. The β-galactosidase activity was measured using the chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system for the detection of the β-galactosidase (Galacthon-Light, Tropix PE biosystems) with 10 μl of cell extracts. Electroporation of rat tibialis anterior muscles was performed as per Ref. 30Aihara H. Miyazaki J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar. All electroporation and subsequent euthanizing and procurement procedures were performed in accordance with University of Pennsylvania IACUC protocols. Liquid nitrogen frozen muscles were pulverized to powder and solubilized with 1× lysis buffer (luciferase assay system; Promega). After a 5-min incubation and one freeze/thaw cycle, samples were centrifuged, and 20 μl of supernatant were processed for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. The luciferase results are expressed as the ratio between the luciferase activity and the β-galactosidase activity. Furthermore, for each series of transfections, we transfected the promoterless plasmid pGL3-basic for the quantification of background. The normalized luciferase results obtained with the pGL3-basic plasmid are defined as 1. All of the other activities of the series are then expressed as the x-fold trans-activation above the background. Data sets on levels of marker gene expression were analyzed (JMP; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) to determine arithmetic means, S.D. values, S.E. values, S.E. values of the means, and the probabilities associated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student's t test, and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test (i.e. the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis about the difference between means among multiple groups within a data set). The Tukey-Kramer HSD provides a conservative calculation of statistical significance in the analysis of intergroup comparisons that minimizes the risk of type I error by increasing the quantile multiplied into the S.E. values to create the least significant difference. To provide a basis for phylogenetic analysis of putative transcriptional control domains within the skeletal MyHC locus, we periodically screened high throughput DNA sequence databases until a representation of the entire murine locus could be identified in draft form. Three overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes spanned the entire locus as depicted in Fig.1 A, although the data contained in the relevant accession files was highly fragmented at the time of this analysis. Based on synteny with the human locus, we reconstructed a single file that contained a properly ordered and annotated draft of the murine locus. As expected, coding regions exhibit greater than 90% sequence homology, without gaps. Although the orthologous genes occupy approximately the same relative proportion of the length of the entire locus, the murine locus is only 80% of the size of the human locus. From the standpoint of transcriptional regulation, the regions upstream of the first coding exons of the orthologous and paralogous genes are of greatest interest. We identified transcriptional start sites by comparison with full-length cDNA sequences or by analyzing homologous intergenic regions for TBP binding site and initiator consensus sequences using Promoter Prediction by Neural Network NNPP (Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory). An initial screen of 8 kb upstream of each transcriptional start site revealed a pattern exemplified by the orthologous embryonic and IIb promoters in which there is strong conservation interrupted by blocks of nonconserved sequence, which in most cases precisely coincide with the boundaries of species-specific repeats as annotated previously using the REPEATMASKER algorithm. There are blocks of >100-bp DNA sequence that attain 60% conservation (note peak height in theraised relief image) out to at least 8 kb upstream of both the human embryonic and IIb MyHC transcriptional start sites (Fig. 1, B and C, embryonic MyHC upstream 8 × 8 kb and IIb MyHC upstream 8 × 8 kb). The conserved regions identified as conserved human embryonic MyHC element (ChemE)-1, -2, and -3 are defined below. With the sole exception of the extraocular MyHC promoter pair, the pattern of conservation within 2 kb of the start sites provided striking evidence for selection against mutation by insertion or deletion. This pattern suggests that the order of and/or the physical distance between transcription factor binding sites spread over at least 2 kb is crucial to the proper developmental regulation of MyHC gene activation/repression. To address the possibility of a shared core promoter structure, we extended the pairwise comparison to include paralogous human MyHC promoters (Fig.1 D). Homology among promoter paralogs is uniquely detected within the most proximal 300 bp, as shown for the IIa, IId/x, IIb, and perinatal genes. A limitation of this analysis for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements is its dependence on user-defined parameters such as window size, DNA scoring matrix, and gap penalty. These biases have been largely eliminated through the recent introduction of a Bayesian statistical method based on a Gibbs sampling algorithm (24Wasserman W.W. Palumbo M. Thompson W. Fickett J.W. Lawrence C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 26Zhu J. Liu J.S. Lawrence C.E. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relationship between level of sequence conservation and distance upstream from the transcriptional start sites is quantitatively displayed in Bayesian “phylogenetic footprint” plots for five of the promoter pairs (Fig. 2). Thez axis in each of the three-dimensional plots indicates the local probability of mouse-human DNA sequence alignment based on a modification of the Bayes block aligner algorithm (24Wasserman W.W. Palumbo M. Thompson W. Fickett J.W. Lawrence C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The overall pattern of gene conservation as a function of distance from the transcriptional start site is similar for the perinatal, IIa, IId/x, and IIb genes. Relative to these four genes, the embryonic gene has a comparatively larger block of conserved sequence in the interval −600 to −1000 (ChemE-2) and a smaller block of conserved sequence in the interval +1 to −300 (ChemE-1). In addition, 4.1 kb upstream of the human embryonic gene transcriptional start site is a 0.5-kb block of extraordinarily conserved noncoding sequence (ChemE-3), a pattern unique among the six genes at this locus. Finally, sequence conservation among the paralogous genes is typified by the human IIaversus IId/x pairing, with four distinct spikes of homology within 300 bp of the transcriptional start. A position weight matrix-based search for binding sites in a transcription factor data base was filtered to identify candidate protein-DNA interactions in the phylogenetically conserved portion of each sequence pair, as shown schematically above the footprints (Fig.2, lettering above individual plots). Three groups of transcription factors known to participate in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression are identified as having high concentrations of sites within these conserved domains: MRFs, MEF-2, and SRF. Additional transcription factors identified by this approach include AP-2, AhR, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, GR, HEB, Oct-1, RREB-1, Sp1, STAT4, TEF-1, and YY1. As previously demonstrated for other muscle-specific promoters, the concentration of predicted sites is higher in the conserved than in the divergent sequence domains (24Wasserman W.W. Palumbo M. Thompson W. Fickett J.W. Lawrence C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The overall distribution of these sites is not appreciably conserved among the paralogous promoters except in the most proximal 300 bp of sequence. We used ClustalW (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) to align all of the proximal promoters for each orthologous gene pair (Fig. 3). This alignment draws attention to four core domains and provides a consensus sequence for these and the intervening regions. A computational analysis of each of the individual sequences and the consensus sequence identifies several “high affinity” matches to the Transfac matrices for MEF-2, MyoD, Oct-1, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, and TBP, the former of which is outlined on the sequence alignment. In this alignment, the embryonic promoter pair is distinguished from the other four pairs in having the highest affinity MEF-2 site (28Fickett J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) nearest to the transcriptional start site (proximal domain 2 as compared with proximal domain 3 for the others). In fact, this site achieves the highest binding score of any predicted MEF-2 site within 2 kb of an MyHC promoter. Three MEF-2 consensus sequences are identified in the IIa, IId/x, and perinatal promoters. MEF-2 binding is predicted from position weight matrices for the corresponding regions of the other two promoters, but the binding strength falls below the default limits at the most distal site for the embryonic promoter and at the most proximal site for the IIb promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2327676988,"MBP-1, a cellular factor, appears to be involved in multiple functions, including transcriptional modulation, apoptosis and cell growth regulation. In this study, we have investigated the signaling pathway involved in MBP-1 mediated apoptotic cell death. Human carcinoma cells infected with a replication deficient adenovirus expressing MBP-1 (AdMBP-1) induced apoptosis, when compared with cells infected by replication-defective adenovirus (dl312) as a negative control. Transduction of MBP-1 in carcinoma cells releases cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol leading to activation of procaspase-9, procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage. We previously observed that MBP-1 mediated apoptosis can be protected by Bcl-2, although MBP-1 does not share a homology with the BH domain of the Bcl-2 family member of proteins. To further understand the mechanism of MBP-1 mediated apoptosis, we examined whether MBP-1 modulates the Bcl-2 gene family. Our results demonstrated that human breast carcinoma cells infected with AdMBP-1 selectively reduced Bcl-xL mRNA and protein expression when compared with dl312 infected negative control cells. An in vitro transient reporter assay also suggested repression of the Bcl-x promoter activity by MBP-1. Additional studies indicated that MBP-1 modulates Ets family protein function, thereby downregulating Bcl-xL expression. Taken together, our results suggest that MBP-1 selectively represses Bcl-xL expression in MCF-7 cells and induces mitochondrial involvement in the apoptotic process."
https://openalex.org/W2076540674,"The mechanism for heparin activation of antithrombin III has been postulated to involve disruption of interactions between its reactive loop P1 residue and Glu255 on the underlying protein surface. To test this hypothesis, the potential P1-constraining Arg393–Glu255 hydrogen bond and ionic interactions were eliminated by converting Glu255 to alanine. E255A and wild-type ATIIIs have identical reactive loop sequences (including the P1 and P14 residues), but differ in that Glu255-mediated, P1-constraining interactions with the underlying surface cannot form in the mutant. Relative to its wild-type parent, E255A had a 5-fold higher affinity for heparin and pentasaccharide. In the absence of cofactor, E255A exhibited a 5-fold activation of thrombin inhibition but no activation of factor Xa inhibition. Pentasaccharide addition elicited no further activation of thrombin inhibition but increased the factor Xa inhibition rate 100-fold. E255A heparin-dependent thrombin and factor Xa inhibition rates were 1000- and 2-fold faster, respectively, than pentasaccharide-catalyzed rates. Although “approximation” is the predominant factor in heparin activation of ATIII thrombin inhibition, and removal of the P1 constraint plays a distinct but minor role, the primary determinant for activation of factor Xa inhibition is the pentasaccharide-induced conformational change, with approximation making a further minor contribution, and removal of the P1 constraint playing no role at all.

Although “approximation” is the predominant factor in heparin activation of ATIII thrombin inhibition, and removal of the P1 constraint plays a distinct but minor role, the primary determinant for activation of factor Xa inhibition is the pentasaccharide-induced conformational change, with approximation making a further minor contribution, and removal of the P1 constraint playing no role at all. antithrombin III full-length high affinity heparin heparin pentasaccharide factor Xa observed pseudo-first-order rate constant apparent second-order rate constant second-order association rate constant dissociation equilibrium constant fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis stoichiometry of inhibition ionic strength polyethylene glycol Antithrombin III (ATIII)1 is a key inhibitor of blood coagulation enzymes and belongs to the serpin family of protease inhibitors whose members employ a common inhibition mechanism. However, the rate at which ATIII inhibits its target enzymes is abnormally low for a serpin, and activation by heparin or vascular wall heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) is necessary for it to achieve the high inhibition rates characteristic of other serpins. The physiological importance of ATIII-heparin/HSPG interactions is supported by the occurrence of thrombosis in individuals carrying ATIII molecules with defects in heparin binding or activation, and by the clinical use of pharmaceutical heparin as an anticoagulant in patients with hereditary and acquired thrombosis. Because of the extensive use of heparin as a pharmaceutical, the mechanism for heparin activation of ATIII anticoagulant activity has been extensively investigated. These studies show that dramatically increased rates of thrombin and factor Xa inhibition can be achieved upon binding of heparin. Heparin binding to antithrombin is a two-step process consisting of an initial low affinity interaction that induces a large scale protein conformational change, which leads to high affinity binding and ATIII activation (1Olson S. Shore J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate enhancement for the inhibition of thrombin results from an approximation (bridging) mechanism in which long, high affinity heparin chains (>18 sugars) facilitate a >1000-fold increased rate of association between thrombin and ATIII (2Olson S. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a specific anticoagulantly active pentasaccharide sequence of heparin is sufficient for accelerating the rate of factor Xa inhibition by ATIII. Binding of this pentasaccharide causes a protein conformational change and is associated with a 270-fold increased rate of factor Xa inhibition and a 1.7-fold increase in rate of inhibition of thrombin (3Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a part of the effort to understand how heparin activates antithrombin III, it is important to determine why its basal rate of target enzyme inhibition is depressed compared with other serpins. The low rates of association between ATIII and its target enzymes have been attributed to problems with accessibility of its P1 residue, arginine 393. On the basis of comparisons of x-ray structures for native antithrombin (4Schreuder H. deBoer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H. Grootenhuis P. Hol W. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Carrell R. Stein P. Fermi G. Wardell M. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and native α-1 antitrypsin (6Elliott P. Lomas D. Carrell R. Abrahams J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), two factors were proposed to constrain the reactive loop and to limit accessibility of the ATIII P1 residue in the native molecule. One constraint involves shortening of the reactive loop and an associated decrease in loop mobility and flexibility due to incorporation of its amino-terminal side (including the P14 residue) into β-sheet A. The structure of an antithrombin III-pentasaccharide co-crystal (7Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R. Carrell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) and studies of a P14 serine-to-tryptophan substitution mutant (8Huntington J. Olson S. Fan B. Gettins P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) show that upon occupation of the pentasaccharide binding site, the P14 residue is expelled from the sheet A, lengthening the reactive loop. Expulsion of the P14 residue by pentasaccharide binding, P14 modification with fluorescein (9Huntington J. Gettins P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or P14 substitution with glutamic acid (10Futamura A. Gettins P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is associated with a 200–300-fold increase in the rate of association with factor Xa and a much smaller 2-fold increase in the rate of reaction with thrombin. Therefore, the P14 constraint on reactive loop length and mobility plays a significant role in depressing the native ATIII rate of factor Xa inhibition but makes a negligible contribution to the low rate of thrombin inhibition. Native ATIII recognition by target proteinases is additionally thought to be affected by a second reactive loop constraint, which is also specific to antithrombin compared with other serpins. The second constraint directly involves the arginine 393 P1 residue and causes it to face inwards toward the body of the inhibitor rather than outwards toward the solvent in native ATIII (Fig. 1). As observed in crystal structures of native ATIII (4Schreuder H. deBoer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H. Grootenhuis P. Hol W. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Carrell R. Stein P. Fermi G. Wardell M. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), this constraint involves ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the P1 (Arg393) and P6′ (Arg399) arginines of the reactive loop polypeptide and a glutamic acid residue (Glu255), which projects out from the C sheet in the body of the inhibitor. Although there has been some question as to whether the 393/399/255 constraint observed in the native and other ATIII structures (7Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R. Carrell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 11Skinner R. Chang W. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J. Abrahams J.-P. Carrell R. Lomas D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) could be a consequence of dimerization between two ATIII molecules in the unit cells of the crystals and the incorporation of the reactive loop polypeptide of one molecule into β-sheet C of the other molecule, the existence of stabilizing 393/399/255 interactions under physiological conditions is supported by solution studies of increased P1 accessibility to the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide (7Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R. Carrell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 12Pike R. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H. McGraw W. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that a constraint on reactive site loop movement and P1 accessibility imposed by internal bonding with the side chain of arginine 393 contributes to the low inhibitory activity of native conformation ATIII and that release of this constraint is an important step in the activation of ATIII by heparin cofactor (5Carrell R. Stein P. Fermi G. Wardell M. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R. Carrell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 12Pike R. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H. McGraw W. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The role of the P1 constraint in heparin activation of ATIII has been previously addressed in several studies. Two studies utilizing fluorescent reporter groups attached at the P1 position concluded that heparin binding to antithrombin does not greatly alter solvent accessibility (13Chuang Y. Swanson R. Raja S. Bock S. Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Google Scholar, 14Futamara A. Beechem J. Gettins P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6680-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or motional freedom of the P1 side chain (14Futamara A. Beechem J. Gettins P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6680-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Work with ATIII variants in which the P1 arginine 393 was replaced with a series of nonionic residues or histidine also imply that the P1 residue is similarly accessible to proteinases in the native and heparin-activated states (13Chuang Y. Swanson R. Raja S. Bock S. Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Google Scholar). However, because of the critical role of the P1 residue in serpin target enzyme interactions, the approach of substituting the P1 amino acid in these studies produced a concomitant change in the target proteinase specificity, and it was not possible to directly address the role of the P1 constraint with respect to the normal physiological targets of ATIII, thrombin and factor Xa. As described in this report, an alternative strategy for investigating the role of the P1 constraint in modulating ATIII anticoagulant activity involves alanine substitution of the negatively charged Glu255 residue that projects from the serpin body and interacts with the P1 and P6′ arginines. This approach has the advantages of maintaining the normal P1 arginine and wild-type reactive loop sequence and therefore permits investigation of the heparin cofactor mechanism to be conducted with respect to the normal physiological targets of ATIII. Using this approach we have quantitated the contributions of three different factors (the P1 and P14 reactive loop constraints and the approximation effect) to heparin cofactor activation of thrombin and factor Xa and have shown that at this level of resolution the detailed mechanisms for modulating ATIII inhibition of these enzymes are fundamentally different. Specifically, relief of the P1 constraint plays a minor role, relief of the P14 constraint plays no role, and approximation plays a major role in heparin modulation of ATIII thrombin inhibition. In contrast, relief of the P1 constraint plays no role, relief of the P14 constraint plays a major role, and approximation plays a minor role in heparin modulation of factor Xa inhibition. The E255A mutation was made on a β-ATIII background (N135A) to reduce heparin binding heterogeneity and facilitate purification (15Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S. Bock S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PCR-based megaprimer mutagenesis was as previously described (16Picard V. Bock S. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: PCR Protocols. Totowa, NJ1996: 183-186Google Scholar) using 5′-ATGTACCAGGCCGGCAAGTTCC-3′ as the mutagenic nucleotide, 5′-GGGTGTCCAATAAGACCG-3′ (AT3.708.F) as the forward primer, and 5′-CTGCCTTCTTCATTTACCTC-3′ (AT3.1262.R) as the reverse primer. A mutant clone was identified by NgoMI digestion. Following sequence verification of the entire 472-bpSacI–NsiI fragment, it was used to replace the corresponding portion of the human ATIII.N135A cDNA sequence in pFastbac1, followed by transposition and virus production in the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Supernatants fromSf9 Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with baculovirus carrying the cDNAs for human ATIII.N135A or ATIII.N135A/E255A were harvested and cleared of cells and debris at 4–5 days postinfection, when the trypan blue viability of the host cells had dropped to ∼80%. After passage through 0.22-micron polyethersulfone membranes, supernatants were applied to 5-ml Hi-trap heparin columns (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a NaCl gradient. The column buffer was 1× PNE (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), and the gradient contained 0–3.0 m additional NaCl. Column fractions were assayed for heparin cofactor activity. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against PNE, and applied to a second heparin column, which was eluted as described above but with the addition of 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 to the buffers. Peak activity fractions from the second heparin column were pooled, dialyzed against Q buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000), and concentrated by tangential ultrafiltration through 30,000 MWCO membranes (Vivaspin-20). The concentrated sample was applied to a 5-ml Econopak Q column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Q buffer, and the ATIII was eluted with a 45-ml gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in Q buffer. Peak activity fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1× PNE and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Purity of ATIII preparations was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined from 280-nm absorbance using the molar extinction coefficient of plasma ATIII (17Nordenman B. Nystrom C. Bjork I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 18: 195-203Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). 1 g samples of the heparin PZ fraction from porcine intestinal mucosa (Celsus) were resuspended in 15 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05m NaCl and size-fractionated on a 2.6 × 60-cm Sephacryl HR-100 column (Amersham Biosciences). Heparin-containing fractions were identified by the Azure A method (18Jacques L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1977; 24: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar), and the size of heparins in each fraction determined by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) (19Jackson P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) versus high affinity heparin (HAH) standards generously provided by Drs. S. Olson and I. Bjork. Fractions containing 20,000-Da heparins (range: 17,000–23,000 Da) from four Sephacryl columns were pooled and applied to a 1 × 30-cm human plasma ATIII-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 m NaCl. Heparins with increasing affinities for antithrombin were eluted with a 1 liter 0.05–3 m NaCl gradient at 45 ml/h. Azure A analysis of the fractions revealed the separation of non-absorbing, low affinity, and high affinity heparins from the column. Fractions containing high affinity heparin were pooled and concentrated and desalted using Centriprep 10 concentrators. Lyophilized high affinity heparin was stored at −70 °C. High affinity heparin concentrations were determined by stoichiometric fluorescence titrationsversus plasma ATIII. The material referred to as heparin in these studies is high affinity heparin prepared as above. All experiments were conducted at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000 (PNE-PEG). In the absence of added salt, the ionic strength of PNE-PEG was 0.15 at pH 7.4. NaCl was added to achieve the higher ionic strength in the heparin binding studies. Stoichiometries for N135A and N135A/E225A inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide or heparin were determined by titrating active site-titrated thrombin and factor Xa with the ATIIIs at various inhibitor to enzyme ratios. Pentasaccharide and active site-titrated enzymes were kindly provided by Dr. Steve Olson, and high affinity heparin was prepared as described above. When included, heparin and pentasaccharide were present at 2 and 2.5 μm, respectively, corresponding to a >2-fold molar excess over the highest ATIII concentration. For determination of inhibition stoichiometries, 12-μl reactions containing 0–1000 nm antithrombin and 400 nm target enzyme in PNE-PEG were incubated at 25 °C for >10 times the half-life of inhibition of the combination being tested. Then 5 μl of the reaction mixture were subsampled into 195 μl of PNE-PEG, and the remaining 7 μl were frozen. 60-μl aliquots of the diluted reaction mix were transferred to a 96-well plate. Residual enzyme activity was measured by adding 100 μl of 1.5 mm thrombin substrate S-2238 or factor Xa substrate S-2765 (Chromogenix) and recording the initial hydrolysis rate at 405 nm. Percent residual enzyme activity was plotted versus the I/E (inhibitor/enzyme) ratio. Stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was determined by extrapolating the linear plot to the molar ratio corresponding to complete proteinase inhibition. In addition to functional monitoring of residual thrombin and factor Xa inhibitory activity, the types of ATIII complexes and products formed at different I/E ratios were determined by analysis of the remaining 7 μl of the reaction mix on 12% polyacrylamide Laemmli gels under non-reducing conditions. Reactions for the measurement of progressive activity were set up under pseudo-first-order conditions and contained ATIII and target enzymes in molar ratios ranging from 10:1 to 30:1. ATIIIs and 10 nm thrombin or fXa were reacted in individual microplate wells in a total volume of 60 μl. The buffer was PNE-PEG plus 50 μg/ml polybrene for thrombin wells and PNE-PEG for fXa wells. Following incubations of 5–40 min, residual thrombin and fXa activity were measured by adding 100 μl of 0.15 mm S2238 or S2765, respectively. Observed pseudo-first-order rate constants, k obs, were obtained from the negative slope of a plot of ln(residual enzyme activity) versus time of enzyme and inhibitor co-incubation. Second-order rate constants (k app) were obtained by dividing the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (k obs) by the ATIII concentration. With several modifications the same method was used to measure the inhibition of thrombin and fXa by N135A and E255A/N135A in the presence of various concentrations of pentasaccharide and heparin. ATIII target enzyme co-incubation times ranged from 0.5 to 40 min, and 50 μg/ml polybrene was included with both chromogenic substrates to quench the cofactor-dependent reactions. Observed pseudo-first-order rate constants were calculated for each heparin (0.5–5 nm) or pentasaccharide (2–10 nm) concentration from the slope of ln(residual proteinase activity) versus time and then plotted against heparin or pentasaccharide concentration to calculate the second-order rate constant for the inhibition by the heparin-ATIII complex, (k hep) or pentasaccharide-ATIII complex (k H5) from Equation 1 (20Olson S. Bjork I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) using theK d for heparin binding at the ionic strength of the reaction (0.15). kobs=(khep[H]o[AT]o/([AT]o+Kd))+kuncat[AT]oEquation 1 k app values were corrected for the partition along the substrate pathway by multiplying the mean of 2–3 measurements by the SI value obtained for the same ATIII-target enzyme-heparin combination. Stoichiometries and equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) for pentasaccharide and heparin binding to ATIII were determined by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence enhancement, which accompanies the binding interaction (20Olson S. Bjork I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Titrations were performed at 25 °C with a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL) using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelength of 340 nm. Solutions for heparin titrations contained 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (pH 7.4) plus NaCl to adjust the ionic strength. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for sample volume increases during titration, and the data were fit to Equation 2 by nonlinear regression curve fitting with Graphpad Prism software. ΔF=ΔFmax×(ATo+H+Kd)−((ATo+H+Kd)2−4×ATo×H)1/2/Equation 2 2×AToIn Equation 2, ΔF is the fractional fluorescence change at a given heparin or pentasaccharide concentration, H is the heparin or pentasaccharide concentration, ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence enhancement, ATo is the effective ATIII concentration and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The effective ATIII concentration was obtained by correcting the ATIII concentration for heparin binding stoichiometry. Recombinant E255A/N135A human antithrombin III was expressed in the baculovirus system as previously described (15Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S. Bock S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The substitution of interest was produced on an N135A β-antithrombin isoform background to eliminateN-glycosylation and heparin binding heterogeneity resulting from the production of two glycoforms when the wild-type sequence, asparagine-proline-serine, is present at residues 135–137 (21Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E255A/N135A was purified from supernatants of infectedSf9 cells by two rounds of affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. A second pass over immobilized heparin was necessary to remove latent ATIII molecules, which represent a substantial fraction of the antithrombin in E255A/N135A supernatants. Purified E255A/N135A and its N135A parent comigrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were >95% pure. Stoichiometries for E255A/N135A and N135A inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa were measured in the absence and presence of cofactor (TableI). The SI values obtained for E255A/N135A and N135A inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the absence of heparin were in good agreement with each other, and with heparin binding stoichiometries of 0.65–0.8, obtained by fluorescence titration. In the presence of heparin, significantly more E255A was required for complete inhibition of both thrombin and factor Xa, as was also observed for the parent N135A molecule, and is well established for plasma-derived antithrombin (22Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the mutant and parent data indicates that E255A/N135A is correctly folded and that the mutation does not alter the basic mechanism or efficiency of target proteinase inhibition.Table IStoichiometries for E255A/N135A and N135A inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the absence and presence of heparinsThrombinFactor Xauncat1-aAbsence of cofactor.+H5+HAHuncat+H5+HAHN135A1.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.02.1 ± 0.01.1 ± 0.01.4 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.0E255A/N135A1.3 ± 0.01.4 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.01.6 ± 0.01.8 ± 0.1Thrombin and factor Xa inhibition stoichiometries (SI) were determined at 25 °C, pH 7.4, I, 0.15 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two to three measurements were made for each condition and are reported as SI ± S.E. for three measurements and SI ± range for two measurements.1-a Absence of cofactor.

E255A/N135A eluted from immobilized heparin at a higher ionic strength (2.8 m NaCl) than its N135A parent (2.1 m NaCl). The magnitude of the increased E255A affinity for heparin was determined by measurement of the dissociation equilibrium constants for binding to pentasaccharide and full-length high affinity heparin (Table II). Fluorescence titrations were conducted at an ionic strength of 0.4 because the affinity of E255A/N135A at physiological ionic strength was too tight to measure directly. The K d for heparin binding to the N135A parent was 15 nm (in good agreement with previous measurements, Refs. 15Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A. Peng X. Picard V. Zendehrouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.

The similarly increased affinity for both heparin and pentasaccharide binding suggests that disruption of the interaction between the P1 arginine in the reactive loop and glutamic acid 255 at the northern pole of ATIII leads to conformational changes in the pentasaccharide binding site region (more than 30 Å away, near the equator of the molecule) that result in a 5-fold increase in antithrombin affinity for both heparin and pentasaccharide.Table IIDissociation equilibrium constants for pentasaccharide and full-length high affinity heparin binding to E255A/N135A and N135A at ionic strength I, 0.4 K dH5HAH nMN135A (Refs. 15Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A.

TableIII shows second-order rate constants for the inhibition of E255A/N135A and its N135A parent in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide and full-length high affinity heparin at pH 7.4 and ionic strength 0.15. Apparent second-order rate constants,k app, were determined from the kinetic loss of target proteinase activity and corrected for flux across the substrate pathway to give the association rate, ka .

Thus, the native conformation of the E255A variant is partially activated for thrombin inhibition, but not factor Xa inhibition.Table IIIAssociation rate constants for uncatalyzed and heparin-catalyzed reactions of E255A/N135A and N135A with thrombin and factor XaThrombin (k a )Factor Xa (k a )uncat+H5+HAHuncat+H5+HAH m −1 sec −1 m −1 sec −1N135A4.0 ± 0.1 × 1031.1 ± 0.3 × 104 3-aTwo measurements.1.5 ± 0.1 × 1073.6 ± 0.1 × 1036.3 ± 0.5 × 1052.2 ± 0.3 × 106E255A/N135A2.1 ± 0.3 × 1042.3 ± 0.1 × 1042.0 ± 0.4 × 1073.5 ± 0.7 × 1033.6 ± 0.2 × 1057.9 ± 1.2 × 105Apparent rate constants (k app) for the inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the absence (uncat) of cofactor and the presence of pentasaccharide (+H5) and full-length high affinity heparin (+HAH) were measured at pH 7.4, 25 °C and I, 0.15 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Second-order association rate constants (k a ) were corrected for partitioning through the substrate pathway by multiplying the apparent rate constant by SI values reported in Table I.

Values are mean ± S.E. for three measurements, except as noted. Patterns of heparin cofactor activation for E255A/N135A and N135A inhibition of thrombin differed. ka for the parent N135A molecule and thrombin increased about 3-fold in the presence of pentasaccharide, as has been previously demonstrated (23Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S. Olson S. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to E255A/N135A, which was already partially activated compared with the parent molecule, and exhibited no further activation upon addition of the pentasaccharide. However, in the presence of full-length high affinity heparin, the rates of thrombin inhibition by both E255A/N135A and N135A increased by ∼1000-fold to become fully activated. The E255A mutation did not increase the rate of progressive factor Xa inhibition. E255A/N135A and its N135A parent were activated to similar degrees by pentasaccharide and full-length heparin for fXa inhibition, although the heparin-dependent ka of E255A/N135A was 3-fold lower than for the control antithrombin, suggesting that the E255A substitution slightly decreases the maximal rate of interaction with factor Xa. The P1 arginine (393) and arginine 399 in the reactive loop of ATIII interact with glutamic acid residue 255, which underlies them and extends out from the body of the molecule (Fig.1). The goal of this work was to investigate the role of the 393/399/255 reactive loop-stabilizing constraint on antithrombin heparin cofactor activation. Because the P1 arginine and the reactive loop polypeptide are central to the interaction of ATIII with its target proteinases, we chose to avoid specificity issues associated with the changing of reactive loop residues and to make an E255A substitution mutant that is altered in the component of the interaction originating on the serpin body side of the interaction. This allowed us to study the effect of 393/399/255 reactive loop–serpin body stabilization in the context of antithrombin's normal physiological targets, thrombin and factor Xa. Fig. 2 summarizes the effects of the P1 and P14 reactive loop constraints and pentasaccharide and full-length heparin binding on rates of ATIII thrombin and factor Xa inhibition. In this figure, the arrows represent relative rates of thrombin or factor Xa inhibition by ATIII variants with wild-type or E255A reactive site regions in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide or full-length high affinity heparin. The areas of the shafts of the arrows are proportional to the magnitude of the association rate for each ATIII/heparin/target enzyme combination. A comparison ofrows a and b shows that selective removal of the 393/399/255 constraint increases the rate of association with thrombin 5-fold but has no effect on the rate of factor Xa inhibition. Comparison of rows b and c indicates that upon subsequent release of the P14 constraint by binding of pentasaccharide, the rate of factor Xa inhibition increases 100-fold, whereas there is no additional increase in the rate of reaction with thrombin over what was achieved by removal of the 393/399/255 constraint. Together these observations indicate that thrombin reacts more efficiently with P1-accessible versus P1-inaccessible (393/399/255-constrained) native ATIII conformations. In contrast, the natural (13Chuang Y. Swanson R. Raja S. Bock S. Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Google Scholar) or mutationally favored (E255A) equilibrium between P1-accessible versus P1-inaccessible native ATIII conformations is of no consequence with respect to facilitating factor Xa interactions. Further release of the P14 constraint by occupancy of the pentasaccharide binding site is required to increase the rate of the factor Xa reaction. Therefore, on the basis of these observations we suggest that under progressive inhibition conditions in the absence of heparin, the key initial interactions of the antithrombin reactive loop with thrombin are localized in the P1 region, whereas the key initial interactions with factor Xa take place in a region of the reactive loop that is freed by P14 expulsion, or, as previously proposed by others (13Chuang Y. Swanson R. Raja S. Bock S. Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Google Scholar, 14Futamara A. Beechem J. Gettins P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6680-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in an ATIII factor Xa binding exosite that is exposed by the conformational change. Comparison of Fig. 2, rows c and d indicates that extension of the pentasaccharide with additional oligosaccharide residues increases the rate of thrombin inhibition by the E255A variant 1000-fold but has only a modest effect (2-fold) on further accelerating the rate of factor Xa inhibition. The magnitudes of the accelerating effects for full-length heparin versus pentasaccharide are similar to what are observed for the N135A parent molecule and plasma-derived antithrombin (Table III and Ref. 23Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S. Olson S. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Together the information contained in Table III and Fig. 2 reveals the relative contributions of (i) the reactive loop P1–393/399/255 constraint, (ii) the reactive loop P14 constraint, and (iii) approximation, to heparin activation of antithrombin III thrombin and factor Xa inhibition. With respect to thrombin inhibition, release of the P1 (393/399/255) constraint makes a modest contribution to accelerating the reaction with thrombin, whereas release of the P14 constraint plays no role at all. In the case of thrombin, it is approximation of the inhibitor and thrombin by full-length heparin that is overwhelmingly responsible for the activation of thrombin inhibition. In contrast, the P1 constraint plays no role and approximation plays a relatively minor role, in heparin cofactor inhibition of factor Xa. Instead, it is the protein conformational change associated with occupancy of the pentasaccharide binding site that drives heparin activation of ATIII factor Xa inhibition. Comparisons of full-length high affinity heparin and pentasaccharide binding to E255A/N135A and N135A are presented in Table II and provide information about protein conformational effects of the P1 constraint. The increased affinity of E255A/N135A for pentasaccharide and full-length high affinity heparin suggests that the 393/399/255 reactive loop constraint is responsible for stabilizing a conformation of the inhibitor with low, native-level affinity for heparin. In addition, the data provide further evidence for structural linkage between the reactive loop and the pentasaccharide binding site on helix D. Removal of the 393/399/255 constraint in the E255A/N135A mutant was associated with 5-fold increases in the affinities for full-length heparin and pentasaccharide. Similar increases in full-length heparin binding affinity have been observed for natural and recombinant ATIII P1 substitutions (13Chuang Y. Swanson R. Raja S. Bock S. Olson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Google Scholar, 24Owen M. George P. Lane D. Boswell D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Together the increased full-length heparin affinities of the E255A/N135A and P1 substitution mutants show that release of the 393/399/255 constraint is associated with a protein conformational change involving the extended binding site for full-length heparin. However, the 5-fold increased pentasaccharide affinity reported here for the E255A/N135A variant relative to its N135A parent more precisely demonstrates conformational linkage between the reactive loop and the pentasaccharide binding site. This finding complements previous observations that have demonstrated the same conformational linkage from the opposite point of view, i.e.based on occupancy of the pentasaccharide binding site affecting the presentation and properties of the reactive loop (25Gettins P. Fan B. Crews B. Turko I. Olson S. Streusand V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In summary, work on an antithrombin E255A mutant that eliminates the P1 reactive loop constraint shows that the mechanisms for heparin cofactor acceleration of thrombin and factor Xa inhibition are distinct and complex, and that activation of this physiologically important anticoagulant protein involves more than the simple increased exposure of its P1 arginine.

Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 56: 1-79Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 2Ikemoto N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3de Meis L. Inesi G. Carafoli E. Membrane Transport of Calcium. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1982: 141-186Google Scholar). It is therefore crucial to determine whether calcium binding is regulated by ATP binding. Based on observations of the velocities of calcium transport that are supported by various kinds of high energy phosphate compounds, Ogawa (24Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 71: 571-573PubMed Google Scholar) and Ogawa and Ebashi (25Ogawa Y. Ebashi S. Nakao M. Packer L. Organization of Energy-transducing Membranes. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1973: 127-140Google Scholar) reported that ATP increases the calcium affinity of the enzyme depending on the ATP concentration (0.3 μm to 2.7 mm). On the other hand, the calcium dependence of equilibrium calcium binding in the absence of ATP (26Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to exhibit a cooperative profile (Hill number (n H) of ∼2) withK 0.5 ∼ 0.4 μm. Such a cooperative profile of kinetic calcium binding (n H ∼ 2, K 0.5 ∼ 0.1 μm), which was obtained from the calcium dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity at a saturating concentration (5 mm) of ATP, has also been observed (27Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify whether ATP changes calcium binding of the ATPase, kinetic calcium binding to the enzyme should be examined in the presence and absence of ATP. Recently, the enzyme molecules in the SR membrane have been suggested to exist as two conformational variants of the chemically equivalent enzyme molecules at a ratio of 1:1 (Fig.1) on the basis of the following observations (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (i) At 0 °C, about half of the calcium-binding sites of the enzyme molecules are in a slow (t 12 ≥ 2 s)/rapid (t <2 s) binding state dependent on pH, and the other half are in a slow binding state independent of pH. The enzyme molecules are slowly or rapidly phosphorylated by ATP, concurrent with slow or rapid calcium binding at a ratio of ∼1:2, indicating that each of the two pools of the calcium sites belongs to one of the two different types (A and B forms) of the enzyme molecules, which are in pH-dependent equilibrium betweenE 1 and E 2 and predominantly in E 2 independent of pH, respectively, before calcium binding (Fig.2). (ii) The amino acid sequence of lysyl endopeptidase peptides of the enzyme preparation is homogeneous and of the fast twitch muscle type, suggesting that the two types of molecules are two conformations of chemically equivalent ATPase molecules. The two hypothesized conformations were previously shown to bind calcium independently in a different manner (29Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model of the conformational variants has been strengthened by the observations that (i) there are the two types of molecules in the SR membrane that differ in the sensitivity of their intrinsic fluorescence intensities to calcium ions and that correspond to the two conformers, respectively (29Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the nonequivalence of the enzyme molecules is canceled by solubilization of the molecules with a detergent (30Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); and (iii) the calcium binding manner of the detergent-solubilized enzyme is distinct from that of either type of conformer (30Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the conformational difference in the conformers has not been specified so far. Here, the calcium dependence of the Ca2+-ATPase activity and of the phosphorylation of the molecules was compared with that of the kinetic calcium binding in the absence of ATP. The results show the existence of two types of regulatory site at which ATP binding changes the binding. The data on ATP regulation are discussed in terms of a model that never seems to come into sharper focus with regard to which conformers of the ATPase molecules are involved in the catalytic cycle of the ATPase, whether these conformers are on different subunits in an oligomer of the enzyme molecules, whether they convert one into the other, and so on.Figure 2Schematic representation of the equilibrium of the A and B forms between E 1 andE 2 before calcium binding and of the kinetics of calcium binding and calcium-induced EP formation. The equilibrium of the A form betweenE 1 and E 2 before calcium binding is pH-dependent (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At acidic pH, the equilibrium shifts to the E 2 side. At 0 °C, the A form apparently slowly binds calcium because of the slow transition of the form from E 2 to E 1. The phosphorylation of the form preincubated with a low concentration of ATP in the absence of calcium is also slowly induced by the slow binding. At alkaline pH, the equilibrium shifts to theE 1 side. Therefore, even at a low temperature of 0 °C, the A form, which is predominantly inE 1, rapidly binds calcium, and the phosphorylation of the form is rapidly induced by the rapid binding. As for the B form, the equilibrium of the form before calcium binding shifts to the E 2 side independent of pH (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At such a low temperature, the B form slowly binds calcium, and the phosphorylation of the form is also slowly induced by the slow binding, irrespective of pH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe procedures for isolation of the SR from rabbit skeletal muscle were the same as those described in a previous study (31Nakamura J.

The reaction times for the assay of the ATPase activity of the membranous enzyme, in which the reactions were linear, were set at 90 s (at 0.01 mg/ml protein and 5 mm ATP) or 5 min (at 0.01 mg/ml protein and 0.25 mm ATP) at pH 6.23 and at 60 s (at 0.005 mg/ml protein and 10 μm ATP and at 0.01 mg/ml protein and 0.25 mm ATP) or 90 s (at 0.01 mg/ml protein and 0.1 mm ATP and at 0.05 mg/ml protein and 5 mm ATP) at pH 7.40. In the presence of the detergent, the reaction time was set at 55 s (at 0.1 mm ATP) or 60 s (at 0.25 mm ATP) at pH 7.40. At 10 μm to 0.25 mm ATP, the association constants for CaEGTA at pH 6.23 and 7.40 were taken as 6.311 × 104 and 1.335 × 107m−1, respectively (35Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). At a higher ATP concentration of 5 mm, the association constants for CaEGTA at pH 6.23 and 7.40 were taken as 5.841 × 104 and 1.247 × 107m−1, respectively (35Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The association constants for CaATP and MgATP at pH 6.23 and 7.40 were taken as 3.097 × 103 and 5.508 × 103m−1 and 8.241 × 103 and 1.466 × 104m−1, respectively (36Khan M.M.T. Martell A.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 668-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The calcium-independent ATPase activity was assayed in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without the addition of calcium. The calcium-dependent ATPase activity (Ca2+-ATPase activity) was obtained by subtracting the calcium-independent activity from the total activity. ATP hydrolysis was measured by determining the amount of phosphate liberated from ATP. Pi, which was liberated from ATP at 10 μm, 0.1–0.25 mm, and 5 mm ATP, was measured using the methods of Chan et al. (37Chan K.-M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), Baginski et al. (38Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 15: 155-158Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and Bonting et al. (39Bonting S.L. Simon K.A. Hawkins N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), respectively.PhosphoenzymeIn the steady-state study of the ATP-induced phosphorylation of the enzyme, the enzyme preparation (0.25 mg/ml protein) was preincubated in a test tube with medium containing 20 mm Bistris propane (pH 6.23) or 40 mm Tris maleate (pH 7.40), 0.12 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.015–100 μm Ca2+ for 10–60 min at 0 °C. The reaction was manually initiated by the addition of 10 μm to 0.25 mm[32P]ATP. The volume of the reaction medium was 0.5 ml. The amount of the 32P-labeled phosphoenzyme reached ∼80% of its steady-state level within the dead time (∼0.2 s) of the experiment after initiation of the reaction and reached the steady-state level 3–5 s later. Thus, the reaction was terminated 5 s after initiation by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% ice-cold perchloric acid. Aliquots (0.8 ml) of the terminated reaction medium were applied to Millipore HA filters (0.45-μm pore size), which were immersed in 5% perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm ADP and 1 mm Pi. The 32P-labeled enzyme protein on the filter was washed five times with 10 ml of the 5% perchloric acid solution. In the pre-steady-state study of calcium-induced phosphorylation of the enzyme, a rapid filtration method was employed as described previously (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the enzyme (0.2 mg of protein) on the Millipore filter with 0.2 mm EGTA and 10 μm to 0.25 mm[32P]ATP for ∼10 s following 0.2 mm EGTA washing for ∼10 s, the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by washing the enzyme on the filter with a phosphorylation solution of 0.015–50 μm Ca2+ containing the same concentration of [32P]ATP as that used before initiation of the reaction. This was achieved by filtering 1–20 ml of the phosphorylation solution at 0 °C. The dead time of the experiment was ∼2 s. Compared with the reaction of the ATP-induced phosphorylation described above, the reaction of the calcium-induced phosphorylation was slow and reached its steady-state level 10–30 s after initiation of the reaction (see Fig. 2 and “Discussion” for details).RESULTSTo examine the effect of ATP on calcium binding in the Ca2+-ATPase molecules of the SR, the calcium dependence of the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the ATPase molecules and of the phosphorylation of the ATPase molecules was studied based on a model of two conformational variants (A and B forms) of chemically equivalent Ca2+-ATPase molecules (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms have been suggested to exist in the SR membrane at a ratio of 1:1 and to independently bind two calcium ions in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1) (29Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Fig. 3 A, the calcium dependence of the total Ca2+-ATPase activity, which is composed of the activities of the two forms, was examined at 10 μm ATP and pH 7.40. The Ca2+-ATPase molecules of the SR have been shown to have one catalytic site with a high affinity for ATP (K m = 2–10 μm) (8Meissner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 906-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,9Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and a putative regulatory site(s) at which ATP binding accelerates the turnover rate of the ATPase activity with lower affinity (K m = 0.1–5.0 mm) (1Tada M. Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 56: 1-79Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 3de Meis L. Inesi G. Carafoli E. Membrane Transport of Calcium. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1982: 141-186Google Scholar, 27Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for ATP than that at the catalytic site. ATP, which was used here at a concentration of 10 μm, seems to bind to the catalytic site. The Hill plots of the calcium dependence of the total ATPase activity exhibited a biphasic profile with slopes of ∼1.8 and ∼1.0 and an apparent calcium affinity (calcium concentration for the half-maximum activity (K 0.5)) of ∼0.3 μm (Fig. 3 B). The two lines of the plots intersect near the zero point of the ordinate, indicating the existence of two different types of ATPase reaction with almost the same level of maximum activity. Such biphasic calcium dependence of the total phosphorylation (slopes of ∼1.9 and ∼0.9,K 0.5 ∼ 0.2 μm), which is composed of the phosphorylation of the two forms and which was induced by the addition of ATP to the enzyme molecules preincubated with calcium, was also observed at 10 μm ATP and pH 7.40 (Fig.4, A and B). On the other hand, it has been found that ATP, which is bound to the catalytic site at 0.89 μm to 0.1 mm ATP, accelerates specific steps in the catalytic cycle (40Froehlich F.P. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2013-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Guillain F. Champeil P. Lacapére J.-J. Gingold M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6140-6147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Stahl N. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5389-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, the calcium dependence of the total Ca2+-ATPase activity and of the total phosphorylation was also examined at 0.1 mm ATP. These calcium-dependent profiles (slopes of ∼1.9 and ∼0.9 and K 0.5 ∼ 0.12 μm for the ATPase activity and slopes of ∼1.7 and ∼0.7 andK 0.5 ∼ 0.24 μm for the phosphorylation) (data not shown) were almost the same as those at 10 μm ATP described above (Figs. 3 and 4). In the absence of ATP at pH 7.40, the A form noncooperatively (n H∼ 1) bound calcium ions with an apparent K 0.5of 2–6 μm, whereas the B form cooperatively (n H ∼ 2) bound the ions with aK 0.5 of ∼0.2 μm (Fig.5 A; replots of the data in Fig. 3A of Ref. 29Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hill plots of the calcium dependence of the total calcium binding, which is composed of the binding of the two forms at a ratio of 1:1, were biphasic with slopes of ∼1.8 and ∼0.8 (Fig. 5 B; replots of the data in Fig. 3C of Ref. 29Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two lines of the Hill plots also intersect near the zero point of the ordinate. TheK 0.5 of the total binding was ∼0.4 μm. This biphasic profile of the total binding in the absence of ATP was close to those of the total ATPase activity and the total phosphorylation. The results indicate that the calcium dependence of the ATPase activities of the A and B forms is near that of their calcium binding in the absence of 10 μm ATP, suggesting that there is no effect of ATP binding at the catalytic site on calcium binding of the two forms. To examine this conclusion, a study was conducted to determine the calcium dependence of the phosphorylation of the A and B forms. The phosphorylation of the two forms was obtained by pre-steady-state analysis of the calcium-induced total phosphorylation reaction as described previously (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the pre-steady-state study, phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of calcium to the enzyme molecules, which were fixed on the filter and preincubated with ATP in the absence of calcium. At pH 7.40, as described previously (28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is thought that the A and B forms are in the enzyme states ofE 1 and E 2, respectively, before calcium binding. At a low temperature of 0 °C, the A form, which pre-exists in E 1, rapidly (<2 s) binds calcium when it is added, whereas the B form, which pre-exists inE 2, apparently slowly (≥2 s) binds calcium because of the slow transition of the enzyme state fromE 2 to E 1 (Fig. 2). Therefore, by rapid and slow calcium binding, the phosphorylation of the A and B forms (preincubated with ATP in the absence of calcium) is rapidly and slowly induced, respectively. The calcium-dependent profile of the observed slow phosphorylation (n H ∼ 2.0,K 0.5 = 0.08–0.1 μm) (Fig. 4,A and B) was found to have a maximum level of ∼2.5 nmol of phosphorylated Ca2+-ATPase (EP)/mg of protein, which is nearly half of the separately obtained maximum total phosphorylation (∼4.9 nmol of EP/mg of protein), and to be close to that of calcium binding of the B form in the absence of ATP (n H ∼ 2,K 0.5 ∼ 0.20 μm) (Fig. 5,A and B); the slow phosphorylation seems to be fully resolved. The maximum levels of the total phosphorylation (∼4.9 nmol of EP/mg of protein) and of the slow phosphorylation (∼2.5 nmol of EP/mg of protein) are thought to be roughly one-half and one-fourth of the density (∼8.5 nmol/mg of protein) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) of the total catalytic sites in the ATPase preparation, respectively. In contrast to the observed calcium-induced slow phosphorylation of the B form, the calcium-induced rapid phosphorylation of the A form was not resolved by pre-steady-state analysis using the method of rapid filtration. The steady-state level of the calcium-induced rapid phosphorylation was lower than the level of the rapid phosphorylation, which was calculated by subtracting the calcium-induced slow phosphorylation from the ATP-induced total phosphorylation that was separately measured. For example, at 1.16 μm (Fig.6 A) and 10.25 μm(Fig. 6 B) Ca2+, the observed and simulated rapid phosphorylation levels were 0.6–0.8 and ∼1.8 nmol ofEP/mg of protein and 1.2–2.0 (also see Fig. 1Bin Ref. 28Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ∼2.3 nmol of EP/mg of protein, respectively. The difference between the phosphorylation levels at 1.16 μm Ca2+ was more significant than that at 10.25 μm Ca2+. TheK 0.5 of the observed rapid phosphorylation seems to be higher than that of the simulated phosphorylation. In the SR of bullfrog skeletal muscle at 15 °C (43Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it has been observed that when the phosphorylation of the SR is induced by the addition of calcium following preincubation of the SR with ATP in the absence of calcium, the steady-state level of the calcium-induced phosphorylation is lower than the level of the ATP-induced phosphorylation following prolonged preincubation with calcium. In the rabbit SR at 25 °C, the phosphorylation level has been found to be independent of the time of preincubation with calcium (26Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the steady-state level of the calcium-induced phosphorylation is lowered by decreasing the reaction temperature. In this study, the reaction of the calcium-induced phosphorylation was initiated by the addition o"

In this study, the over-expression of both wild-type Harvey and Kirsten Ras proteins as contributors to rat mammary carcinogenesis were examined using a transgenic rat model. Three rat transgenic lines (designated HrHr transgenics) carrying three to six copies of wild-type rat Harvey ras driven by the wild-type rat Harvey ras promoter were produced. In addition, transgenic lines carrying either three or seven copies of the Kirsten ras gene under the same promoter (HrKr) were produced. No pathological changes in the mammary gland were observed in any of the HrHr or HrKr transgenic rat line heterozygotes. Two of the Ras transgenic lines, HrHr (R8) and HrKr (4334), had a significant reduction in NMU-induced rat mammary cancer when compared to their non-transgenic littermates. All five Ras transgenic lines developed fewer carcinomas than their non-transgenic littermates following NMU exposure. The percentage of NMU-induced G35 to A35 activating mutations in the endogenous Harvey ras gene in mammary carcinomas from the HrHr, HrKr transgenic rats and their non-transgenic littermates was similar ( approximately 50%). In contrast, less than 1% of the NMU-induced carcinomas in these Ras transgenic rats had an activating ras mutation in their transgenes. These findings highlight the potential of Ras to function as a modifier gene in repressing mammary carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2322610886,"T2EC are chicken erythrocytic progenitors that balance between self-renewal and differentiation as a function of response to specific growth factors. Their transformation by the v-erbA oncogene locks them into the self-renewal program. We show here that the expression of the VLA-2 integrin alpha2 subunit mRNA is downregulated by v-erbA and that VLA-2 engagement and clustering, brought about by treatment with an alpha2-specific antibody or by culture on the VLA-2 ligand collagen I, inhibits T2EC proliferation. From competition studies using antibodies, VLA-2 was shown to be involved in the collagen-induced response. While engagement of VLA-2 inhibited proliferation, it was not sufficient to induce differentiation. The transformation of T2EC by v-erbA decreased their interaction with collagen I and the VLA-2 brake on cell proliferation, which may account for the increased proliferation potential of transformed erythrocytic progenitors and for their shedding into the blood of infected chickens. Our data suggest that the interaction between erythroid progenitors and collagen, mediated by VLA-2, play a major role in the control of erythropoiesis in vitro and that this pathway is a target of the v-erbA oncogene."

Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); the two forms exist in the SR membrane at a ratio of 1:1 and bind two calcium ions in a different manner (see Fig. 1 in the accompanying article (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). This model was hypothesized on the basis of the following observations (18Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (i) There are two types of enzyme molecules that are in pH-dependent equilibrium betweenE 1 and E 2 and predominantly in E 2 independent of pH, respectively, before calcium binding. (ii) The amino acid sequence of lysyl endopeptidase peptides of the enzyme preparation is homogeneous. The model has been strengthened by observations showing the existence of two types of molecules that differ in the sensitivity of their intrinsic fluorescence intensity to calcium ions (19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also in their sensitivity to submillimolar ATP (the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) and by observations of cancellation of the nonequivalence of the molecules by solubilization of the molecules with detergent (20Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We report that NTPs other than ATP markedly reduce the calcium affinity of the solubilized molecules, although the molecules in the SR membrane are not sensitive to the NTPs. The procedures for isolation of the SR from rabbit skeletal muscle were as described previously (21Nakamura J. Endo Y. Konishi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 18: 108-113Google Scholar). Membranous Ca2+-ATPase was purified from the SR by washing the SR with sodium deoxycholate employing a modification (22Nakamura J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) of the method of Meissner et al. (23Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleisher S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) at a 1:5 ratio of deoxycholate to reticulum protein. As described in the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the density of the catalytic sites in the preparation was estimated to be ∼8.5 nmol/mg of preparation protein. The maximum level of the preparation that was phosphorylated with ATP was 4.2–5.6 (average of 4.4; n = 17)) nmol/mg of protein obtained in 0.25 mg of protein/ml of preparation (5 mm MgCl2, 0.12m KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mmCaCl2 at pH 7.4 and 0 °C). In the preparation that was solubilized with the nonionic detergent C12E8, the maximum level was 4.4–4.6 (average of 4.5; n = 4)) nmol/mg of protein obtained in 0.05 mg of protein/ml of preparation (0.12 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.46 mm ATP, 10 mm CaCl2, and 2.0 mg/ml C12E8 at pH 7.40 and 0 °C). The total activity of NTP hydrolysis, which is composed of calcium-independent and -dependent activities of NTP hydrolysis, was assayed in 40 mm Tris maleate buffer solution (pH 7.40) containing 0.05 mg/ml membranous enzyme protein, 0.12 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NTP, and 0.01–664 μm Ca2+ at 25 °C. The membranous enzyme was treated with 2 μm calcium ionophore A23187 before use. In the assay of the NTPase activity of the detergent-solubilized enzyme, the membranous enzyme (0.05 mg/ml enzyme protein) was directly solubilized in the assay medium containing 2.0 mg/ml C12E8. The association constant for CaEGTA at pH 7.40 was taken as 1.247 × 107m−1 (24Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The association constants for CaNTP and MgNTP at pH 7.40 were taken as 8.241 × 103 and 1.466 × 104m−1, which are the values for CaATP and MgATP at this pH (25Khan M.M.T. Martell A.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 668-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The calcium-independent activity of NTP hydrolysis was determined under identical conditions, except that 5 mm EGTA was added without the addition of calcium. The calcium-dependent activity of NTP hydrolysis (Ca2+- NTPase activity) was obtained by subtracting the calcium-independent activity from the total activity. NTP hydrolysis was measured by determining the amount of phosphate liberated from NTP using the method of Bonting et al. (26Bonting S.L. Simon K.A. Hawkins N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Similar to the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in which the ATP effect on calcium binding of the Ca2+-ATPase molecules was examined, here, we studied the effect of CTP, GTP, ITP, and UTP on calcium binding of the enzyme molecules by comparing the calcium dependence of the hydrolysis activity (Ca2+- NTPase activity) of the NTPs of the enzyme with that of calcium binding in the absence of these NTPs. The results are discussed based on a model of two conformational variants (A and B forms) of chemically equivalent Ca2+-ATPase molecules (18Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two forms have been suggested to exist in the SR membrane at a ratio of 1:1 and to independently bind two calcium ions in the absence of a substrate for the enzyme (19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the calcium dependence of the total Ca2+-GTPase activity, which is composed of the activities of the A and B forms, at 5 mmGTP, pH 7.40, and 25 °C. The Hill plots of the total calcium dependence were biphasic (Fig. 1 B). The two lines of the plots (slopes of ∼1.9 and 0.8–1.0, respectively) intersect near the zero point of the ordinate, suggesting the existence of two different types of Ca2+-GTPase reaction with almost the same level of maximum activity. The calcium concentration for the half-maximum activity (K 0.5) of the total activity was ∼0.2 μm. Such calcium-dependent profiles with almost the same maximum activities (1.4–1.6 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) as that of the GTPase activity (1.52 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) were also observed when CTP and ITP were used as substrates (data not shown). In a previous study (19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that in the absence of NTP at this alkaline pH, the membranous A form noncooperatively (n H ∼ 1) bound calcium ions with an apparent calcium affinity (calcium concentration for half-maximum binding (K 0.5)) of ∼2 μm, whereas the B form cooperatively (n H ∼ 2) bound calcium withK 0.5 ∼ 0.2 μm (Fig.2 A; replots of the data in Fig. 3A of Ref. 19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hill plots of the total binding, which is composed of the binding of the two forms at a ratio of 1:1, were biphasic with slopes of ∼1.8 and ∼0.8 (Fig. 2 B; replots of the data in Fig. 3C of Ref. 19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two lines of the Hill plots also intersect near the zero point of the ordinate. TheK 0.5 of the total binding was ∼0.4 μm. The calcium-dependent profile of the total binding was very close to that of the total GTPase activity (Fig.1). This suggests that GTP, CTP, and ITP have no effect on calcium binding of the two forms. When UTP was used as the substrate, the calcium dependence of the total Ca2+-UTPase activity of the membranous A and B forms at 5 mm UTP (Fig. 3 A) was completely different from that of the total GTPase activities of the two forms shown in Fig. 1. The Hill plots of the total UTPase activity were monophasic with n H = 4.0–4.5 andK 0.5 ∼ 0.04 μm (Fig.3 B). Taking into account that 1 mol of the ATPase molecule binds 2 mol of calcium (3Tada M. Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 56: 1-79Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Ikemoto N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5de Meis L. Inesi G. Carafoli E. Membrane Transport of Calcium. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1982: 141-186Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), the observation of ann H value of ∼4 suggests that the two forms cooperatively bind four calcium ions. It was earlier found that UTP phosphorylates all of the membranous enzyme molecules at a level of 8.5 nmol of phosphorylated enzyme/mg of protein (17Ferreira S.T. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9973-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ATP phosphorylates half of the molecules (3–4 nmol of phosphorylated enzyme/mg of protein) (17Ferreira S.T. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9973-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6232-6237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The density of the ATPase molecules in the ATPase preparation used here was estimated to be ∼8.5 nmol/mg of preparation protein, and the maximum level of the preparation that was phosphorylated with ATP was 4.2–5.6 nmol/mg of protein (see “Experimental Procedures” in the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) for details). Although the maximum phosphorylation level of the preparation with UTP was not examined, if almost all of the enzyme molecules are phosphorylated with UTP, there should be very few molecules that are inE 2 and to which UTP binding induces the regulation of calcium binding, as discussed in the preceding study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that UTP binds to the molecules before phosphorylation so that the UTP binding induces such a regulatory effect on the calcium binding performance in addition to the full phosphorylation of the enzyme molecules. TheK 0.5 of the total UTPase activity (∼0.04 μm) is about one-tenth of the value (∼0.4 μm) of total calcium binding of the A and B forms in the absence of NTP (Fig. 2; replots of the data in Fig. 3A of Ref. 19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is close to the value (∼0.05 μm) of the total ATPase activity at a high ATP concentration of 5 mm, which is shown in Fig. 10 in the preceding study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). UTP seems to increase the calcium affinity of the forms, as is the case with ATP. At pH 6.23, the total Ca2+-UTPase activity gradually increased from 0 to 0.240 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min when the calcium concentration was increased from 0.09 μm to 0.36 mm, and it decreased at >0.36 mmCa2+ (Fig. 4 A); the K 0.5 was ∼2 μm. At >0.1 mm Ca2+, a significant amount of insoluble UTP-calcium complex seems to be formed in the presence of 5 mm UTP; it is impossible to adjust the calcium concentration to >0.1 mm. Moreover, the formation of the insoluble UTP-calcium complex is thought to decrease the UTP concentration available for its hydrolytic reaction. However, the observed calcium-dependent profile at the acidic pH was completely different from that at an alkaline pH of 7.40 (Fig.3 A), suggesting the existence of a difference in UTP effect on the interaction of the two forms at acidic and alkaline pH values. To obtain an image of the UTP effect at the acidic pH, the calcium dependence of the total Ca2+-UTPase activity was subjected to Hill analysis. The Hill plots were biphasic (Fig. 4 B). The slopes of the two lines of the plots were ∼1.0 and ∼0.4, respectively. In the absence of NTP at the acidic pH, as shown in a previous study (19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the membranous A form noncooperatively (n H ∼ 1) bound calcium withK 0.5 ∼ 7 μm, whereas the B form cooperatively (n H ∼ 2) bound calcium withK 0.5 = 2–6 μm (Fig.5, A and B; replots of the data in Fig. 1 (A and C) of Ref. 19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total binding profile, which is composed of the binding of the two forms at a ratio of 1:1, was monophasic with n H∼ 1.3 and K 0.5 ∼ 8 μm. Based on the results of the biphasic profile of the UTPase activity at the acidic pH, it is therefore likely that UTP degrades the calcium binding manner of the A and B forms from noncooperative to negatively cooperative and from positively cooperative to noncooperative, respectively. UTP therefore seems to regulate calcium binding of the two forms in opposite directions at acidic and alkaline pH values.Figure 4Ca2+-UTPase activity of the membranous ATPase molecules as a function of calcium concentration at 5 mm UTP and pH 6.23.

A, total calcium binding to the two forms of ATPase molecules. Calcium binding to the A form (×), which is in anE 1/E 2 state dependent on pH and which pre-exists in E 2 at this acidic pH, was obtained by subtracting the binding to the B form (– – –), which pre-exists in E 2 independent of pH, from the total binding (○). Calcium binding to the B form was simulated using parameters of n H = 2.0 andK 0.5 = 5.3 μm, obtained on the basis of the observations of the calcium-dependent change in fluorescence intensity of the molecules and a maximum binding capacity of half (4.9 nmol/mg of protein) of the capacity of the observed total binding (9.8 nmol/mg of protein) (cf.“Discussion” in Ref. 19Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B, Hill plots of the total binding.

At 0.1 μmCa2+, where these NTPase activities of the membranous molecules were ∼30% of their maximum levels (cf. Figs. 1and 3), no Ca2+-NTPase activities of the solubilized molecules were observed. At 9.9 μm Ca2+, where these activities of the membranous molecules were at their maximum levels, the NTPase activities of the solubilized molecules were <5% (<60 nmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) of the respective maximum activities of the membranous molecules (1.4–1.6 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min). As described above, the formation of the insoluble NTP-calcium complex seems to make it impossible to adjust the concentration to >0.1 mm calcium at an alkaline pH of 7.40. Nevertheless, when the calcium concentration was increased from 9.9 μm to 0.311 mm, these NTPase activities of the solubilized molecules were gradually increased to 0.18–0.55 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min, although they did not reach their maximum levels; the activities at 0.311 mm Ca2+ were at only a 20–50% level of the respective maximum NTPase activities of the membranous molecules. If the NTPase activities observed at 0.311 mm Ca2+are assumed to be maximum levels, the K 0.5values of the NTPase activities can be estimated to be ∼40–100 μm. The n H values of the calcium dependence of the activities could not be estimated because of the incompletion of the calcium-dependent profiles of their activities (Fig. 6). The solubilized molecules have been shown to bind calcium negatively cooperatively (n H = 0.5–0.6) with K 0.5 = 3–5 μm in the absence of NTPs at pH 7.40 (20Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Compared with the K 0.5(3–5 μm) of the solubilized molecules in the absence of the NTPs, the K 0.5 (>40–100 μm) in the presence of the NTPs seems to be >10 times higher. It was examined whether the observed low NTPase activity at a calcium concentration of <0.311 mm results from the denaturation of the molecules by these NTPs during their hydrolysis (Fig.7 A), although such denaturation is prevented by a high level of calcium of more than 0.311 mm. Such a possibility was examined at 9.9 μm Ca2+, where the NTPase activities (0.004–0.057 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) were <20% of those at 0.311 mm Ca2+. The CTPase reaction of the solubilized molecules was first carried out for 10 min at 2.5 mm CTP. After the CTPase reaction, 2.5 mm ATP was added to the reaction medium. The rate of Pi production increased from 0.063 to 0.957 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min after the addition of ATP. The increased Piproduction is thought to be brought about by the total NTPase reaction, which is composed of the reactions of the ATPase and the CTPase in the presence of ATP and CTP. The addition of 2.5 mm CTP 10 min after the initiation of the CTPase reaction did not significantly affect the prior CTPase reaction. These results suggest that the ATPase reaction is predominant in the total NTPase reaction after the addition of ATP. Also, when the reactions of GTPase, ITPase, and UTPase were carried out beforehand, such an increased Pi production was observed after the addition of ATP (data not shown). The total NTPase activity in the presence of ATP and CTP was ∼80% of that without the prior CTPase reaction (1.235 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min); the total NTPase activity of the solubilized molecules that were preincubated for 10 min without the CTPase reaction was ∼60% of the activity that was initiated without the preincubation (1.940 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min). These results indicate that although ∼40% of the solubilized molecules lose their activity during the preincubation without the CTPase reaction, most of the remaining molecules are active even after the CTP reaction, and they take turns in hydrolyzing ATP and CTP. This suggests that the NTPs reversibly lower the calcium affinity of the solubilized molecules, resulting in the reduction of the NTPase activity at a pre-saturation concentration of calcium. In contrast to the NTPase activities of the solubilized molecules, the ATPase activity of the molecules at 5 mm ATP and pH 7.40 (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 20Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) exhibited almost the same calcium-dependent profile (n H ∼ 2.2, K 0.5 ∼ 0.1 μm) and the same maximum activity (6.0 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) as those of the membranous molecules (n H ∼ 2,K 0.5 = 0.04–0.08 μm, and maximum activity = 3.95–5.2 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min) (see Fig. 10 in the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). In a previous study (20Nakamura J. Tajima G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17350-17354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it was found that the calcium dependence of acetyl phosphate hydrolysis of the solubilized molecules is the same as that of calcium binding in the absence of substrate and that AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, does not affect calcium binding of the solubilized molecules (n H = 0.5–0.6,K 0.5 = 3–5 μm). These data suggest that the structure of the base in NTP is crucial for calcium binding of the solubilized molecules and that the adenine ring is essential for the molecules. In other words, ATP seems to be the only intrinsic substrate for the enzyme molecule. Such an exclusive property of the molecule might be related to the fact that P-type ATPases, which contain Ca2+-ATPase, lack the P-loop, which is a common motif in the other types of ATPase and GTPase (29Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 schematically represents the effects of CTP, GTP, ITP, UTP, and ATP at a concentration of 5 mm on calcium binding of the membranous and solubilized Ca2+-ATPase molecules at pH 7.40 that were observed in this work as well as in the first part of this study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The observations show that (i) ATP positively transforms the membranous and solubilized enzyme molecules, resulting in an increase in the calcium affinity of these molecules and/or in an increase (n H ∼ 2) in cooperativity in binding calcium ions; (ii) UTP more positively transforms the membranous molecules, resulting in a large increase (n H ∼ 4) in the cooperativity of the molecules in binding calcium ions; (iii) CTP, GTP, and ITP do not transform the membranous molecules; (iv) the NTPs other than ATP negatively transform the solubilized molecules, resulting in a decrease in the calcium affinity of the molecules; and (v) intermolecular interaction of the molecules in the SR membrane makes the molecules resistant to negative transformation by the NTPs other than ATP. The regulatory effect of ATP on calcium binding of the enzyme molecules was discussed in the first part of the study based on a model of the putative regulatory site of the enzyme molecule (3Tada M. Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 56: 1-79Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5de Meis L. Inesi G. Carafoli E. Membrane Transport of Calcium.

Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1967; 62: 558-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which is distinct from the catalytic site and to which ATP binding accelerates the catalytic reaction of the molecules. It was previously found that the catalytic reaction of the membranous molecules is accelerated by GTP and ITP (9Taylor J.S. Hattan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4402-4407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15de Meis L. de Mello M.C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3691-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Van Winkle W.B. Tate C. Bick R.J. Entman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2268-2274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not by UTP (17Ferreira S.T. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9973-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the membranous enzyme molecules have a regulatory site for GTP and ITP, but not for UTP. On the other hand, it was observed here that the calcium binding performance (affinity for calcium and cooperativity in binding calcium) of the membranous molecules was increased by UTP (Fig. 3), but not by GTP (Fig. 1) and CTP and ITP (data not shown), and that all of these NTPs degraded the calcium affinity of the solubilized molecules (Fig. 6). It is therefore difficult to discuss the effect of the NTPs on calcium binding based simply on a model of the putative regulatory site. However, the earlier and present data on substrate regulation raise the following questions. (i) Can these NTPs drive the ATPase molecules to pump down the calcium level outside the SR vesicles to the same extent? Based on the calcium affinities of the enzyme molecules in the presence of the NTPs, ATP and UTP might be substantially more efficient in lowing the calcium concentration than CTP, ITP, and GTP. On the other hand, UTP does not accelerate the overall catalytic reaction and may not be able to rapidly establish a calcium gradient across the SR membrane or to maintain it as well as ATP, GTP, and ITP, which can accelerate the reaction. (ii) Are the intermolecular interactions of the enzyme molecules related to the calcium transport activity of the molecules? UTP promotes these interactions stronger than ATP, as evidenced by higher cooperativity in calcium binding with UTP than with ATP. This difference between ATP and UTP may be related to the difference in phosphorylation levels that are attained with ATP and UTP; ATP is able to phosphorylate only half of the catalytic sites of the enzyme molecules (17Ferreira S.T. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9973-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), consistent with an alternating-site model (30Froehlich F.P. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

An alternating-site type of behavior of the molecules might be kinetically more active in establishing a calcium gradient than the full-site type of behavior coupled with UTP hydrolysis. (iii) How is NTP regulation of calcium binding related to the ability of the enzyme molecules to oligomerize in the presence of the NTP employed? The absence of regulatory effects of CTP, ITP, and GTP would imply that intermolecular interactions of the molecules do not occur in calcium transport energized by these substrates. The regulatory effect of UTP is lost by solubilization of the molecules with C12E8, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are important for expression of the regulation. In contrast, the regulatory effect of ATP persists even after the solubilization, although intermolecular interactions might occur under these conditions, albeit with less strength, as described in the first part of the study (32Nakamura J. Tajima G. Sato C. Furukohri T. Konishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24180-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These questions provide new points of view for understanding the mechanism of calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W2053166927,"In the equilibrium unfolding process of Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas testosteroni by urea, it was observed that the enzyme stability increases by 2.5 kcal/mol in the presence of 5% trifluoroethanol (TFE). To elucidate the increased enzyme stability by TFE, the backbone dynamics of Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase were studied in the presence and absence of 5% TFE by 15N NMR relaxation measurements, and the motional parameters (S 2, τ e , and R ex) were extracted from the relaxation data using the model-free formalism. The presence of 5% TFE causes little change or a slight increase in the order parameters (S 2) for a number of residues, which are located mainly in the dimer interface region. However, the majority of the residues exhibit reduced order parameters in the presence of 5% TFE, indicating that high frequency (pico- to nanosecond) motions are generally enhanced by TFE. The results suggest that the entropy can be an important factor for the enzyme stability, and the increase in entropy by TFE is partially responsible for the increased stability of Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase."
