https://openalex.org/W4207053865,"Regeneration is the holy grail of tissue repair, but skin injury typically yields fibrotic, non-functional scars. Developing pro-regenerative therapies requires rigorous understanding of the molecular progression from injury to fibrosis or regeneration. Here, we report the divergent molecular events driving skin wound cells toward scarring or regenerative fates. We profile scarring versus YAP-inhibition-induced wound regeneration at the transcriptional (single-cell RNA sequencing), protein (timsTOF proteomics), and tissue (extracellular matrix ultrastructural analysis) levels. Using cell-surface barcoding, we integrate these data to reveal fibrotic and regenerative ""molecular trajectories"" of healing. We show that disrupting YAP mechanotransduction yields regenerative repair by fibroblasts with activated Trps1 and Wnt signaling. Finally, via in vivo gene knockdown and overexpression in wounds, we identify Trps1 as a key regulatory gene that is necessary and partially sufficient for wound regeneration. Our findings serve as a multi-omic map of wound regeneration and could have therapeutic implications for pathologic fibroses."
https://openalex.org/W4207064490,"Medical and health science students are among the frontline health care workers who are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection during their clinical attachments and future career. As health care providers, they are expected to promote and administer the COVID-19 vaccine and counsel vaccine-hesitant patients. It is, therefore, imperative to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical and health science students. Thus, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors among medical and health science students of Wolkite University.An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 420 medical and health science students attending Wolkite University from March 1 to 30, 2021. Simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Self-administered and structured questionnaires were used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.2.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 software package for further analysis. Bivariable and multivariable analysis was used to identify associated factors. P values <0.05 result were considered as a statistically significant association.The level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 41.2% (95% CI; 35.2%-50.4%). Student age ≤23 years were 1.9 times more likely vaccine hesitant [aOR = 1.94, 95% CI; 1.14-3.28], being female were 1.7 times more likely vaccine hesitant [aOR = 1.76, 95% CI; 1.14-2.72], resided in rural area were 1.6 times more likely vaccine hesitant [aOR = 1.63, 95% CI; 1.06-2.49], source of information from social media were 2.7 times more likely vaccine hesitant [aOR = 2.68, 95% CI; 1.58-4.54], and good practice to COVID-19 mitigation measures were 47% less likely vaccine hesitant [aOR = 0.53, 95% CI; 0.34-0.83] compared to their counterpart.COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is found to be high. Therefore, students are advised to receive COVID-19 vaccine information from government lead mass media (i.e. television and radio), increase awareness and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4210354992,"Infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus can vary from asymptomatic, or flu-like with moderate disease, up to critically severe. Severe disease, termed COVID-19, involves acute respiratory deterioration that is frequently fatal. To understand the highly variable presentation, and identify biomarkers for disease severity, blood RNA from COVID-19 patient in an intensive care unit was analyzed by whole transcriptome RNA sequencing. Both SARS-CoV2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 syndrome were associated with up to 25-fold increased expression of neutrophil-related transcripts, such as neutrophil defensin 1 (DEFA1), and 3-5-fold reductions in T cell related transcripts such as the T cell receptor (TCR). The DEFA1 RNA level detected SARS-CoV2 viremia with 95.5% sensitivity, when viremia was measured by ddPCR of whole blood RNA. Purified CD15+ neutrophils from COVID-19 patients were increased in abundance and showed striking increases in nuclear DNA staining by DAPI. Concurrently, they showed >10-fold higher elastase activity than normal controls, and correcting for their increased abundance, still showed 5-fold higher elastase activity per cell. Despite higher CD15+ neutrophil elastase activity, elastase activity was extremely low in plasma from the same patients. Collectively, the data supports the model that increased neutrophil and decreased T cell activity is associated with increased COVID-19 severity, and suggests that blood DEFA1 RNA levels and neutrophil elastase activity, both involved in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), may be informative biomarkers of host immune activity after viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W4207019329,"Carbapenems are the last resort antimicrobials for the treatment of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Emergence of carbapenems resistant group B2 uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is a major concern because of their high virulence. Prevalence of these enzymes and multidrug resistance (MDR) among B2 UPEC isolates from Iraqi outpatients with acute urinary tract infection (UTI) was evaluated in this research. Urine cultures were performed and the isolates were identified biochemically. Escherichia coli isolates were tested for phylogroup reference by quadraplex PCR, then B2 isolates were detected for antimicrobial resistance by disc diffusion test and carbapenemase genes by PCR. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent among Gram-negative isolates (66.6%) and B2 was the most detected phylogroup among E. coli isolates (33.9%). Most of B2 isolates showed high resistance rates to tested antimicrobials, especially β-lactams with MDR revealed in 100% of them. Whereas, low resistance rates were noted against carbapenems, aminoglycosides and nitrofurantoin. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 76.3% of B2 isolates. Of which, blaOXA-48 was the most frequent (57.8%), followed by blaPER (47.3%), blaKPC (15.7%), blaVEB and blaVIM (10.5%, for each). Whereas, blaGES and blaIMP genes were not found. Coproduction of these genes occurred among 17 isolates. The combination of blaOXA-48 and blaPER was the most frequent (41.1%). All carbapenemase producing isolates were MDR. These results revealed high prevalence of carbapenemase genes and MDR among B2 UPEC recovered in this study. In the study area. it is strongly advised to use aminoglycosides and nitrofurantoin for empirical treatment of UPEC."
https://openalex.org/W4206911355,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and is a threat to global health. Patients who experienced cytokine storms tend to have a high mortality rate. However, to date, no study has investigated the impact of cytokine storms.This retrospective cohort study included only COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in a Private Hospital in West Jakarta between March and September 2020. All patients were not vaccinated during this period and treatment was based on the guidelines by the Ministry of Health Indonesia. A convenience sampling method was used and all patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled.The clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients following medical therapy was either cured (85.7%) or died (14.3%), with 14.3% patients reported to have cytokine storm, from which 23.1% led to fatalities. A plasma immunoglobulin (Gammaraas®) and/or tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor antagonist; Actemra®) injection was utilised to treat the cytokine storm while remdesivir and oseltamivir were administered to ameliorate COVID-19. Most (61.5%) patients who experienced the cytokine storm were male; mean age 60 years. Interestingly, all patients who experienced the cytokine storm had hypertension or/ and diabetes complication (100%). Fever, cough and shortness of breath were also the common symptoms (100.0%). Almost all (92.3%) patients with cytokine storm had to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most (76.9%) patients who had cytokine storm received hydroxychloroquine and all had antibiotics [1) azithromycin + levofloxacin or 2) meropenam for critically ill patients] and vitamins such as vitamins C and B-complex as well as mineral. Unfortunately, from this group, 23.1% patients died while the remaining 70% of patients recovered. A significant (p<0.05) correlation was established between cytokine storms and age, the presence of comorbidity, diabetes, hypertension, fever, shortness of breath, having oxygen saturation (SPO2) less than 93%, cold, fatigue, ward of admission, the severity of COVID-19 disease, duration of treatment as well as the use of remdesivir, Actemra® and Gammaraas®. Most patients recovered after receiving a combination treatment (oseltamivir + remdesivir + Antibiotics + Vitamin/Mineral) for approximately 11 days with a 90% survival rate. On the contrary, patients who received oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + Gammaraas® + antibiotics +Vitamin/Mineral, had a 83% survival rate after being admitted to the hospital for about ten days.Factors influencing the development of a cytokine storm include age, duration of treatment, comorbidity, symptoms, type of admission ward and severity of infection. Most patients (76.92%) with cytokine storm who received Gammaraas®/Actemra®, survived although they were in the severe and critical levels (87.17%). Overall, based on the treatment duration and survival rate, the most effective therapy was a combination of oseltamivir + favipiravir + hydroxychloroquine + antibiotics + vitamins/minerals."
https://openalex.org/W4207035521,"The majority of musculoskeletal modelling studies investigating healthy populations use generic models linearly scaled to roughly match an individual's anthropometry. Generic models disregard the considerable variation in musculoskeletal geometry and tissue properties between individuals. This study investigated the physiological implications of personalizing musculoskeletal model geometry (body segment mass, inertia, joint center, and maximum isometric muscle force). Nine healthy athletes performed ten repetitions of 15 meter sprints at 75-95% of their maximum sprinting speed and ten repetitions of unanticipated sidestep cut trials with a 4.5-5.5 m/s approach running speed. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was collected on the lower extremities, from which subject-specific musculoskeletal models were developed. A one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping paired t-test was used to compare generic and subject-specific musculoskeletal models for: lower-limb kinematics, kinetics, torque matching, as well as hamstrings, adductors, and quadriceps muscle activations and fiber dynamics. Percentage change of geometric parameters between generic and subject-specific models were determined. Compared to generic models, subject-specific models showed significantly lower ankle dorsi/plantar flexion angle during sprinting and several significantly different net joint moments during sprint and cut tasks. Additionally, subject-specific models demonstrated better torque matching, more physiologically plausible fiber lengths, higher fiber velocities, lower muscle forces, and lower simulated activations in a subset of investigated muscles and motor tasks. Furthermore, subject-specific models identified between-limb differences that were not identified with generic models. Use of subject-specific modeling, even in healthy populations, may result in more physiologically plausible muscle fiber mechanics. Implementing subject-specific models may be especially beneficial when investigating populations with substantial geometric between-limb differences, or unilateral musculoskeletal pathologies, as these are not captured by a generic model."
https://openalex.org/W4207052310,"Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a promising candidate for nanomedicine delivery due to their bioactive cargos, high biocompatibility to human cells, biodegradability, low cytotoxicity, and potential for large-scale production. However, the research on EVs derived from medicinal plants is very limited. In this study, Kaempferia parviflora extracellular vesicles (KPEVs) were isolated by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and their size, morphology, and surface charge were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The biological properties of KPEVs, including their bioactive compound composition, gastric uptake, cytotoxicity, acid tolerance, and storage stability, were also examined. In addition, KPEVs had an average and uniform size of 200-300 nm and a negative surface charge of 14.7 ± 3.61 mV. Moreover, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, the major bioactive compound of KP, was packaged into KPEVs. Meanwhile, KPEVs were resistant to gastric digestion and stably maintained at -20°C and -80°C for 8 weeks with no freeze-thaw cycle. The lipid hydrolysis during EVs storage at room temperature and 4°C were also demonstrated for the first time. Furthermore, the labeled KPEVs were internalized into adenocarcinoma gastric cells, and the cell viability was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, according to the results of the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium assay. Our study supports the potential application of KPEVs as a vehicle for anticancer or oral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4207068574,"The combination of blockchain and the sports industry is bound to be a trend in terms of innovation and the development of sports industry in the near future. Therefore, after analyzing the problems existing in the current business model of the sports industry, this paper takes 200 innovation indicators of 50 listed companies in the sports industry, among which 15 use blockchain and 35 do not use, as research samples and uses a three-stage DEA model to calculate their innovation efficiency. The results show that sports companies that use blockchain have better performance in terms of innovation efficiency than do those that do not, which illustrates the necessity of blockchain-based business model innovation. Then, by focusing on the internal structure and the case of the ""vSport blockchain"", this work shows that this business model innovation is feasible. The article first proposes a blockchain-based sports industry business model and then uses a combination of empirical and case studies to prove the necessity and feasibility of sports industry business model innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4206959358,"The health benefits of physical activity (PA) participation in later life are widely recognised. Understanding factors that can influence the participation of community-dwelling older adults in PA is crucial in an ageing society. This will be paramount in aiding the design of future interventions to effectively promote PA in this population. The main aim of this qualitative study was to explore influences on PA among community-dwelling older people, and the secondary aim was to explore gender differences.Qualitative data were collected in 2014 by conducting focus group discussions using a semi-structured discussion guide with older people resident in Hertfordshire, UK. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically.Ninety-two participants were recruited to the study (47% women; 74-83 years) and a total of 11 focus groups were conducted. Findings indicated six themes that appeared to affect older adults' participation in PA: past life experiences; significant life events; getting older; PA environment; psychological/personal factors; and social capital. Overall, the findings emphasised the role of modifiable factors, namely psychological factors (such as self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy) and social factors (such as social support and social engagement). These factors exerted their own influence on physical activity participation, but also appeared to mediate the effect of other largely non-modifiable background and ageing-related factors on participants' engagement with PA in later life.In view of these findings, intervention designers could usefully work with behavioural scientists for insight as to how to enhance psychological and social factors in older adults. Our data suggest that interventions that aim to build self-efficacy, motivation and social networks have the potential to indirectly promote PA participation in older adults. This would be best achieved by developing physical activity interventions through working with participants in an empowering and engaging way."
https://openalex.org/W4206919109,"In many countries a second wave of infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has occurred, triggering a shortage of reagents needed for diagnosis and compromising the capacity of laboratory testing. There is an urgent need to develop methods to accelerate the diagnostic procedures. Pooling samples represents a strategy to overcome the shortage of reagents, since several samples can be tested using one reaction, significantly increasing the number and speed with which tests can be carried out. We have reported the feasibility to use a direct lysis procedure of saliva as source for RNA to SARS-CoV-2 genome detection by reverse transcription quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR). Here, we show that the direct lysis of saliva pools, of either five or ten samples, does not compromise the detection of viral RNA. In addition, it is a sensitive, fast, and inexpensive method that can be used for massive screening, especially considering the proximity of the reincorporation of activities in universities, offices, and schools."
https://openalex.org/W4207082181,"The assessment of mal-adaptive anxiety is crucial, considering the associated personal, economic, and societal burden. The State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA) is a self-report instrument developed to provide multidimensional anxiety assessment in four dimensions: trait-cognitive, trait-somatic, state-cognitive and state-somatic. This research aimed to extend STICSA's psychometric studies through the assessment of its dimensionality, reliability, measurement invariance and nomological validity in the Portuguese population. Additionally, the predictive validity of STICSA-Trait was also evaluated, through the analysis of the relationship between self-reported trait anxiety and both the subjective and the psychophysiological response across distinct emotional situations. Similarly to previous studies, results supported both a four-factor and two separated bi-factor structures. Measurement invariance across sex groups was also supported, and good nomological validity was observed. Moreover, STICSA trait-cognitive dimension was associated with differences in self-reported arousal between groups of high/low anxiety, whereas STICSA trait-somatic dimension was related to differences in both the subjective and psychophysiological response. Together, these results support STICSA as a useful instrument for a broader anxiety assessment, crucial for an informed diagnosis and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3135302781,"Advancing the utility of social media data for research applications requires methods for automatically detecting demographic information about social media study populations, including users' age. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a method that automatically identifies the exact age of users based on self-reports in their tweets. Our end-to-end automatic natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, ReportAGE, includes query patterns to retrieve tweets that potentially mention an age, a classifier to distinguish retrieved tweets that self-report the user's exact age (""age"" tweets) and those that do not (""no age"" tweets), and rule-based extraction to identify the age. To develop and evaluate ReportAGE, we manually annotated 11,000 tweets that matched the query patterns. Based on 1000 tweets that were annotated by all five annotators, inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) was 0.80 for distinguishing ""age"" and ""no age"" tweets, and 0.95 for identifying the exact age among the ""age"" tweets on which the annotators agreed. A deep neural network classifier, based on a RoBERTa-Large pretrained transformer model, achieved the highest F1-score of 0.914 (precision = 0.905, recall = 0.942) for the ""age"" class. When the age extraction was evaluated using the classifier's predictions, it achieved an F1-score of 0.855 (precision = 0.805, recall = 0.914) for the ""age"" class. When it was evaluated directly on the held-out test set, it achieved an F1-score of 0.931 (precision = 0.873, recall = 0.998) for the ""age"" class. We deployed ReportAGE on a collection of more than 1.2 billion tweets, posted by 245,927 users, and predicted ages for 132,637 (54%) of them. Scaling the detection of exact age to this large number of users can advance the utility of social media data for research applications that do not align with the predefined age groupings of extant binary or multi-class classification approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4206931642,"Long-term athletic development practices have been recommended for the past two decades. However, limited research exists exploring the knowledge and skills required by practitioners to optimise long-term athletic development. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, adherence, practices, and challenges of practitioners responsible for delivering long-term athletic development. A mixed methods survey was completed by 236 practitioners (e.g., sport coaches, physical education teachers) consisting of four parts; 1) demographics, 2) knowledge, 3) adherence, and 4) practices and challenges. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed by Friedman’s analysis of variance and thematic analyses, respectively. Quantitative findings showed practitioners 1) recognised their responsibility for delivering long-term athletic development, 2) have a familiarity with existing developmental models, and 3) had high adherence, focused upon health and wellbeing, to delivering long-term athletic development. However, practices associated with growth and maturity, monitoring and assessment, and the systematic progression and individualisation of training had lower adherence. Qualitative analysis indicated that practitioner’s perceived definitions of athleticism and long-term athletic development were inconsistent, especially according to the psychological components (i.e., confidence). Practitioners’ descriptions of their long-term athletic development practices identified two higher order themes; 1) goals, in which long-term athletic development “is for life” and the importance of “an individual centered journey” highlighted as sub-themes; and 2) realities of delivering long-term athletic development, whereby variety in programme delivery, monitoring development and practical challenges were noted as key priorities. Eight practical challenges were identified including governance and priorities, resources, education, early specialization, high training volumes, staff communication, parents and youth motivation. This mixed method survey highlighted a multitude of knowledge, adherence, practices and challenges towards long-term athletic development. These novel findings can help inform policy to optimise long-term athletic development and to support the complex problem of developing a healthier, fitter and more physically active youth population."
https://openalex.org/W4207026160,"The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 has led to several studies on the transmission of the virus. A little studied potential fomite of great concern in the community is currency, which has been shown to harbor microbial pathogens in several studies. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the United States have limited the use of banknotes in favor of credit cards. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown greater stability on plastic in several studies. Herein, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature on banknotes, money cards and coins was investigated. In vitro studies with live virus suggested SARS-CoV-2 was highly unstable on banknotes, showing an initial rapid reduction in viable virus and no viral detection by 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 displayed increased stability on money cards with live virus detected after 48 hours. Environmental swabbing of currency and money cards on and near the campus of Brigham Young University supported these results, with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on banknotes, and a low level on money cards. However, no viable virus was detected on either. These preliminary results suggest that the use of money cards over banknotes in order to slow the spread of this virus may be ill-advised. These findings should be investigated further through larger environmental studies involving more locations."
https://openalex.org/W4207062904,"In cancer patients, appropriate diagnosis and management of infection are frequently challenging owing to subtle or atypical presentation. We investigated the effectiveness of infectious disease (ID) consultations and the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) in a Japanese cancer center. This 36-month-period, single-institution, interrupted time series analysis was retrospectively conducted during April 1, 2018–March 31, 2021, to evaluate a two-phase intervention: Phase 1 (notification of antimicrobials by the infection control team) and Phase 2 (establishing an ID consultation service and implementing ASP). Among 32,202 patients hospitalized, 22,096 and 10,106 hospitalizations occurred at baseline and during intervention period, respectively. The Antimicrobial Stewardship Team (AST) provided feedback on specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials in 913 instances (347 appropriate [38%]; 566 inappropriate [62%]), and 440 ID consultations were completed, with a 75% overall acceptance rate for AST suggestions. In Phase 2, monthly carbapenem days of therapy (CAR-DOT) decreased significantly, and narrow-spectrum antibiotic usage increased significantly in both trend and level; monthly DOT of antipseudomonal agents decreased significantly in trend. The results of these analyses of antimicrobial use are consistent with the DOT-based data based on antimicrobial use density (AUD). The total number of inpatient specimens increased significantly; the trend of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections decreased, without changes in the incidence of other resistant organisms, all-cause in-hospital mortality, and length of stay. Actual and adjusted CAR purchase costs per patient-day decreased without significant changes in the actual and adjusted purchase cost per patient-day for all intravenous antimicrobials. Combining ID consultation and ASP reduced carbapenem use without negative patient outcomes. Their implementation could facilitate establishment of safe cancer treatment facilities in Japan and improve prognosis in cancer patients."

The mean and standard deviation of the bone thickness on the lingual side of the mandibular third molar in the apical region was 1.5 ± 1.6 mm, and the absence of lingual cortical bone in the apical region, namely, ""perforation"", was observed in 44 patients. The statistical analysis revealed the predictors of cases with perforation as follows: gender, age, and the available space evaluated by Pell and Gregory classification.This study clarified that ""perforation"" was sometimes observed in young Japanese, and that the predictors of those cases were as follows: gender, age, and the available space evaluated by Pell and Gregory classification."
https://openalex.org/W4206987764,"Migratory strategies dictate stopover ecology, particularly concerning decisions of when, where and how long to stop, and what to do at stationary periods. In birds, individuals stop primarily to replenish energy stores, although the functions of stopover events vary among and within species, particularly between pre- and post-breeding seasons. Here, we combined plasma metabolite levels and haematological parameters to compare refuelling rates and physiological state within (early, mid, late) and between (spring, autumn) migratory periods, aiming to identify potentially different migratory strategies in a shorebird, the dunlin Calidris alpina , using a key stopover site in Iberia. Plasma triglycerides and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations did not differ between seasons, and small differences were found in haematological profiles (higher haemoglobin and hematocrit levels in spring). Similar refuelling rates and physiological status suggests a single migratory strategy in spring and autumn. During both seasons, dunlins arrive at the Tagus estuary with medium-to-high fuel loads, indicating they do not engage in prolonged fuelling. This agrees with a skipping migratory strategy, where birds fly short-to-medium distances while fuelling at moderate rates along a network of sites. Although we may expect late spring migrants to experience stronger pressures to optimally schedule migratory events, we found no significant differences in physiological profiles among early, mid and late migrants. Unexpectedly, such differences were found in autumn: early birds showed the highest triglycerides and haemoglobin levels and lowest β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. These results denote enhanced refuelling rates and blood oxygen-carrying capacity in early autumn migrants, which is typical of jumpers, i.e., birds travelling with larger fuel loads and performing fewer stops. Our study adds substantially to previous knowledge of stopover ecology in migratory shorebirds in the East Atlantic Flyway. Importantly, it indicates that the Tagus estuary is a high-quality stopover site for intermediate fuelling. Yet, understanding non-fuelling stopping functions is needed to ultimately inform conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W4206996454,"Distracted driving behavior is one of the main factors of road accidents. Accurately predicting the risk of driving behavior is of great significance to the active safety of road transportation. The large amount of information collected by the sensors installed on the vehicle can be identified by the algorithm to obtain the distracted driving behavior data, which can be used to predict the driving behavior risk of the vehicle and the area. In this paper, a new neural network named Driving Behavior Risk Prediction Neural Network (DBRPNN) is developed for prediction based on the distracted driving behavior data. The network consists of three modules: the Feature Processing Module, the Memory Module, and the Prediction Module. In this process, attribute data (time in a day, daily driving time, and daily driving mileage) that can reflect external factors and driver statuses, are added to the network to increase the accuracy of the model. We predicted the driving behavior risk of different objects (Vehicle and Area). For the applicability improvement of the model, we further classify the distracted driving behavior categories, and DBRPNN can provide more accurate risk prediction. The results show that compared with traditional models (Classification and Regression Tree, Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory), DBRPNN has better prediction performance. The method proposed in this paper has been fully verified and may be transplanted into active safety early warning system for more accurate and flexible application."

We investigated whether Schistosoma and geohelminth infections are associated with β-cell function and insulin resistance among adults.A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults during 2016-2017. Demography, Schistosoma and geohelminth infections, HIV and insulin data were collected. Insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test (fasting, 30, and 120-min), overall insulin secretion index, insulinogenic index, HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR were main outcome measures for β-cell function and insulin resistance, respectively. Generalized estimating equations and generalized linear models assessed the association of Schistosoma and geohelminth infections with outcome measures separately by HIV status. Outcomes were presented as marginal means with 95% CI.Data were obtained for 1718 participants. Schistosoma infection was associated with higher 30-min insulin (24.2 mU/L, 95% CI: 6.9, 41.6) and overall insulin secretion index (13.3 pmol/L/mmol/L; 3.7, 22.9) among HIV-uninfected participants but with lower fasting insulin (-0.9 mU/L; -1.6, -0.2), 120-min insulin (-12.0 mU/L; -18.9, -5.1), and HOMA-IR (-0.3 mmol/L; -0.6, -0.05) among HIV-infected participants not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among HIV-infected participants not on ART, geohelminth infection was associated with lower fasting insulin (-0.9 mU/L; -1.6, -0.2), 120-min insulin (-9.1 mU/L; -17.3, -1.0), HOMA-β (-8.9 mU/L)/(mmol/L; -15.3, -2.6) and overall insulin release index (-5.1 pmol/L/mmol/L; -10.3, 0.02), although this was marginally significant. There was no association among those on ART.Schistosoma infection was associated with higher β-cell function among HIV-uninfected participants whereas Schistosoma and geohelminth infections were associated with reduced β-cell function among HIV-infected participants not on ART."
https://openalex.org/W4206941399,"Hibernating bears remain in their dens for 5-7 months during winter and survive without eating or drinking while staying inactive. However, they maintain their physical functions with minimal skeletal muscle atrophy and metabolic dysfunction. In bears, resistance to skeletal muscle atrophy during hibernation is likely mediated by seasonally altered systemic factors that are independent of neuromuscular activity. To determine whether there are components in bear serum that regulate protein and energy metabolism, differentiated human skeletal muscle cells were treated with bear serum (5% in DMEM/Ham's F-12, 24 h) collected during active summer (July) and hibernating winter (February) periods. The serum samples were collected from the same individual bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus, n = 7 in each season). Total protein content in cultured skeletal muscle cells was significantly increased following a 24 h treatment with hibernating bear serum. Although the protein synthesis rate was not altered, the expression of MuRF1 protein, a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase was significantly decreased along with a concomitant activation of Akt/FOXO3a signaling. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were also observed in hibernating bear serum. These observations suggest that protein metabolism in cultured human myotubes may be altered when incubated with hibernating bear serum, with a significant increase in serum IGF-1 and diminished MuRF1 expression, a potential target of Akt/FOXO3a signaling. A protein sparing phenotype in cultured muscle cells by treatment with hibernating bear serum holds potential for the development of methods to prevent human muscle atrophy and related disorders."

Through the development of a high-throughput exoproteome screening assay (HESA), genes involved in MH96 exoprotein production were identified. Of 4,080 screened transposon mutants, 34 mutants exhibited a decreased exoprotein release, and one mutation located in the intergenic region of the Yen-Tc operon displayed an elevated exoprotein release relative to the wild-type strain MH96. DNA sequencing revealed several transposon insertions clustered in gene regions associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPSI and LPSII), and N-acyl-homoserine lactone synthesis (quorum sensing). Twelve transposon insertions were located within transcriptional regulators or intergenic regions. The HESA will have broad applicability for identifying genes associated with exoproteome production in a range of microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W4206951743,"Climate change affects many aspects of the physiological and biochemical processes of growing maize and ultimately its yield. A comprehensive climate suitability model is proposed that quantifies the effects of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind in different phenological stages of maize. It is calibrated using weather and yield data from China's Henan Province. The comprehensive suitability model showed the capability of correctly hindcasting observed temporal and spatial changes in maize phenology in response to climatic factors. The predicted yield based on the suitability model can well match the recorded field yield very well from 1971-2020. The results of correlation showed that the yields are more closely related to multi-weather factors, temperature and precipitation than to solar radiation and wind. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that temperature and precipitation are the dominant weather factors affecting yield changes based on a direct differentiation method. The comprehensive suitability model can provide a scientific support and analysis tool for predicting grain production considering climate changes."
https://openalex.org/W4206961947,"Background A growing body of evidence demonstrating that individuals with Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) are more likely to have severe forms of COVID-19 and subsequent mortality. Hence, our study aimed to assess the knowledge of vulnerability and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among patients with hypertension or diabetes in Southern Ethiopia. Objective To assess the knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus in three zones of Southern Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was used with a multi-stage random sampling technique to select 682 patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus from 10 th -17 th July 2020 at the three zones of Southern Ethiopia. Logistic regression analysis with a 95% confidence interval was fitted to identify independent predictors of knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to determine the magnitude of the association between the outcome and independent variables. P-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results The Multi-dimensional knowledge (MDK) analysis of COVID-19 revealed that 63% of study subjects had good knowledge about COVID-19. The overall preventive practice towards COVID -19 was 26.4%. Monthly income (AOR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.94) significantly predicted knowledge towards COVID-19. Ninety-five percent of the study subjects knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected individuals. One hundred and ten (16.2%) of study subjects correctly responded to the questions that state whether people with the COVID-19 virus who do not have a fever can infect the other. Knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.1) became the independent predictor of preventive practice. Conclusions In this study, the knowledge of the respondents towards the COVID-19 pandemic was good. But the preventive practice was very low. There was a significant gap between knowledge and preventive practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the study subjects. Monthly income was significantly associated with knowledge of COVID-19. Knowledge of COVID-19 was found to be an independent predictor of preventive practice towards COVID-19. Community mobilization and improving COVID-19- related knowledge and practice are urgently recommended for those patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W4206989108,"Virtual reality (VR) has become a common tool and is often considered for sport-specific purposes. Despite the increased usage, the transfer of VR-adapted skills into the real-world (RW) has not yet been sufficiently studied, and it is still unknown how much of the own body must be visible to complete motoric tasks within VR. In addition, it should be clarified whether older adults also need to perceive their body within VR scenarios to the same extent as younger people extending the usability. Therefore, younger (18–30 years old) and elderly adults (55 years and older) were tested (n = 42) performing a balance-, grasping- and throwing task in VR (HMD based) accompanied with different body visualization types in VR and in the RW having the regular visual input of body’s components. Comparing the performances between the age groups, the time for completion, the number of steps (balance task), the subjective estimation of difficulty, the number of errors, and a rating system revealing movements’ quality were considered as examined parameters. A one-way ANOVA/Friedmann with repeated measurements with factor [body visualization] was conducted to test the influence of varying body visualizations during task completion. Comparisons between the conditions [RW, VR] were performed using the t-Tests/Wilcoxon tests, and to compare both age groups [young, old], t-Tests for independent samples/Mann-Whitney-U-Test were used. The analyses of the effect of body visualization on performances showed a significant loss in movement’s quality when no body part was visualized (p &lt; .05). This did not occur for the elderly adults, for which no influence of the body visualization on their performance could be proven. Comparing both age groups, the elderly adults performed significantly worse than the young age group in both conditions (p &lt; .05). In VR, both groups showed longer times for completion, a higher rating of tasks’ difficulty in the balance and throwing task, and less performance quality in the grasping task. Overall, the results suggest using VR for the elderly with caution to the task demands, and the visualization of the body seemed less crucial for generating task completion. In summary, the actual task demands in VR could be successfully performed by elderly adults, even once one has to reckon with losses within movement’s quality. Although more different movements should be tested, basic elements are also realizable for elderly adults expanding possible areas of VR applications."

Inclusion criteria: hospital discharge records for adults age > 17 years old, with a diagnosis of ARDS on index admission, with associated procedure codes for endotracheal intubation and/or invasive mechanical ventilation, who were discharged alive. Primary exposure is adult hospitalization for meeting criteria as described. The primary outcome measure is 30-day readmission rate, as well as patient characteristics and time distribution of readmissions.Nationally, 25,170 admissions meeting criteria were identified. Index admission mortality rate was 37.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.2-38.8). 15,730 records of those surviving hospitalization had complete discharge information. 30-day readmission rate was 18.4%, with 14% of total readmissions occurring within 2 calendar days of discharge; these early readmissions had higher mortality risk (odds ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-6.56) compared with readmission in subsequent days. For the closest all-cause readmission within 30 days, the mean cost was $26,971, with a total national cost of over $75.6 million.Thirty-day readmission occurred in 18.4% of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in this sample, and early readmission is strongly associated with increased mortality compared to late readmission. Further research is needed to clarify whether the rehospitalizations or associated mortalities are preventable."
https://openalex.org/W4207027297,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may severely impair pulmonary function and cause hypoxia. However, the association of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT with impaired ventilation remains unexplained. This pilot study aims to demonstrate the relationship between the radiological findings on COVID-19 CT images and ventilation abnormalities simulated in a computational model linked to the patients' symptoms.Twenty-five patients with COVID-19 and four test-negative healthy controls who underwent a baseline non-enhanced CT scan: 7 dyspneic patients, 9 symptomatic patients without dyspnea, and 9 asymptomatic patients were included. A 2D U-Net-based CT segmentation software was used to quantify radiological futures of COVID-19 pneumonia. The CT image-based full-scale airway network (FAN) flow model was employed to assess regional lung ventilation. Functional and radiological features were compared across groups and correlated with the clinical symptoms. Heterogeneity in ventilation distribution and ventilation defects associated with the pneumonia and the patients' symptoms were assessed.Median percentage ventilation defects were 0.2% for healthy controls, 0.7% for asymptomatic patients, 1.2% for symptomatic patients without dyspnea, and 11.3% for dyspneic patients. The median of percentage pneumonia was 13.2% for dyspneic patients and 0% for the other groups. Ventilation defects preferentially affected the posterior lung and worsened with increasing pneumonia linearly (y = 0.91x + 0.99, R2 = 0.73) except for one of the nine dyspneic patients who had disproportionally large ventilation defects (7.8% of the entire lung) despite mild pneumonia (1.2%). The symptomatic and dyspneic patients showed significantly right-skewed ventilation distributions (symptomatic without dyspnea: 0.86 ± 0.61, dyspnea 0.91 ± 0.79) compared to the patients without symptom (0.45 ± 0.35). The ventilation defect analysis with the FAN model provided a comparable diagnostic accuracy to the percentage pneumonia in identifying dyspneic patients (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94 versus 0.96).COVID-19 pneumonia segmentations from CT scans are accompanied by impaired pulmonary ventilation preferentially in dyspneic patients. Ventilation analysis with CT image-based computational modelling shows it is able to assess functional impairment in COVID-19 and potentially identify one of the aetiologies of hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4207071420,"Background Job satisfaction refers to a person’s attitude toward his/her job and its various aspects. Job satisfaction improves the quality of service and employees’ physical and mental health. The present study aimed to design a valid and reliable instrument to assess Iranian midwives job satisfaction instrument (MJSI). Methods This is a sequential exploratory study for tool design. This study in two phases; (qualitative and tool’s psychometric evaluation) was conducted in Ilam, Iran, 2019 years. In the first phase, a qualitative content analysis was carried out by in-depth and semi-structured individual interviews with 10 experts. Then, the pool of items extracted from the qualitative phase was completed by reviewing the existing texts and tools. The second phase of the study involved reducing the overlapping items and validating the tool. In order to investigate the construct validity, a cross sectional study was conducted with the participation of 121 midwives with census sampling. Data analysis was performed by SPSS-19 software using exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests (Cronbach’s alpha). Results In the qualitative phase and after reviewing the existing texts and tools by the research team, a 58-item questionnaire was developed and then entered into the psychometric phase. Then, the tool was finalized with five factors, including: 1) communication features, 2) professional features, 3) responsibility aspects, 4) physical-mental aspects and 5) social aspects, respectively. After the psychometric process, by removing the items in different stages, a specific questionnaire was developed to measure the midwives’ job satisfaction with 25 items which explained a total of 49.95% of the total variance. Reliability of the tool was approved by Cronbach’s alpha = 0.71 and test-retest with 2-weeks intervals, indicating an appropriate stability for the scale (ICC = 0.898). Conclusion The 25-item self-reporting midwives job satisfaction tool had acceptable validity and reliability. We recommend the use of this tool for evaluating the job satisfaction of midwives, as well as management and research purposes."

However, anthracnose is a great challenge to the OLA cultivation in South Korea. Colletotrichum spp. is a major group of plant pathogens responsible for anthracnose on a range of economically important hosts. Its occurrence on OLA remains unresolved. To investigate the diversity, morphology, phylogeny, and biology of Colletotrichum spp., 32 fungal isolates were obtained from 30 OLA-affected leaves collected from five different farms, in two regions in South Korea, Mungyeong and Sangju. The phylogenetic analysis with four or five gene loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, GAPDH, and CHS-1) along with morphology of 26 representative isolates delineated six previously known Colletotrichum species including C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s), C. cigarro, C. plurivorum, C. siamense and C. sojae, and one new species, described here as C. ovataense. Amongst these species, C. gloeosporioides s.s. and C. plurivorum were the most prevalent species. A pathogenicity test on the detached leaves revealed that different Colletotrichum species presented a distinct degree of virulence, confirming Koch's postulates. In this study, C. fructicola, C. cigarro, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and C. sojae were reported from A. ovata for the first time, as the causal agent of ovate-leaf atractylodes anthracnose. Understanding the diversity and biology of the Colletotrichum species population will help in managing this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210703388,"Vegetation species succession and composition are significant factors determining the rate of ecosystem biodiversity recovery after being disturbed and subsequently vital for sustainable and effective natural resource management and biodiversity. The succession and composition of grasslands ecosystems worldwide have significantly been affected by accelerated environmental changes due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, understanding spatial data on the succession of grassland vegetation species and communities through mapping and monitoring is essential to gain knowledge on the ecosystem and other ecosystem services. This study used a random forest machine learning classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform to classify grass vegetation species with Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER multispectral imager (MI) data resampled with the current Sentinel-2 MSI data to map and estimate the changes in vegetation species succession. The results indicate that ASTER MI has the least accuracy of 72%, Landsat 7 ETM+ 84%, and Sentinel-2 had the highest of 87%. The result also shows that other species had replaced four dominant grass species totaling about 49 km 2 throughout the study."
https://openalex.org/W3126873853,"Emotions at work have long been identified as critical signals of work motivations, status, and attitudes, and as predictors of various work-related outcomes. When more and more employees work remotely, these emotional signals of workers become harder to observe through daily, face-to-face communications. The use of online platforms to communicate and collaborate at work provides an alternative channel to monitor the emotions of workers. This paper studies how emojis, as non-verbal cues in online communications, can be used for such purposes and how the emotional signals in emoji usage can be used to predict future behavior of workers. In particular, we present how the developers on GitHub use emojis in their work-related activities. We show that developers have diverse patterns of emoji usage, which can be related to their working status including activity levels, types of work, types of communications, time management, and other behavioral patterns. Developers who use emojis in their posts are significantly less likely to dropout from the online work platform. Surprisingly, solely using emoji usage as features, standard machine learning models can predict future dropouts of developers at a satisfactory accuracy. Features related to the general use and the emotions of emojis appear to be important factors, while they do not rule out paths through other purposes of emoji use."
https://openalex.org/W4206907169,"Objective Human gait requires complex somatosensory processing of various inputs such as proprioception. Proprioception can be altered in the presence of pain. This has been shown mostly during controlled tasks, thereby limiting the influence of external perturbations. While controlling the environment is sometimes warranted, it limits the ecological validity of the data. Using robotic orthoses to apply perturbations during movements seems a promising tool to functionally assess proprioception, where the complex somatosensory processing required in real-life situations is at play. The main objective of this study was to compare the proprioceptive threshold of healthy participants during gait in the presence and absence of an acute experimental pain. Methods 36 healthy participants walked on a treadmill while wearing a robotized ankle–foot orthosis (rAFO) around their right ankle. The rAFO applied torque perturbations of graded magnitudes during the swing phase of gait. Participants had to report the presence/absence of such perturbations, as a measure of proprioceptive threshold. Following initial assessment, they were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: Control (no stimulation), Painless (non-nociceptive stimulation) and Painful (nociceptive stimulation). Electrodes placed on the right lateral malleolus delivered an electrical stimulation during the second assessment for Painless and Painful groups. A Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare the percentage of change of the three groups between the two assessments. Results A 31.80±32.94% increase in proprioceptive threshold, representing an increase of 1.3±1.2 Nm in the detection threshold, was observed for the Painful group only (p&lt;0.005), with an effect size of 1.6. Conclusion Findings show that the presence of pain at the ankle can alter participants’ proprioceptive threshold during gait. Clinical assessment of proprioception should therefore carefully consider the presence of pain when evaluating a patient’s performance using clinical proprioceptive test and consider the negative effect of pain on proprioceptive threshold for test interpretation."

https://openalex.org/W4206960631,"Due to unreasonable pricing, farmers have low enthusiasm for reclaiming their homesteads, which can be used to generate construction land quota. This paper studies how to design a feasible pricing mechanism to stimulate the enthusiasm of farmers. First, we analyze the practice that the local government gives the developers with quota the selection, the right to select the location of the land to be auctioned. Then, applying sequential auction theory, we propose first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auction models and design quota auction pricing mechanisms. Through theoretical and numerical analysis, we obtain the equilibrium strategy and analyze the impact of selection and on developers’ bidding pricing on quota. The results show that the selection can enhance the developer’s quota bidding price and farmers’ income. And the higher the value of selection to the developer, the higher the quota bidding price and farmer’s income. Contrarily, the larger the number of developers, the smaller the quota bidding price and farmers’ income. Finally, the quota bidding price and farmers’ income in the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction are higher than in the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction."

This study investigated growth patterns and evaluated factors associated with suboptimal growth in adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection.This retrospective cohort study included HIV-infected adolescents, aged 13 to 18 years, with at least 5 years of ART follow-up at a large HIV clinic in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. Weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ), height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body mass index (BMI)-for-age Z-scores were calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards. Growth velocity graphs were generated utilising the mean height change calculated at 6-monthly intervals, using all available data after ART initiation, to calculate the annual change. Other collected data included WHO HIV disease staging, CD4%, HIV viral loads (VLs), ART regimens and tuberculosis co-infection.Included were 288 children with a median age of 6.5 years (IQR 4.2;8.6 years) at ART initiation, and 51.7% were male. At baseline the majority of children had severe disease (92% WHO stages 3&4) and were started on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens (79.2%). The median CD4% was 13.5% (IQR 7.9;18.9) and median HIV viral load log 5.0 (IQR 4.4;5.5). Baseline stunting (HAZ <-2) was prevalent (55.9%), with a median HAZ of -2.2 (IQR -3.1;-1.3). The median WAZ was -1.5 (IQR -2.5;-0.8), with 29.2% being underweight-for-age (WAZ <-2). The peak height velocity (PHV) in adolescents with baseline stage 3 disease was higher than for those with stage 4 disease. Being older at ART start (p<0.001) and baseline stunting (p<0.001) were associated with poorer growth, resulting in a lower HAZ at study exit, with boys more significantly affected than girls (p<0.001).Suboptimal growth in adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection is a significant health concern, especially in children who started ART later in terms of age and who had baseline stunting and is more pronounced in boys than in girls."

https://openalex.org/W4207055608,"Most transcription factors possess at least one long intrinsically disordered transactivation domain that binds to a variety of coactivators and corepressors and plays a key role in modulating the transcriptional activity. Despite the crucial importance of these domains, the structural and functional basis of transactivation remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/cAMP response element-binding protein-2, an essential transcription factor for cellular stress adaptation. Bioinformatic sequence analysis of the ATF4 transactivation domain sequence revealed that the first 125 amino acids have noticeably less propensity for structural disorder than the rest of the domain. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complemented by a range of biophysical methods, we found that the isolated transactivation domain is predominantly yet not fully disordered in solution. We also observed that a short motif at the N-terminus of the transactivation domain has a high helical propensity. Importantly, we found that the N-terminal region of the transactivation domain is involved in transient long-range interactions with the basic-leucine zipper domain involved in DNA binding. Finally, in vitro phosphorylation assays with the casein kinase 2 show that the presence of the basic-leucine zipper domain is required for phosphorylation of the transactivation domain. This study uncovers the intricate coupling existing between the transactivation and basic-leucine zipper domains of ATF4, highlighting its potential regulatory significance."

https://openalex.org/W4206922439,"Although evidence from high-resource settings indicates that women with HIV are at higher risk of acquiring high-risk HPV and developing cervical cancer, data from cervical cancer ""screen and treat"" programs using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in lower-income countries have found mixed evidence about the association between HIV status and screening outcomes. Moreover, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of HIV-related characteristics (e.g., viral suppression, treatment factors) on screening outcomes in these high HIV burden settings.This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between HIV status, HIV treatment, and viral suppression with cervical cancer screening outcomes. Data from a ""screen and treat"" program based at a large, free antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi was retrospectively analyzed to determine rates of abnormal VIA results and suspected cancer, and coverage of same-day treatment. Multivariate logistic regression assessed associations between screening outcomes and HIV status, and among women living with HIV, viremia, ART treatment duration and BMI.Of 1405 women receiving first-time VIA screening between 2017-2019, 13 (0.9%) had suspected cancer and 68 (4.8%) had pre-cancerous lesions, of whom 50 (73.5%) received same-day lesion treatment. There was no significant association found between HIV status and screening outcomes. Among HIV+ women, abnormal VIA was positively associated with viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL (aOR 3.02, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.49) and negatively associated with ART treatment duration (aOR 0.88 per additional year, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98).In this population of women living with HIV with high rates of ART coverage and viral suppression, HIV status was not significantly associated with abnormal cervical cancer screening results.

The objective was to compare histopathological characteristics, cytokines and mediators of physiological processes in PM depending on the parasitic species, through a cross-sectional study in three groups: negative-PM, vivax-PM, falciparum-PM from Northwestern Colombia. The diagnosis of PM was made with thick blood smear, qPCR, and histopathology. Immuno-histochemical was made with EnVision system (Dako) and Zeiss Axio Imager M2 with light microscope. Cells in apoptosis were studied with the TUNEL technique. To measure the expression level of cytokines and mediators qRT-PCR was used. We included 179 placentas without PM and 87 with PM (53% P. vivax and 47% P. falciparum). At delivery, anemia was 25% in negative-PM, 60% in vivax-PM, and 44% in falciparum-PM group. The neonatal weight had an intense difference between groups with 3292±394g in negative-PM, 2,841±239 in vivax-PM, and 2,957±352 in falciparum-PM. The histopathological characteristics and CD+ cells in placenta with statistical differences (Dunn´s test) between negative-PM vs vivax-PM (P. falciparum was similar to P. vivax) were infarction, fibrinoid deposits, calcification, cells in apoptosis, immune infiltrates in decidua and intervillous space, CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD56+, CD68+. The expression levels of mediators in the placenta with statistical differences (Dunn´s test) between negative-PM vs vivax-PM (P. falciparum was similar to P. vivax) were Fas, FasL, HIF1α, Cox1, Cox2, VEGF, IL4, IL10, IFNγ, TNF, TGFβ, FOXP3, and CTLA4. PM with P. falciparum and P. vivax, damages this organ and causes significant alteration of various physiological processes, which cause maternal anemia and a reduction in neonatal weight in degrees that are statistically and clinically significant.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and fluorescent immunohistochemistry were performed to compare the expression levels of VEGF receptors and nociceptors in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) between VEGFA-instilled mice and saline-instilled controls. To manipulate primary afferent activity, Gi-coupled Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (Gi-DREADD) were expressed in lumbosacral DRG neurons of TRPV1-Cre-ZGreen mice via targeted adeno-associated viral vector (AAVs) injections. A small molecule agonist of Gi-DREADD, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), was injected into the peritoneum (i. p.) in awake animals to silence TRPV1 expressing sensory neurons in vivo during physiological and behavioral recordings of bladder function. Intravesical instillation of VEGFA in the urinary bladders increased visceral mechanical sensitivity and enhanced RTX-sensitive detrusor contractility. Sex differences were identified in the baseline detrusor contractility responses and VEGF-induced visceral hypersensitivity. VEGFA instillations in the urinary bladder led to significant increases in the mRNA and protein expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) in lumbosacral DRG, whereas the expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and VEGF receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) remained unchanged when compared to saline-instilled animals. Importantly, the VEGFA-induced visceral hypersensitivity was reversed by Gi-DREADD-mediated neuronal silencing in lumbosacral sensory neurons. Activation of bladder VEGF signaling causes sensory neural plasticity and visceral hypersensitivity in mice, confirming its role of an UCPPS biomarker as identified by the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) research studies. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of lumbosacral sensory neurons in vivo completely reversed VEGFA-induced pelvic hypersensitivity in mice, suggesting the strong therapeutic potential for decreasing primary afferent activity in the treatment of pain severity in UCPPS patients."
https://openalex.org/W4207022960,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and its isomeric variant, dermatan sulfate (DS), are complex glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are ubiquitous components of the extracellular matrix in various tissues including the brain. CS and/or DS are known to bind to a variety of growth factors and regulate many cellular events such as proliferation and differentiation. Although the biological activities of CS and/or DS towards neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) have been well investigated, the CS and/or DS of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have not been fully characterized. Here, we analyzed GAGs on mononuclear cells of rat umbilical cord blood cells (UCB-MNCs). CS was detected in vascular intima and media of rat umbilical cord at embryonic day 19 (E19) by immunohistochemistry. The stem-cell-enriched-UCBCs (SCE-UCBCs), which were expanded from rat UCB-MNCs, expressed CS. CS chains are composed of repeating disaccharide units, which are classified into several types such as O-, A-, B-, C-, D-, and E-unit according to the number and positions of sulfation. A disaccharide composition analysis revealed that CS and/or DS were abundant in rat UCB-MNCs as well as in their expanded SCE-UCBCs, while the amount of heparan sulfate (HS) was less. The degree of sulfation of CS/DS was relatively low and the major component in UCB-MNCs and SCE-UCBCs was the A-unit. A colony-forming cell assay revealed that the percentage of colony-forming cells decreased in culture with CS degradation enzyme. The CS and/or DS of UCBCs may be involved in biological activities such as stem cell proliferation and/or differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4207056820,"Participation in longitudinal research studies in resource-limited settings often involves frequent interactions with study staff and other participants, as well as receipt of incentives and transportation reimbursements. Social support-receipt of material and emotional resources from one's social network-has been linked to antiretroviral adherence in sub-Saharan Africa. The extent to which social support arises from study participation, its range and depth, and its implications for observational study conduct, have not been extensively described.We conducted individual open-ended and semi-structured interviews with participants in a longitudinal, observational antiretroviral therapy adherence monitoring study in Mbarara, Uganda. Participants were asked about their experiences in the longitudinal study and their interactions with research staff. We also interviewed study research assistants (RAs). Deductive and inductive coding were used to identify content related to the experience of study participation. Codes were organized into themes, and relationships between themes were used to develop overarching categories.Sixty longitudinal study participants and 6 RAs were interviewed. Instrumental and emotional social support emerged as pervasive and valued aspects of longitudinal study participation. Instrumental support that participants received consisted of enhanced linkage to medical care, health education, and direct and indirect material benefits. Emotional support consisted of perceptions of feeling ""cared for"" and social interactions that permitted escape from HIV-related stigma. Both instrumental and emotional support often arose through the close relationships participants formed with research staff and with each other. Study-derived social support motivated some participants to adhere to antiretroviral therapy-an unanticipated effect potentially influencing the longitudinal study's primary observational outcome.Longitudinal study participation resulted in instrumental and emotional social support for participants. The depth of support participants experienced has implications for observational study design in resource-limited settings, including need to assess potential effects on study outcomes; consideration of social support during risk/benefit assessment in study ethics review and consent; and vigilance for consequences of social support loss when studies end."
https://openalex.org/W4207060197,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased risk of heart failure (HF). The mechanisms and cardiac prerequisites explaining this association remain unresolved. In this study, we sought to determine the potential cardiac impact of an experimental model of RA in mice subjected to HF by constriction of the ascending aorta.Aorta was constricted via thoracotomy and placement of o-rings with inner diameter 0.55 mm or 0.66 mm, or sham operated. RA-like phenotype was instigated by delayed-type hypersensitivity arthritis (DTHA) two weeks after surgery and re-iterated after additional 18 days. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before surgery and at successive time points throughout the study. Six weeks after surgery the mice were euthanized, blood and tissue were collected, organ weights were documented, and expression levels of cardiac foetal genes were analysed. In a supplemental study, DTHA-mice were euthanized throughout 14 days after induction of arthritis, and blood was analysed for important markers and mediators of RA (SAP, TNF-α and IL-6). In order to put the latter findings into clinical context, the same molecules were analysed in serum from untreated RA patients and compared to healthy controls.Significant elevations of inflammatory markers were found in both patient- and murine blood. Furthermore, the DTHA model appeared clinically relevant when compared to the inflammatory responses observed in three prespecified RA severity disease states. Two distinct trajectories of cardiac dysfunction and HF development were found using the two o-ring sizes. These differences were consistent by both MRI, organ weights and cardiac foetal gene expression levels. Still, no difference within the HF groups, nor within the sham groups, could be found when DTHA was induced.DTHA mediated systemic inflammation did not cause, nor modify HF caused by aortic constriction. This indicates other prerequisites for RA-induced cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4210425197,"Both cardiovascular and reproductive complications may have origins in utero or in early life. Women in the Bogalusa Heart Study (n = 1401) had been linked to birth certificates for birthweight and gestational data, which were examined relative to childhood (ages 4-16) cardiometabolic indicators, indicated by mean levels overall and total risk factor burden as estimated by area under the curve (AUC) computed from longitudinal quadratic random-effects growth models. Women reported the birthweight and gestational age of each of their own pregnancies, and delivery medical records were linked to interview data where possible. Path analyses were conducted to examine the relationships among a woman's own birth outcomes, childhood and preconception adult cardiovascular health, and birth outcomes. Mean blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) adjusted relative risk (aRR) per 1-SD increase, 1.27, 95% CI 1.04-1.57) and low-density lipoprotein (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.44) in childhood predicted preterm birth (PTB), while mean SBP (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.74) predicted term low birthweight. The AUC data suggested an association between blood pressure and PTB (aRR for SBP top 10%, 1.86, 95% CI 1.08-3.21). Pre-pregnancy total cholesterol was negatively associated with gestational age. In path analyses, positive associations were found for each step between own birthweight, childhood BMI, pre-pregnancy BMI, and child's birthweight. Childhood levels of some, though not all, cardiovascular risk factors may predict adverse birth outcomes (preterm birth and reduced fetal growth)."
https://openalex.org/W4225576043,"Multidisciplinary collaboration has generally been shown to have positive effects on healthcare but can be difficult to facilitate. This study assessed the effects of a multidisciplinary fibroid clinic on practice patterns and clinician perceptions to better understand drivers of interspecialty collaboration.Annual rates of hysterectomies, myomectomies, and uterine fibroid embolizations (UFEs) performed in an urban healthcare system were collected from 2012-2019. Rates of each procedure were compared over time before and after launching a multidisciplinary fibroid clinic at the academic medical center. Referral rates were also compared. The gynecologists and interventional radiologists (IRs) involved in the clinic were interviewed 2 years prior to and after the clinic launch about their approaches to fibroids and perceptions of others who treat this condition. A phenomenological approach was used to identify and compare themes within the interviews by two researchers with excellent inter-rater agreement (κ = 0.80).Annual rates of fibroid procedures increased over time (p<0.01) but the relative number of UFEs decreased (p = 0.01). UFE referrals by the clinic gynecologists significantly increased as did the number of combined fibroid procedures (p<0.01). However, the rates of one fibroid procedure relative to others were not different between the clinic and rest of the healthcare system (p = 0.55). Specialty-specific perceptions of fibroid treatments and inter-specialty dynamics did not change. Despite this, clinicians unanimously perceived the clinic and post-clinic practice patterns as positive and distinct from their previous work and relationships between gynecology and IR elsewhere. Limitations of this study included its single clinic design and potential confounder of differences in advertising pre- versus post-clinic.Creating the right practice environment may be more important for fostering inter-specialty collaboration and work satisfaction than shared mental models or procedural volumes in certain practice settings."
https://openalex.org/W4206904022,"Francisella tularensis is a highly pathogenic intracellular bacterium that causes the disease tularemia. While its ability to replicate within cells has been studied in much detail, the bacterium also encodes a less characterised type 4 pili (T4P) system. T4Ps are dynamic adhesive organelles identified as major virulence determinants in many human pathogens. In F . tularensis , the T4P is required for adherence to the host cell, as well as for protein secretion. Several components, including pilins, a pili peptidase, a secretin pore and two ATPases, are required to assemble a functional T4P, and these are encoded within distinct clusters on the Francisella chromosome. While some of these components have been functionally characterised, the role of PilO, if any, still is unknown. Here, we examined the role of PilO in the pathogenesis of F . novicida . Our results show that the PilO is essential for pilus assembly on the bacterial surface. In addition, PilO is important for adherence of F . novicida to human monocyte-derived macrophages, secretion of effector proteins and intracellular replication. Importantly, the pilO mutant is attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice regardless of the route of infection. Following intratracheal and intradermal infection, the mutant caused no histopathology changes, and demonstrated impaired phagosomal escape and replication within lung liver as well as spleen. Thus, PilO is an essential virulence determinant of F . novicida ."
https://openalex.org/W4206929868,"Ward-Based Outreach Teams' (WBOTs) use of mobile technologies can promote better quality and improved health services for populations in low- and middle-income countries. However, the implementation of such systems is fraught with threats to sustainability.The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of users' views and experiences of the implementation of mHealth in a selected sub-district in North West Province, South Africa.The study was qualitative, exploratory and descriptive. Data were collected from community health workers (CHWs) (n = 24) and outreach team leaders (OTLs) (n = 4) who used mobile devices loaded with the Mobenzi application through semi-structured focus group interviews, using an interview guide. Creswell's stages of thematic analysis were used for data analysis, and codes, categories and themes were validated with the participants.Three themes emerged from the findings, namely the transition from a paper-based system to an electronic system; the use of the application; and reverting to paper-based documentation. The findings revealed that WBOTs considered the mHealth application as useful, easy to use, and supportive to their workflow. They experienced some technical challenges and lamented the inaccessibility of technicians. The mobile initiative's termination caused distress among the participants, especially CHWs who had to revert to paper-based documentation to capture community health data. OTLs were concerned about the quality of health data being captured in the absence of the application.The study concluded that community-based health care programmes that use WBOTs and mHealth technologies are essential in strengthening the health care system. WBOTs are facilitators for improving access to health care. Policy-makers and district managers will gain useful insights if they engage application users in discussions regarding future mobile health interventions for household and community-based care."
https://openalex.org/W4206977183,"A multistage pressure reducing valve with specially designed pressure reducing components is presented in this paper. As the deformation of the valve trims under fluid-solid-heat coupling has an important influence on the operation reliability of the valve, a numerical simulation is carried out to analyse the flow field characteristic in the valve and radial deformation of the valve trims using the ANSYS software. And a deformation experiment is designed to validate the deformations of the valve trims at high temperature of 693.15 K. The results indicate that the simulation results agree well with the experimental data. Moreover, it is found that the temperature field has the most significant influence on the deformation of the valve trims, the radial deformations of the matching surface vary from 0.439 to 0.442 mm. And the radial deformations caused by other factors vary from 0.005 to 0.015 mm. In addition, as a novel indicator, the clearance after deformation of the matching surface is used to evaluate the operation reliability of the valve. By using the GAP function in ANSYS static module, the clearances of the matching surface are obtained at different openings under the condition of fluid-solid-heat coupling, further indicating that the initial clearance between the valve plug and inner sleeve should be greater than 0.014 mm to ensure the operation reliability of the valve."
https://openalex.org/W4207070942,"Background and aims The effects of influenza vaccination (IV) on the outcomes of patients with kidney disease (KD) are not completely understood. We aimed to evaluate and compare the outcomes during admission of KD between elderly patients who did or did not receive an IV within the previous 12 months. Methods We used health insurance research data in Taiwan and conducted a population-based cohort study that included 22,590 older people aged ≥ 65 years who were hospitalized for KD in 2008–2013. We performed propensity score matching (case-control ratio 1:1) to select 4386 eligible IV recipients and 4386 nonrecipient controls for comparison. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of IV associated with complications and mortality during KD admission were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results During hospitalization for KD, IV was significantly associated with lower risks of 30-day in-hospital mortality (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39–0.82), septicemia (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68–0.87), and intensive care (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96). Additionally, IV recipients had a shorter length of hospital stay and lower medical expenditure than nonrecipients. Subgroup analyses further showed that the association of IV with reduced adverse events was confined to patients aged ≥ 75 years. Conclusions Previous IV was associated with reduced risks of complications and mortality and in elderly patients hospitalized for KD. We raised the possibility and suggested the need to promote IV for this susceptible population of patients with KD."
https://openalex.org/W4207074145,"The evidence for rehabilitation interventions poststroke lack sufficient robustness. However, variation in treatment effects across countries have been given little attention.To compare two identically protocolized trials conducted in different western countries in order to identify factors that may have caused variation in secondary trial outcomes.Comparative study based on individual patient data (N = 129) from two randomized controlled trials, conducted in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities in the Netherlands (N = 66) and Australia (N = 63). Patients with stroke and their caregivers were randomly allocated to an 8-week caregiver-mediated exercises intervention (N = 63; 31 Australian and 32 Dutch) or to a control group (N = 66; 32 Australian and 34 Dutch). Patient characteristics, compliance, usual care and process measures were compared across countries. We examined if study setting significantly moderated the trial outcomes: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and General Self-Efficacy Scale, measured at 8- and 12 weeks follow-up. In addition, we explored if factors that were significantly different across countries caused variation in these trial outcomes.Most patients suffered an ischemic stroke, were in the subacute phase and participated with their partner. Dutch patients were younger (P = 0.005) and had a lower functional status (P = 0.001). Australian patients were recruited earlier poststroke (P<0.001), spent less time in exercise therapy (P<0.001) and had a shorter length of stay (P<0.001). The level of contamination was higher (P = 0.040) among Dutch controls. No effect modification was observed and trial outcomes did not change after controlling for cross-country differences.The present study highlighted important clinical differences across countries whilst using an identical study protocol. The observed differences could result in a different potential for recovery and variation in treatment effects across trials. We argue that we can proceed faster to evaluating interventions within international pragmatic trials."
