https://openalex.org/W2090293022,"In spite of suppression efforts, severe wildfires burn large areas of southern California grassland, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral. Such large burns may not have been characteristic prior to the initiation of fire suppression more than 70 years ago. To compare controlled with uncontrolled areas, wildfires of southern California and adjacent northern Baja California were evaluated for the period 1972 to 1980 from Landsat imagery. Fire size and location, vegetation, year, and season were recorded. It was found that suppression has divergent effects on different plant communities depending on successional processes, growth rates, fuel accumulation, decomposition rates, and length of flammability cycles. These variables establish feedback between the course of active fires, fire history, spatial configuration of flammable vegetation, and fire size. Suppression has minimal impact in coastal sage scrub and grassland. Fire control in chaparral reduces the number of fires, not burned hectarage; fires consequently increase in size, spread rate, and intensity and become uncontrollable in severe weather conditions. The Baja California chaparral fire regime may serve as a model for prescribed burning in southern California."

Large manganese and helium-3 anomalies in seawater samples, evidence of intense present-day activity of hydrothermal springs, indicate that sulfides are still being produced along this segment of the rise. Massive sulfides also occur on adjacent off-axis seamounts."

Species occurrences are far more irregular for spiders than vertebrates on the same islands. Much variation in spider density is explainable by distance from the presumed source of colonists and presence or absence of vertebrate predators. As has been predicted for passive dispersers, densities decline exponentially with distance. For a given distance, spider densities are about ten times greater on islands without vertebrate predators than on those with such predators."

https://openalex.org/W2056082885,"Magnetospheric electrons precipitated by ground-based coded very low frequency radio transmissions have been detected by rocket measurement of bremsstrahlung x-rays, caused by impact of the electrons with the upper atmosphere. The direct correlations obtained between the very low frequency signals and the x-rays demonstrate the limits of sensitivity required and indicate that this remote sensing technique would be useful for future study of very low frequency effects induced by single lightning strokes."

In some areas of intense scientific effort, commercial priorities tend to be forgotten. Too many of the units of the economic system are backward in understanding what science can offer and inefficient in using the opportunities which it provides. Evidence suggests that the successful use of science depends on the overall quality of management rather than specifically on its degree of scientific knowledge."

The measured ratios of carbon-14 to carbon-12 correspond to ages of 7800, 8800, and 9000 years with uncertainties of +/- 600 years."
