https://openalex.org/W2076510096,"During the first 50 days of a long-term period of incubation of lake sediments with inorganic mercury (Hg2+), low concentrations of methylinercury were observed to build up. Upon continued incubation there was a rapid decrease in amount of methylmercury in the system and a concomitant evolution of volatile inorganic mercury (Hg0). Transfer of the mixed culture to growth media containing methylmercury resulted in the degradation of methylmercury and the volatilization of Hg0. Four bacterial isolates were obtained from the mixed culture which, in pure culture, rapidly degraded methylmercury to methane and Hg0. The presence of methane in head space gases was confirmed by flameionization gas chromatography, and the presence of Hg0 in head space gases was confirmed by mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2018688691,The solar magnetic sector structure appears to be related to the average area of high positive vorticity centers (low-pressure troughs) observed during winter in the Northern Hemisphere at the 300-millibar level. The average area of high vorticity decreases (low-pressure troughs become less intense) during a few days near the times at which sector boundaries are carried past the earth by the solar wind. The amplitude of the effect is about 10 percent.

That of a sample of platypus milk was a tetrasaccharide, difucosyllactose. Free lactose was found in small amounts only. The milk carbohydrate of monotremes is distinguished from that of both marsupials and placental mammals by its high fucose content."
https://openalex.org/W2069300512,"In-place measurements of the bottom currents in the Hudson Canyon reveal that the current regime is characterized by a pronounced reversal of flow up and down the canyon. Velocities are commonly of the order of 8 to 15 centimeters per second, reaching 27 centimeters per second on occasion in the upper and central portion of the canyon. Although alpha 2.5-day recording of currents showed a net transport upcanyon, a combination of 66 current measurements from the submersible Alvin, the analysis of sediment texture and organic carbon, and the determination of the benthic fauna-nutrient relationship indicate that over the long term there is a net transport of fine material through the canyon to the outer continenital rise."

https://openalex.org/W1972645113,"The asexual lichen-forming fungus Parmelia hypotropa has two common chemical races that differ sharply in biogeography and niche characteristics and appear to have been derived by morphologic parallelism from chemically identical races of the closely related Parmelia perforata, which is sexual. Among the lichen fungi many chemically variable asexual morphs, which conventional taxonomies treat as species, are probably polyphyletic like Parmelia hypotropa."
https://openalex.org/W2049299449,"Reexamination of the 1958 skull of the late Miocene Oreopithecus bambolii revealed a cranial anatomy different from that widely accepted for this taxon. There is a sagittal crest, a high nuchal crest, a large gonial angle, and alpha high, rather vertical, occiput. This catarrhine was not a very large brained primate compared to known advanced hominoids."
https://openalex.org/W1971871277,"Cotton remains from four archeological sites in central coastal Peru, representing a time sequence from about 2500 to 1000 B.C., were compared with similar materials obtained from living wild and cultivated forms of Gossypium barbadense L. The comparison revealed that the archeological cotton samples were primitive forms of Gossypium barbadense, differing little from present-day wild forms of the same species. Although not the earliest cottons recorded for the New World, they appear to represent the earliest stages of cotton domestication yet recorded."

This is a report of the diagnostically Late Permian (uppermost Paleozoic) ammonoid Cyclolobus walkeri (Diener, 1903) from the Zewan Formation 20 meters below the Permian-Triassic contact at the classic section in Guryul Ravine, Srinagar region, Kashmir."
