https://openalex.org/W1768635289,"Computer analysis of a conserved domain, BRCT, first described at the carboxyl terminus of the breast cancer protein BRCA1, a p53 binding protein (53BP1), and the yeast cell cycle checkpoint protein RAD9 revealed a large superfamily of domains that occur predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage. The BRCT domain consists of approximately 95 amino acid residues and occurs as a tandem repeat at the carboxyl terminus of numerous proteins, but has been observed also as a tandem repeat at the amino terminus or as a single copy. The BRCT superfamily presently includes approximately 40 nonorthologous proteins, namely, BRCA1, 53BP1, and RAD9; a protein family that consists of the fission yeast replication checkpoint protein Rad4, the oncoprotein ECT2, the DNA repair protein XRCC1, and yeast DNA polymerase subunit DPB11; DNA binding enzymes such as terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferases, deoxycytidyl transferase involved in DNA repair, and DNA-ligases III and IV; yeast multifunctional transcription factor RAP1; and several uncharacterized gene products. Another previously described domain that is shared by bacterial NAD-dependent DNA-ligases, the large subunits of eukaryotic replication factor C, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases appears to be a distinct version of the BRCT domain. The retinoblastoma protein (a universal tumor suppressor) and related proteins may contain a distant relative of the BRCT domain. Despite the functional diversity of all these proteins, participation in DNA damage-responsive checkpoints appears to be a unifying theme. Thus, the BRCT domain is likely to perform critical, yet uncharacterized, functions in the cell cycle control of organisms from bacteria to humans. The carboxyterminal BRCT domain of BRCA1 corresponds precisely to the recently identified minimal transcription activation domain of this protein, indicating one such function."

https://openalex.org/W1970907592,"Three-dimensional periodic microstructures of aluminum oxide, which are important for creating photonic band-gap structures (PBGs), were fabricated by laser rapid prototyping by means of laser-induced direct-write deposition from the gas phase. The structures consisted of layers of parallel rods forming a face-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice constants of 66 and 133 micrometers. These structures showed transmission minima centered around 4 terahertz (75 micrometers) and 2 terahertz (150 micrometers), respectively. PBGs will allow precise control of the optical properties of materials, including lasers without threshold."

Methane can be highly activated, yielding high rates of conversion to higher hydrocarbons and aromatics (10 to 45 percent) at low temperatures (400° to 600°C), by its reaction over H -galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite in the presence of alkenes or higher alkanes. The methane activation results from its hydrogen-transfer reaction with alkenes."

https://openalex.org/W2113104146,"Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) protein plays a prominent role in the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA in Escherichia coli. The protein possesses three enzymatic activities, hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (DNA glycosylase), beta-elimination (AP lyase), and delta-elimination; these functions act in a concerted manner to excise oxidized deoxynucleosides from duplex DNA. Schiff base formation between the enzyme and substrate has been demonstrated (Tchou, J., and Grollman, A. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11671-11677); this protein-DNA complex can be trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride. By digesting the stable, covalently linked intermediate with proteases and determining the accurate mass of the products by negative electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we show that the N-terminal proline of Fpg protein is linked to DNA and, therefore, is identified as the nucleophile that initiates the catalytic excision of oxidized bases from DNA. This experimental approach may be applicable to the analysis of other protein-DNA complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2021526142,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that fibrinogen can associate with endothelial cells via an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition specificity. In the present study, we have characterized the specificity of fibrinogen binding to endothelial cells under different cation conditions. Fibrinogen binding to suspended endothelial cells was selectively supported by Mn2+ and was suppressed by Ca2+. The Mn2+-supported interaction was completely inhibited by RGD peptides but not by αvβ3 blocking monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, the interaction was completely blocked by two α5β1 monoclonal antibodies. This interaction was not mediated by fibronectin bound to the integrin; could be demonstrated with purified α5β1; and also was observed with a second α5β1-bearing cell type, platelets. The binding of fibrinogen to α5β1 on endothelial cells in the presence of Mn2+ was time-dependent, specific, saturable, and of high affinity (Kd = 65 nM). By employing anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies, the carboxyl-terminal RGD sequence at Aα 572-574 was implicated in fibrinogen recognition by α5β1. Two circumstances were identified in which α5β1 interacted with fibrinogen in the presence of Ca2+: when the receptor was activated with monoclonal antibody (8A2) or when the fibrinogen was presented as an immobilized substratum. These results identify fibrinogen as a ligand for α5β1 on endothelial and other cells, an interaction which may have broad biological implications."

Contrary to the current interpretation of shock-wave experiments, the simulations suggest that, below 100 gigapascals, methane dissociates into a mixture of hydrocarbons, and it separates into hydrogen and carbon only above 300 gigapascals. The simulation conditions (100 to 300 gigapascals; 4000 to 5000 kelvin) were chosen to follow the isentrope in the middle ice layers of Neptune and Uranus. Implications on the physics of these planets are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1515978161,"Circulating antibodies from human and murine chagasic sera are able to interact with myocardium-activating neurotransmitter receptors. Here we reported the presence of autoantibodies against the second extracellular loop of the human heart muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) in patients with Chagas' disease by using a synthetic 24-mer peptide in immunoblotting and enzyme immunoassay. Affinity-purified antipeptide IgG from chagasic patients, similar to monoclonal antihuman M2 mAChR, recognized bands with a molecular weight corresponding to the cardiac mAChR. The binding was inhibited by the peptide, assessing the specificity of the interaction. The antipeptide autoantibody also displayed an ""agonist-like"" activity modifying the intracellular events associated with mAChR activation, i.e., decreased contractility, increased cGMP, and decreased cAMP production. All of these effects on rat atria by chagasic antipeptide autoantibodies resemble the effects of the authentic agonist and those of the total polyclonal chagasic IgG, being selectively blunted by atropine and neutralized by the synthetic peptide corresponding in aminoacid sequence to the second extracellular loop of the human M2 mAChR. A clinical relevance of these findings is demonstrated by a strong association between the existence of circulating antipeptide autoantibodies in chagasic patients and the presence of dysautonomic symptoms, making these autoantibodies a proper early marker of heart autonomic dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2086571220,"Mitochondrial disorders are a large group of phenotypically heterogeneous diseases. An understanding of their molecular basis would benefit greatly from the ability to manipulate the mitochondrial genome and/or to introduce functional exogenous DNA into mitochondria. As a first step toward this approach, we have used electroporation to introduce a 7.2-kilobase plasmid DNA into isolated functional mitochondria. Transfer of the DNA at field strengths between 8 and 20 kV/cm was investigated by Southern blot analysis. Maximal plasmid internalization was achieved at a field strength of 14 kV/cm. The functional integrity of the mitochondria after electroporation was verified by enzymatic assays of specific mitochondrial marker enzymes and by measuring respiratory control. At field strengths above 12 kV/cm, an increasing mitochondrial destruction was observed. 12 kV/cm was found to be optimal for the most efficient plasmid internalization while still retaining the functional integrity of the mitochondria. At this field strength, about half of the internalized plasmid was found in the inner membrane or mitochondrial matrix, as determined by immunoelectron microscopy and Southern blot analysis of electroporated mitochondria treated with digitonin. We estimate that on average one plasmid molecule/mitochondrion reaches the matrix or inner membrane. Mitochondrial disorders are a large group of phenotypically heterogeneous diseases.

A growing number of degenerative diseases of the brain, skeletal and heart muscle, the kidney, and endocrine glands are recognized as being due to mutations in the mitochondrial genome (for reviews, see Refs. 1Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Google Scholar, 2Wallace Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 128-133Google Scholar, 3Zeviani M. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1992; 15: 456-471Google Scholar). The introduction of specific changes in the mitochondrial genome and the ability to reintroduce the modified genomes into mitochondria would facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of expression and replication of the mitochondrial genome, provide insight into the molecular pathology of mitochondrial diseases, and may serve as a first step toward gene therapy of mitochondrial disease (4Wheeler V.C. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Williamson R. Coutelle C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 251-255Google Scholar). Because of the high DNA transfer efficiency obtained with electroporation in bacteria and cultured cells, we decided to investigate this procedure for the introduction of DNA into mitochondria in vitro which could then be introduced into cells by microinjection (5King M.P. Attardi G. Cell. 1988; 52: 811-819Google Scholar, 6King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Google Scholar) or endocytosis (7Clark M.A. Shay J.W. Nature. 1982; 295: 605-607Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the development and optimization of an electroporation procedure for the introduction of DNA, up to a size of at least 7.2 kilobases, into isolated mammalian mitochondria. We demonstrate the transfer of this DNA into the inner mitochondrial membrane and/or matrix by Southern analysis after removal of the outer membrane and by electron microscopy on the intact organelles, and we have shown functionality of the manipulated organelles by preservation of their ATP-generating capacity. All steps of mitochondrial isolation were performed at 4°C. Mice of no particular breed or sex were starved overnight and killed by cervical dislocation. The livers were collected into homogenization buffer (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% w/v fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), cut into small pieces, washed three times in homogenization buffer, and homogenized by two strokes of a Potter homogenizer (1,000 rpm) at a ratio of 15 ml of buffer/3 g of tissue. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged three times at 700 × g for 5 min to eliminate cell debris, red blood cells, and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondria were rinsed once in one-third of the initial supernatant volume of homogenization buffer, centrifuged again at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended into respiration buffer (225 mM sucrose, 10 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 100 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml for measurement of mitochondrial respiration or into 0.33 M sucrose for other procedures. The protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 5 μg of pCMVβ plasmid (Clontech) was added to 100 μl of the mitochondrial suspension of which 20 μl was transferred into a cold electroporation cuvette (0.1-cm gap cuvette; Bio-Rad) containing 30 μl of 0.33 M sucrose. Electroporation was carried out using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser™ at a capacitance of 25 microfarads, a resistance of 400 Ω, and a range of field strengths varying between 8 and 20 kV/cm. Electroporated mitochondria were removed quickly from the cuvette. The cuvette was washed once with 50 μl of 0.33 M sucrose, which was added to the electroporated mitochondria. Freshly electroporated mitochondria were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C, and the pellet was used for all subsequent experiments, with the exception of the enzymatic assays for which it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nonelectroporated mitochondria controls were treated identically. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 0.33 M sucrose and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 6 min. It was resuspended in 100 μl of DNase buffer (0.33 M sucrose, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml to digest any noninternalized DNA. DNase was subsequently inactivated by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, 10-min incubation at 65°C, and treatment with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Merck) for 4 h at 37°C. 2 μl of 10% SDS was added to achieve mitochondrial lysis. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and precipitated with 0.10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, and 20 ng of carrier yeast tRNA at −20°C overnight. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose gel. The separated DNA was transferred overnight to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Corp.). Blots were baked for 2 h at 80°C before a 3-h prehybridization in CHURCH buffer (1.68% w/v NaH2PO4, 5.41% w/v Na2HPO4, 0.7% w/v SDS, and 1% v/v denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 65°C. Blots were hybridized overnight at 65°C with pCMVβ or pRSmt22 (containing the whole mouse mitochondrial DNA) plasmids labeled with 32P using a Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham). Blots were washed at 65°C for 15 min consecutively in 2 × SSC, 1 × SSC, and 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% v/v SDS before autoradiography. For quantification, DNA band intensities were measured on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using a known amount of pCMVβ plasmid and endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as internal control. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of respiration buffer. Mitochondria were added to an oxygen electrode chamber maintained at 30°C, containing 2.4 ml of respiration buffer. The final concentrations of added substrates were: 2.5 mM malate+glutamate, 5 mM succinate, or 0.6 mM NADH. Oxidation was measured for 3 min before the addition of 180 μmol of ADP. The respiration rate was measured until the added ADP was exhausted. Mitochondrial coupling was determined by measuring the respiratory control ratio (RCR) 1The abbreviations used are: RCRrespiratory control ratioP/O ratioproduced ATP/consumed oxygen ratio. and produced ATP/consumed oxygen (P/O) ratio. The RCR is the ratio of the oxygen consumption rate in the presence of ADP (state III) to the oxygen consumption rate when ADP is exhausted (state IV). Coupled liver mitochondria have an RCR of approximately 2-10. The P/O ratio is an estimation of the number of coupling sites along the respiratory chain, measured by the number of molecules of ADP used (i.e. ATP synthesized) per oxygen atom consumed. For a NADH-linked substrate (malate+glutamate), the theoretical P/O ratio is 3 and for FADH2-linked substrate it is 2. In practice, P/O ratios are between 2.5 and 3.0 for NADH-linked substrates and between 1.5 and 2.0 for FADH2-linked substrates. respiratory control ratio produced ATP/consumed oxygen ratio. The frozen mitochondrial pellet was diluted to a concentration of 1.72 mg of protein/ml in 0.33 M sucrose. Citrate synthase activity was measured as described previously by Srere (9Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured in a 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.08 mM cytochrome c reduced immediately before measurements with few grains of sodium hydrosulfite. The activity was determined as a decrease in absorbance at 550 nm after the addition of about 10 μg of protein of the mitochondrial suspension. Monoamine oxidase activity was measured at 250 nm in a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mM benzylamine. The reaction was started by the addition of about 150 μg of mitochondrial protein. The effect of electroporation on the integrity of mitochondria was investigated by estimation of the relative changes (in percent) of enzyme activity and mtDNA amount associated with the mitochondrial pellet after exposure to increasing field strengths compared with the values of mitochondria before electroporation (100%). Each graph (see Figs. 2, 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, a and b) is constructed using the mean of two or three estimations at each indicated field strength derived from three independent electroporation experiments using the indicated range of increasing field strengths. The overall standard deviation from the mean of all single estimations at each field strength was calculated from all values of each parameter. It was ±4.8% for cytochrome c oxidase, ±2.8% for citrate synthase, ±4.6% for monoamine oxidase, and ±18.5% for mtDNA. For RCRs, standard deviation values were ±6.4% and ±3.1% and for P/O ratios ±3.9% and ±5.0% with malate+glutamate or succinate as substrate, respectively. For the O2 consumption of mitochondria using malate+glutamate, succinate, or NADH as substrate the overall standard deviation was ±2.0, ±2.3, and ± 0.7 μmol of O2 consumed/min/mg of protein, respectively.Fig. 3Effect of electroporation on mitochondrial enzymatic activities. Isolated mouse liver mitochondria were electroporated at field strengths ranging from 0 to 20 kV/cm.

They were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.8 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% w/v fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and purified further on a continuous 1.0-2.0 M sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The band of pure mitochondria was removed, diluted with 2 volumes of TE, pH 8.0, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C. Pure mitochondria were resuspended in 0.33 M sucrose at a concentration of 100 mg of protein/ml. A 2.4% (w/v) digitonin solution in 0.33 M sucrose was added to obtain a concentration of 0.30 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondrial proteins. Digitonin treatment was carried out for 15 min at 4°C without shaking and terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 0.33 M sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the mitoplast pellet was washed once with 500 μl of 0.33 M sucrose. After a further 15-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the mitoplast pellet was used for DNA extraction after DNase treatment or for enzymatic assays, as described previously. pCMVβ was labeled for electron microscopy with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) by nick translation, using conditions that prevent degradation of the DNA molecule (10Wheeler V.C. Coutelle C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 374-376Google Scholar). The labeled DNA was purified on a Sephadex G-50 column. Electroporation was performed with digoxigenin-labeled pCMVβ plasmid (or unlabeled control plasmid) as described previously. Mitochondria were then washed once in 0.33 M sucrose, pelleted at 15,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and resuspended immediately in 500 μl of fixation buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.18 M sucrose, 1% w/v glutaraldehyde) after careful removal of all of the supernatant. After fixing for 1 h at room temperature, mitochondria were pelleted as above. All traces of supernatant were removed, and the mitochondria were washed twice for 1 h at room temperature in 500 μl of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The mitochondrial pellet was immersed for 3 h in a mixture of 1.8 M sucrose and 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone according to Tokuyasu (11Tokuyasu K.T. Histochemistry. 1989; 21: 163-171Google Scholar) and cryosectioned. Immunolabeling and detection with anti-digoxin antibody (Sigma) and anti-mouse gold (Dianova) were performed according to Griffiths (12Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer-Verlag,, Berlin1993: 137-162Google Scholar). Based on the similar size of Escherichia coli and mitochondria and the high efficiency of bacterial transformation by electroporation, we chose to investigate this procedure for the transformation of mitochondria. Southern blot analysis was used to determine the effect of increasing field strengths on the internalization of the pCMVβ plasmid into mitochondria by electroporation (Fig. 1a). Following electroporation at field strengths between 0 and 20 kV/cm, mitochondria were treated with DNase I to remove any noninternalized plasmid and were pelleted before DNA extraction and electrophoresis. The Southern blot was subsequently hybridized with labeled probes for both mtDNA (pRSmt22) and pCMVβ (Fig. 1a), and the intensities of the bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Figs. 1b and 2). As shown in Fig. 1, increasing amounts of plasmid are rendered DNase-resistant by increasing field strengths of electroporation. No DNase protection is achieved without electroporation. The amount of internalized plasmid increases with field strengths up to 14 kV/cm (approximately of 4.4 ng of internalized plasmid at 14 kV/cm) and decreases at higher field strengths (Fig. 1, a and b). The majority of internalized plasmid, up to 14 kV/cm, is in the open circular conformation. At higher field strengths, most of it is linear (Fig. 1, a and b). No supercoiled plasmid was detected at any of the applied field strengths. Beginning at 12 kV/cm and increasing with higher field strengths, electroporation-induced damage of the plasmid is also visible as a smear (Fig. 1a). Plasmid DNA may be more susceptible to such damage than the endogenous mtDNA as it is not protected by the mitochondrial membranes. The amount of mtDNA remains practically constant up to a field strength of about 12 kV/cm (Fig. 2). At 12 kV/cm, intact mtDNA is reduced to 83% of the amount presents in nonelectroporated mitochondria. At higher field strengths, a dramatic decrease of the mtDNA was observed. At 20 kV/cm it is reduced to 20% compared with nonelectroporated mitochondria (Fig. 2). This decrease is most likely due to an electroporation-induced mitochondrial destruction, with a release of the mtDNA into the electroporation medium and its subsequent DNase I digestion. Electroporation-induced damage to the mtDNA does not appear likely as judged from the absence of observable degradation on the Southern blot, after mtDNA probe hybridization. To quantify the amount of internalized pCMVβ plasmid in relation to intact mitochondria the amount of endogenous mtDNA was used for reference (Fig. 1b). These results demonstrate that it is possible to transfer DNA of plasmid size into mitochondria by electroporation. However, the extent of damage to the mitochondria inflicted by this procedure, as suggested by the decrease of endogenous mtDNA, was a major concern. We therefore investigated the influence of electroporation on the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria by studying its effect on the mitochondrial association of marker enzymes and on the respiratory capacity of the organelles. The following marker enzymes, specific for particular mitochondrial compartments, were used: monoamine oxidase and cytochrome c oxidase for the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively, and citrate synthase for the matrix. For this analysis, the mitochondria were pelleted, and the enzyme activity and DNA content associated with the mitochondrial pellet were determined at the indicated field strengths. Up to a field strength of 12 kV/cm, the activity of both monoamine oxidase and citrate synthase decreases slightly to about 83% relative to nonelectroporated mitochondria (Fig. 3). This indicates a slight destructive effect up to this field strength. At higher field strengths, the citrate synthase activity falls to 60% at 18 kV/cm and then to a residual 18% at 20 kV/cm. In contrast, monoamine oxidase activity decreases to only 79% at 18 kV/cm and then falls to 60% of nonelectroporated mitochondria at 20 kV/cm (Fig. 3). The difference between the two enzymes suggests a leakage of the matrix enzyme through the destabilized mitochondrial membranes rather than a complete destruction of the mitochondrial structures up to about 18 kV/cm. The increase of cytochrome c oxidase activity between a field strength of 10 and 14 kV/cm to a plateau value of about 120% between 14 and 18 kV/cm (Fig. 3) is probably also due to this electroporation-induced membrane destabilization allowing increased access of the substrate (reduced cytochrome c) to the enzyme. At 20 kV/cm, a steep fall in cytochrome c oxidase activity to 50% is observed, reaching practically the level of monoamine oxidase activity (Fig. 3) and suggesting a massive destruction of the mitochondrial structures. The pattern of release of mtDNA from the mitochondria with increasing field strength correlates well with the decrease of citrate synthase activity (Fig. 2). This supports the hypothesis of an initial leakage of the mitochondrial matrix during electroporation since both citrate synthase and mtDNA are located in the matrix compartment. To assess the functional integrity of mitochondria during electroporation, we measured mitochondrial respiration using two different substrates, malate+glutamate and succinate, in the presence of ADP. Succinate is a direct substrate for complex II, whereas malate+glutamate produce NADH in the mitochondrial matrix, which is a direct substrate for complex I. NADH cannot be used directly as a substrate on intact and coupled mitochondria as it is unable to cross the inner membrane. Respiration with NADH on intact mitochondria is very low and can therefore be used as an indicator of mitochondrial integrity. Fig. 4 shows a linear decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption up to a field strength of 14 kV/cm using both malate+glutamate and succinate as substrate. At 14 kV/cm, the oxygen consumption rate is reduced to 71 and 53% of that of control mitochondria using malate+glutamate and succinate as substrate, respectively. At higher field strengths, the rate of oxygen consumption drops dramatically with both substrates indicating total loss of function above 14 kV/cm. Using NADH as substrate, mitochondrial respiration is very low up to 10 kV/cm (between 1.7 and 2.4 μmol of O2 consumed/min/mg of protein), indicating complete membrane integrity. Oxygen consumption increases from 12 kV/cm onward, reaching a peak at 14 kV/cm (6.2-fold increase compared with control mitochondria) indicating membrane destabilization. It drops at higher field strengths in accordance with malate+glutamate- or succinate-fueled respiration (Fig. 4), again indicating mitochondrial destruction. This is in agreement with the severe structural membrane damage above field strengths of 14 kV/cm determined by the enzymatic assays. Mitochondrial coupling was used as the most sensitive functional assay, by measuring the changes of the P/O ratio and RCR under the influence of electroporation (Fig. 5, a and b). With increasing field strengths, a similar decrease of the RCR is observed with either malate+glutamate or succinate as substrate. The RCRs indicate good coupling (RCR = 3.3 and 2.1 with malate+glutamate or succinate as substrate, respectively) up to 12 kV/cm. The P/O ratio is also conserved up to this field strength, but it drops dramatically above this value. In conclusion, the maximum field strength up to which isolated mitochondria can be electroporated while still maintaining their structural and functional integrity is 12 kV/cm. Further questions to be addressed concerned the localization of the introduced DNA, in particular whether or not the DNA reached the mitochondrial matrix, and the extent to which contaminating nonmitochondrial structures contributed to the DNase protection effect. Electron microscopy and selective solubilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane in conjunction with sucrose gradient purification of the electroporated mitochondria were applied to answer these questions. The electron micrographs in Fig. 6 are examples of tblltrathin sections from mitochondria electroporated at 12 kV/cm with digoxigenin-labeled pCMVβ plasmid and stained with monoclonal anti-digoxin and a gold-labeled secondary antibody. Internalized plasmid molecules can be seen at the mitochondrial periphery (panels a-c) and in the inner mitochondrial membrane or matrix (panels e-g). The resolution of immunoelectron microscopy does not allow a more exact distinction between these two compartments. Plasmid DNA signals could be detected in 63 out of a total 303 mitochondria (Table I). This is statistically significant (p < 0.001) compared with a no-pulse control in which 5/303 mitochondrial sections contained a signal. Of these 63 sections, signals localized in the inner membrane/matrix were detected in 37 sections (58%) and in 3 sections of the no-pulse control (Table I).Table I.Localization of electroporated plasmid DNA as determined by immunoelectron microscopy12 kV/cm pulsed samplesNo-pulsed samplesTotal mitochondrial signalaThe values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals detected in mitochondrial structures.635PeripheralaThe values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals detected in mitochondrial structures.262InternalaThe values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals detected in mitochondrial structures.373No. of mitochondrial sections examined303303Nonmitochondrial signalbThe values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals found in contaminant nonmitochondrial structures in those fields of view contributing to the total number of mitochondrial sections counted.3311a The values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals detected in mitochondrial structures.b The values given are the number of plasmid DNA signals found in contaminant nonmitochondrial structures in those fields of view contributing to the total number of mitochondrial sections counted. Open table in a new tab To exclude the possibility that free digoxigenin-11-dUTP would account for the observed signal a control electroporation was performed using plasmid DNA which was nick translated in the absence of digoxigenin-11-dUTP and supplemented with this nucleotide after nick translation. This DNA did not result in any significant signal, showing that only labeled DNA plasmid molecules (as opposed to free digoxigenin-11-dUTP) were responsible for the immunoreactive signal. DNA plasmid signals were also found associated with nonmitochondrial structures (endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, Golgi-like membranes, but no nuclei) present in the mitochondrial preparation (panel d). 33 signals in nonmitochondrial structures were counted in the viewing fields containing the 303 analyzed mitochondria (Table I). Since this plasmid is also not digested by DNase I, it probably contributes to the protected plasmid DNA detected by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1) to about 30%. To establish further the predominantly mitochondrial internalization and in particular inner membrane/matrix localization of the transferred plasmid DNA, we purified the electroporated mitochondria (12 kV/cm) on a sucrose gradient and subsequently treated them with digitonin and DNase I before extracting DNA for Southern blot analysis. The gradient purification resulted in a mitochondrial preparation virtually free of contaminating membrane structures (less than 5%). Digitonin is a specific detergent that selectively solubilizes the outer mitochondrial membrane. Treatment with digitonin was therefore used to determine the amount of plasmid internalized into the mitochondrial matrix. Complete destruction of the outer membrane after digitonin treatment was verified by the absence of monoamine oxidase activity in digitonin-treated mitochondria (results not shown). Fig. 7 demonstrates the internalization of plasmid DNA into the highly purified nontreated and digitonin-treated mitochondria. The internalized plasmid was quantified by radioimaging, and the amount of internalized plasmid in treated and nontreated samples was compared after normalization with the respective mtDNA amount. 43% of the total amount of internalized plasmid was found to be localized to the matrix with similar amounts of both linear and open circular plasmid forms. We have shown that exogenous plasmid DNA with a size of 7.2 kilobases can be introduced into isolated mitochondria by electroporation at an optimal electroporation field strength of about 12 kV/cm. At this field strength, a significant internalization of plasmid into mitochondria is observed by Southern blot analysis. This is not the field strength of maximum internalization (maximum at 14 kV/cm) but represents the maximum applicable field strength at which minimal mitochondrial damage is observed. Electroporation can induce damage of DNA at high field strengths (13Meaking W.S. Edgerton J. Wharton C.W. Meldrum R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 357-362Google Scholar). At 12 kV/cm we observed conversion of the supercoiled DNA to open circular and linear forms. As mitochondria possess specific ligases and topoisomerases (14Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Google Scholar), the reconstitution of the supercoiled form of the internalized plasmid can be expected. Conservation of mitochondrial integrity is also of great importance since injection of only a small number of partially uncoupled mitochondria into human fibroblasts was found to be detrimental to cell viability (15Corbisier P. Remacle J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 173-182Google Scholar). At a field strength of 12 kV/cm the mitochondria appear morphologically intact by immunoelectron microscopy, and the values of the coupling indicators are still in the normal range (RCR and P/O values of > 3 and 2 with malate+glutamate and succinate, respectively), despite some membrane destabilization. The introduced foreign DNA has to reach the mitochondrial matrix to allow its replication and gene expression. The combined evidence from electron microscopy and digitonin treatment demonstrates the presence of about half of the internalized plasmid in the inner membrane/matrix compartment. 303 sections of the mitochondria electroporated with a 12-kV/cm pulse were analyzed, of which 37 (12%) contained an inner membrane/matrix-localized plasmid DNA signal. Since each detected signal represents antibody bound to a single plasmid molecule, 12% of mitochondrial sections contain internalized plasmid DNA that may be localized to the matrix. It should be noted that the immunoelectron microscopy will only detect plasmid molecules that are on the surface of a section. Consequently, the total number of molecules in a section is likely to be underestimated. Given that each section only represents approximately one-tenth of the total mitochondrial volume, these data can only provide a rough estimate of the number of plasmid molecules present in a whole mitochondrion. Assuming a uniform distribution of plasmid molecules among the mitochondria and that each section represents a single mitochondrion, the observed frequency of 12% supports the presence of one plasmid molecule/mitochondrion (p < 0.05). Given that there is an average of five copies of endogenous mtDNA/mitochondrion, it can be postulated that plasmid DNA is present at approximately 20% of the level of mtDNA. Several techniques have been tried for the introduction of foreign DNA into mitochondria (16Butow R.A. Fox T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 465-468Google Scholar, 17Anzanio P.Q. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5592-5596Google Scholar, 18Fox T.D. Sanford J.C. McMullin T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7288-7292Google Scholar, 19Klein T.M. Wolf E.D. Wu R. Sanford J.C. Nature. 1987; 327: 70-73Google Scholar). Although successful in plant cells and yeast, biolistic delivery has so far not been applicable to mammalian mitochondria. Early attempts to introduce DNA into “mega”-mitochondria of liver cells by systemic delivery in encapsulating liposomes (20Cudd A. Nicolau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 201-214Google Scholar) have not been continued, probably because of the low efficiency of this procedure. More recently Seibel et al. (21Seibel P. Trappe J. Villani G. Klopstock T. Papa S. Reichmann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 10-17Google Scholar) have exploited the protein import machinery of mitochondria to translocate a DNA/targeting-peptide chimera into isolated mitochondria following earlier experiments by Vestweber and Schatz (22Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1989; 338: 170-172Google Scholar). They delivered a 322-base pair DNA fragment covalently conjugated to the 32-amino acid presequence of rat ornithine transcarbamylase into isolated rat liver mitochondria. 37% of the conjugated fraction associated with mitoplasts after digitonin treatment was completely translocated into the matrix. The electroporation technique described here is so far the most effective means for introduction of exogenous DNA of a size of at least 7.2 kilobases into the matrix of mammalian mitochondria. This method should allow the effective introduction of functional nucleic acid sequences into viable mitochondria in vitro and thereby be of great value for the elucidation of mitochondrial gene expression. We also believe that this technique may constitute a first step toward a novel approach of gene therapy for mitochondrial disorders. We are, however, aware of the multitude of problems to be solved before this is likely to become feasible. Among them are the need to adapt this method for the size of mitochondrial DNA and/or to construct a “minimal” functional mitochondrial genome incorporating a corrective sequence, the demonstration of stable replication and expression of such construct in mitochondria, and finally the ability to introduce such manipulated mitochondria into cells in vitro and in vivo. We have chosen the X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency as a model for such an approach and have synthesized a gene encoding human ornithine transcarbamylase according to mitochondrial codon usage (4Wheeler V.C. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Williamson R. Coutelle C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 251-255Google Scholar). We have recently inserted this gene sequence into the cloned mouse mitochondrial genome between two contiguous tRNAs, giving it the potential to be processed from the primary mitochondrial transcript. 2V. C. Wheeler, M. Aitken, and C. Coutelle, manuscript in preparation. We plan to introduce this construct by the described electroporation method into mitochondria and to test for expression using an in organello expression system (23McLean J.R. Cohn G.L. Brandt I.K. Simpson M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 657-663Google Scholar). If successful, we will attempt correction of this defect by introduction of mitochondria containing this modified genome into ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient hepatocytes or oocytes from spf or spf-ash mice (24Doolittle D.P. Hulbert L.L. Cordy C. J. Hered. 1974; 65: 194-195Google Scholar, 25DeMars R. LeVan S.L. Trend B.L. Russell L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1515337665,"Patients with skeletal muscle catabolism (cachexia) fail to conserve the skeletal muscle protein and release large amounts of nitrogen as urea. Previous studies suggest that the threshold for the conversion of amino acids into other forms of chemical energy and the concomitant production of urea are regulated by the plasma cystine level and hepatic cysteine catabolism. Studies of plasma amino acid exchange rates in the lower extremities now show that healthy young subjects regulate their plasma cystine level in a process that may be described as controlled constructive catabolism. The term controlled describes the fact that the release of cystine and other amino acids from the peripheral tissue is negatively correlated with (certain) plasma amino acid levels. The term constructive describes the fact that the release of cystine is correlated with an increase of the plasma cystine level. The regulation of the plasma cystine level is disturbed in conditions with progressive skeletal muscle catabolism including cancer, HIV infection, and old age. These conditions show also a low plasma glutamine:cystine ratio indicative of an impaired hepatic cystine catabolism. In HIV+ patients and SIV-infected macaques, a decrease of the plasma cystine level was found to coincide with the decrease of CD4+ T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013151547,"The mechanism by which single-chain urokinase (scuPA) binds to its receptor (uPAR) is incompletely understood. We report that a fragment comprising the first domain of recombinant soluble uPAR (sDI) as well as a fragment comprising the remaining domains (sDII-DIII) competes with the binding of recombinant full-length soluble uPAR (suPAR) to scuPA with an IC50 = 253 nM and an IC50 = 1569, respectively. sDII-III binds directly to scuPA with Kd = 238 nM. Binding of scuPA to each fragment also induces the expression of plasminogen activator activity. sDI and sDII-DIII (200 nM each) induced activity equal to 66 and 36% of the maximum activity induced by full-length suPAR (5 nM), respectively. Each fragment also stimulates the binding of scuPA to cells lacking endogenous uPAR. Although scuPA binds to sDI and to sDII-DIII through its amino-terminal fragment, the fragments act synergistically to inhibit the binding of suPAR and to stimulate plasminogen activator activity. Furthermore, sDII-DIII retards the velocity and alters the pattern of cleavage of sDI by chymotrypsin. These results suggest that binding of scuPA to more than one epitope in suPAR is required for its optimal activation and association with cell membranes."

In particular, Mft52 is required for the delivery of fusion proteins such as COXIV-DHFR, where the only targeting information is encoded at the extreme amino terminus of the precursor protein, the first part of the precursor to emerge from the ribosome. Mft52 has an “acid-bristle” domain, homologous to that found in the presequence-binding subunits of the import receptor on the mitochondrial surface (14Lithgow T. Junne T. Suda K. Gratzer S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11973-11977Google Scholar, 15Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Google Scholar). We propose that Mft52 functions to usher nascent precursor proteins to the mitochondria."

The mechanism of E*I* formation is incompletely understood and continues to be a source of controversy. Kinetic evidence exists that formation of E*I* proceeds via a Michaelis complex (E·;I) and so involves at least two steps. In this paper, we determine the rate of E*I* formation from α-chymotrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin using two approaches: first, by stopped-flow spectrofluorometric monitoring of the fluorescent change resulting from reaction of α-chymotrypsin with a fluorescent derivative of α1-antichymotrypsin (derivatized at position P7 of the reactive center loop); and second, by a rapid mixing/quench approach and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. In some cases, serpins are both substrates and inhibitors of the same enzyme. Our results indicate the presence of an intermediate between E·;I and E*I* and suggest that the partitioning step between inhibitor and substrate pathways precedes P1-P1′ cleavage.

The ratio of moles of inhibitor required per mole of proteinase for 100% inhibition is defined as the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI).

The position of cleavage in released I* occurs within a so-called “reactive center loop,” which in intact I extends out from the rest of the molecule, contains a segment of modified α-helix (17Stein P.E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 150-154Google Scholar), and is the primary interaction site between the inhibitor and the target proteinase. Following standard nomenclature (22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar), the position of cleavage takes place between the P1 and P1′ sites of the inhibitor, which in ACT corresponds to positions 358 and 359. Residues proceeding toward the N and C termini from P1 and P1′, respectively, are labeled with higher P and P′ numbers. The reactive center loop extends from approximately P17 to P9′. Cleavage of intact I to form I* is accompanied by a large decrease in free energy and a substantial gain in stability toward denaturation by either heating or denaturing agents (23Bruch M. Weiss V.

These results, coupled with the observation that E*I* dissociates on treatment with hydroxylamine (34Owen G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 405: 380-387Google Scholar), provide strong evidence that the covalent bond within E*I* is between the proteinase active site serine hydroxyl (Ser-195 in α-chymotrypsin) and the liberated P1 carboxyl of the serpin and corresponds either to acyl-enzyme or to the tetrahedral intermediate (35Matheson N.R. van Halbeek H. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13489-13491Google Scholar) resulting from water attack on the acyl-enzyme. Indeed, these species may be in mobile equilibrium with each other.Formation of the E*I* complex requires completion of a minimum of three processes: 1) establishment of P1 interaction with the S1-binding site of the enzyme and of perhaps subsite interactions as well, necessitating at least partial unwinding of the helical portion of the reactive center loop; 2) partial or full insertion of strand 4A into β-sheet A (18Carrell R.W.

However, the relative timing of these processes is unknown.In this paper, we determine the rate of E*I* formation from E·;I using two approaches. In the first, we derivatize the A352C-rACT variant (at position P7) with the fluorescent reagent 4-bromomethyl-7-methoxycoumarin (BMMC), demonstrate that the resulting (7-methoxycoumaryl-4)-methyl derivative of A352C-rACT (MCM-A352C-rACT) inhibits α-chymotrypsin in the normal manner, and measure its rate of complex formation with α-chymotrypsin by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry. In the second, we apply a rapid mixing/quench approach and SDS-PAGE analysis to determine the rate of E*I* formation on reaction of either MCM-A352C-rACT or rACT with α-chymotrypsin.

However, the intracellular signals that follow receptor activation and lead to the different cellular responses to TGFβ are still largely unknown. On the basis of the different sensitivity to the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine and the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, we identified two distinct pathways through which TGFβ activates a genomic response. Consistently, 2-aminopurine prevented and okadaic acid potentiated the induction of JE by TGFβ. The induction of PAI-1 and junB was instead potentiated by 2-aminopurine, after a transient inhibition and was unaffected by okadaic acid. The superinducing effect of 2-aminopurine required the presence of a functional RB protein since it was abolished in SV40 large T antigen-transfected cells, absent in the BT549 and Saos-2 RB-defective cell lines, and restored in BT549 and Saos-2 cells after reintroduction of pRB.

Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Google Scholar), the biochemical pathways acting downstream of these receptors are still largely uncharacterized. With few exceptions (8Ong G. Sikora K. Gullick W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 761-763Google Scholar), in epithelial cells TGFβ-mediated growth inhibition correlates with the G1 inhibition of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product, pRB (1Roberts A.B.

Several events contribute to preventing pRB phosphorylation in TGFβ-treated cells: suppression of CDK4 synthesis (10Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Google Scholar), down-regulation of cyclins and cdks expression (11Geng Y. Weinberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most of the other cellular responses to TGFβ, including control of extracellular matrix protein deposition, wound healing, and immune suppression are proposed to be mediated by controlling the expression of specific genes (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer, Heidelberg1990: 419-431Google Scholar). In many cases this is regulated at the transcriptional level through the binding of specific transcription factors to stimulatory sequences, as in the case of PAI-1 (15Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Google Scholar), JE (16Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 419-426Google Scholar), p21CIP1 (17Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X-F. J. Biol.

In the case of c-myc the same promoter region, the TGFβ control element, is required for down-regulation of c-myc by both TGFβ and the retinoblastoma protein (21Pientepol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E.

Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Google Scholar) and for down-regulation of N-myc in embryonic lung organ cultures (23Serra R. Moses H.L. Development. 1995; 121: 3057-3066Google Scholar). In contrast, in Mv1Lu cells, pRB appears not to be required for PAI-1, junB, and fibronectin induction by TGFβ (24Laiho M. Ronnstrand L. Heino J. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Google Scholar, 25Zentella A. Weis F.M.B. Ralph D.A. Laiho M. Massague J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 4952-4958Google Scholar). 2-Aminopurine (2-AP) is a serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor initially described for its ability to inhibit the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (26Zinn K. Keller A. Whittmore L-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Google Scholar). It was also shown to inhibit expression of interferon-induced genes, to block serum and platelet-derived growth factor induction of c-fos and c-myc (27Tiwari R.K. Kusari J. Kumar R. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4289-4294Google Scholar, 28Mahadevan L.C. Wills A.J. Hirst E.A. Rathjen P.D. Heat J.K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 327-335Google Scholar) and to modulate the expression of a group of genes specifically expressed in growth-arrested cells (29Ciccarelli C. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1525-1529Google Scholar). Okadaic acid is a fatty acid that has tumor promoter activity on mouse skin (30Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar); however, it does not activate or bind protein kinase C. It is, on the contrary, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (30Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar). Although their broad and still not completely characterized activity may limit the interpretation of the results obtained by their means, 2-AP and okadaic acid have successfully been employed for testing the involvement of protein kinases and phosphatases in several signal transduction pathways (26Zinn K. Keller A. Whittmore L-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Google Scholar–30Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar). To better understand the role of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of pre-existing proteins, on the signal transduction pathway(s) activated by TGFβ we have analyzed the effect of 2-AP and okadaic acid on the activation of gene expression and the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by TGFβ. In particular we report here on the regulation of three genes involved in different biological effects initiated by TGFβ: (i) JE, a monocyte chemoattractant (16Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 419-426Google Scholar); (ii) PAI-1, whose induction by TGFβ is an important step in the control of extracellular matrix deposition (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer, Heidelberg1990: 419-431Google Scholar, 15Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Google Scholar); and (iii) junB, an early responsive gene involved in the control of growth and differentiation which is regulated by TGFβ in most cell types (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer, Heidelberg1990: 419-431Google Scholar). The effects of 2-AP on TGFβ-induced pRB dephosphorylation and growth inhibition were also investigated. According to the sensitivity to 2-AP and okadaic acid we identified two different pathways through which TGFβ stimulates gene expression. 2-AP, which is able to prevent TGFβ-inducible expression of several genes, potentiates the induction of PAI-1 and junB by TGFβ, after a transient inhibition. In addition we show that potentiation of TGFβ-inducible junB expression by 2-AP requires a functional RB protein. Therefore 2-AP unravels a role for pRB in a distinct pathway leading to the up-regulation of junB and possibly other genes by TGFβ. All the different cell types were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 units/ml streptomycin, with the only exception of Saos-2 requiring RPMI 1640 medium. pPVU-01.5.3, Saos-2 #84, Saos-2 #1, and BTB5V4-RB were cultured in the presence of Geneticin or Geneticin and hygromicin as specified elsewhere (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar, 31Gjetting T. Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 441-446Google Scholar, 32Fung Y-K.T. T'Ang A. Linn Murphree A. Zhang F-H. Qui W-R. Wang S-W. Shi X-H. Lee L. Driscoll B. Wu K-J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2659-2672Google Scholar). For stimulation studies, unless differently specified, cells were grown to subconfluency and then transferred in serum-free medium containing 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with TGFβ1 (Sigma; 1-5 ng/ml) and/or 2-AP (10 mM), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), phorbol ester (TPA, 100 ng/ml), and okadaic acid (10 ng/ml). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in guanidinium thiocyanate buffer, and total RNA was isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation. 20 μg of total RNAs were denatured with formamide and formaldehyde, fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon Gene Screen Plus hybridization membranes (DuPont) by overnight blotting. Filters were hybridized overnight with 2 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probes/ml. DNA probes were labeled by random priming to an efficiency of 0.5-1 × 109 cpm/μg. Filters were washed to a final concentration of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and autoradiographed at −70°C with intensifying screens. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off plates into hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium orthophosphate, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin) and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. After three cycles of freeze-thaw, the lysates were passed several times through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein (usually 30-60 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8.5%), electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-RB (IF8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Cell cycle analysis was performed as described previously (33Screpanti I. Scarpa S. Meco D. Bellavia D. Stuppia L. Frati L. Modesti A. Gulino A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 183-192Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells for each sample were fixed in 70% cold ethanol for 30 min at 4°C and, after washes in cold phosphate-buffered saline, treated with RNase (0.5 mg/ml) and stained with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were then kept in the dark at 4°C for 30 min and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry in a linear scale using a FACscan cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cell debris and doublets were excluded from the analysis by appropriate gating using physical parameters. Fluorescence data were analyzed by the Consort 30 software. The induction of PAI-1 and junB mRNAs is a relatively early response of different cell types to TGFβ treatment, while induction of JE mRNA is considered a late effect. Despite the differences in their kinetic, the accumulation of JE, PAI-1, and junB mRNAs upon treatment with TGFβ is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level and does not require ongoing protein synthesis (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer, Heidelberg1990: 419-431Google Scholar, 16Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 419-426Google Scholar). To verify the possible role of serine/threonine protein kinases on TGFβ-specific pathway(s), mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells were treated with 2-AP both in the absence and presence of TGFβ for 1-6 h. Treatment of cycling Mv1Lu cells with TGFβ resulted in a biphasic up-regulation of the JE mRNA with an initial peak after 1 h, a decline to the control level around 3 h, followed by a second gradual increase beginning at 6 h (Fig. 1A) and reaching the plateau level by 12-24 h (not shown). Addition of 2-AP diminished both the basal and the TGFβ-stimulated levels of JE mRNA irrespective of the length of the treatment (Fig. 1A). As expected PAI-1 and junB expression was up-regulated within 1 h of treatment with TGFβ and gradually decreased between 3 and 6 h (Fig. 1A). Addition of 2-AP showed an inhibitory effect on the TGFβ-mediated induction of PAI-1 and junB mRNAs after 1 h of treatment. However, when applied for either 3 or 6 h, 2-AP appeared to specifically superinduce PAI-1 and junB expression activated by TGFβ, without a significant effect on their basal level (Fig. 1A). Neither the inhibitory nor the stimulatory effect of 2-AP were inhibited by contemporary addition of cycloheximide (not shown). To better characterize the described effect of 2-AP on PAI-1 and junB expression induced by TGFβ, Mv1Lu cells were exposed to 2-AP for time intervals of different length, before they were stimulated with TGFβ for 1 h. Addition of 2-AP within 5 min prior to the stimulation with TGFβ consistently reduced the up-regulation of JE, PAI-1, and junB mRNAs (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of JE induction could also be observed in cells that were exposed to 2-AP for 2 or 5 h (Fig. 1B). On the contrary, up-regulation of PAI-1 and junB mRNA by TGFβ was higher in cells subjected to such a long-term pre-exposure to 2-AP compared to control cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate on the specificity of action of 2-AP, we also studied its effect on the genomic response initiated by phorbol ester (TPA), a known activator of protein kinase C. Treatment of Mv1Lu cells with TPA for 6 h also increased the level of JE, PAI-1, and junB mRNAs (Fig. 1C). Contemporary addition of 2-AP slightly reduced JE up-regulation in cells treated with TPA (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, 2-AP did not modify the response of PAI-1 and only modestly affected the response of junB to TPA, suggesting that the late superinducing effect on PAI-1 and junB expression is specific to the regulation of these genes by TGFβ. Given the opposite sensitivity to 2-AP of PAI-1 and junB compared to JE expression induced by TGFβ, we tested the effect of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatase 1 and 2A. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid did not affect expression of the basal levels of PAI-1 mRNA in Mv1Lu cells, while it slightly increased the level of junB and JE after 6 h (Fig. 2). However, while okadaic acid did not interfere with the induction of PAI-1 and junB expression by either TGFβ (Fig. 2) or TGFβ plus 2-AP (not shown), it caused a small but reproducible increase of the level of JE mRNA induced by TGFβ (Fig. 2). In cells stimulated with TGFβ and okadaic acid, 2-AP induced a reduction of the JE mRNA (not shown), although less severe than that induced in cells treated with TGFβ alone, meaning that also the superinduction due to okadaic acid of the TGFβ-stimulated expression of JE is negatively affected by 2-AP. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, pRB, is considered one of the most important targets for TGFβ action in several cell lines, including Mv1Lu. In this cell type the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ was shown to be correlated to the inhibition of pRB phosphorylation (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar). To ascertain if treatment with kinase inhibitor 2-AP could also affect the TGFβ-activated pathways leading to pRB dephosphorylation and/or to the cell cycle arrest, actively growing Mv1Lu cells were treated with TGFβ, 2-AP, or a combination of the two substances for 1-24 h. The relative protein extracts were analyzed by Western blot for the detection of pRB isoforms. In the same experiment duplicates of the different cell culture samples were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to cell cycle FACS analysis. One representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3. As previously reported (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar), in actively proliferating Mv1Lu cells the majority of pRB appeared in its hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 3). Hypophosphorylated pRB started to accumulate within 3-6 h of treatment with TGFβ and after 24 h virtually all pRB was in its hypophosphorylated form in TGFβ-treated cells. Although Mv1Lu cells are very sensitive to contact inhibition, a condition in which accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRB is also observed, this did not limit our analysis since pRB was still fully phosphorylated in control cells which were maintained in culture for 24 h without any treatment (Fig. 3, last lane). The addition of 2-AP to TGFβ did not prevent the accumulation of the hypophosphorylated isoform of pRB induced by TGFβ, independent of the length of the exposure to both agents (Fig. 3). 2-AP itself was able to induce accumulation of the hypophosphorylated pRB isoform (Fig. 3), with a maximum effect after 24 h. However, after such a long treatment a considerable amount of pRB was still hyperphosphorylated in 2-AP-treated cells, but not in cells treated with both TGFβ and 2-AP. The cell cycle analysis of the duplicate samples revealed that treatment with TGFβ induced accumulation of the cells in the G1 and a strong reduction of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. This effect was maximum after 24 h and clearly distinct from the spontaneous increase in the number of G1 cells due to the contact inhibition observed in control cells maintained in culture for 24 (Fig. 3, last lane) (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar). In contrast, 2-AP induced an increase in the number of cells with a G2/M DNA content detected as early as 1-3 h after the beginning of the treatment and maximum after 6 h (Fig. 3). This effect was also accompanied by the reduction in the number G1 cells, whereas S phase cell number was only modestly affected by 2-AP, under these conditions. In the presence of both TGFβ and 2-AP the majority of the cells progressively accumulated in a G2/M DNA content state, similar to 2-AP-treated cells. However, after 24 h we observed a strong reduction in the number of cells in the S phase, which suggests that even under these conditions Mv1Lu cells are sensitive to TGFβ growth inhibitory signals. To study whether pRB could be involved in the specific response generated by 2-AP on TGFβ-induced gene expression, we investigated the effects of 2-AP on the induction of JE, PAI-1, and junB mRNAs by TGFβ in the pPVU-01.5.3, a Mv1Lu clone transfected with the SV40 large T antigen (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar). In these cells, large T antigen binding to pRB has been related to the loss of response to the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ (9Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Google Scholar), although they retain the capability to up-regulate junB and extracellular matrix proteins upon TGFβ treatment (24Laiho M. Ronnstrand L. Heino J. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Google Scholar). In keeping with these observations we found that TGFβ induced PAI-1, junB, and JE expression in pPVU-01.5.3 clone (Fig. 4) with a similar kinetic when compared to the parental Mv1Lu cell line (Fig. 1A). Contemporary addition of 2-AP was able to inhibit the induction of JE throughout the 1-6 h treatment and the induction of PAI-1 and junB mRNAs after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 4), as previously observed for Mv1Lu cells. However, we failed to detect the expected superinducing effect of 2-AP, which instead inhibited the TGFβ-inducible expression of both PAI-1 and junB in the pPVU-01.5.3 clone even after 3 and 6 h of treatment (Fig. 4). These results indicate that, while the early inhibitory effect of 2-AP on TGFβ-induced expression of JE, PAI-1, and junB is unaffected by the presence of the large T antigen, the late superinducing effect of 2-AP is negatively regulated by the large T antigen possibly through its binding to pRB. Since large T antigen binds and possibly inactivates several cellular proteins in addition to pRB, we sought to investigate the effect of 2-AP on TGFβ-induced gene expression on different cell lines expressing a functional pRB (A549, PMC42, and HaCat) compared to cell lines harboring inactive RB alleles (BT549 and Saos-2) (Ref. 34Lukas J. Muller H. Bartkova J. Spitkovsky D. Kjeruff A.A. Jansen-Durr P. Strauss M. Bartek J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 625-638Google Scholar and references therein). The above mentioned cell lines were treated with TGFβ, 2-AP, or a combination of the two for 1-6 h and junB expression was investigated by Northern blot and quantified by densitometric scanning of the x-ray films. To ensure a better comparison of the rough data, the absolute numeric values were converted to junB percent fold induction, with 100% arbitrarily assigned to the highest value of junB induction after TGFβ treatment. On the contrary we could not evaluate the effect of 2-AP on TGFβ-inducible expression of the PAI-1 mRNA since several cell lines did not up-regulate PAI-1 expression in response to TGFβ. In the RB-positive A549, PMC42 (Fig. 5A), and HaCat cells (not shown) 2-AP prevented the induction of junB mRNA occurring after 1 h of treatment with TGFβ, but it superinduced the same mRNA after 3 and 6 h. On the contrary 2-AP inhibited the TGFβ-regulated junB expression even after 3 and 6 h in RB-defective Saos-2 and BT549 cell lines (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5The superinducing effect of 2-AP on the TGFβ-inducible junB expression correlates with the expression of a functional pRB. PMC42, A549, BT549, and Saos-2 cell lines, selected for their property to own either a functional or a deleted pRB, were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 (solid symbols) or TGFβ1 and 2-AP (open symbols) for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for junB expression by Northern blot. Data resulting from densitometric scanning are expressed as percent of the junB fold induction. 100% was arbitrarily assigned to the highest value of junB induction after TGFβ treatment. A, RB positive cells, A549 (diamonds) and PMC42 (triangles) are compared to the parental Mv1Lu cells (squares, graphical representation of Northern blot shown in Fig. 1A). B, RB negative cells BT549 (triangles) and Saos-2 (diamonds) are compared with the pPVU-O1.5.3 clone (squares, graphical representation of Northern blot shown in Fig. 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the involvement of pRB in the superinduction of junB mRNA upon treatment with both TGFβ and 2-AP, we also analyzed the response of three different RB-reconstituted clones (Fig. 6). The BTB5V4-RB is a BT549 stable transfectant in which the full-length human RB cDNA is located under a tetracycline-controlled promoter (31Gjetting T. Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 441-446Google Scholar). As previously observed (31Gjetting T. Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 441-446Google Scholar), tetracycline-treated cells expressed a discrete amount of pRB, which could be increased after 48 h of culture in the absence of tetracycline (Fig. 6A). Saos-2 cells express a truncated and nonfunctional p95RB (Fig. 6B). Saos-2 number 1 and Saos-2 number 84 are two RB-reconstituted clones (32Fung Y-K.T. T'Ang A. Linn Murphree A. Zhang F-H. Qui W-R. Wang S-W. Shi X-H. Lee L. Driscoll B. Wu K-J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2659-2672Google Scholar) expressing low levels of the exogenous p105RB (Fig. 6B). All these cell lines responded to TGFβ with an early up-regulation of junB mRNA (Fig. 6C). Addition of 2-AP to the treatment prevented junB induction by TGFβ after 1 h, whereas it clearly showed a superinducing effect after 3 h of treatment in RB-reconstituted BTB5V4-RB cells which was further enhanced under conditions in which pRB expression was further induced by the removal of tetracycline from the culture medium (Fig. 6C; compare with parental BT549 in Fig. 5B). A similar response to 2-AP was found in the pRB-reconstituted Saos-2 #1 and Saos-2 #84 clones (Fig. 6C; compare with parental Saos-2 in Fig. 5B), confirming that the introduction of a functional RB gene is sufficient to reconstitute the TGFβ-dependent superinduction of junB mRNA in response to 2-AP. Taken together these observations clearly indicate that the late superinducing effect of 2-AP on TGFβ inducible junB expression is dependent on the presence of functional pRB while its early inhibi"
