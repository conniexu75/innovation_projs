The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology."

Here, we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR system to function with custom guide RNA (gRNA) in human cells. For the endogenous AAVS1 locus, we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25% in 293T cells, 13 to 8% in K562 cells, and 2 to 4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that this process relies on CRISPR components; is sequence-specific; and, upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs, can effect multiplex editing of target loci. We also compute a genome-wide resource of ~190 K unique gRNAs targeting ~40.5% of human exons. Our results establish an RNA-guided editing tool for facile, robust, and multiplexable human genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2086409213,"Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Thomas O'Brien and colleagues report the discovery of a new gene, INFL4, encoding interferon-λ4, that is upstream of INFL3 (IL28B). A compound dinucleotide frameshift genetic variant in INFL4 creates the full-length INFL4 protein and is more strongly associated with hepatitis C virus clearance in individuals of African ancestry than rs12979860, a known variant associated with clearance. Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. We performed RNA sequencing in primary human hepatocytes activated with synthetic double-stranded RNA to mimic HCV infection. Upstream of IFNL3 (IL28B) on chromosome 19q13.13, we discovered a new transiently induced region that harbors a dinucleotide variant ss469415590 (TT or ΔG), which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860, a genetic marker strongly associated with HCV clearance. ss469415590[ΔG] is a frameshift variant that creates a novel gene, designated IFNL4, encoding the interferon-λ4 protein (IFNL4), which is moderately similar to IFNL3. Compared to rs12979860, ss469415590 is more strongly associated with HCV clearance in individuals of African ancestry, although it provides comparable information in Europeans and Asians. Transient overexpression of IFNL4 in a hepatoma cell line induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of HCV clearance and its clinical management."

Mammalian hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain cell cycle quiescence in a hypoxic microenvironment. It has been proposed that HSCs exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype under these conditions. Here we directly investigated this idea using metabolomic analysis and found that HSCs generate adenosine-5′-triphosphate by anaerobic glycolysis through a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk)-dependent mechanism. Elevated Pdk expression leads to active suppression of the influx of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria. Pdk overexpression in glycolysis-defective HSCs restored glycolysis, cell cycle quiescence, and stem cell capacity, while loss of both Pdk2 and Pdk4 attenuated HSC quiescence, glycolysis, and transplantation capacity. Moreover, treatment of HSCs with a Pdk mimetic promoted their survival and transplantation capacity. Thus, glycolytic metabolic status governed by Pdk acts as a cell cycle checkpoint that modulates HSC quiescence and function.

Although stem cells probably exhibit metabolic characteristics allowing them to meet diverse energy demands, it is not known whether their metabolic phenotype differs from that of transiently amplifying progenitors and terminally differentiated cells and, if so, how metabolic phenotypes directly define stem cell identity (Suda et al., 2011Suda T.

Cells generate adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the major currency for energy-consuming reactions, through central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The mammalian HSC system is maintained by self-renewal of quiescent long-term (LT)-HSCs and subsequent generation of short-term (ST)-HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs), and various lineage-restricted progenies (Zon, 2008Zon L.I.

LT-HSCs maintain cell cycle quiescence through precise regulation of levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor responsive to cellular and systemic hypoxia (Takubo et al., 2010Takubo K.

Although the ratio of ATP generation to glucose consumption under anaerobic glycolysis is inefficient compared with that supported by OXPHOS, the rate of ATP production under hypoxia potentially increases 100-fold compared to that supported by mitochondrial energy production under normoxia (Voet and Voet, 2010Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2010Google Scholar). HSCs are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and show low endogenous ROS levels. Aberrant ROS generation could abrogate various stem cell properties including cell cycle quiescence, self-renewal, survival, and multilineage differentiation capacity in HSCs (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K.

Because various mutant mice defective in LT-HSC maintenance display a wide range of bioenergetic defects in vivo, achieving a stable metabolic state in LT-HSCs is probably important for their maintenance (Liu et al., 2009Liu J.

Recently, Simsek et al. reported that LT-HSCs show higher glycolytic capacity than do cells in whole BM, which consists primarily of lineage marker+-differentiated cells (Lin+ cells) (Simsek et al., 2010Simsek T. Kocabas F. Zheng J. Deberardinis R.J. Mahmoud A.I. Olson E.N. Schneider J.W. Zhang C.C. Sadek H.A. The distinct metabolic profile of hematopoietic stem cells reflects their location in a hypoxic niche.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 380-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). This activity is regulated by Cripto-GRP78 signaling activated by HIF-1α (Miharada et al., 2011Miharada K. Karlsson G. Rehn M. Rörby E. Siva K. Cammenga J. Karlsson S. Cripto regulates hematopoietic stem cells as a hypoxic-niche-related factor through cell surface receptor GRP78.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 330-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these metabolic characteristics are common in primitive hematopoietic cells such as LT-HSCs and progenitors and required for their maintenance. In this study, we addressed the proposed “metabolic stemness” of HSCs, namely glycolytic activation, using metabolomics and genetics. During glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate and then anaerobically to lactate or aerobically to acetyl-CoA for use in mitochondrial metabolism. The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), whose activity is suppressed by phosphorylation by PDH kinases (Pdks) (Harris et al., 2002Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Regulation of the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We observed that LT-HSCs show HIF-1α-mediated Pdk activation, resulting in maintenance of glycolytic flow and suppression of the influx of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria. Also, a glycolytic metabolic state was shown to promote LT-HSC cell cycle quiescence, an activity that could potentially be exploited to regulate the cell cycle in those cells in vitro and in vivo. In mice, loss of Pdk2 and Pdk4 resulted in defective maintenance of cell cycle quiescence and transplantation capacity and altered glycolytic metabolic properties in LT-HSCs. Treatment of LT-HSCs with a competitive inhibitor of PDH promoted maintenance of transplantation capacity in vitro. These observations suggest that Pdk-mediated antagonism of mitochondrial metabolism comprises a checkpoint required to establish a metabolic state favoring cell cycle quiescence of LT-HSCs. To define specific metabolic characteristics of hypoxic LT-HSCs, we performed metabolome analyses with capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) (Soga et al., 2003Soga T. Ohashi Y. Ueno Y. Naraoka H. Tomita M. Nishioka T. Quantitative metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry.J.

Sakuragawa T. et al.Cystathionine beta-synthase as a carbon monoxide-sensitive regulator of bile excretion.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using at least 1 × 106 murine BM LT-HSCs (CD34−Flt3− Lineage marker− Sca-1+ c-Kit+; CD34−Flt3− LSK cells) and their progeny, including ST-HSCs (CD34+Flt3− LSK cells), MPPs (CD34+Flt3+ LSK cells), myeloid progenitors (MPs; Lin− c-Kit+ Sca-1− cells), and differentiated hematopoietic cells (Gr-1/Mac-1+ myeloid cells, CD4/CD8+ T cells, and B220+ B cells) to assess levels of intracellular metabolites functioning in central carbon metabolism. We replicated the analysis and show one representative result in Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online (Figure 1A is an extract of Figure S1A). Notably, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP), a product of the rate-limiting step of glycolysis catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk-1), was observed only in LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs (Figures 1A and S1A). Because F1,6BP is a strong allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase (PK) (Voet and Voet, 2010Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2010Google Scholar), LT-HSCs probably support glycolytic metabolism required to produce PK-dependent ATP. Because low levels of the Pfk-1 substrate fructose-6-phosphate were also observed in LT-HSCs, the rate-limiting Pfk-1 reaction is probably activated in LT-HSCs (Figures 1A and S1A). In addition, pyruvate, a byproduct of PK-dependent ATP generation, accumulated to high levels in LT-HSCs (Figures 1A and S1A), while levels of phosphoenolpyruvate, a PK substrate, remained low (Figures 1A and S1A). Mitochondrial OXPHOS is fueled by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Among TCA cycle-related metabolites, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and both acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA were not detected in any hematopoietic fraction (Figure S1A). In support of metabolomics profiling data shown in Figures 1A and S1A, we found that various glycolytic enzymes were more highly expressed in LT-HSCs than in progenitors or terminally differentiated cells (Figure S1B), suggesting that LT-HSCs utilize glycolysis for energy generation (Voet and Voet, 2010Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2010Google Scholar). Interestingly, LT-HSC ATP levels were lowest among various primitive hematopoietic cell fractions in the BM (Figure 1B). The Side Population (SP) phenotype of LT-HSCs is marked by expression of the ATP-dependent transporter Bcrp1 (Goodell et al., 1996Goodell M.A. Brose K. Paradis G. Conner A.S. Mulligan R.C.

Med. 2001; 7: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) and maintained by intracellular ATP production. The SP phenotype of normal LT-HSCs was sensitive to treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) (Figure 1C). Treatment of BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) with the respiration inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3), even at concentrations (20 mM) sufficient to inhibit OXPHOS, moderately reduced SP phenotypes in LT-HSCs (Figure 1C). Glucose uptake by cells from primitive fractions including LT- or ST-HSCs or MPPs was higher than that seen in myeloid progenitor or lineage marker+ fractions (Figure 1D). The activity of pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes an ATP-generating step in glycolysis, was highest in LT-HSCs among various BM fractions (Figure 1E). Overall, these observations suggest that only LT-HSCs, rather than transiently amplifying progenitors or terminally differentiated cells, can survive independent of mitochondrial energy generation, possibly through suppression of the PDH-E1α subunit by Pdk-dependent phosphorylation (depicted schematically in Figure 2A). Expression of all murine Pdk family members (Pdk1–Pdk4) (Harris et al., 2002Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Regulation of the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) was high in LT-HSCs (Figure 2B), and PDH-E1α was more highly phosphorylated in LT-HSCs than in their differentiated progeny (Figures 2C and 2D). The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was lowest in LT-HSCs, dynamically upregulated after their differentiation into ST-HSCs, and slightly decreased in MPPs or MPs (Figure 2E). The higher OCR seen in fractions other than LT-HSCs was probably maintained by mitochondrial oxygen consumption, as treatment with oligomycin, which inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthase, clearly suppressed the OCR in these cells (Figure 2E). These findings are in accord with the idea that LT-HSCs survive in a hypoxic environment and are less dependent on mitochondrial oxygen-consuming metabolism than more differentiated cells (Figure 2E). To determine whether a HIF-1α-dependent crucial checkpoint maintains anaerobic metabolic stemness in LT-HSCs, we examined parameters relevant to metabolism in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs. We found that HIF-1α deficiency was accompanied by decreased expression of various glycolytic enzymes in LT-HSCs (Figure S2). Glucose uptake was identical at various differentiation stages in HIF-1αΔ/Δ BM (Figure 3A), although an essential glucose transporter, Glut1, was significantly downregulated in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figure S2). Glycolytic LDH activity in normal LT-HSCs was higher than that seen in CD34+ LSK progenitors (the sum of ST-HSCs plus MPPs) and was decreased in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figure 3B). We found that LT-HSCs release lactate into the culture medium only under hypoxia and those levels decrease in the case of HIF-1α deficiency (Figure 3C). Because intracellular levels of lactate, a product of the LDH reaction, in LT-HSCs and their differentiated progeny were unchanged (Figures 1A and S1A), we conclude that LT-HSCs probably rapidly release lactate generated by glycolysis into the extracellular space. Intracellular pyruvate levels, which are high in LT-HSCs (Figures 1A and S1A), were decreased by HIF-1α deficiency (Figure 3D). These data suggest that, in the hypoxic niche, LT-HSCs suppress flux of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria for the TCA cycle and HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs show defective conversion of pyruvate to lactate, an activity maintained through the suppression of PDH by Pdk. In support of this, phosphorylation of the α subunit of PDH-E1 is attenuated in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figure 3E). Overall ATP production was considerably decreased in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs compared to HIF-1αΔ/Δ CD34+ LSK progenitors (Figure 3F), suggesting that ATP production in the former is dependent on HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis and that mitochondrial metabolism is suppressed by Pdk. Overall mitochondrial mass in wild-type LT-HSCs was smaller than that seen in wild-type CD34+ LSK progenitors (Figure 3G). In HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs, mitochondrial volume and expression of the mitochondrial respiratory component COX4-1 (Fukuda et al., 2007Fukuda R. Zhang H. Kim J.W. Shimoda L. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. HIF-1 regulates cytochrome oxidase subunits to optimize efficiency of respiration in hypoxic cells.Cell. 2007; 129: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) were higher than that seen in wild-type LT-HSCs (Figures 3G and 3H). These data suggest that HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs exhibit decreased dependence on anaerobic glycolysis and activate mitochondrial aerobic metabolism due to loss of a metabolic checkpoint regulated by PDH-E1α subunit phosphorylation status. To directly analyze metabolic changes in HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs, we analyzed the SP phenotype. Overall, the HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK fraction showed significant loss of the SP phenotype after treatment with 20 mM NaN3 (Figure S3A), suggesting that, in the case of HIF-1α deficiency, compensatory mitochondrial aerobic metabolism supports ATP production in the primitive hematopoietic fraction. By contrast, LSK cells deficient in VHL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting HIF-1α (Semenza, 2010Semenza G.L. Oxygen homeostasis.Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med. 2010; 2: 336-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), showed significantly reduced mitochondrial volume compared to wild-type LSK cells (Figure S3B). Because normal quiescent HSCs have relatively little cytoplasm and contain few inactive mitochondria (Kim et al., 1998Kim M. Cooper D.D. Hayes S.F. Spangrude G.J. Rhodamine-123 staining in hematopoietic stem cells of young mice indicates mitochondrial activation rather than dye efflux.Blood. 1998; 91: 4106-4117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 3G), the decreased mitochondrial mass seen in VHLΔ/Δ LSK cells suggests that active regulatory mechanisms function in HIF-1α dose-dependent energy production in primitive hematopoietic cells. The decreased glycolysis and activated mitochondrial energy metabolism seen in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figure 3) suggest that HIF-1α-dependent remodeling of metabolic pathways by Pdk-mediated antagonism of PDH activity occurs in LT-HSCs. Notably, among Pdk family members, Pdk2 and Pdk4 mRNA levels were positively correlated with HIF-1α expression in LT-HSCs (Figure 4A). Their mRNA levels decreased in the case of HIF-1α deficiency and increased in the presence of VHL deficiency (Figure 4A). Increased Pdk mRNA levels were suppressed by deletion of both HIF-1α and VHL (Figure 4A). Exposure of LT-HSCs to hypoxia increased expression of Pdk4 but not Pdk2 (Figure S4A), suggesting oxygen-dependent and -independent roles for HIF-1α for the expression of these two genes. To verify that Pdks function as HIF-1α effectors in HSC maintenance, we transduced LT-HSCs or LSK cells with retrovirus expressing Pdk2 or Pdk4 (Figures 4B and S4B). Pdk misexpression (at mRNA levels 100- to 1,000-fold greater than normal) by retrovirus-restored phosphorylation of the PDH-E1α subunit in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs (Figure 4C) and glycolytic activity in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells, as measured by LDH activity (Figure 4D), and antagonized increased mitochondrial ROS generation seen under HIF-1α deficiency (Takubo et al., 2010Takubo K. Goda N. Yamada W. Iriuchishima H. Ikeda E. Kubota Y. Shima H. Johnson R.S. Hirao A. Suematsu M. Suda T. Regulation of the HIF-1alpha level is essential for hematopoietic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) (Figure S4D). The number of Ki67+ cycling cells also decreased in Pdk-transduced HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells (Figure 4E). For in vitro analysis of HSCs, we utilized the SLAM marker to detect HSCs in the LSK population because some LT-HSCs tend to express CD34 in vitro (Noda et al., 2008Noda S. Horiguchi K. Ichikawa H. Miyoshi H. Repopulating activity of ex vivo-expanded murine hematopoietic stem cells resides in the CD48-c-Kit+Sca-1+lineage marker- cell population.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HIF-1αΔ/Δ cells cultured in hypoxic conditions could not sustain an LT-HSC fraction, a deficiency rescued by the introduction of Pdk2 or Pdk4 into HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells (Figures 4F and 4G). To test reconstitution capacity, we transplanted 3,000 GFP+-HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells into lethally irradiated Ly5.1 (CD45.1+) congenic mice together with competitor BM (CD45.1+). Transduced LSK cells in every group contained a similar number of LT-HSCs, as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Twelve weeks after BM transplantation (BMT), HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells transduced with GFP virus showed significantly decreased repopulation capacity, probably due to upregulation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LT-HSCs during transduction stress, as previously reported (Takubo et al., 2010Takubo K. Goda N. Yamada W. Iriuchishima H. Ikeda E. Kubota Y. Shima H. Johnson R.S. Hirao A. Suematsu M. Suda T. Regulation of the HIF-1alpha level is essential for hematopoietic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast, HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells transduced with either Pdk2 or Pdk4 virus showed substantial chimerism and multilineage reconstitution capacity in peripheral blood (PB) compared to control HIF-1αΔ/Δ cells (Figure 4H and Figure S4E). These experiments suggest that HIF-1α maintains substantial chimerism and multilineage reconstitution capacity through upregulation of Pdk2 and Pdk4 despite expression of other HIF-α family members (Figure S4C). To assess whether Pdk functions in LT-HSC maintenance downstream of HIF-1α, we examined hematopoiesis of Pdk2/Pdk4 double knockout mice (Dunford et al., 2011Dunford E.C. Herbst E.A. Jeoung N.H.

Peripheral blood counts indicated that these Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− mice were mildly but significantly anemic compared to control mice (Figure 5A). Various populations of differentiated and undifferentiated cells in the BM, spleen, and thymus were unchanged in number in Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− mice (Figures S5A–S5E). Progenitor capacity of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LSK cells, as assessed by the colony-forming capacity in semisolid methylcellulose plus cytokines, was identical to that of control cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that steady-state hematopoiesis and progenitor capacity is maintained in Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− mice. To investigate self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LT-HSCs, we performed BM transplantation of these cells with congenic competitors into lethally irradiated recipient mice. In contrast to the capacity of differentiated counterparts, LT-HSCs were defective in repopulation of primary recipient peripheral blood at 3–4 months after transplantation (Figure 5C). Four months after BMT, Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− donor-derived cells retained differentiation capacity of T, B, and myeloid cells comparable with control donor-derived cells (Figure 5D). At that time, recipients of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− donor cells exhibited less chimerism than did recipients of control donor cells in the LSK-gated, CD34−Flt3− LSK-gated, or SLAM-LSK-gated fraction of BM (Figure 5E), indicating that HSC levels decreased. We then isolated and transplanted 1 × 106 primary donor-derived MNCs into secondary recipients. We observed a clear defect in long-term reconstitution ability of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− HSCs in the PB and BM of secondary recipients (Figures 5F and S5F) without any differentiation defect 4 months after secondary transplantation (Figure 5G). We isolated and transplanted 1 × 106 secondary donor-derived MNCs into tertiary recipients. We observed no long-term reconstitution ability of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− HSCs in the PB of tertiary recipients (Figure S5G). ROS reportedly induces p16Ink4a expression (Takahashi et al., 2006Takahashi A. Ohtani N. Yamakoshi K. Iida S. Tahara H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Ide T. Saya H. Hara E. Mitogenic signalling and the p16INK4a-Rb pathway cooperate to enforce irreversible cellular senescence.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and p16Ink4a enhances HSC aging (Janzen et al., 2006Janzen V. Forkert R. Fleming H.E. Saito Y. Waring M.T. Dombkowski D.M. Cheng T. DePinho R.A. Sharpless N.E. Scadden D.T. Stem-cell ageing modified by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a.Nature. 2006; 443: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). We observed increased mitochondrial ROS production in Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LT-HSCs (Figure 5H). Thus, ROS-mediated senescence of Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LT-HSCs could account for loss of stem cell properties through p16Ink4a upregulation. In support of this idea, we detected significantly elevated levels of p16Ink4a transcripts in Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LT-HSCs from primary and secondary BMT recipients (Figure 5I). The pivotal role played by Pdk2 and Pdk4 in LT-HSC senescence during transplantation suggests that Pdk-mediated antagonism of mitochondrial metabolism prevents LT-HSC senescence by maintaining cell cycle quiescence. To test this hypothesis, we examined cell cycle kinetics of the Pdk2−/−: Pdk4−/− LT-HSCs by multicolor flow cytometry. Although the number of LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and MPPs was unchanged in Pdk2−/−: Pdk"

While the causes of HCM have been identified as genetic mutations in the cardiac sarcomere, the pathways by which sarcomeric mutations engender myocyte hypertrophy and electrophysiological abnormalities are not understood. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development, we generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a ten-member family cohort carrying a hereditary HCM missense mutation (Arg663His) in the MYH7 gene. Diseased iPSC-CMs recapitulated numerous aspects of the HCM phenotype including cellular enlargement and contractile arrhythmia at the single-cell level. Calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging indicated dysregulation of Ca(2+) cycling and elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) are central mechanisms for disease pathogenesis. Pharmacological restoration of Ca(2+) homeostasis prevented development of hypertrophy and electrophysiological irregularities. We anticipate that these findings will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development and identify novel therapies for the disease."

(p. 91 ) developed a method for investigating the consequences of phenotypic variability in single mycobacterial cells exposed to the pro-drug, isoniazid. Isoniazid needs to be activated by bacterial catalase. In the isoniazid–mycobacterium system, random fluctuations in catalase activity were important for cell survival. Because catalase is essential, it cannot be ablated; however, catalase activity pulsed randomly in the mycobacteria. Thus, a subpopulation of individual cells manage to avoid being killed by the activated antibiotic."

We determined high-resolution crystal structures of αβ-tubulin in complex with two unrelated MSAs, zampanolide and epothilone A. Both compounds were bound to the taxane pocket of β-tubulin and used their respective side chains to induce structuring of the M-loop into a short helix. Because the M-loop establishes lateral tubulin contacts in microtubules, these findings explain how taxane-site MSAs promote microtubule assembly and stability. Further, our results offer fundamental structural insights into the control mechanisms of microtubule dynamics."

A pressing question, in the context of global warming, is whether ENSO might be affected by the rising atmospheric temperatures caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Climate models do not agree on the answer to this question, but one place to look for data about how global temperatures might influence ENSO is the record of past ENSO variability. Cobb et al. (p. 67 ) present a record of ENSO variability spanning the past 7000 years, in an attempt better to define its response to insolation forcing over this same period.

However, exhaustion of antigen-specific T cells represents a major challenge to this type of approach.

The T cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were then redifferentiated into CD8+ T cells that had a high proliferative capacity and elongated telomeres.

Reprogramming of antigen-specific T cells to generate iPSCs (T-iPSCs) Redifferentiation of CD8+ T cells, with original antigen specificity, from T-iPSCs Newly differentiated T cells show high proliferation and elongated telomeres T cell antigen-specific cytotoxicity is maintained T cells play a central role in acquired immunity and the configuration of systemic immunity against pathogens. In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are major components of this systemic response to microorganisms, viral infections, and neoplasms (Greenberg, 1991Greenberg P.D.

CD8(+) T cells: foot soldiers of the immune system.Immunity. 2011; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). T cells initiate their proliferative and effector functions upon human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted recognition of specific antigen peptides via T cell receptors (TCRs). This is greatly beneficial in enabling the selective recognition and eradication of target cells, and also in long-term immunological surveillance by long-lived memory T cells (Butler et al., 2011Butler N.S.

However, viruses in chronic infection or cancers often hamper or escape the T cell immunity by decreasing the expression of molecules required for T cell recognition or by inhibiting antigen presentation (Virgin et al., 2009Virgin H.W. Wherry E.J. Ahmed R. Redefining chronic viral infection.Cell. 2009; 138: 30-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In addition, continuous exposure to chronically expressed viral antigens or cancer/self-antigens can drive T cells into an “exhausted” state. This is characterized by loss of effector functions and the potential for long-term survival and proliferation, ultimately leading to the depletion of antigen-responding T cell pools (Klebanoff et al., 2006Klebanoff C.A.

T cell exhaustion.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). The infusion of ex vivo-expanded autologous antigen-specific T cells is being developed clinically for T cell immunotherapy. However, up to now, highly expanded T cells have not proven to be particularly effective (June, 2007June C.H. Adoptive T cell therapy for cancer in the clinic.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This is in part explained by losses of function that occur during the ex vivo manipulation of patient autologous T cells. In another instance, genetic modification of antigen receptors is an ambitious but only partially successful way to add desired antigen specificity to nonspecific T cells (Morgan et al., 2006Morgan R.A. Dudley M.E. Wunderlich J.R. Hughes M.S. Yang J.C. Sherry R.M. Royal R.E. Topalian S.L.

The therapeutic effect also strongly depends on the extent of functional loss that occurs during the ex vivo manipulation of T cells and on the stability of exogenous antigen receptor expression specific to target molecules in the presence of the endogenous TCR genes (Bendle et al., 2010Bendle G.M. Linnemann C. Hooijkaas A.I. Bies L. de Witte M.A. Jorritsma A. Kaiser A.D. Pouw N. Debets R. Kieback E. et al.Lethal graft-versus-host disease in mouse models of T cell receptor gene therapy.Nat.

Overview of gene therapy clinical progress including cancer treatment with gene-modified T cells.Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2009; : 675-681Google Scholar). For the purpose of overcoming these obstacles, the therapeutic potential of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is being explored. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or iPSCs have the capacity for self-renewal while maintaining pluripotency (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar) and could potentially form the basis for the unlimited induction of antigen-specific juvenile T cells. However, there are challenges to this approach as well, given that methods for the differentiation and immunological education of ESCs and iPSCs, or indeed that of intermediate hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells, into fully matured functional human T cells are not well established (Timmermans et al., 2009Timmermans F. Velghe I. Vanwalleghem L. De Smedt M. Van Coppernolle S. Taghon T. Moore H.D. Leclercq G. Langerak A.W. Kerre T. et al.Generation of T cells from human embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic zones.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6879-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Reprogramming the nuclei of lymphocytes was historically performed for studying whether terminally differentiated or fully matured somatic cells could revert to a pluripotent state. The first demonstration of lymphocyte reprogramming employed somatic cell nuclear transfer in murine B and T cells, proving that terminally differentiated somatic cells were reprogrammable (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Monoclonal mice generated by nuclear transfer from mature B and T donor cells.Nature. 2002; 415: 1035-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Reprogramming murine B cells into pluripotent stem cells by iPSC technology also provided definite proof for fate reversibility in fully matured somatic cells (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Schorderet P. Carey B.W. Beard C. Wernig M. Creyghton M.P. Steine E.J. Cassady J.P. Foreman R. et al.Direct reprogramming of terminally differentiated mature B lymphocytes to pluripotency.Cell. 2008; 133: 250-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). From another point of view, nuclear reprogramming of lymphocytes is seen as having applications for regenerative medicine different than those for scientific research. The irreversible rearrangement of genes encoding immunoglobulins and TCRs was recognized solely as a genetic marker in somatic cell nuclear transfer and iPSC research. However, the preserved rearrangements in genomic DNA can also provide a blueprint of “educated” weapons for attacking cancers and pathogens in adoptive immunotherapy. Although several groups have reported the generation of T cell-derived iPSCs (T-iPSCs), their clinical applications have yet to be thoroughly explored (Brown et al., 2010Brown M.E. Rondon E.

In the present study, we chose a T cell clone specific to an HIV type 1 (HIV-1) epitope of known structure to act as a generic representation of iPSC-mediated T cell regeneration. We successfully induced iPSCs from antigen-specific T cells and redifferentiated them into functional T cells. This may act as proof of concept for the application of “rejuvenated” T cells in treating various diseases. Crucial to this concept was that T-iPSCs retained the assembled “endogenous” TCR genes even after being subjected to nuclear reprogramming. Furthermore, redifferentiated T cells showed the same pattern of TCR gene arrangement as that in the original T cells. These features may therefore serve as the foundation for the reproduction of unlimited numbers of T cells that express desired TCRs conferring to antigen specificity. To establish T cell-derived iPSCs, we magnetically separated the CD3+ T cell population from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers. The isolated CD3+ T cells were stimulated with human CD3 and CD28 antibody-coated microbeads (α-CD3/28 beads) in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2). We then transduced the activated CD3+ T cells with separate retroviral vectors that individually code for OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. Human ESC-like colonies were obtained within 25 days of culture (Figure S1A available online). We also isolated PBMCs from an HLA-A24-positive patient with a chronic HIV-1 infection. CD8+ CTL clones specific for an antigenic peptide (amino acids [aa] 138–145) from the HIV-1 Nef protein (Nef-138-8(WT); RYPLTFGW) (Altfeld et al., 2006Altfeld M. Kalife E.T. Qi Y. Streeck H. Lichterfeld M. Johnston M.N. Burgett N. Swartz M.E. Yang A. Alter G. et al.HLA Alleles Associated with Delayed Progression to AIDS Contribute Strongly to the Initial CD8(+) T Cell Response against HIV-1.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e403Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were established. One of the clones, H25-#4, was stimulated using α-CD3/28 beads in the presence of IL-2 and then transduced simultaneously with six retroviral vectors encoding OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, NANOG, and LIN28A. However, we could not reprogram H25-#4 into pluripotency, possibly due to the cells being in a low infectious and exhausted state, or due to insufficient expression of the reprogramming factors. In response, we attempted to increase transduction efficiency and transgene expression by using two Sendai virus (SeV) vectors. One of them encodes tetracistronic factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) (Nishimura et al., 2011Nishimura K. Sano M. Ohtaka M. Furuta B. Umemura Y. Nakajima Y. Ikehara Y. Kobayashi T. Segawa H. Takayasu S. et al.Development of defective and persistent Sendai virus vector: a unique gene delivery/expression system ideal for cell reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4760-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with the miR-302 target sequence (SeVp[KOSM302L]; K.N., M.O., and M.N., data not shown), and another encodes SV40 large T antigen (SeV18[T]) (Fusaki et al., 2009Fusaki N. Ban H. Nishiyama A. Saeki K. Hasegawa M. Efficient induction of transgene-free human pluripotent stem cells using a vector based on Sendai virus, an RNA virus that does not integrate into the host genome.Proc. Jpn. Acad., Ser. B, Phys. Biol. Sci. 2009; 85: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). After transduction of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated H25-#4 cells with the SeV vectors in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15, sufficient numbers of human ESC-like colonies appeared within 40 days of culture (Figure 1A). Use of this SeV system and optimization of transduction conditions greatly improved the reprogramming efficiency. It enabled us to reprogram several CD8+ or CD4+ T cell clones specific to pp65 antigen in cytomegalovirus (CMV), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antigen in type 1 diabetes, and α-GalCer (Table 1).Table 1Generation of Human T-iPSCs from Various Patient-Derived T Cell SpecimensAntigenT Cell SourceInitial Cell NumberNo. of ESC-like ColoniesNo. of Colonies Picked up for Establishing T-iPSC ClonesDate (MM/YYYY)HIV-1 Nefmonoclonal T cell clone4 × 1057705/2011CMV pp65polyclonal tetramer-sorted cells∼5,000151507/2011GADmonoclonal T cell clone1 × 106>100not picked up08/20125 × 105>1001908/2012α-GalCerFACS-sorted Vα24+ cells1 × 106>100not picked up08/20125 × 105>100708/2012Sample cells were transduced with OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, and SV40 large T-antigen by using two Sendai virus (SeV) vectors (SeVp[KOSM302L] and SeV18[T]). After around 40 days, the number of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like colonies were counted on the basis of morphology and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. All established T cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (T-iPSC) lines were free from residual SeV vectors (one example in the case of the HIV-1 Nef-specific T-iPSC clone is shown in Figure 1H). CMV, cytomegalovirus; GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Open table in a new tab Sample cells were transduced with OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, and SV40 large T-antigen by using two Sendai virus (SeV) vectors (SeVp[KOSM302L] and SeV18[T]). After around 40 days, the number of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like colonies were counted on the basis of morphology and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. All established T cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (T-iPSC) lines were free from residual SeV vectors (one example in the case of the HIV-1 Nef-specific T-iPSC clone is shown in Figure 1H). CMV, cytomegalovirus; GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The resultant CD3+ T cell- and H25-#4-derived ESC-like colonies (TkT3V1-7 and H254SeVT-3, respectively) exhibited alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and expressed the pluripotent cell markers SSEA-4, Tra-1-60, and Tra-1-81 (Figures S1B–S1E and 1B–1E). H254SeVT-3 expressed HLA-A24 (Figure 1F). Both TkT3V1-7 and H254SeVT-3 also expressed human ESC-related genes (Figures S1F and 1G). The expression of exogenous reprogramming factors from the integrated provirus (TkT3V1-7) was halted (Figure S1F), and nonintegrated SeV genomic RNA was successfully removed from the cytosol by RNAi or by self-degradation caused by temperature-sensitive mutations (H254SeVT-3) (Figure 1H). Comparison of gene-expression profiles revealed that the gene-expression patterns in the ESC-like cells were similar to those in human ESCs, but differed significantly from those in peripheral blood (PB) T cells (Figure S1G). Scant methylation of the OCT3/4 and NANOG promoter regions was confirmed using bisulfite PCR, thus indicating successful reprogramming (Freberg et al., 2007Freberg C.T. Dahl J.A. Timoskainen S. Collas P. Epigenetic reprogramming of OCT4 and NANOG regulatory regions by embryonal carcinoma cell extract.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Figures S1H and 1I). In addition, when injected into nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-Scid) mice, those cells formed teratomas containing characteristic tissues derived from all three germ layers, which is indicative of pluripotency (Brivanlou et al., 2003Brivanlou A.H. Gage F.H. Jaenisch R. Jessell T. Melton D. Rossant J. Stem cells. Setting standards for human embryonic stem cells.Science. 2003; 300: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) (Figures S3 and 2A ). Therefore, those colonies were confirmed as typical human iPSCs. Almost all TCRs are composed of heterodimerically associated α and β chains. TCRA or TCRB gene (encoding α chain or β chain, respectively) rearrangements are involved in normal αβ T cell development in the thymus. These rearrangements enabled us to determine retrospectively whether the iPSCs were derived from an αβ T cell. The BIOMED-2 consortium designed multiplex-PCR primers for analyzing TCRB gene assemblies (van Dongen et al., 2003van Dongen J.J. Langerak A.W. Brüggemann M. Evans P.A. Hummel M. Lavender F.L. Delabesse E. Davi F. Schuuring E.

TCRB and TCRA gene assemblies were identified as single bands representing each allele in TkT3V1-7 and H254SeVT-3 (Figures S1H, S1I, 1J, and 1K). We next confirmed the presence of an antigen-recognition site on the TCR that consisted of three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3). CDR3 is the most diversifiable among the three because it spans the V(D)J-junction region, where several random nucleotides (N or P nucleotides) are inserted (Alt and Baltimore, 1982Alt F.W.

We determined the CDR3 sequences of the assembled TCRA and TCRB genes in TkT3V1-7 and H254SeVT-3 and identified a set of productive TCRA and TCRB gene rearrangements (i.e., in-frame junction with no stop codon) (Table S1 and Table 2). Furthermore, the sequences of CDR3 from H254SeVT-3 and H25-#4 were completely identical at both TCRA and TCRB gene loci. These results indicated that the iPSCs established were derived from a single T cell and that the antigen specificity encoded in the genomic DNA of the T cell was conserved during reprogramming.Table 2TCR Gene Rearrangements in H25-4, H254SeVT-3, or Redifferentiated CD8+ T CellsCellGenome or mRNAProductivityRearrangementSequence of Junctional RegionVαJα3′VαP(N)5′JαTCRAH25-4genomeproductiveTRAV8-3∗01TRAJ10∗01TGTGCTGTGGGTTTCACGGGAGGAGGAAACAAACTCACCTTTTunproductiveaOut-of-frame junction (at CDR3).TRAV13-1∗01TRAJ29∗01TGTGCAGCAATCCTCAGGAAACACACCTCTTGTCTTTH254SeVT-3genomeproductiveTRAV8-3∗01TRAJ10∗01TGTGCTGTGGGTTTCACGGGAGGAGGAAACAAACTCACCTTTTunproductiveaOut-of-frame junction (at CDR3).TRAV13-1∗01TRAJ29∗01TGTGCAGCAATCCTCAGGAAACACACCTCTTGTCTTTreT-1mRNAproductiveTRAV8-3∗01TRAJ10∗01TGTGCTGTGGGTTTCACGGGAGGAGGAAACAAACTCACCTTTTunproductiveaOut-of-frame junction (at CDR3).TRAV13-1∗01TRAJ29∗01TGTGCAGCAATCCTCAGGAAACACACCTCTTGTCTTTreT-2.1mRNAproductiveTRAV8-3∗01TRAJ10∗01TGTGCTGTGGGTTTCACGGGAGGAGGAAACAAACTCACCTTTTunproductiveaOut-of-frame junction (at CDR3).TRAV13-1∗01TRAJ29∗01TGTGCAGCAATCCTCAGGAAACACACCTCTTGTCTTTreT-3mRNAproductiveTRAV8-3∗01TRAJ10∗01TGTGCTGTGGGTTTCACGGGAGGAGGAAACAAACTCACCTTTTunproductiveaOut-of-frame junction (at CDR3).TRAV13-1∗01TRAJ29∗01TGTGCAGCAATCCTCAGGAAACACACCTCTTGTCTTTVβDβJβ3'VβN1-Dβ-N25'JβTCRBH25-4genomeproductiveTRBV7-9∗01TRBD1∗01TRBJ2-5∗01TGTGCCAGCAGCTTACGGGACAGGGTGCCGGAGACCCAGTACTTCunproductivegermlineTRBD1∗01TRBJ2-7∗01TACAAAGCTGTAACATTGTGGGGACAACTCTACGAGCAGTACTTCGGGCCGH254SeVT-3genomeproductiveTRBV7-9∗01TRBD1∗01TRBJ2-5∗01TGTGCCAGCAGCTTACGGGACAGGGTGCCGGAGACCCAGTACTTCunproductivegermlineTRBD1∗01TRBJ2-7∗01TACAAAGCTGTAACATTGTGGGGACAACTCTACGAGCAGTACTTCGGGCCGreT-1mRNAproductiveTRBV7-9∗01TRBD1∗01TRBJ2-5∗01TGTGCCAGCAGCTTACGGGACAGGGTGCCGGAGACCCAGTACTTCreT-2.1mRNAproductiveTRBV7-9∗01TRBD1∗01TRBJ2-5∗01TGTGCCAGCAGCTTACGGGACAGGGTGCCGGAGACCCAGTACTTCreT-3mRNAproductiveTRBV7-9∗01TRBD1∗01TRBJ2-5∗01TGTGCCAGCAGCTTACGGGACAGGGTGCCGGAGACCCAGTACTTCPCR-amplified samples (H25-4: not shown; H254SeVT-3: shown in Figures 1J and 1K; reT-1, reT-2.1, and reT-3: shown in Figure 3B) were sequenced, then V, D, and J segment usages and junctional sequences in CDR3 were identified.

Following the application of specific in vitro differentiation protocols, iPSCs can give rise to mesoderm-derived cell types, especially hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells (Takayama et al., 2008Takayama N.

This was applied to assess the capacity of T-iPSCs for hematopoietic differentiation by coculturing on C3H10T1/2 feeder cells in the presence of VEGF, SCF, and FLT-3L for the generation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. On day 14 of culture, the cells were transferred onto Delta-like 1-expressing OP9 (OP9-DL1) feeder cells (Timmermans et al., 2009Timmermans F. Velghe I. Vanwalleghem L. De Smedt M. Van Coppernolle S.

An essential developmental checkpoint for production of the T cell lineage.Science. 2010; 329: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). After 21–28 days of culture, the hematopoietic cells differentiated into CD45+, CD38+, CD7+, CD45RA+, CD3+, and TCRαβ+ T lineage cells (Figure S4). As was the case with TCRαβ transgenic mice (Borgulya et al., 1992Borgulya P. Kishi H. Uematsu Y. von Boehmer H. Exclusion and inclusion of alpha and beta T cell receptor alleles.Cell. 1992; 69: 529-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and chimeric mice derived from ESCs produced through nuclear transplantation of T cells (Serwold et al., 2007Serwold T. Hochedlinger K. Inlay M.A. Jaenisch R. Weissman I.L. Early TCR expression and aberrant T cell development in mice with endogenous prerearranged T cell receptor genes.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), aberrant expression of TCRαβ was observed at the CD4/CD8 double-negative (DN) stage. Although some of these T lineage cells differentiated into the CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) stage and the more mature CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) stages (Figure 2C), we could not characterize the small number of SP cells in more detail. During thymocyte development, the CD4/CD8 DN and DP stages correspond respectively to the TCRB-encoded β chain and TCRA-encoded α chain assembly stages (von Boehmer, 2004von Boehmer H. Selection of the T-cell repertoire: receptor-controlled checkpoints in T-cell development.Adv. Immunol. 2004; 84: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the TCRB locus, the negative-feedback regulation of gene assembly and the capacity to deter further rearrangement are very strict (Khor and Sleckman, 2002Khor B. Sleckman B.P. Allelic exclusion at the TCRbeta locus.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the TCRA locus, by contrast, negative-feedback regulation is relatively loose, and further gene assembly of the preassembled gene, a phenomenon known as “receptor revision,” tends to occur (Huang and Kanagawa, 2001Huang C. Kanagawa O. Ordered and coordinated rearrangement of the TCR alpha locus: role of secondary rearrangement in thymic selection.J.

Immunol. 2009; 21: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In experiments using TCRα transgenic mice, the reactivation of Rag1 and Rag2, genes related to recombination machinery, occurred in CD4/CD8 DP-stage thymocytes, and gene assembly of endogenous Tcra was observed (Padovan et al., 1993Padovan E. Casorati G. Dellabona P. Meyer S. Brockhaus M. Lanzavecchia A. Expression of two T cell receptor alpha chains: dual receptor T cells.Science. 1993; 262: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar; Petrie et al., 1993Petrie H.T. Livak F. Schatz D.G.

Med. 1993; 178: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such further gene assembly would be exceedingly undesirable for our purposes, because it would probably convert the tropism of the TCR and render the redifferentiated T cells incapable of attacking the previously targeted antigen. To determine whether such receptor revision could occur in redifferentiating T lineage cells, we collected CD1a− DN- and CD1a+ DP-stage cells from among the CD45+, CD3+, TCRαβ+, and CD5+ T lineage cells and then analyzed the gene rearrangement of TCR messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (Figures S5A–S5C). Nucleotide sequences of TCRB mRNAs in the T lineage cells were identical to those in the T-iPSCs at both the DN and DP stages. By contrast, some TCRA mRNAs at the DN and DP stages were identical to those in the T lineage cells, but others differed, and differing sequences were observed more frequently at the DP stage than the DN stage (Table S2). RAG1 and RAG2 expression were observed at both the DN and the DP stages, though stronger expression was observed at the DP stage (Figure S5D). To create mature CD8 SP cells from T-iPSC-derived T lineage cells without receptor revision, we focused on TCR signaling. Turka et al., 1991Turka L.A. Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Chun J.J. Gorka C.

https://openalex.org/W1995527023,"The influence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the stem cell niche remains poorly understood. We found that Syndecan-4 (Sdc4) and Frizzled-7 (Fzd7) form a coreceptor complex in satellite cells and that binding of the ECM glycoprotein Fibronectin (FN) to Sdc4 stimulates the ability of Wnt7a to induce the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells. Newly activated satellite cells dynamically remodel their niche via transient high-level expression of FN. Knockdown of FN in prospectively isolated satellite cells severely impaired their ability to repopulate the satellite cell niche. Conversely, in vivo overexpression of FN with Wnt7a dramatically stimulated the expansion of satellite stem cells in regenerating muscle. Therefore, activating satellite cells remodel their niche through autologous expression of FN that provides feedback to stimulate Wnt7a signaling through the Fzd7/Sdc4 coreceptor complex. Thus, FN and Wnt7a together regulate the homeostatic levels of satellite stem cells and satellite myogenic cells during regenerative myogenesis."

Nemoto S. Finkel T. Mitochondria, oxidants, and aging.Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). As the site of respiration/oxidative phosphorylation, these double-membrane organelles provide a highly efficient route for eukaryotic cells to generate ATP from energy-rich molecules. The role of the mitochondria in ATP generation is dependent on ambient oxygen tension. Under normal oxygen tensions, cells catabolize glucose to pyruvate. Pyruvate is then imported into the mitochondria for further catabolism through the Krebs cycle, which transfers electrons to the respiratory chain for ATP synthesis. In low oxygen tensions, or hypoxic conditions where there is a lack of oxygen as an electron acceptor, cells undergo anaerobic glycolysis as a default mode. Pyruvate is then used for low-efficiency energy production in the cytosol by glycolysis. Mitochondrial energy metabolism is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs), especially UCP1, in the mitochondrial inner membrane attenuate mitochondrial energy production by conducting proton leak from the intermembrane space to the matrix and dissipating the proton gradient necessary for ATP generation (Brand and Esteves, 2005Brand M.D. Esteves T.C.

The functions of other UCPs, however, are still controversial. Emerging evidence suggests that UCP2 may regulate cellular bioenergetics by controlling mitochondrial substrate utilization. Specifically, increased UCP2 activity inhibits pyruvate entering into the mitochondria for Krebs cycle utilization while facilitating the oxidation of alternative carbon sources, such as fatty acids and glutamine (Bouillaud, 2009Bouillaud F.

The function of mitochondria in the coordination of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and lineage differentiation is not well defined (Mantel et al., 2011Mantel C. Messina-Graham S.V. Broxmeyer H.E. Superoxide flashes, reactive oxygen species, and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore: potential implications for hematopoietic stem cell function.Curr. Opin.

Metabolic regulation of hematopoietic stem cells in the hypoxic niche.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 298-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The ambient oxygen tension in the microenvironment (niches) of HSCs is believed to be low. To produce ATP in this environment, HSCs utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production (Simsek et al., 2010Simsek T. Kocabas F. Zheng J. Deberardinis R.J. Mahmoud A.I. Olson E.N. Schneider J.W. Zhang C.C. Sadek H.A. The distinct metabolic profile of hematopoietic stem cells reflects their location in a hypoxic niche.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 380-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Limited mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in HSCs helps to preserve this essential cell reservoir from oxidative damage by attenuating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct generated during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. A recent study has demonstrated that the mitochondrial content in HSCs is even slightly higher than that in myeloid progenitors, although lower than that in late erythroid progenitors (Norddahl et al., 2011Norddahl G.L. Pronk C.J. Wahlestedt M. Sten G. Nygren J.M. Ugale A. Sigvardsson M. Bryder D. Accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations drive premature hematopoietic aging phenotypes distinct from physiological stem cell aging.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that mitochondria in HSCs are relatively inactive. However, when HSCs undergo differentiation, a robust energy demand is expected for this rapid and energy-consuming cellular process. Indeed, ATP and ROS levels in lineage-committed progenitors are much higher than those in HSCs (Inoue et al., 2010Inoue S. Noda S. Kashima K. Nakada K. Hayashi J. Miyoshi H.

Nonetheless, how mitochondrial energy metabolism is regulated and how mitochondrial bioenergetics and substrate utilization cooperatively coordinate both HSC differentiation and self-renewal in concert with other mechanisms is poorly understood. PTPMT1, a PTEN-like phosphatase encoded by nuclear DNA, is relatively widely expressed in various tissues and is exclusively localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria via N-terminal amino acids 1–37 (Pagliarini et al., 2005Pagliarini D.J.

Cell. 2005; 19: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Little is known about the role of PTPMT1 in physiology and disease; however, recent studies have shown that global disruption of PTPMT1 results in developmental arrest and postimplantation lethality (Shen et al., 2011Shen J.

Biol. 2011; 31: 4902-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further dissect the physiological function of PTPMT1, we have created a PTPMT1 conditional allele (PTPMT1fl/+) and determined the effects of PTPMT1 depletion on hematopoietic cell development. PTPMT1 is highly expressed in HSCs (Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+CD48−Flk2−), LSK (Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+) cells, and LK (Lineage−Sca-1−c-Kit+) cells relative to Lineage+ and mature cells (Figure 1A). To dissect the role of PTPMT1 in hematopoiesis, we created a PTPMT1 conditional allele (PTPMT1fl/+) (Figures S1A–S1C available online) and generated PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ mice based on PTPMT1fl/+ mice and Mx1-Cre transgenic mice that express Cre in panhematopoietic cells (including HSCs) in response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pI-pC) treatment (Kühn et al., 1995Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Four-week-old PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ mice were treated with pI-pC to induce Cre expression and PTPMT1 deletion. As a result, nearly 80% of the mice died within 2–3 weeks of treatment (Figure 1B) due to pancytopenia and severe anemia (Figure S1D). Moreover, bone marrow (BM) myeloid (Figure 1C) and lymphoid (Figure 1D) progenitors detected by colony-forming unit (CFU) assays were drastically decreased as compared with those in control mice. Twenty percent of pI-pC-treated PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ mice survived owing to the incomplete deletion of PTPMT1 in HSCs and the reconstitution of hematopoiesis from PTPMT1-undeleted HSCs. As shown in Figure 1E, 7 days after pI-pC treatment, a majority of peripheral blood cells showed PTPMT1 deletion (representing direct deletion from these cells). However, 3 weeks later, PTPMT1 deletion in peripheral blood cells was greatly decreased in surviving PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ mice. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that in these surviving animals PTPMT1 was deleted in 95%–98% of HSCs and LSK cells, whereas PTPMT1 deletion in common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; Lineage−Sca-1−c-Kit+CD34+CD16/32low) and Lineage+ cells was only 20% (Figure 1F). Surprisingly, the percentage of HSCs in the BM of these mice was increased by ∼40-fold (Figure 1G) (absolute numbers are shown in Table S1) despite PTPMT1 deletion in ∼95%–98% of these cells, indicative of a robust expansion/accumulation of knockout stem cells. Phenotypic multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell populations (Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150−CD48−Flk2−, Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+CD48+Flk2−, Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150−CD48+Flk2−, and Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150−CD48+Flk2+) (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J.

Remarkably, even 12 months after PTPMT1 ablation, the number of HSCs (∼90% of which exhibited PTPMT1 depletion) in the knockout mice were still ∼27 times greater than that in control mice (Figure S1E). The drastic expansion of the stem cell pool implies that hematopoietic failure caused by PTPMT1 ablation from the mitochondria was not due to an induction of apoptosis. In fact, apoptotic cells in HSCs were not appreciably changed in PTPMT1 knockout mice (Figure 1H). To further verify the crucial role of PTPMT1 in hematopoiesis observed in inducible PTPMT1 knockout mice, we generated hematopoietic-cell-specific knockout (PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+) mice based on PTPMT1fl/+ mice and Vav1-Cre transgenic mice, in which Cre expression, and thus PTPMT1 deletion, was restricted to hematopoietic cells including stem cells. All PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+ mice died of pancytopenia and severe anemia within 5–9 days of birth (Figure 2A). These animals could be completely rescued by receiving transplants of wild-type (WT) BM cells (Figure 2A), verifying the cell-autonomous effect of PTPMT1 deficiency on neonatal hematopoiesis. Autopsies of PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+ pups revealed that the sizes of the spleen and the thymus were drastically decreased compared with those of WT littermates (Figure 2B). Histopathological examination of BM cells confirmed hematopoietic failure (Figure 2C). Total cell numbers of the BM from PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+ neonates were decreased by ∼75-fold at postnatal day 5 (P5) (Figure S2A). Hematopoietic progenitors in the BM of knockout mice were undetectable (Figure 2D). The percentage of HSCs [Lineage−Sca-1+CD150+CD48−Flk2− cells were quantified because of the loss of c-Kit expression associated with severe hematopoietic failure (Simonnet et al., 2009Simonnet A.J.

The expansion of HSCs in PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+ mice appeared to be developed gradually (Figure S2B). Notably, apoptosis in the BM cells (Figure S2C) and levels of ROS (Figure S2D) that are often elevated and cause cell death when mitochondria are dysfunctional were not altered. Since HSCs were drastically expanded and MPPs were increased to a much lesser extent, hematopoietic failure in PTPMT1 knockout mice appeared to be caused mainly by a block in the differentiation of stem cells. To test this hypothesis, HSCs were purified from PTPMT1-depleted mice and assessed for various functional activities. In response to cytokine stimulation, PTPMT1 knockout stem cells failed to differentiate to produce colonies in CFU assays (Figure 3A). The capability of PTPMT1-depleted HSCs to give rise to Lineage+ progeny when cocultured with OP9 stromal cells was essentially lost (Figure S3A). We also isolated HSCs and performed single-cell culture. In contrast to WT stem cells that vigorously differentiated, PTPMT1 knockout stem cells either did not divide or, at most, underwent one round of cell division under the in vitro culture conditions (Figure 3B). To further validate the impact of PTPMT1 deficiency on stem cell function, competitive repopulation assays were performed. BM cells (test cells) isolated from PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ and PTPMT1+/+/Mx1-Cre+ mice (CD45.2+) were mixed with BM cells (competitor cells) harvested from BoyJ mice (CD45.1+) at the ratio of 1:1 and transplanted into lethally irradiated BoyJ mice. Six weeks after transplantation when donor cells were fully engrafted, recipient mice were treated with pI-pC. In this competitive setting, reconstitution from PTPMT1-depleted test cells was greatly decreased in primary transplants (Figures 3C and 3D) and barely detectable in secondary transplants (Figure 3E). The same results were obtained when BM cells from pI-pC-treated PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ or PTPMT1+/+/Mx1-Cre+ mice were used for competitive transplantations. Contributions of PTPMT1-depleted donor cells to the whole hematopoietic cell population or each lineage in primary transplants (Figures S3B and S3C) and secondary transplants (Figure S3D) were blocked. We sorted test-cell-derived LSK (CD45.2+LSK), myeloid (CD45.2+Mac-1+Gr-1+), B lymphoid (CD45.2+B220+), and T lymphoid (CD45.2+CD3+) cells from primary recipients 20 weeks after pI-pC administration and examined PTPMT1 deletion in these cells. As shown in Figure 3F, whereas PTPMT1 was deleted in approximately 95% of CD45.2+LSK cells, PTPMT1 deletion in CD45.2+ lineage cells was barely detected, suggesting that these lineage cells were derived from PTPMT1-undeleted test cells. Remarkably, in both competitive repopulation assay setups, the percentages of CD45.2+LSK cells derived from PTPMT1-depleted test cells were still four to six times greater than those in control test-cell-derived populations in primary recipients (Figures 3G and S3E), reaffirming the profound cell-autonomous effects of PTPMT1 deficiency on stem/early progenitor cell homeostasis. PTPMT1 is a phosphatase that is exclusively localized to the mitochondria (Pagliarini et al., 2005Pagliarini D.J. Wiley S.E. Kimple M.E. Dixon J.R. Kelly P. Worby C.A. Casey P.J. Dixon J.E. Involvement of a mitochondrial phosphatase in the regulation of ATP production and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To elucidate the structural bases for the indispensable role of PTPMT1 in HSCs, WT PTPMT1, catalytically deficient PTPMT1 C132S, and truncated PTPMT1 lacking the mitochondrial localization signal (amino acids 1-37) (PTPMT1 Δ37) were transduced into PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ BM cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Transduced cells were sorted according to green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed separately by the retroviral vector, and then assessed for repopulating/differentiation capabilities by competitive repopulation assays, as described in Figure 3D. Following deletion of endogenous PTPMT1 by pI-pC treatment, control-vector-transduced PTPMT1fl/fl/Mx1-Cre+ cells failed to reconstitute hematopoiesis (Figure 4A), consistent with the results shown in Figures 3C and 3D. Reintroduction of WT PTPMT1 in PTPMT1 knockout cells effectively rescued stem cell repopulating capabilities. In contrast, neither PTPMT1 C132S nor PTPMT1 Δ37 exhibited any rescue capacity (Figure 4A). In addition, embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) fetal liver hematopoietic cells isolated from PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+ embryos were transduced with either WT PTPMT1, PTPMT1 C132S, PTPMT1 Δ37, or control vector, and then assessed for radioprotective function in lethally irradiated recipient mice. As shown in Figure 4B, only WT PTPMT1-transduced knockout cells rescued recipient animals, whereas all transplants receiving either PTPMT1 C132S, PTPMT1 Δ37, or control-vector-transduced knockout cells invariably died within 2–3 weeks of irradiation. Furthermore, the percentage of HSCs in WT PTPMT1-rescued recipients was restored to the normal range (data not shown). These add-back experiments, while confirming the crucial cell-intrinsic role of PTPMT1 in HSCs, suggest that this phosphatase functions in a catalytically dependent manner and that the mitochondrial localization is required for its function. To test whether PTPMT1 is generally important for all hematopoietic cells, we generated lineage-specific knockout mice PTPMT1fl/fl/LysM-Cre+ (in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, GMPs), PTPMT1fl/fl/LCK-Cre+ (in CD4−/CD8− stage T lymphoid progenitors), and PTPMT1fl/fl/CD19-Cre+ (in pro-B stage B lymphoid progenitors) mice by crossing PTPMT1fl/+ mice with LysM-Cre, LCK-Cre, and CD19-Cre transgenic mice, respectively. Intriguingly, ablation of PTPMT1 from GMPs, T lymphoid, or B lymphoid progenitors in these mice did not disrupt normal cell development. In sharp contrast to panhematopoietic cell (including stem cell) knockouts (PTPMT1fl/fl/Vav1-Cre+) that died at the postnatal stage, PTPMT1fl/fl/LysM-Cre+, PTPMT1fl/fl/LCK-Cre+, and PTPMT1fl/fl/CD19-Cre+ mice showed no defects in myeloid, T lymphoid, or B lymphoid lineages (Figures S4A–S4C), nor was the cell cycle of lineage progenitors altered (Figure S4D). The lineage-specific knockout mice were active and fertile without any discernible abnormalities during the 1.5 years of follow-up. These in vivo data strongly suggest that while PTPMT1 plays a vital role in stem cells, it is dispensable for late lineage progenitors. To further define the underlying mechanisms for the differentiation block of PTPMT1-depleted HSCs, we first tested whether knockout HSCs were replicatively senescent by examining senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (β-gal) activity using 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside (C12FDG), a fluorogenic substrate for β-gal. No significant differences in β-gal activities were detected in the HSCs of PTPMT1 knockout mice (Figure S4E). We also determined the expression of p16, a molecular hallmark of cellular senescence. Again, there were no significant changes in p16 levels between WT and knockout LSK cells (Figure 5F) or HSCs (Figure S4F). We then analyzed the cell cycle status of LSK cells and HSCs. These analyses revealed a significant increase in the percentages of knockout LSK cells and HSCs at the G1 phase while the percentages of S/G2/M cells were not changed (Figures 5A and 5B). Moreover, the percentages of LSK cells and HSCs at the G0 phase (quiescence) were decreased in PTPMT1-depleted mice. In vivo BrdU incorporation assays showed that after 16 hr of in vivo BrdU labeling, the percentages of BrdU+ cells in LSK and HSC populations in PTPMT1 knockout mice were not significantly altered (Figures 5C and 5D), verifying the S phase data obtained from the dye-based cell cycle analyses (Figures 5A and 5B). Furthermore, BrdU long-term label-retaining assays (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L. Bockamp E. et al.Hematopoietic stem cells reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal during homeostasis and repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 1118-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) demonstrated that BrdU label-retaining cells in the HSC population in PTPMT1 knockout mice 100 days after the BrdU labeling were markedly decreased (Figure 5E), reaffirming the loss of quiescence in PTPMT1 deficient HSCs. Collectively, these cell cycle data suggest an enhanced entry of quiescent stem cells (G0 phase) into the cell cycle in PTPMT1 knockout mice, and that these cells were subsequently delayed at the G1 phase (the ratio of S/G2/M cells to G1 cells was decreased). In agreement with the cell cycle changes, p21 and p57, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors critical for controlling HSC cycling (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D.

We next sought to determine the fundamental impact of PTPMT1 ablation on the mitochondria. Ultra structures of mitochondria in PTPMT1-depleted stem cells were not altered (data not shown) and the overall mitochondrial DNA content in these cells was comparable to that in control cells (Figure 6A). Also, steady state total cellular ATP levels (Figure 6B) and ROS levels in PTPMT1-depleted HSCs (Figure 6C) were not significantly changed. We next analyzed mitochondrial aerobic metabolism in intact, viable LSK cells using real-time measurement of oxygen consumption. PTPMT1 knockout cells had much lower basal oxygen consumption and maximal oxidative capacity as compared with WT cells (Figure 6D). Interestingly, measurement of extracellular proton flux revealed that PTPMT1-depleted cells had significantly increased extracellular acidification rates (Figure 6E), suggesting that these cells exhibited enhanced glycolysis. In agreement with these data on the mitochondrial function, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), an intracellular energy sensor (Hardie, 2011Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: an energy sensor that regulates all aspects of cell function.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1895-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), was highly activated (determined by phosphorylation of Thr172) in PTPMT1 knockout LSK cells (Figure 6F) and HSCs (Figure 6G). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), one of the targets of AMPK and a negative regulator of fatty acid oxidation (Viollet et al., 2009Viollet B. Guigas B. Leclerc J. Hébrard S. Lantier L. Mounier R. Andreelli F. Foretz M. AMP-activated protein kinase in the regulation of hepatic energy metabolism: from physiology to therapeutic perspectives.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2009; 196: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), was inhibited, as evidenced by the increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of this enzyme (Figure 6F), implying that fatty acid metabolism might be enhanced in PTPMT1 knockout stem cells. Intriguingly, PTPMT1-depleted macrophages derived from myeloid-specific knockout (PTPMT1+/+/LysM-Cre+) mice also showed decreased mitochondrial aerobic metabolism at basal levels and maximal reserve capacities (Figure S5A). However, no defects in the growth (Figure S5B) and the cell cycle (Figure S5C) were detected. Also, there was no upregulation of p53, p21, or p57 in these knockout macrophages (Figure S5D), and AMPK phosphorylation was only marginally increased in these cells (Figure S5E). PTPMT1 favors phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), especially PI(3,5)P2, PI5P, and PI(3,4)P2, as substrates (Shen et al., 2011Shen J. Liu X. Yu W.M. Liu J. Nibbelink M.G. Guo C. Finkel T. Qu C.K.

Biol. 2011; 31: 4902-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), similar to PTEN phosphatase. PIPs are a class of membrane phospholipids that regulate many important cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and ion channel/transporter functions (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006Di Paolo G.

In this study, we established iPSCs from mature cytotoxic T cells specific for the melanoma epitope MART-1. When cocultured with OP9/DLL1 cells, these iPSCs efficiently generated TCRβ(+)CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive (DP) cells expressing a T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the MART-1 epitope. Stimulation of these DP cells with anti-CD3 antibody generated a large number of CD8(+) T cells, and more than 90% of the resulting cells were specific for the original MART-1 epitope. Stimulation of the CD8(+) T cells with MART-1 antigen-presenting cells led to the secretion of IFNγ, demonstrating their specific reactivity. The present study therefore illustrates an approach for cloning and expanding functional antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells that might be applicable in cell-based therapy of cancer."

However, below absolute zero, there is a netherworld of negative temperatures, which are, counterintuitively, hotter than positive temperatures. Usually, such states are achieved in the laboratory and are characterized by a higher occupation of high-energy versus low-energy states. This is most easily done for systems that have a finite spectrum of energy states, bounded from above and below. Braun et al. (p. 52 ; see the Perspective by Carr ) achieved negative temperature for a system in which its spectrum was only bounded on one side. Starting with a gas of 39 K bosonic atoms with repulsive interactions in a dipole trap and an optical lattice, a final state with negative temperature was reached where the atoms attract each other."

Working at the atomic scale, Khajetoorians et al. (p. 55 ) observed ST T in a structure of 5 to 7 magnetic atoms adsorbed on a metallic surface. The tip of a spinpolarized scanning tunneling microscope (STM) acted as the source of the spin-polarized current, and the reversal of the sign of the STM voltage resulted in the reversal of the preferred spin direction. By varying the temperature, the roles of different quantum processes were elucidated. These results will be of significance as spintronic components are further miniaturized."

https://openalex.org/W1985008271,"Faint Young Sun During the first ∼billion years after the formation of Earth, the Sun was significantly less luminous than today, delivering considerably less solar energy to our planet. Nevertheless, the geological record shows that Earth harbored liquid water and was not frozen—as would be expected on the basis of the reduced solar output. The presence of liquid water on Earth during this time is referred to as the “faint young Sun” paradox. Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert (p. 64 ; see the Perspective by Kasting ) suggest a new explanation for this mystery, invoking absorption of solar radiation owing to collisions between atmospheric H 2 and N 2 as a source of heating. This mechanism could have supplied enough extra warming to keep surface temperatures above 0°C."

Given the medicinal relevance of the cardenolides in the treatment of congestive heart failure, a variety of ouabagenin analogs could potentially be generated from the key intermediate as a means of addressing the narrow therapeutic index of these molecules.

Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, STRUCTURE. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost a thousand-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all.

We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with about 8 days delay and some disagreement with authors.

This activation of TRP channels is mediated by production of endogenous activators and is dependent on key tyrosine residues of TRPV4. Our study has identified critical components of the intracellular signaling pathways underlying the activation of TRP channels. These may represent novel targets for therapeutics aimed at reducing augmented signaling under pathophysiological conditions while leaving normal responses intact. This selective inhibition of aberrant signaling is a more attractive target compared with global inhibition of TRP channels, which have important physiological roles in thermoregulation, osmoregulation, and nociception."

https://openalex.org/W2113967828,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease characterized by myofibroblast proliferation. Transition of epithelial/mesothelial cells into myofibroblasts [epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)] occurs under the influence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, with Snail being a major transcription factor. We study here the role of the heat-shock protein HSP27 in fibrogenesis and EMT. In vitro, we have up- and down-modulated HSP27 expression in mesothelial and epithelial cell lines and studied the expression of different EMT markers induced by TGF-β1. In vivo, we inhibited HSP27 with the antisense oligonucleotide OGX-427 (in phase II clinical trials as anticancer agent) in our rat subpleural/pulmonary fibrosis models. We demonstrate that HSP27 is strongly expressed during the fibrotic process in patients with IPF and in different in vivo models. We showed that HSP27 binds to and stabilizes Snail and consequently induces EMT. Conversely, HSP27 knockdown leads to Snail proteasomal degradation, thus inhibiting TGF-β1-induced EMT. Inhibition of HSP27 with OGX-427 efficiently blocks EMT and fibrosis development. Controls in vivo were an empty adenovirus that did not induce fibrosis and a control antisense oligonucleotide. The present work opens the possibility of a new therapeutic use for HSP27 inhibitors against IPF, for which there is no conclusively effective treatment.—Wettstein, G., Bellaye, P.-S., Kolb, M., Hammann, A., Crestani, B., Soler, P., Marchal-Somme, J., Hazoume, A., Gauldie, J., Gunther, A., Micheau, O., Gleave, M., Camus, P., Garrido, C., Bonniaud, P.

https://openalex.org/W1983275249,"Drugs are primary weapons for reducing malaria in human populations. However emergence of resistant parasites has repeatedly curtailed the lifespan of each drug that is developed and deployed. Currently the most effective anti-malarial is artemisinin, which is extracted from the leaves of Artemisia annua. Due to poor pharmacokinetic properties and prudent efforts to curtail resistance to monotherapies, artemisinin is prescribed only in combination with other anti-malarials composing an Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT). Low yield in the plant, and the added cost of secondary anti-malarials in the ACT, make artemisinin costly for the developing world. As an alternative, we compared the efficacy of oral delivery of the dried leaves of whole plant (WP) A. annua to a comparable dose of pure artemisinin in a rodent malaria model (Plasmodium chabaudi). We found that a single dose of WP (containing 24 mg/kg artemisinin) reduces parasitemia more effectively than a comparable dose of purified drug. This increased efficacy may result from a documented 40-fold increase in the bioavailability of artemisinin in the blood of mice fed the whole plant, in comparison to those administered synthetic drug. Synergistic benefits may derive from the presence of other anti-malarial compounds in A. annua. If shown to be clinically efficacious, well-tolerated, and compatible with the public health imperative of forestalling evolution of drug resistance, inexpensive, locally grown and processed A. annua might prove to be an effective addition to the global effort to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality."

They identify common variants at the HLA-DRB1–HLA-DQA1 HLA class II region associated with susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis. To identify susceptibility loci for visceral leishmaniasis, we undertook genome-wide association studies in two populations: 989 cases and 1,089 controls from India and 357 cases in 308 Brazilian families (1,970 individuals). The HLA-DRB1–HLA-DQA1 locus was the only region to show strong evidence of association in both populations. Replication at this region was undertaken in a second Indian population comprising 941 cases and 990 controls, and combined analysis across the three cohorts for rs9271858 at this locus showed Pcombined = 2.76 × 10−17 and odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30–1.52. A conditional analysis provided evidence for multiple associations within the HLA-DRB1–HLA-DQA1 region, and a model in which risk differed between three groups of haplotypes better explained the signal and was significant in the Indian discovery and replication cohorts. In conclusion, the HLA-DRB1–HLA-DQA1 HLA class II region contributes to visceral leishmaniasis susceptibility in India and Brazil, suggesting shared genetic risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis that cross the epidemiological divides of geography and parasite species."
https://openalex.org/W1970982374,"Identifying cells of tumor origin is a fundamental question in tumor biology. Answers to this central question will not only advance our understanding of tumor initiation and progression but also have important therapeutic implications. In this study, we aimed to uncover the cells of origin of lung adenocarcinoma, a major subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. To this end, we developed new mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma that enabled selective manipulation of gene activity in surfactant associated protein C (SPC)-expressing cells, including alveolar type II cells and bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) that reside at the bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ). Our findings showed that activation of oncogenic Kras alone or in combination with the removal of the tumor suppressor p53 in SPC+ cells resulted in development of alveolar tumors. Similarly, sustained EGF signaling in SPC+ cells led to alveolar tumors. By contrast, BASCs failed to proliferate or produce tumors under these conditions. Importantly, in a mouse strain in which Kras/p53 activity was selectively altered in type II cells but not BASCs, alveolar tumors developed while BADJs retained normal architecture. These results confirm and extend previous findings and support a model in which lung adenocarcinoma can initiate in alveolar type II cells. Our results establish the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which lung cancer initiates and progresses in a specific lung cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2099888885,"In the mammalian testis, coexisting tight junctions (TJs), basal ectoplasmic specializations, and gap junctions (GJs), together with desmosomes near the basement membrane, constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The most notable feature of the BTB, however, is the extensive network of actin filament bundles, which makes it one of the tightest blood-tissue barriers. The BTB undergoes restructuring to facilitate the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes at stage VIII-IX of the epithelial cycle. Thus, the F-actin network at the BTB undergoes cyclic reorganization via a yet-to-be explored mechanism. Rictor, the key component of mTORC2 that is known to regulate actin cytoskeleton, was shown to express stage-specifically at the BTB in the seminiferous epithelium. Its expression was down-regulated at the BTB in stage VIII-IX tubules, coinciding with BTB restructuring at these stages. Using an in vivo model, a down-regulation of rictor at the BTB was also detected during adjudin-induced BTB disruption, illustrating rictor expression is positively correlated with the status of the BTB integrity. Indeed, the knockdown of rictor by RNAi was found to perturb the Sertoli cell TJ-barrier function in vitro and the BTB integrity in vivo. This loss of barrier function was accompanied by changes in F-actin organization at the Sertoli cell BTB in vitro and in vivo, associated with a loss of interaction between actin and α-catenin or ZO-1. Rictor knockdown by RNAi was also found to impede Sertoli cell-cell GJ communication, disrupting protein distribution (e.g., occludin, ZO-1) at the BTB, illustrating that rictor is a crucial BTB regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2085360155,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS), a multisubunit needle-like apparatus, has recently been found to play a role in interspecies interactions. The Gram-negative bacteria harboring T6SS (donor) deliver the effectors into their neighboring cells (recipient) to kill them. Meanwhile, the cognate immunity proteins were employed to protect the donor cells against the toxic effectors. Tae4 (type VI amidase effector 4) and Tai4 (type VI amidase immunity 4) are newly identified T6SS effector-immunity pairs. Here, we report the crystal structures of Tae4 from Enterobacter cloacae and Tae4-Tai4 complexes from both E. cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium. Tae4 acts as a dl-endopeptidase and displays a typical N1pC/P60 domain. Unlike Tsi1 (type VI secretion immunity 1), Tai4 is an all-helical protein and forms a dimer in solution. The small angle x-ray scattering study combined with the analytical ultracentrifugation reveal that the Tae4-Tai4 complex is a compact heterotetramer that consists of a Tai4 dimer and two Tae4 molecules in solution. Structure-based mutational analysis of the Tae4-Tai4 interface shows that a helix (α3) of one subunit in dimeric Tai4 plays a major role in binding of Tae4, whereas a protruding loop (L4) in the other subunit is mainly responsible for inhibiting Tae4 activity. The inhibition process requires collaboration between the Tai4 dimer. These results reveal a novel and unique inhibition mechanism in effector-immunity pairs and suggest a new strategy to develop antipathogen drugs.Background: The bacteria effector Tae4 is injected into the recipient cells to kill them and the immunity protein Tai4 is produced to inactivate Tae4.Results: Tae4 displays a papain-like fold, and Tai4 dimer is responsible for inhibiting Tae4 activity.Conclusion: The inactivation of Tae4 is required by collaboration of both subunits of Tai4 dimer.Significance: Our results add new insights into the effector-immunity interaction module. The type VI secretion system (T6SS), a multisubunit needle-like apparatus, has recently been found to play a role in interspecies interactions. The Gram-negative bacteria harboring T6SS (donor) deliver the effectors into their neighboring cells (recipient) to kill them. Meanwhile, the cognate immunity proteins were employed to protect the donor cells against the toxic effectors. Tae4 (type VI amidase effector 4) and Tai4 (type VI amidase immunity 4) are newly identified T6SS effector-immunity pairs. Here, we report the crystal structures of Tae4 from Enterobacter cloacae and Tae4-Tai4 complexes from both E. cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium. Tae4 acts as a dl-endopeptidase and displays a typical N1pC/P60 domain. Unlike Tsi1 (type VI secretion immunity 1), Tai4 is an all-helical protein and forms a dimer in solution. The small angle x-ray scattering study combined with the analytical ultracentrifugation reveal that the Tae4-Tai4 complex is a compact heterotetramer that consists of a Tai4 dimer and two Tae4 molecules in solution. Structure-based mutational analysis of the Tae4-Tai4 interface shows that a helix (α3) of one subunit in dimeric Tai4 plays a major role in binding of Tae4, whereas a protruding loop (L4) in the other subunit is mainly responsible for inhibiting Tae4 activity.

Roy C.R. Recognition and delivery of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells by bacterial secretion systems.Traffic. 2006; 7: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the T6SS has roles in interspecies interactions by injecting effector proteins into the periplasmic compartment of the recipient cells (2.Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. GÜvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D.

The T6SS from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa targets at least three effector proteins, namely Tse1, Tse2, and Tse3, to recipient cells. Tse1 has peptidoglycan (PG) amidase activity that hydrolyzes the peptide bond between γ-d-Glu and meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDAP), and Tse3 acts as a muramidase cleaving the β-1,4 linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. The target of Tse2 remains unknown (4.Li M. Le Trong I. Carl M.A. Larson E.T. Chou S. De Leon J.A. Dove S.L. Stenkamp R.E. Mougous J.D.

Specific cognate immunity proteins, Tsi1 and Tsi3 from P. aeruginosa, are secreted into the periplasmic space to protect the target cell. These proteins bind and neutralize the activities of Tse1 and Tse3, respectively (3.Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

In 2012, Russell et al. identified new PG peptidase effectors of Gram-negative bacteria that fall into four highly divergent families (Tae1, Tae2, Tae3, and Tae4) on the basis of sequence homology and different substrate specificities (6.Russell A.B. Singh P. Brittnacher M. Bui N.K. Hood R.D. Carl M.A. Agnello D.M. Schwarz S. Goodlett D.R. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

Effector and its cognate immunity proteins are often characterized as operons, suggesting that the self-protection is a general feature in Gram-negative bacteria possessing the T6SS. Tse1 and Tsi1 were renamed to Tae1 (type VI amidase effector) and Tai1 (type VI amidase immunity). Tae2 and Tae3 are responsible for the cleavage of a mDAP-d-Ala bond. The opposing cognate immunity proteins, Tai2 and Tai3, inactivate the amidase activities of Tae2 and Tae3. Similar to Tae1, Tae4 can hydrolyze the d-Glu-mDAP bond. However, it targets the acceptor stem rather than the donor stem. Our group and others have solved the crystal structures Tae1 and its complex with Tai1 from P. aeruginosa and revealed the structural mechanisms for the inhibition of Tae1 by Tai1 (7.Benz J.

Crystal structure of type VI effector Tse1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But so far the structure of Tae4 has not been reported. Both Tae4 and Tai4 bear very low sequence homology with Tae1 and Tai1, and the effectors have different substrate specificities. Therefore, the substrate recognition and catalysis by Tae4 may be different from that of Tae1. The mechanism of how Tai4 specifically inactivates Tae4 remains unknown. Structural exploration of Tae4 and the Tae4-Tai4 complex will aid the development of new antibacterial agents and our understanding of the role of T6SS in interspecies competition. In this paper, we have determined the crystal structure of Tae4 from Enterobacter cloacae. The Tae4-Tai4 structures from E. cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium were also solved by x-ray crystallography. Tae4 displays several distinct features different from its structural homologues. A flexible loop may contribute to substrate specificity based on structural and mutagenesis analysis. The Tae4-Tai4 complex forms a heterotetramer that is closely linked to the biological function. A biochemical approach was used to reveal the species specificity of the Tae4 effector recognized by Tai4, and the common nature of the effector inhibited by an immunity protein through binding to a lid loop represents a characteristic toxin-antitoxin interaction model. The genes encoding full-length EcTae4 and truncated EcTai4 (residues 19–117 without the N-terminal 18-residue signal peptide) were amplified from the E. cloacae genomic DNA. The PCR products were digested and then cloned into the pET28at-plus vector (11.Zhang H. Gao Z.Q. Wang W.J. Liu G.F. Shtykova E.V. Xu J.H. Li L.F. Su X.D. Dong Y.H.

These expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). EcTae4 was also ligated into the pET21b vector (Novagen) between the NheI and XhoI sites. The two recombinant plasmids (pET21b-EcTae4 and pET28at-plus-EcTai4) were co-transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells for co-expression. The genes encoding full-length StTae4 and truncated StTai4 (without the N-terminal 24-residue signal peptide) were PCR-amplified from S. typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA and cloned using the same procedure as above. Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (10.Zhang H. Gao Z.Q. Su X.D Dong Y.H. Crystal structure of type VI effector Tse1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 289 K. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol) containing 250 mm imidazole. The proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography and subsequent gel-filtration chromatography. All the mutants were generated by the overlap PCR method. EcTae4 and the Tae4-Tai4 complex were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml using Millipore Amicon Ultra 10 KD. Crystallization screens were performed with Hampton Research and Qiagen kits using sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 293 K. EcTae4 crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction grew from 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, pH 5.6, 1.0 m lithium sulfate monohydrate. Tae4-Tai4 from E. cloacae were crystallized using 0.2 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 25% (w/v) PEG1000. The SeMet S. typhimurium Tae4-Tai4 crystal was obtained in the mixture solution of 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 5.6, and 30% v/v (+/−) -2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in 2–3 days. All of the data were collected on the beamline 3W1A at BSRF (Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility) with a mounted MAR-165 CCD detector. Before data collection, the crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol for a few seconds and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All the data were processed by HKL2000 (12.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The SeMet crystal structure of the Tae4-Tai4 complex from S. typhimurium was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The selenium atoms were located by the program Shelxd (13.Sheldrick G.M. Experimental phasing with SHELXC/D/E: combining chain tracing with density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and then used to calculate the initial phases in Shelxe. The phases from Shelxe were improved in Resolve (14.Terwilliger T.C. Maximum likelihood density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The Tae4 and Tae4-Tai4 complex structures from E. cloacae were determined by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (18.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar) with the SeMet one as the searching model. All of the structures were validated by Molprobity (19.Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd., W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

SAXS data were collected on the beamline station 1W2A in BSRF using a MARCCD165 detector. The scattering was recorded in the range of the momentum transfer 0.023 < s < 0.22 Å−1, in which s = (4πsinθ)/λ, 2θ represents the scattering angle, and the x-ray wavelength λ is 1.54 Å. The measurements were performed in a cuvette (100 μl) with exposure time of 100 s to diminish the parasitic scattering. The PRIMUS program was used to process the scattering curves (20.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The sample was measured at different protein concentrations (1, 3, and 5 mg/ml for S. typhimurium Tae4-Tai4 proteins; 2, 4, and 6 mg/ml for E. cloacae Tae4-Tai4 proteins) to exclude concentration dependence. The distance distribution functions p (r) was computed with experimental data by the program GNOM (21.Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). The theoretical curves were calculated by the program CRYSOL (22.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. CRYSOL: a program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). The program GASBOR was used to build the ab initio low resolution shapes of the complex in solution (23.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Determination of domain structure of proteins from x-ray solution scattering.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The protein structure is represented by an ensemble of dummy residues. The sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifugation (Beckman-Coulter Instruments) with a Ti rotor at 293 K. Both the Tae4-Tai4 proteins were diluted to an A280 of 0.8. The SEDFIT program was used to analyze the sedimentation coefficient (24.Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The interactions between EcTae4 and EcTai4 were explored using a BIAcore 3000 instrument at 298 K. EcTae4 (∼2 μg/ml) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, using the amine coupling kit. EcTai4, and its mutants were injected at a flow rate of 40 μl/min for 90 s, followed by washing with running buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) for 10 min. The CM5 surface was regenerated with 100 mm phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 40 μl/min for 50 s. The kinetic parameters were modeled with the BIAevaluation 4.1 software. l-Ala-d-Glu-mDAP was docked into the EcTae4 structure by the AutoDock 4.2 program (25.Morris G.M. Huey R. Lindstrom W. Sanner M.F. Belew R.K. Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. AutoDock4 and AutoDockTools4: automated docking with selective receptor flexibility.J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13567) Google Scholar). Docking studies were carried out using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm with 25,000 energy evaluations. The grid maps contained 50 × 50 × 50 points with a grid points spacing of 0.375 Å in each dimension. Cys-46 and His-128 were treated as flexible residues in the process of modeling. The model with the lowest binding energy was selected for analysis. Tae4/Tai4 mutants from E. cloacae were subcloned into the pET22b/pET26b vectors containing signal peptide sequences. A single colony harboring the expressing plasmid was grown in LB medium at 310 K. After overnight culture, the cells were serially diluted in 10-fold steps and plated onto the LB agar supplemented with antibiotic and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The plates were prepared for pictures after an additional 20 h growth at 310 K. Tobacco etch virus was used to remove the His tag of the EcTae4 proteins. His-tag EcTai4 and its variant proteins were treated with nickel beads at 277 K for 10 min. Subsequently, the prey proteins were loaded into the beads. After extensive washing with 20 mm imidazole, the proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The crystal structure of Tae4 from E. cloacae (EcTae4) has been determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å. Residues 145–148 could not be seen because of the poor electron density (Fig. 1A). Tae4 crystallizes in the space group P3221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The overall structure of Tae4 demonstrates a common architecture of the NlpC/P60 domain (26.Anantharaman V. Aravind L.

In the present structure, Tae4 can be divided into two subdomains (N-terminal and C-terminal) connected by loop 7 (residues 93–97). The N-terminal subdomain is composed of an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by a short α-helix. The C-terminal subdomain is formed by five α-helices and a β-hairpin (Fig. 1, A and B). According to previous studies, the substrate binding sites are located in a concave between these two subdomains (6.Russell A.B. Singh P. Brittnacher M. Bui N.K. Hood R.D. Carl M.A. Agnello D.M.

We have so far been unable to obtain the crystal structure of Tae4 with its substrate. Therefore, molecular docking was employed to investigate the potential binding sites. In the ligand binding model, mDAP forms a hydrogen bond with Asn-19 and is stabilized further by interactions with Asp-139 and Asp-140 at the S1′ site (32.Schechter I. Berger A.

The S1 pocket is shaped by Asn-44, Ala-45 Cys-46, Arg-49, and His-128, where the d-Glu is located (Fig. 3A). In YkfC, Trp-228 is proposed to occupy both S2 and S1 binding sites (30.Xu Q. Abdubek P.

SERT relies exclusively on the coat protein complex II component SEC24C for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export. The closely related transporters for noradrenaline and dopamine depend on SEC24D. Here, we show that discrimination between SEC24C and SEC24D is specified by the residue at position +2 downstream from the ER export motif (607RI608 in SERT). Substituting Lys610 with tyrosine, the corresponding residue found in the noradrenaline and dopamine transporters, switched the SEC24 isoform preference: SERT-K610Y relied solely on SEC24D to reach the cell surface. This analysis was extended to other SLC6 (solute carrier 6) transporter family members: siRNA-dependent depletion of SEC24C, but not of SEC24D, reduced surface levels of the glycine transporter-1a, the betaine/GABA transporter and the GABA transporter-4. Experiments with dominant negative versions of SEC24C and SEC24D recapitulated these findings. We also verified that the presence of two ER export motifs (in concatemers of SERT and GABA transporter-1) supported recruitment of both SEC24C and SEC24D. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to document a change in SEC24 specificity by mutation of a single residue in the client protein.

https://openalex.org/W2011889516,"Severing the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) by crushing the optic nerve (ONC) causes the majority of RGC to degenerate and die, primarily by apoptosis. We showed recently that after ONC in adult rats, caspase-2 activation occurred specifically in RGC while no localisation of caspase-3 was observed in ganglion cells but in cells of the inner nuclear layer. We further showed that inhibition of caspase-2 using a single injection of stably modified siRNA to caspase-2 protected almost all RGC from death at 7 days, offering significant protection for up to 1 month after ONC. In the present study, we confirmed that cleaved caspase-2 was localised and activated in RGC (and occasional neurons in the inner nuclear layer), while TUNEL⁺ RGC were also observed after ONC. We then investigated if suppression of caspase-2 using serial intravitreal injections of the pharmacological inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk (z-VDVAD) protected RGC from death for 15 days after ONC. Treatment of eyes with z-VDVAD suppressed cleaved caspase-2 activation by >85% at 3-4 days after ONC. Increasing concentrations of z-VDVAD protected greater numbers of RGC from death at 15 days after ONC, up to a maximum of 60% using 4000 ng/ml of z-VDVAD, compared to PBS treated controls. The 15-day treatment with 4000 ng/ml of z-VDVAD after ONC suppressed levels of cleaved caspase-2 but no significant changes in levels of cleaved caspase-3, -6, -7 or -8 were detected. Although suppression of caspase-2 protected 60% of RGC from death, RGC axon regeneration was not promoted. These results suggest that caspase-2 specifically mediates death of RGC after ONC and that suppression of caspase-2 may be a useful therapeutic strategy to enhance RGC survival not only after axotomy but also in diseases where RGC death occurs such as glaucoma and optic neuritis."

https://openalex.org/W2167207012,"Previously, we reported an acidification-dependent interaction of the endosomal vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) with cytohesin-2, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), suggesting that it functions as a pH-sensing receptor. Here, we have studied the molecular mechanism of signaling between the V-ATPase, cytohesin-2, and Arf GTP-binding proteins. We found that part of the N-terminal cytosolic tail of the V-ATPase a2-subunit (a2N), corresponding to its first 17 amino acids (a2N(1–17)), potently modulates the enzymatic GDP/GTP exchange activity of cytohesin-2. Moreover, this peptide strongly inhibits GEF activity via direct interaction with the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-2.

Cytohesins are Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) for the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family, which belongs to the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins. Cytohesin-2 (also known as ARNO) is a member of the cytohesin family, which includes another three members as follows: cytohesin-1, cytohesin-3 (also called ARNO3 or GRP1), and cytohesin-4. These proteins share common structures, containing the following four domains: (i) an N-terminal coiled-coil; (ii) a central Sec7 domain; (iii) a pleckstrin homology domain; and (iv) a C-terminal polybasic motif region. The conserved Sec7 catalytic domain is responsible for Arf-GEF activity, which activates Arf GTP-binding proteins involved in signaling and regulation of the vesicular trafficking in both endocytic and exocytic pathways (9.Donaldson J.G.

Given the importance of both the V-ATPase and cytohesin to cellular signaling, we have been examining the potential relationship between the two proteins. In previous work from our laboratory, we found that the V-ATPase itself functions as a pH-sensing receptor in endosomes (6.Hurtado-Lorenzo A. Skinner M. El Annan J. Futai M. Sun-Wada G.H. Bourgoin S.

V-ATPase: a potential pH sensor.Nat Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, it was shown that a2-subunit isoform containing V-ATPase directly interacts with cytohesin-2 and Arf family GTP-binding proteins, recruiting these proteins to early endosomes in an acidification-dependent manner. Moreover, our recent study demonstrated that cytohesin-2 directly interacts not only with the a2-subunit but with all four (a1–a4) a-subunit isoforms of the V-ATPase, indicating a widespread regulatory interaction between V-ATPase and Arf family GTP-binding proteins (26.Merkulova M.

During the course of this work, we identified two structural elements involved in specific and high affinity association of the V-ATPase a2-subunit isoform with cytohesin-2 as follows: (i) an N-terminal binding motif formed by the first 17 amino acids a2N(1–17) of the cytosolic N-terminal tail of a2-subunit (a2N), and (ii) an interaction pocket formed by the catalytic Sec7 and regulatory polybasic domains of cytohesin-2 (27.Merkulova M.

Biacore analysis revealed a very strong binding affinity between this a2N(1–17) peptide and the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-2, which was similar to the binding affinity between full-length cytohesin-2 and the complete a2N. We hypothesized that the a2N(1–17) peptide could be involved in the signaling and regulation of the enzymatic GEF activity of cytohesin-2 (27.Merkulova M. Bakulina A. Thaker Y.R. GrÜber G.

Here, we have examined the molecular mechanism of binding and signaling between the V-ATPase, cytohesin-2, and Arf GTP-binding proteins. We now report a novel function of the V-ATPase as a signaling receptor that modulates activity of cytohesin-2 and Arf GTP-binding proteins. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and in silico docking analysis, we identified the structural basis and molecular mechanism of this novel signaling phenomenon. Our data also suggest that the signaling between V-ATPase, cytohesin-2, and Arf family GTP-binding proteins is an evolutionarily conserved and a widespread phenomenon that may take place on a variety of membranes and organelles from yeast to mammalian cells.

Cells were disrupted by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiLoad Q column. Arf1 was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10%(v/v) glycerol. The fractions containing Arf1 were loaded onto a Sephacryl column. The fractions containing Arf1 were pooled. The protein solution was concentrated, and buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT by ultrafiltration. Myristoylated Arf1 (myr-Arf1) was isolated using a phenyl-Sepharose HP column. The column was developed in a gradient of 3 m to 100 mm NaCl. NU-PAGE analysis shows >95% purity of myr-Arf1 (Fig. 1A).

To load (Δ17)Arf1 and (Δ13)Arf6 with GDP, both recombinant proteins were incubated with 10-fold GDP and 2 mm EDTA. Excess GDP was removed using a column packed with Sephadex G-25M. We used two assays to determine the GDP/GTP exchange activity of both full-length cytohesin-2 and Sec7 domain. This assay allows the steady-state enzymatic GEF activity analysis of full-length cytohesin-2 or Sec7 domain with Arf1 and Arf6 in the presence of PIP2-containing liposomes (33.Santy L.C. Frank S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2031504489,"The α1 Na/K-ATPase possesses both pumping and signaling functions. Using purified enzyme we found that the α1 Na/K-ATPase might interact with and regulate Src activity in a conformation-dependent manner. Here we further explored the importance of the conformational transition capability of α1 Na/K-ATPase in regulation of Src-related signal transduction in cell culture. We first rescued the α1-knockdown cells by wild-type rat α1 or α1 mutants (I279A and F286A) that are known to be defective in conformational transition. Stable cell lines with comparable expression of wild type α1, I279A, and F286A were characterized. As expected, the defects in conformation transition resulted in comparable degree of inhibition of pumping activity in the mutant-rescued cell lines. However, I279A was more effective in inhibiting basal Src activity than either the wild-type or the F286A. Although much higher ouabain concentration was required to stimulate Src in I279A-rescued cells, extracellular K(+) was comparably effective in regulating Src in both control and I279A cells. In contrast, ouabain and extracellular K(+) failed to produce detectable changes in Src activity in F286A-rescued cells. Furthermore, expression of either mutant inhibited integrin-induced activation of Src/FAK pathways and slowed cell spreading processes. Finally, the expression of these mutants inhibited cell growth, with I279A being more potent than that of F286A. Taken together, the new findings suggest that the α1 Na/K-ATPase may be a key player in dynamic regulation of cellular Src activity and that the capability of normal conformation transition is essential for both pumping and signaling functions of α1 Na/K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2094210450,"GPR17 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by two classes of molecules: uracil-nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes. GPR17 is required for initiating the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors but has to be down-regulated to allow cells to undergo terminal maturation. Although a great deal has been learned about GPR17 expression and signaling, no information is currently available about the trafficking of native receptors after the exposure of differentiating oligodendrocytes to endogenous agonists. Here, we demonstrate that neuron-conditioned medium induces the transcriptionally mediated, time-regulated expression of GPR17 in Oli-neu, an oligodendrocyte precursor cell line, making these cells suitable for studying the endocytic traffic of the native receptor. Agonist-induced internalization, intracellular trafficking, and membrane recycling of GPR17 were analyzed by biochemical and immunofluorescence assays using an ad hoc-developed antibody against the extracellular N-terminal of GPR17. Both UDP-glucose and LTD4 increased GPR17 internalization, although with different efficiency. At early time points, internalized GPR17 co-localized with transferrin receptor, whereas at later times it partially co-localized with the lysosomal marker Lamp1, suggesting that a portion of GPR17 is targeted to lysosomes upon ligand binding. An analysis of receptor recycling and degradation demonstrated that a significant aliquot of GPR17 is recycled to the cell surface. Furthermore, internalized GPR17 displayed a co-localization with the marker of the “short loop” recycling endosomes, Rab4, while showing very minor co-localization with the “long loop” recycling marker, Rab11. Our results provide the first data on the agonist-induced trafficking of native GPR17 in oligodendroglial cells and may have implications for both physiological and pathological myelination.Background: GPR17 is a key player in oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Altogether, these studies indicate that GPR17 is an integral signaling component controlling oligodendrocyte ontogenesis and suggest that the appropriate activation and deactivation of GPR17 are crucial steps in OPC maturation. As it has been reported for many GPCRs, after ligand binding, GPR17 may undergo endocytosis and subsequent sorting into lysosomes for degradation and/or into recycling endosomes for re-incorporation into the plasma membrane. The balance of this dynamic intracellular trafficking is physiologically relevant because it modulates receptor levels at the cell surface. This process has important implications for the activation or silencing of GPR17-signaling pathway(s), and in turn, for OPC differentiation (12Ferguson S.S.

Endocytosis and signaling. Intertwining molecular networks.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). It may even be hypothesized that GPR17 endocytosis may represent a key event necessary to allow OPCs to proceed to myelination. A similar process has been associated with the specification of other cell lineages, where the down-regulation of membrane receptors has been proposed to be necessary to allow cells to proceed toward terminal differentiation (17Walrafen P. Verdier F. Kadri Z. Chrétien S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. Both proteasomes and lysosomes degrade the activated erythropoietin receptor.Blood. 2005; 105: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the abnormal up-regulation of GPR17 has been associated with defective myelination during development and with multiple sclerosis (7Chen Y. Wu H. Wang S. Koito H. Li J. Ye F. Hoang J. Escobar S.S. Gow A. Arnett H.A. Trapp B.D. Karandikar N.J. Hsieh J. Lu Q.R. The oligodendrocyte-specific G protein-coupled receptor GPR17 is a cell-intrinsic timer of myelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, the characterization of the mechanisms involved in the expression of GPR17 in the plasma membrane may help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of GPR17 to oligodendrogenesis and may set the background for interpreting the consequences of GPR17 dysfunction in disease. At present, however, there are very few studies available on the trafficking of GPR17 both under basal conditions and upon activation. In 1321N1 cells heterologously expressing hGPR17, it has been demonstrated that the GPR17 agonists UDP-glucose and LTD4 determine receptor desensitization/re-sensitization (6Daniele S. Trincavelli M.L. Gabelloni P. Lecca D. Rosa P. Abbracchio M.P. Martini C. Agonist-induced desensitization/resensitization of human G protein-coupled receptor 17. A functional cross-talk between purinergic and cysteinyl-leukotriene ligands.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 338: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a previous study has failed to demonstrate the direct activation of GPR17 by agonists, proposing that the receptor may function exclusively as a negative regulator for the cysLT1 receptor response to LTD4 treatment (18Maekawa A. Balestrieri B. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y. GPR17 is a negative regulator of the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor response to leukotriene D4..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11685-11690Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Benned-Jensen and Rosenkilde (19Benned-Jensen T. Rosenkilde M.M. Distinct expression and ligand binding profiles of two constitutively active GPR17 splice variants.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 159: 1092-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that mouse or human GPR17 is activated by uracil nucleotides but apparently not by LTD4 or LTC4 and showed that LTD4 did not significantly increase the internalization of FLAG-tagged hGPR17 in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Moreover, despite the crucial role of GPR17 in OPCs (see above) and the evidence that the receptor is clearly down-regulated in cells achieving terminal maturation, no studies are yet available on the agonist-induced regulation of native GPR17 in cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. In this study, therefore, we decided to analyze the endocytic trafficking of native GPR17 after activation with uracil nucleotides or cysLTs using a physiological expression system. Although OPC primary cultures would represent an ideal system, the necessity to isolate them from tissue for each experiment and the relatively low number of cells obtained from each preparation markedly limited their use in the detailed biochemical analysis planned for the present work. To avoid this problem, we selected Oli-neu cells, an OPC cell line immortalized from E16 mouse brains because these cells can be induced to recapitulate several features of differentiating OPCs in vitro (20Jung M. Krämer E. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H.

Distinct endocytic recycling of myelin proteins promotes oligodendroglial membrane remodeling.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first established the conditions for stimulating the endogenous expression of GPR17 in Oli-neu and then used these cells for the analysis of the endocytic trafficking of native GPR17. We found that Oli-neu cells express significant amounts of GPR17 after incubation with medium conditioned from neuronal primary cultures. The expression of the receptor was transient and depended on the maturational stages of Oli-neu toward a more differentiated phenotype; GPR17 synthesis was up-regulated during the early stages of differentiation and was down-regulated when the cells reached later stages of maturation, as shown in primary OPCs (2Lecca D.

Furthermore, the GPR17 gene promoter appeared to be highly activated by factors released in the medium by neurons and/or astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that UDP-glucose and LTD4, although with low efficiency, stimulated clathrin-mediated endocytosis of GPR17. After internalization, the receptor is delivered into early endosomes and then sorted either to lysosomes for degradation or recycled to the cell surface via the small G-protein Rab4-dependent pathway.

The siRNA against GPR17 were designed and synthesized by Qiagen (Milan, Italy), and the transfection reagent INTERFERinTM came from Polyplus-transfection (Illkirch, France). An antibody was raised in rabbit using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of mouse GPR17 (MNGLEAALPSLTDNSSLAYSEQC) coupled to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (22Taverna E. Saba E.

The antibodies (from here on referred to as anti-Nt-GPR17) were affinity-purified and tested for their specificity for in vivo immunolabeling. The human GPR17 promoter was analyzed with the Genomatix suite. A small fragment of 909 bp was hypothesized to be a regulatory region, and it was cloned into a pGL4.17 vector (Promega), upstream to the luc2 reporter gene, using the primers 5′-CGCTCGAGTTCCCATGTTGCTGGATGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAGCTTCGCTGAGTGTTTCCTCTGCT-3′ (reverse) containing a cassette for the restriction enzymes XhoI and HindIII, respectively. The generated vector was called pGL4-h909. The Oli-neu murine OPC cell line was kindly provided by Prof. J.

The neuron-conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from primary cultured neurons prepared from the cerebral cortex of 18-day-old rat embryos and maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 as previously described (23Passafaro M. Piëch V. Sheng M. Subunit-specific temporal and spatial patterns of AMPA receptor exocytosis in hippocampal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The CM was collected after 7–10 days and passed through a 22-μm filter. The Oli-neu cells were cultured in normal medium or normal medium plus CM in a 1:1 ratio. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiated Oli-neu cells were preincubated for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Oli-neu medium and labeled with 200 μCi/ml Express 35S-protein labeling mix ([35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min. They were then washed twice with complete medium containing a 2-fold excess of methionine/cysteine and chased in the absence or presence of the drugs for the times indicated under “Results.” At the end of the chase, the cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The extracts were immediately analyzed by gel electrophoresis or after immunoprecipitation (see above). The gels were exposed to phosphor screens and analyzed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Band intensity was quantified with ImageQuant software. For RNA interference, the Oli-neu cells were plated the day before and incubated in CM for 6 h before transfection. The cells were transfected using the transfection reagent INTERFERinTM without siRNA (mock transfection control), 2.5 nm scrambled siRNA (negative control), or a siRNA designed to silence mouse GPR17 (Qiagen; target sequences), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 24 or 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis or the cellular proteins extracted for immunoblotting. For forkhead box protein (Fox)O1 knock-down, Oli-neu cells were transfected with 50 nm siRNA designed to silence mouse FoxO1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Millipore). Thirty-six hours after transfection cells were incubated for 24 h with CM and then fixed as described above.

After 24 h of transfection, the medium was removed, and fresh CM was added. Analysis of GPR17 internalization was performed ∼48 h after transfection. For FoxO1 overexpression, Oli-neu were transfected with cDNAs encoding GFP-FoxO1 or FLAG-FoxO1-alanine-aspartic acid-alanine (ADA) obtained from Dr. D. Accili (Columbia University, New York) and provided by Addgene. After 48 h of incubation in Sato medium, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence.

https://openalex.org/W2037273083,"Neuroglobins, previously thought to be restricted to vertebrate neurons, were detected in the brain of a photosymbiotic acoel, Symsagittifera roscoffensis, and in neurosensory cells of the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica. For the neuroglobin of S. roscoffensis, a member of a lineage that originated either at the base of the bilateria or of the deuterostome clade, we report the ligand binding properties, crystal structure at 2.3 Å, and brain immunocytochemical pattern. We also describe in situ hybridizations of two neuroglobins specifically expressed in differentiating nematocytes (neurosensory cells) and in statocytes (ciliated mechanosensory cells) of C. hemisphaerica, a member of the early branching animal phylum cnidaria. In silico searches using these neuroglobins as queries revealed the presence of previously unidentified neuroglobin-like sequences in most metazoan lineages. Because neural systems are almost ubiquitous in metazoa, the constitutive expression of neuroglobin-like proteins strongly supports the notion of an intimate association of neuroglobins with the evolution of animal neural systems and hints at the preservation of a vitally important function. Neuroglobins were probably recruited in the first protoneurons in early metazoans from globin precursors. Neuroglobins were identified in choanoflagellates, sponges, and placozoans and were conserved during nervous system evolution. Because the origin of neuroglobins predates the other metazoan globins, it is likely that neuroglobin gene duplication followed by co-option and subfunctionalization led to the emergence of globin families in protostomes and deuterostomes (i.e. convergent evolution)."
https://openalex.org/W2017976049,"The Drosophila integrator complex consists of 14 subunits that associate with the C terminus of Rpb1 and catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent snRNAs near their 3' ends. Although disruption of almost any integrator subunit causes snRNA misprocessing, very little is known about the role of the individual subunits or the network of structural and functional interactions that exist within the complex. Here we developed an RNAi rescue assay in Drosophila S2 cells to identify functional domains within integrator subunit 12 (IntS12) required for snRNA 3' end formation. Surprisingly, the defining feature of the Ints12 protein, a highly conserved and centrally located plant homeodomain finger domain, is not required for reporter snRNA 3' end cleavage. Rather, we find a small, 45-amino acid N-terminal microdomain to be both necessary and nearly sufficient for snRNA biogenesis in cells depleted of endogenous IntS12 protein. This IntS12 microdomain can function autonomously, restoring full integrator processing activity when introduced into a heterologous protein. Moreover, mutations within the microdomain not only disrupt IntS12 function but also abolish binding to other integrator subunits. Finally, the IntS12 microdomain is sufficient to interact and stabilize the putative scaffold integrator subunit, IntS1. Collectively, these results identify an unexpected interaction between the largest and smallest integrator subunits that is essential for the 3' end formation of Drosophila snRNA."

In this study, we aimed to (i) investigate the level and pattern of genetic variability within/among populations of those species; (ii) evaluate genetic differentiation between both species and its relationships and ascertain whether both species are consistent with their current taxonomical treatment as separate species; and (iii) discuss the implications for the effective conservation of two species. Methods Total 574 individuals from 30 populations of R. palmatum and R. tanguticum were collected, covering the entire distribution range of two species in China. The genetic variation within and among 30 populations was evaluated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Important Findings Twelve selected ISSR primers generated a total of 175 fragments, 173 (98.86%) of which were polymorphic. The Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's index (I) of both species were high at species level (H = 0.3107, I = 0.4677 for R. palmatum; H = 0.2848, I = 0.4333 for R. tanguticum). But for both species, the genetic diversity was low at population level, and average within-population diversity of R. palmatum was H = 0.1438, I = 0.2151, and that of R. tanguticum was H = 0.1415, I = 0.2126. The hierarchical AMOVA revealed high levels of among-population genetic differentiation in both species, in line with the gene differentiation coefficient and the limited among-population gene flow (R. palmatum: Φst = 0.592, Gst = 0.537, Nm = 0.432; R. tanguticum: Φst = 0.567, Gst = 0.497, Nm = 0.507). By contrast, only 6.52% of the total genetic variance was partitioned between R. palmatum and R. tanguticum. Bayesian analysis, UPGMA cluster analysis, and PCoA analysis all demonstrated the similar results. A significant isolation-by-distance pattern was revealed in R. palmatum (r = 0.547, P = 0.010), but not in R. tanguticum (r = 0.241, P = 0.100). Based on these results, effective conservation strategies were proposed for these two species. The small molecular variance between R. palmatum and R. tanguticum revealed that they had a common ancestor, and we considered that these two species might not be good species."

https://openalex.org/W2053146167,"The GABA transporter GAT-1 belongs to the neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters which are crucial for synaptic transmission. GAT-1 mediates electrogenic transport of GABA together with sodium and chloride. Structure-function studies indicate that the bacterial homologue LeuT, which possess extra- and intracellular thin gates, is an excellent model for this class of neurotransmitter transporters. We recently showed that a conserved aspartate residue of GAT-1, Asp-451, whose LeuT equivalent participates in its thin extracellular gate, is functionally irreplaceable in GAT-1. Only the D451E mutant exhibited residual transport activity but with an elevated apparent sodium affinity as a consequence of an increased proportion of outward-facing transporters. Because during transport the opening and closing of external and internal gates should be tightly coupled, we have addressed the question of whether mutations of the intracellular thin gate residues Arg-44 and Asp-410 can compensate for the effects of their extracellular counterparts. Mutation of Asp-410 to glutamate resulted in impaired transport activity and a reduced apparent affinity for sodium. However, the transport activity of the double mutant D410E/D451E was increased by approximately 10-fold of that of each of the single mutants. Similar compensatory effects were also seen when other combinations of intra- and extracellular thin gate mutants were analyzed. Moreover, the introduction of D410E into the D451E background resulted in lower apparent sodium affinity than that of D451E alone. Our results indicate that a functional interaction of the external and internal gates of GAT-1 is essential for transport."
https://openalex.org/W1973739943,"Macrophage-specific apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion plays an important protective role in atherosclerosis. However, the precise signaling mechanisms regulating apoE secretion from primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in regulating basal and stimulated apoE secretion from HMDMs. Treatment of HMDMs with structurally distinct pan-PKC inhibitors (calphostin C, Ro-31-8220, Go6976) and a PKC inhibitory peptide all significantly decreased apoE secretion without significantly affecting apoE mRNA or apoE protein levels. The PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated apoE secretion, and both PMA-induced and apoAI-induced apoE secretion were inhibited by PKC inhibitors. PKC regulation of apoE secretion was found to be independent of the ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA1. Live cell imaging demonstrated that PKC inhibitors inhibited vesicular transport of apoE to the plasma membrane. Pharmacological or peptide inhibitor and knockdown studies indicate that classical isoforms PKCα/β and not PKCδ, -ε, -θ, or -ι/ζ isoforms regulate apoE secretion from HMDMs. The activity of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) correlated with modulation of PKC activity in these cells, and direct peptide inhibition of MARCKS inhibited apoE secretion, implicating MARCKS as a downstream effector of PKC in apoE secretion. Comparison with other secreted proteins indicated that PKC similarly regulated secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and chitinase-3-like-1 protein but differentially affected the secretion of other proteins. In conclusion, PKC regulates the secretion of apoE from primary human macrophages."

However, the mechanisms that shape the signaling response of the GPCR are not well understood. In this study, we replaced cone transducin α (cTα) for rod transducin α (rTα) in rod photoreceptors of transgenic mice, which also express S opsin, to evaluate the role of Gα subtype on signal amplification from different GPCRs in the same cell; such analysis may explain functional differences between retinal rod and cone photoreceptors. We showed that ectopically expressed cTα 1) forms a heterotrimeric complex with rod Gβ(1)γ(1), 2) substitutes equally for rTα in generating photoresponses initiated by either rhodopsin or S-cone opsin, and 3) exhibited similar light-activated translocation as endogenous rTα in rods and endogenous cTα in cones. Thus, rTα and cTα appear functionally interchangeable. Interestingly, light sensitivity appeared to correlate with the concentration of cTα when expression is reduced below 35% of normal. However, quantification of endogenous cTα concentration in cones showed a higher level to rTα in rods. Thus, reduced sensitivity in cones cannot be explained by reduced coupling efficiency between the GPCR and G protein or a lower concentration of G protein in cones versus rods."
https://openalex.org/W2089101223,"Human African trypanosomiasis is caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. Polyamine biosynthesis is a clinically validated target for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. Metabolic differences between the parasite and the human polyamine pathway are thought to contribute to species selectivity of pathway inhibitors. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) catalyzes a key step in the production of the polyamine spermidine. We previously showed that trypanosomatid AdoMetDC differs from other eukaryotic enzymes in that it is regulated by heterodimer formation with a catalytically dead paralog, designated prozyme, which binds with high affinity to the enzyme and increases its activity by up to 10(3)-fold. Herein, we examine the role of specific residues involved in AdoMetDC activation by prozyme through deletion and site-directed mutagenesis. Results indicate that 12 key amino acids at the N terminus of AdoMetDC are essential for prozyme-mediated activation with Leu-8, Leu-10, Met-11, and Met-13 identified as the key residues. These N-terminal residues are fully conserved in the trypanosomatids but are absent from other eukaryotic homologs lacking the prozyme mechanism, suggesting co-evolution of these residues with the prozyme mechanism. Heterodimer formation between AdoMetDC and prozyme was not impaired by mutation of Leu-8 and Leu-10 to Ala, suggesting that these residues are involved in a conformational change that is essential for activation.

Serum samples were collected at four time points: during 2007 (n = 1968), in October 2009 (n = 2218), in May 2010 (n = 2638) and in May 2011 (n = 2513) and were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. In 2007, 4.9% of the population had pre-existing HI titres ≥40, with the highest prevalence (20.0%) in 15-24 year-olds, followed by ≥80 year-olds (9.3%). The overall prevalence of HI titres ≥40 had not changed significantly in October 2009. In May 2010 the prevalence had increased to 48.6% with the highest percentages in 5-14 year-olds (76.2%) andlowest in 75-79 year-olds (18.3%). One year later the prevalence of HI titres ≥40 had increased further to 52.2%. Children 5-14 years had the highest incidence of infection and vaccine uptake as well as the highest post-pandemic protective antibody levels. In contrast, the elderly had high vaccine uptake and low attack rate but low levels of protective antibodies, underlining that factors other than HI antibodies are involved in protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, for all age-groups the seroprevalence was stable or increasing between 2010 and 2011, indicating that both vaccine- and infection-induced antibodies were long-lived."
https://openalex.org/W2069078331,"ApoA-IV is an amphipathic protein that can emulsify lipids and has been linked to protective roles against cardiovascular disease and obesity. We previously reported an x-ray crystal structure of apoA-IV that was truncated at its N and C termini. Here, we have extended this work by demonstrating that self-associated states of apoA-IV are stable and can be structurally studied using small-angle x-ray scattering. Both the full-length monomeric and dimeric forms of apoA-IV were examined, with the dimer showing an elongated rod core with two nodes at opposing ends. The monomer is roughly half the length of the dimer with a single node. Small-angle x-ray scattering visualization of several deletion mutants revealed that removal of both termini can have substantial conformational effects throughout the molecule. Additionally, the F334A point mutation, which we previously showed increases apoA-IV lipid binding, also exhibited large conformational effects on the entire dimer. Merging this study's low-resolution structural information with the crystal structure provides insight on the conformation of apoA-IV as a monomer and as a dimer and further defines that a clasp mechanism may control lipid binding and, ultimately, protein function."

https://openalex.org/W2066234852,"A strategy to reverse the symptoms of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency in a mouse model was investigated. The nucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) was expressed in TK2-deficient mice that have been shown to present with a severe phenotype caused by mitochondrial DNA depletion. The Dm-dNK+/− transgenic mice were shown to be able to rescue the TK2-deficient mice. The Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice were normal as judged by growth and behavior during the observation time of 6 months. The Dm-dNK-expressing mice showed a substantial increase in thymidine-phosphorylating activity in investigated tissues. The Dm-dNK expression also resulted in highly elevated dTTP pools. The dTTP pool alterations did not cause specific mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions when 6-month-old mice were analyzed. The mitochondrial DNA was also detected at normal levels.

Conclusion: Nucleotide import into mitochondria can compensate the loss of TK2 in differentiated tissues. Significance: The results highlight mechanisms to be explored for treatment of mtDNA depletion. The synthesis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not cell cycle-regulated and requires a constant supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for maintenance of the mitochondrial integrity in quiescent cells. dNTPs are synthesized by two pathways: the de novo pathway and the salvage pathway. The mitochondrial dNTP pool is maintained by salvage of deoxynucleosides within the mitochondria and by importing cytosolic deoxyribonucleotides through specific transporters (1Bridges E.G. Jiang Z.

Therefore, in nonreplicating cells, the mtDNA synthesis heavily depends on the salvage pathway enzymes thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) (6Zhou X. Johansson M. Solaroli N.

Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome comprises a heterogeneous group of mitochondrial disorders characterized by reduced levels of mtDNA but with no mutations or deletions of the mtDNA (10Suomalainen A. Isohanni P. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes — Many genes, common mechanisms.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2010; 20: 429-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mutations in the nuclear encoded dNKs, DGUOK and TK2, have been associated with hepatocerebral and myopathic forms of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, respectively (8Mandel H. Szargel R.

Other mutations known to cause mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome are mutations in p53R2, the succinyl-CoA ligase β subunit (SUCLA2), the succinyl-CoA ligase α subunit (SUCLG1), the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ), the twinkle gene (mitochondrial DNA helicase), and the MPV17 protein (12Wang L. Deoxynucleoside salvage enzymes and tissue specific mitochondrial DNA depletion.Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2010; 29: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To find possible strategies to treat mtDNA deficiency, some basic questions must be addressed. One important question is whether nucleotides delivered in the nuclear or cytosolic compartment can reach mitochondria and support mtDNA synthesis in quiescent cells. This would be of value because it is known from the antiviral field that mononucleotide analogs can reach the cytosol and act as monophosphate prodrugs targeting viral DNA (13Meier C. Jessen H.J. Balzarini J. Nucleoside diphosphate prodrugs.Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 2008; (Oxf.): 83-84Crossref Google Scholar, 14Mehellou Y. Balzarini J. McGuigan C. Aryloxy phosphoramidate triesters: a technology for delivering monophosphorylated nucleosides and sugars into cells.Chemmedchem. 2009; 4: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). If such monophosphates can be prodrugs of dTMP and dCMP, they could in theory reverse a TK2 deficiency provided they reach the mitochondrial compartment. The deoxyribonucleoside kinase from D. melanogaster (Dm-dNK) is a multisubstrate nucleoside kinase that has unique properties to recognize all four natural nucleosides and has a very high catalytic rate (15Johansson M. van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. Cloning and characterization of the multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Biol.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether Dm-dNK expression could rescue the severe phenotype of TK2-deficient mice (7Zhou X. Solaroli N. Bjerke M. Stewart J.B. Rozell B. Johansson M.

Our results demonstrate that the Dm-dNK-expressing mice (Dm-dNK+/− and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/−) appear as wild-type (wt) mice regarding growth, behavior, and mtDNA levels during the entire observation period of 6 months. The only evident differences between the Dm-dNK-expressing mice and the wt control mice were a highly elevated thymidine (dThd) phosphorylating activity and a 100-fold increase of the dTTP pool level. A mouse line expressing Dm-dNK was constructed by PCR amplification and subsequent cloning into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The transgene was cut from the vector using BglII and DraIII restriction enzymes. The Dm-dNK transgene was made through the pronuclear injection technique. Genotyping was performed by isolating DNA from tail tissues for PCR analysis of the presence of the Dm-dNK gene. Tail samples collected from mice ∼14 days old were cut ∼0.25 inches from the tip using sterile scissors, and the mice were ear-marked. DNA was isolated from the tail samples using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen), and the DNA was screened for Dm-dNK gene by PCR using specific primers for the Dm-dNK gene (Dm-dNK-F and Dm-dNK-R, supplemental Table 1). The mice were studied for growth rate, organ weights, mortality, and signs of neurological defects throughout the observation time of 6 months. Dm-dNK+/− mice were crossed with TK2+/− mice to generate Dm-dNK+/− TK2+/− mice, which were intercrossed to generate TK2-deficient mice expressing Dm-dNK (Dm-dNK+ TK2−/−) (see Fig. 3A). Genomic DNA of the Dm-dNK+TK2−/− mice was digested using the SpeI restriction enzyme and analyzed by Southern blot to confirm the absence of the wt TK2 allele, and the DNA was screened for the Dm-dNK gene by PCR as mentioned above. All animal experiments were compliant with the guidelines of the local ethical committee (S104-09, S135-11). Total protein was extracted from tissues using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Western blot was performed using 4–12% precast Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE) and Amersham Biosciences Hybond-P membrane (Invitrogen). The presence of Dm-dNK protein was detected using anti-histidine antibody targeted against His tag of the protein (Calbiochem, 1:3000) and anti-mouse IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (GE Healthcare, 1:3000). ECL (GE Healthcare) was used as a substrate for the HRP. The subcellular localization of Dm-dNK protein was determined through immunofluorescence. Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded in wells of chamber slide (Thermo Scientific) and cultured overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. When the confluence reached 50–80%, the cells were transfected with Dm-dNK construct using FuGENE® 6 reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 24 h before mitochondrial staining. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Life Technologies) at the concentration 0.25 ng/μl for 30 min. The cells were then fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and treated with cold acetone for 10 min. The subcellular localization of Dm-dNK was detected using anti-histidine primary antibody (Calbiochem) and Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies). The enzyme assays were carried out as described (18Solaroli N. Zheng X. Johansson M. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. Mitochondrial expression of the Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues were homogenized (using tube and pestle (Kimble Chase) or Qiagen TissueRuptor) and suspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P40). The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) and BSA as a standard. The enzymatic assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 15 mm NaF, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 40–50 μg of protein, 3 μm [methyl-3H]thymidine (2 Ci/mmol; Moravek), and 7 μm unlabeled thymidine in a volume of 50 μl. For the bromovinyl-2′-deoxyuridine (BVDU) assay, 2.5 μm [5-3H]BVDU (28 Ci/mmol) was used as the substrate. 10 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter discs after incubation at 37 °C at different time points (0, 10, 20, and 30 min). The filters were washed three times in 5 mm ammonium formate, and the filter-bound product was eluted from the filter with 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 m HCl. The radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting using 3 ml of scintillation buffer. The number of mtDNA copies per diploid nucleus in mouse tissues was determined using real-time PCR absolute quantification, using an ABI 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems). Total genomic DNA was purified from mouse tissues using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). 5–10 ng of genomic DNA was used in each reaction. Primers and probe for mouse mt-ND1 gene (mitochondrial encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1; primers, mt-ND1-F and mt-ND1-R; probe, mt-ND1) and for single-copy mouse RPPH1 gene (nuclear encoded ribonuclease P RNA component H1; primers, RPPH1-F and RPPH1-R; probe, RPPH1) were designed for this purpose (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). For each DNA sample, the mitochondrial gene mt-ND1 and the nuclear gene RPPH1 were quantified separately. Standard curves were generated using known numbers of a plasmid containing one copy of each of the two mouse genes referred above. According to the standard curve, the number of copies from each gene was calculated for each sample, and the number of mtDNA copies per diploid nucleus was calculated according to the formula: mtDNA copies per diploid nucleus = 2 × (mt-ND1 gene copies/RPPH1 gene copies). dNTP extracts were obtained from skeletal muscle after homogenization (Qiagen TissueRuptor) on ice in 10 volumes (w/v) of cold MTSE buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precipitated with 100% methanol (to a final concentration of 60%), kept for 1–3 h at −20 °C, boiled 3 min, and centrifuged at 20,670 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were evaporated until dry, resuspended in 200 μl of distilled water, and stored at −80 °C until needed. The total dNTP pools were determined as described (21Ferraro P. Franzolin E. Pontarin G. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Quantitation of cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e85Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl reaction volumes were generated by 10 μl of sample or standard with 90 μl of reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.25 mm of specific oligonucleotide template, 0.25 μm [2,8-3H]dATP (15.2 Ci/mmol; for dTTP, dCTP and dGTP determinations; Moravek) or [methyl-3H]dTTP (66.2 Ci/mmol; Moravek) for dATP determination, and 0.2 unit of Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) (1 unit catalyzes the incorporation of 10 nmol of deoxynucleotide into acid insoluble product in 30 min at 37 °C). After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter discs. After drying, the filters were washed three times for 10 min in 5% Na2HPO4, once in distilled water, and once in 95% ethanol. The filters are completely dried, and the retained radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and dNTP pools were determined in pmol dNTP/mg of tissue. The preparations of specific oligonucleotides for each dNTPs were as described (22Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Enzymatic assay for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates using synthetic oligonucleotides as template primers.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was synthesized using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression analysis of all genes was done with specific primers and TaqMan probes (MWG-Biotech), using the endogenous GAPDH gene as a loading control. The PCR reactions were done using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast equipment. The primers and probes for TK1, TK2, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), DGUOK, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 B (RRM2B), and GAPDH genes are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Total DNA was extracted from mice tissue and fragments from mt-Cytb gene (nucleotides 14073–14906) and mitochondrial DNA noncoding region (nucleotides 15357–138) were amplified by high fidelity PCR (PfuUltra high fidelity DNA polymerase, Agilent). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM®-T vector (Promega) after A-tailing the blunt-ended PCR products according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids of multiple clones obtained were sequenced to detect point mutations in those fragments, and mutation rates were calculated. Selected tissue samples from two mice per genotype were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and transferred to 70% ethanol after 24 h. After routine processing and paraffin embedding, 4-μm-thick sections were mounted on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and viewed under a light microscope. All experimental data are reported as mean, and error bars in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 indicate S.E. Student's t test was used to analyze differences between the mean values, and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Dm-dNK transgene was constructed using a pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 1A). Restriction digestion showed the Dm-dNK cDNA present in the construct used for transfection (Fig. 1B). Dm-dNK+/− mice were created by crossing a Dm-dNK+/− mouse with a wt mouse, and the pups (∼14 days) were screened for the presence of the Dm-dNK gene by PCR. The integration of the Dm-dNK transgene in the mouse genome was verified by PCR as shown in lanes 1 and 2 (Fig. 1C). The Dm-dNK protein expression was detected in skeletal muscle of 1-month-old mice by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D), whereas the control samples of litter mate wt mice did not show Dm-dNK protein expression. Dm-dNK has previously been shown to localize in the cell nucleus when expressed in human cells (20Zheng X. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

The Dm-dNK construct used in the present study was also shown to have a nuclear localization when transfected in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1). The catalytic activity of Dm-dNK was measured by dThd phosphorylation in tissue extracts from 1-month-old Dm-dNK+/− mice (Fig. 2A). Extracts from brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, and liver all showed increased dThd-phosphorylating activity as compared with corresponding tissues from wt control mice. Highest enzyme activity with ∼80-fold increase was detected in skeletal muscle and kidney, whereas activity in the liver showed a 1.5–2-fold increase. The dThd phosphorylation rates were similar when determined in skeletal muscle of 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old mice (Fig. 2B). In addition, to test for a gene dose effect, phosphorylation of the high affinity substrate BVDU was used to measure enzyme activity in kidneys of 1-month-old Dm-dNK+/− mice, Dm-dNK+/+ mice, and control wt mice. The homozygote Dm-dNK+/+ mice showed a slightly higher enzyme activity (1.5–2-fold) than the heterozygote Dm-dNK+/− mice (Fig. 2C). TK2-deficient mice expressing Dm-dNK (Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/−) were created as shown in Fig. 3A. Genomic DNA of Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice was analyzed by Southern blot to confirm the absence of the wt TK2 alleles (Fig. 3B). The Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice were fertile, appeared similar in size, and showed normal development in comparison with the wt and Dm-dNK+/− mice over the observation period of 6 months. The Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice showed increased dThd-phosphorylating activity at levels similar to the Dm-dNK+/− mice (supplemental Fig. S2). There was no significant difference in the relative organ weights of heart, liver, kidney, and spleen in these mice (Fig. 3C). There were no major histopathology differences between the mouse lines investigated (Fig. 3D), although a slight increase in tubular protein casts was observed in mice carrying the Dm-dNK transgene (supplemental Fig. S3). Quantification of the mtDNA was performed using real-time PCR to determine the number of mtDNA copies per diploid nucleus in brain and skeletal muscle of 6-month-old mice. These tissues were chosen for quantification because the dThd-phosphorylating activity was highest in skeletal muscle, and previous studies show mtDNA depletion in brain of newborn TK2−/− mice (7Zhou X. Solaroli N. Bjerke M. Stewart J.B. Rozell B. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Progressive loss of mitochondrial DNA in thymidine kinase 2-deficient mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2329-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). No change in mtDNA copy number was observed in tissues of both Dm-dNK+/− and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice (Fig. 4A). To determine the effect of Dm-dNK activity on intracellular dNTP pools, these were measured in whole cell extracts of skeletal muscle of 1-month-old wt and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice (Table 1). The results showed that there was a 114-fold increase of the dTTP pool, a 3.7-fold increase of the dCTP pool, and a 1.6-fold increase of the dGTP pool in the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice. It was not possible to obtain values of the dATP pool, probably because of the presence of a large excess of dTTP in the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− extracts that competed with the [3H]dTTP present in the reaction mix.TABLE 1dNTP pool levels in skeletal muscle of 1-month-old WT and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− micedNTP pool concentrationRatio (Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/−/WT)WTDm-dNK+/−TK2−/−pmol of dNTP/mg of tissuedTTP0.32 ± 0.0736 ± 4.0114dCTP0.39 ± 0.021.4 ± 0.23.7dGTP0.43 ± 0.030.67 ± 0.071.6dATP0.25 ± 0.03NDND Open table in a new tab The mRNA expression of several deoxyribonucleotide metabolizing enzymes was compared between wt, Dm-dNK+/−, and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice. The results showed a decrease of the expression of TK2 in the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice (p < 0.001) and a slight increase in R2 in the Dm-dNK+/− mice (p < 0.05) as compared with the wt mice. No significant change was observed in TK1, deoxycytidine kinase, DGUOK, and p53R2 expression levels (Fig. 4B). Point mutations in the mtDNA were determined by cloning and sequencing the mt-Cytb gene and mtDNA noncoding control regions in skeletal muscle of 6-month-old wt and Dm-dNK+/− mice (Table 2). The mutation frequencies were not significantly different in the wt and Dm-dNK+/− mice when analyzed in both the noncoding control regions (2.0–3.1 mutations/10 kb) and the mt-Cytb gene (1.7–7.8 mutations/10 kb) (p > 0.05). However, one of the Dm-dNK+/− mice showed a higher mutation frequency (∼14 mutations/10 kb) and indicates the importance of a more extensive mutation analysis in mice of older age.TABLE 2mtDNA point mutations analysisMouse (genotype)mt-Cytb geneNoncoding control regionNumber of mutations/base pairs sequencedMutation frequency (per 10 kb)Number of mutations/base pairs sequencedMutation frequency (per 10 kb)Wild type 10/58380.02/75672.6Wild type 21/50042.03/75673.9Wild type 32/66723.02/75672.6Dm-dNK+/− 13/58385.12/75672.6Dm-dNK+/− 21/33363.02/86482.3Dm-dNK+/− 37/500414.01/86481.2 Open table in a new tab The present work was initiated to address questions of importance to develop treatment strategies for specific mtDNA deficiency diseases. The strategy chosen was to express the multisubstrate Dm-dNK in TK2-deficient mice. The Dm-dNK cDNA has previously been expressed in mammalian cells, and the enzyme has been characterized regarding enzyme kinetics and substrate specificity (17Solaroli N. Johansson M. Balzarini J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6673-6679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Dm-dNK enzyme is closely related to the mammalian TK2 enzyme but, in contrast to TK2, Dm-dNK possesses a very high catalytic activity (15Johansson M. van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. Cloning and characterization of the multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23814-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on these enzymatic properties, we speculated that the Dm-dNK enzyme would be more efficient, as compared with TK2, to deliver dTTPs for mitochondrial DNA synthesis and thus rescue the severe phenotype of TK2-deficient mice. The alternative would have been to replace the missing TK2 with an identical TK2 transgene. However, TK2 is an enzyme with low catalytic activity and would not be optimal to address the fundamental question regarding cytosolic substitution of dTMP and dCMP as substrates for mtDNA synthesis. TK1 is only present in dividing cells, whereas TK2 is present both in nondividing and in dividing cells but at much lower levels (25Eriksson S. Arnér E. Spasokoukotskaja T. Wang L. Karlsson A.

Tissue specific distribution of pyrimidine deoxynucleoside salvage enzymes shed light on the mechanism of mitochondrial DNA depletion.Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2010; 29: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Accordingly, very low levels of dThd phosphorylation were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, liver, and kidney cells of the wt mice, and the low levels of activity observed probably originated mainly from TK2, although subpopulations of dividing cells may also be present because the tissue preparations contains a mixture of cell types. The dThd-phosphorylating activity observed in the tissue extracts of Dm-dNK-expressing mice (Dm-dNK+/− and Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/−) was a result of the combined activity of the low amount of TK2 enzyme and the Dm-dNK enzyme. The general pattern was a large increase of dThd phosphorylation in all investigated tissues, but there was also a variation depending on the tissue. Because the background TK1 and TK2 activities were very low, the differences most probably were due to a variation in the expression of the Dm-dNK gene. This variation in gene expression between different tissues could be due to differences in epigenetic modifications in different organs expressing Dm-dNK+/− (27Babinet C. Transgenic mice: an irreplaceable tool for the study of mammalian development and biology.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: S88-S94PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the increased dThd-phosphorylating activity was mainly due to Dm-dNK activity, and not the induction of TK1, the nucleoside analog substrate BVDU was used in kidney extracts. BVDU is a very efficient substrate for Dm-dNK but a poor substrate for TK1 (28Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Pérez-Pérez M.J. Hernández A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V.

Eriksson S. 5-Bromovinyl 2′-deoxyuridine phosphorylation by mitochondrial and cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK2 and TK1) and its use in selective measurement of TK2 activity in crude extracts.Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2008; 27: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The large increase of BVDU phosphorylation in kidney extracts of Dm-dNK+/− mice thus supports the conclusion that the Dm-dNK transgene is responsible for the increased dThd-phosphorylating activity. The effects of a strong and general increase of dThd phosphorylation have not previously been studied in a mammalian system, to our knowledge. This enzymatic reaction is the first step to synthesize dTTP for DNA synthesis. The question of how this dThd-phosphorylating activity affected the dTTP pool was therefore of great interest. dNTP pool imbalances are believed to affect the fidelity of DNA synthesis, and there is substantial evidence for the existence of substrate cycles to fine-tune dTTP levels (30Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Cytosolic high Km 5′-nucleotidase and 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase in substrate cycles involved in nucleotide metabolism.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34758-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the nuclear genome environment, mutagenic dNTP pools are known to activate the DNA damage checkpoint pathways (32Zegerman P. Diffley J.F.X. DNA replication as a target of the DNA damage checkpoint.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This may only occur if at least one dNTP is present at low levels and thereby limit DNA replication (33Kumar D. Viberg J. Nilsson A.K. Chabes A. Highly mutagenic and severely imbalanced dNTP pools can escape detection by the S-phase checkpoint.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The increased dTTP pools detected in our study are unique to address previous hypotheses regarding consequences of dNTP pool imbalances. We can conclude that the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice live without gross signs of disturbance with the high dTTP pools during the observation period of 6 months. However, this is a relatively short observation time, and we cannot exclude that the introduced Dm-dNK may affect the mice at an older age. In addition, it must be noted that the dNTP pool measurements are from whole cell extracts and do not reflect intramitochondrial dNTP levels. Because there was no significant difference in the mtDNA copy number in the Dm-dNK+/− or the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice, the increase in levels of dTTP may not have affected the fidelity of DNA synthesis. DNA sequencing revealed some mutations in the Dm-dNK+/− mice, but no pattern was found that would account for a high dTTP pool causing this effect, and the increase was not statistically significant. Elevated dTTP pools have also been found in mice deficient in thymidine phosphorylase, which dephosphorylates thymidine to thymine. Mutations in thymidine phosphorylase result in a syndrome called mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy presenting with increased dThd and dUrd concentrations (34Valentino M.L. Martí R. Tadesse S. López L.C. Manes J.L. Lyzak J. Hahn A. Carelli V. Hirano M. Thymidine and deoxyuridine accumulate in tissues of patients with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice lacking thymidine phosphorylase have been shown to exhibit elevated dTTP pools and late onset mtDNA depletion in brain (35López L.C. Akman H.O. García-Cazorla A. Dorado B. Martí R. Nishino I. Tadesse S. Pizzorno G. Shungu D. Bonilla E. Tanji K. Hirano M. Unbalanced deoxynucleotide pools cause mitochondrial DNA instability in thymidine phosphorylase-deficient mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Further studies of older mice will be necessary to draw conclusions on whether the high dTTP pool causes an increased rate of mutations in the Dm-dNK+/−TK2−/− mice. Studies have shown that limited availability of dCTP is a key factor for mtDNA depletion in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy rather than excess of dTTP (36González-Vioque E. Torres-Torronteras J. Andreu A.L. Martí R. Limited dCTP availability accounts for mitochondrial DNA depletion in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002035Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our present study also suggests that thymidine phosphorylase deficiency may cause additional cell alterations and that elevated dTTP pools alone are insufficient to explain the full set of symptoms observed in this disease. An important result of the present study is the proof that dTMP, synthesized exclusively by an enzyme outside the mitochondria, can compensate for the dTTP required for mtDNA synthesis in quiescent cells. This finding opens possibilities to deliver cytoplasmic monophosphate analogs that can subsequently serve as substrates for dTTP and mtDNA. There are examples of such monophosphate analogs in the antiviral field (13Meier C. Jessen H.J. Balzarini J. Nucleoside diphosphate prodrugs.Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 2008; (Oxf.): 83-84Crossref Google Scholar, 14Mehellou Y. Balzarini J. McGuigan C.

Chem. 2008; 51: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These compounds bypass the nucleoside kinase step, which is a requirement for treatment of TK2 or DGUOK deficiencies. The clinical success of antiviral nucleotide analog compounds proves that monophosphates can be easily administered to patients and effectively delivered to target cells.

https://openalex.org/W1997953789,"The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a rapid increase in atmospheric temperature over the last 50 years. Whether or not marine organisms thriving in this cold stenothermal environment are able to cope with warming is of concern. Here, we present changes to the growth and shell characteristics of the ecologically important, small and short lived brooding bivalve Lissarca miliaris from Signy Island, Antarctica. Using material collected from the 1970's to the present day, we show an increase in growth rate and adult shell deterioration accompanied by a decrease in offspring size, associated with an increase in annual average temperatures. Critical changes to the bivalve's ecology seen today evidence the problem of a shift in baseline since the onset of warming recorded in Antarctica. These small bivalves are demonstrating ecophysiological responses to subtle warming that, provided warming continues, could soon surpass a physiological tipping point, adding to warming associated threats such as increased predatory pressure and ocean acidification."
