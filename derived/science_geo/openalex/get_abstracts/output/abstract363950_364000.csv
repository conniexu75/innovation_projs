https://openalex.org/W2022267544,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that helps coordinate glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, AMPK is shown to transcriptionally regulate genes involved in controlling energy metabolism in skeletal muscle by acting together with the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD+ levels. This results in the deacetylation and activation of the SIRT1 downstream target PGC-1α. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is shown to transcriptionally regulate genes involved in controlling energy metabolism in skeletal muscle by acting together with the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD+ levels, resulting in the deacetylation and activation of the SIRT1 downstream target PGC-1α. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic fuel gauge conserved along the evolutionary scale in eukaryotes that senses changes in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio1. Recent evidence indicated an important role for AMPK in the therapeutic benefits of metformin2,3, thiazolidinediones4 and exercise5, which form the cornerstones of the clinical management of type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. In general, activation of AMPK acts to maintain cellular energy stores, switching on catabolic pathways that produce ATP, mostly by enhancing oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, while switching off anabolic pathways that consume ATP1. This regulation can take place acutely, through the regulation of fast post-translational events, but also by transcriptionally reprogramming the cell to meet energetic needs. Here we demonstrate that AMPK controls the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle by acting in coordination with another metabolic sensor, the NAD+-dependent type III deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD+ levels, resulting in the deacetylation and modulation of the activity of downstream SIRT1 targets that include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α and the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and O3 (FOXO3a) transcription factors. The AMPK-induced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of these targets explains many of the convergent biological effects of AMPK and SIRT1 on energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2161358581,"Clinical trials of microbicides as a means of preventing the transmission of HIV-1 to women have proved disappointing. Now a study in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–rhesus macaque vaginal transmission model for HIV infection suggests that a prophylactic approach might yet be worth pursuing. The commonly used antimicrobial compound glycerol monolaurate (GML) was found to suppress SIV infection even after repeated virus exposure. But its mechanism of action was surprising. The host's inflammatory response to the virus, rather than helping, was shown to fuel the infection by recruiting the very CD4+ T cells that the virus targets. GML's prophylactic action appeared to result from its ability to block this host response, rather than from a direct effect on the virus. This points to cell signalling and innate host responses in the mucosal cells as potential targets for drugs and vaccines aimed at preventing infection by HIV — and by other pathogens too if they use similar infection strategies. Glycerol monolaurate in a microbicide is shown to protect monkeys from infection after intra-vaginal exposure to high doses of SIV. The suppressive activity may be due to the inhibition of target cell recruitment due to glycerol-monolaurate-mediated inhibition of epithelial cell signalling and inflammatory cytokine expression. Although there has been great progress in treating human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection1, preventing transmission has thus far proven an elusive goal. Indeed, recent trials of a candidate vaccine and microbicide have been disappointing, both for want of efficacy and concerns about increased rates of transmission2,3,4. Nonetheless, studies of vaginal transmission in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–rhesus macaque (Macacca mulatta) model point to opportunities at the earliest stages of infection in which a vaccine or microbicide might be protective, by limiting the expansion of infected founder populations at the portal of entry5,6. Here we show in this SIV–macaque model, that an outside-in endocervical mucosal signalling system, involving MIP-3α (also known as CCL20), plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CCR5+cell-attracting chemokines produced by these cells, in combination with the innate immune and inflammatory responses to infection in both cervix and vagina, recruits CD4+ T cells to fuel this obligate expansion. We then show that glycerol monolaurate—a widely used antimicrobial compound7 with inhibitory activity against the production of MIP-3α and other proinflammatory cytokines8—can inhibit mucosal signalling and the innate and inflammatory response to HIV-1 and SIV in vitro, and in vivo it can protect rhesus macaques from acute infection despite repeated intra-vaginal exposure to high doses of SIV. This new approach, plausibly linked to interfering with innate host responses that recruit the target cells necessary to establish systemic infection, opens a promising new avenue for the development of effective interventions to block HIV-1 mucosal transmission."

https://openalex.org/W1986619660,"Although there is a growing recognition of the significance of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) as a biological signaling molecule involved in vascular and nervous system functions, its biogenesis and regulation are poorly understood. It is widely assumed that desulfhydration of cysteine is the major source of H(2)S in mammals and is catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). In this study, we demonstrate that the profligacy of human CSE results in a variety of reactions that generate H(2)S from cysteine and homocysteine. The gamma-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of homocysteine, yields H(2)S and a novel biomarker, homolanthionine, which has been reported in urine of homocystinuric patients, whereas a beta-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of cysteine, generates lanthionine. Kinetic simulations at physiologically relevant concentrations of cysteine and homocysteine, reveal that the alpha,beta-elimination of cysteine accounts for approximately 70% of H(2)S generation. However, the relative importance of homocysteine-derived H(2)S increases progressively with the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia, and under conditions of severely elevated homocysteine (200 microm), the alpha,gamma-elimination and gamma-replacement reactions of homocysteine together are predicted to account for approximately 90% of H(2)S generation by CSE. Excessive H(2)S production in hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the associated cardiovascular pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2094096129,"Osmoregulated transporters sense intracellular osmotic pressure and respond to hyperosmotic stress by accumulation of osmolytes to restore normal hydration levels. Here we report the determination of the X-ray structure of a member of the family of betaine/choline/carnitine transporters, the Na+-coupled symporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is a highly effective osmoregulated uptake system for glycine betaine. Glycine betaine is bound in a tryptophan box occluded from both sides of the membrane with aromatic side chains lining the transport pathway. BetP has the same overall fold as three unrelated Na+-coupled symporters. Whereas these are crystallized in either the outward-facing or the inward-facing conformation, the BetP structure reveals a unique intermediate conformation in the Na+-coupled transport cycle. The trimeric architecture of BetP and the break in three-fold symmetry by the osmosensing C-terminal helices suggest a regulatory mechanism of Na+-coupled osmolyte transport to counteract osmotic stress. Microorganisms need to adapt rapidly to extreme variations in salinity, temperature or osmolarity. Many of them counteract high osmolarity via the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes, highly polar, organic compounds that promote protein stability through unfavourable interactions with the unfolded state. High-affinity transporters are used to import osmolytes from extracellular sources and Ressl et al. report the determination of the X-ray structure of a member of the family of betaine/choline/carnitine transporters, the Na+-coupled symporter BetP, which is a highly effective osmoregulated uptake system for glycine betaine. The crystal structure shows BetP to have the same overall fold as other, unrelated Na+-coupled transporters, but it is captured in a unique intermediate conformation whereby the glycine betaine substrate is occluded from both sides of the membrane. The structure of BetP therefore provides new insights into both osmoregulation and the fundamental mechanisms of membrane transport. This paper presents the first X-ray structure of a member of the the betaine/choline/carnitine transporter family. This Na+-coupled symporter (BetP) has the same overall fold as other unrelated Na+-coupled transporters and is captured in an intermediate conformation, whereby the substrate (glycine betaine) is occluded from both sides of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2047254315,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, that play important regulatory roles in a variety of biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. In mammals, miRNAs have been shown to modulate adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, we performed a global miRNA gene expression assay in different fat depots of overweight and obese individuals to investigate whether miRNA expression in human adipose tissue is fat-depot specific and associated with parameters of obesity and glucose metabolism. Paired samples of abdominal subcutaneous (SC) and intraabdominal omental adipose tissue were obtained from fifteen individuals with either normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 9) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 6). Expression of 155 miRNAs was carried out using the TaqMan®MicroRNA Assays Human Panel Early Access Kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). We identified expression of 106 (68%) miRNAs in human omental and SC adipose tissue. There was no miRNA exclusively expressed in either fat depot, suggesting common developmental origin of both fat depots. Sixteen miRNAs (4 in NGT, 12 in T2D group) showed a significant fat depot specific expression pattern. We identified significant correlations between the expression of miRNA-17-5p, -132, -99a, -134, 181a, -145, -197 and both adipose tissue morphology and key metabolic parameters, including visceral fat area, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and circulating leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6. In conclusion, microRNA expression differences may contribute to intrinsic differences between omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, human adipose tissue miRNA expression correlates with adipocyte phenotype, parameters of obesity and glucose metabolism."

There is extensive evidence that recent climatic change has affected animal and plant populations, but no indicators exist that summarise impacts over many species and large areas. We use data on long-term population trends of European birds to develop such an indicator. We find a significant relationship between interspecific variation in population trend and the change in potential range extent between the late 20th and late 21st centuries, forecasted by climatic envelope models. Our indicator measures divergence in population trend between bird species predicted by climatic envelope models to be favourably affected by climatic change and those adversely affected. The indicator shows a rapid increase in the past twenty years, coinciding with a period of rapid warming."
https://openalex.org/W2029421531,"The role of mergers in producing galaxies, together with the finding that most large galaxies harbour black holes in their nuclei, implies that binary supermassive black hole systems should be common. Here we report that the quasar SDSS J153636.22+044127.0 is a plausible example of such a system. This quasar shows two broad-line emission systems, separated in velocity by 3,500 km s(-1). A third system of unresolved absorption lines has an intermediate velocity. These characteristics are unique among known quasars. We interpret this object as a binary system of two black holes, having masses of 10(7.3) and 10(8.9) solar masses separated by approximately 0.1 parsec with an orbital period of approximately 100 years."
https://openalex.org/W2057364898,"Engineering fluorescent proteins into large genomic clones, contained within BACs or fosmid vectors, is a tool to visualize and study spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in transgenic animals. Because these reporters cover large genomic regions, they most likely capture all cis-regulatory information and can therefore be expected to recapitulate all aspects of endogenous gene expression. Inserting tags at the target gene locus contained within genomic clones by homologous recombination (“recombineering”) represents the most straightforward method to generate these reporters. In this methodology paper, we describe a simple and robust pipeline for recombineering of fosmids, which we apply to generate reporter constructs in the nematode C. elegans, whose genome is almost entirely covered in an available fosmid library. We have generated a toolkit that allows for insertion of fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, VENUS, mCherry) and affinity tags at specific target sites within fosmid clones in a virtually seamless manner. Our new pipeline is less complex and, in our hands, works more robustly than previously described recombineering strategies to generate reporter fusions for C. elegans expression studies. Furthermore, our toolkit provides a novel recombineering cassette which inserts a SL2-spliced intercistronic region between the gene of interest and the fluorescent protein, thus creating a reporter controlled by all 5′ and 3′ cis-acting regulatory elements of the examined gene without the direct translational fusion between the two. With this configuration, the onset of expression and tissue specificity of secreted, sub-cellular compartmentalized or short-lived gene products can be easily detected. We describe other applications of fosmid recombineering as well. The simplicity, speed and robustness of the recombineering pipeline described here should prompt the routine use of this strategy for expression studies in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2088079940,"Watching a speaker's facial movements can dramatically enhance our ability to comprehend words, especially in noisy environments. From a general doctrine of combining information from different sensory modalities (the principle of inverse effectiveness), one would expect that the visual signals would be most effective at the highest levels of auditory noise. In contrast, we find, in accord with a recent paper, that visual information improves performance more at intermediate levels of auditory noise than at the highest levels, and we show that a novel visual stimulus containing only temporal information does the same. We present a Bayesian model of optimal cue integration that can explain these conflicts. In this model, words are regarded as points in a multidimensional space and word recognition is a probabilistic inference process. When the dimensionality of the feature space is low, the Bayesian model predicts inverse effectiveness; when the dimensionality is high, the enhancement is maximal at intermediate auditory noise levels. When the auditory and visual stimuli differ slightly in high noise, the model makes a counterintuitive prediction: as sound quality increases, the proportion of reported words corresponding to the visual stimulus should first increase and then decrease. We confirm this prediction in a behavioral experiment. We conclude that auditory-visual speech perception obeys the same notion of optimality previously observed only for simple multisensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1481861927,"An αβ T-cell response depends on the recognition of antigen plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins by its antigen receptor (TCR). Scott-Browne et al. present evidence that TCR genes encode inherent specificity for MHC molecules. In this paper the authors present evidence that T-cell receptor genes encode inherent specificity for major histocompatibility complex molecules. An αβ T-cell response depends on the recognition of antigen plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins1 by its antigen receptor (TCR). The ability of peripheral αβ T cells to recognize MHC is at least partly determined by MHC-dependent thymic selection, by which an immature T cell survives only if its TCR can recognize self MHC2,3,4,5,6,7. This process may allow MHC-reactive TCRs to be selected from a repertoire with completely random and unbiased specificities. However, analysis of thymocytes before positive selection indicated that TCR proteins might have a predetermined ability to bind MHC8,9,10,11. Here we show that specific germline-encoded amino acids in the TCR promote ‘generic’ MHC recognition and control thymic selection. In mice expressing single, rearranged TCR β-chains, individual mutation of amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2β to Ala reduced development of the entire TCR repertoire. Altogether, these results show that thymic selection is controlled by germline-encoded MHC contact points in the αβ TCR and indicate that the diversity of the peripheral T-cell repertoire is enhanced by this ‘built-in’ specificity."

Patch clamp studies of mitochondria isolated from cells deficient in one or both of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak show that at least one of the proteins must be present for formation of the cytochrome c-translocating channel, mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), and that the single channel behaviors of MACs containing exclusively Bax or Bak are similar. Truncated Bid catalyzes MAC formation in isolated mitochondria containing Bax and/or Bak with a time course of minutes and does not require VDAC1 or VDAC3.

Unlike Bax, Bak is normally a resident of the mitochondrial outer membrane and is bound to VDAC2, another outer membrane protein (16Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J.

However, Bak is not available for oligomerization until another pro-apoptotic protein, like t-Bid, disrupts the interaction of Bak with VDAC2. In contrast, most Bax is located in the cytoplasm until an apoptotic signal induces the translocation of Bax to the outer membrane of mitochondria and eventual Bax oligomerization in this same membrane (14Antonsson B.

Bax and Bak have multiple putative transmembrane domains; the amphipathic helices 5 and 6 of Bax are predicted to form, at least in part, the pore of the cytochrome c release channel (18Annis M. Soucie E. Dlugosz P. Cruz-Aguado J. Penn L. Leber B. Andrews D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Bax lacking helices 5 and 6 does not translocate to mitochondria nor cause cytochrome c release (19Parikh N. Koshy C. Dhayabaran V. Perumalsamy L. Sowdhamini R. Sarin A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 24938-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Given the structural similarities between Bax and Bak, the same helices may be important in formation of the MAC pore by both proteins (21Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although Bax and Bak are certainly involved in MAC formation, the exact molecular composition of this channel remains unknown. In this study we report that Bax and Bak are functionally redundant with regard to MAC formation and cytochrome c release in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). This is true despite the fact that Bak normally resides in the outer membrane, whereas Bax is generally translocated to this membrane to induce MAC formation. Our experimental design bypasses Bax translocation and any underlying autocatalytic mechanism that might be involved (22Lartigue L. Medina C. Schembri L. Chabert P. Zanese M. Tomasello F. Dalibart R. Thoraval D. Crouzet M. Ichas F. De Giorgi F. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Instead, it focuses on formation of the MAC pore. Early MAC-associated conductance increments are relatively small, suggesting that Bax-dependent formation of the cytochrome c-permeable pore does not occur prior to membrane insertion of Bax. Mathematical modeling of the conductance changes indicates that, if MAC is a circular pore assembled by sequential addition of helices 5 and 6 from Bax and/or Bak monomers, the mature, cytochrome c transport-competent pore is likely a 9–10-mer of these proteins.

Alternatively, cytochrome c was measured after permeabilization of cells as described previously (16Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c in the supernatants of cells or isolated mitochondria was quantified by ELISA following the manufacturer's instructions (QuantikineR&D Systems). alamethicin (80 μg/ml) was used as a positive control (31Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Patch Clamping Techniques—Membrane patches of isolated mitochondria were, if need be, excised after formation of a seal using micropipettes with ∼0.3-μm tips and resistances of 10–30 megohms at room temperature. The micropipettes tips were smaller than those of our earlier studies directly patch clamping mitochondria. Because the cross-sectional area of the membrane patches is smaller, the reported conductances of patch-clamped mitochondria are lower than previously reported before and after induction of apoptosis (13.3 ± 2.5 nS apoptotic versus 6.3 ± 3.6 nS control in 2001 (13Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and 3–5 nS apoptotic verses 0.6 ± 0.4 nS control in this study). Patching media was symmetrical, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 0.23 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. Voltages were clamped with an Axopatch 200 amplifier and reported as pipette potentials. Conductance was typically determined from total amplitude histograms of 30 s of current traces at +20 mV. Patches were scored “positive” for MAC when an increase in voltage-independent (±50 mV) conductance of at least 1.5 nS was seen within 30 min of seal development; this typically occurred when t-Bid was included in the micropipette tip. This channel activity is referred to as MAC in mitochondria isolated from Parental cells, MAC-Bak from Bax KO cells, and MAC-Bax from Bak KO cells. The permeability of untreated mitochondria is also reflected in the seal resistances that were not found to be significantly different for the various cell lines (n = 10–23 independent patches for each cell line). Levels of t-Bid used in the patch pipettes for these experiments were 20 nm for Parental and Bax KO cells, 250 nm for Bak KO cells, and 1 μm for DKO cells unless otherwise indicated. pClamp version 8 (Axon Instruments) and WinEDR version 2.3.3 (Strathclyde Electrophysiological Software; courtesy of J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK) were used for current analysis. Sample rate was 5 kHz with 2-kHz filtration. When necessary, simple perfusion of the chamber often resulted in excision of patches. Permeability ratios were calculated from the reversal potential in the presence of a 150:30 mm KCl gradient as described previously (32Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Dibucaine (Sigma D0638) and cytochrome c (Sigma C-7752) were introduced and removed by perfusion of the bath (0.5 ml volume) with 3–5 ml of patching solution. The channel activity of monomeric human Bax, truncated for 20 amino acids at the C terminus (BaxΔC20), activated by t-Bid (14Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol.

Micropipette tips were filled with media containing 380 ng/μl monomeric BaxΔC plus 35 ng/μl t-Bid and then backfilled with patching media. Hence, the actual Bax concentration was lower than that loaded in the tips. Seals were formed with these micropipettes on giant liposomes prepared as described previously (32Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Criado M. Keller B.U. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mathematical Analysis—The number of helices forming MAC was estimated assuming α-helices had a diameter (D) of 1.2 nm (34Hirokawa T. Uechi J. Sasamoto H. Suwa M. Mitaku S. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and aligned on center perpendicular to the membrane. The resulting polygon had a variable number (n) of vertices, where the center of each helix was located at a vertex of the polygon. The area (A) was approximated by a circle whose area was calculated by Equation 1 as more helical staves were added to the polygon in an approach similar to Sanson et al. (35Sansom M.S. Kerr I.D. Mellor I.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), A=πD2(12−2cos(2πn)−1/2)2(Eq. 1) The area was then corrected by adding n times the triangular area (2Ac) between staves in the pore. Ac is defined by subtracting the area of the two arcs Ar (Equation 2) and AR (Equation 3) from the area of the right triangle AΔ (Equation 4) that is defined by the base r and height R + r in Equation 5 (see supplemental Fig. 1S). Ar=((n−2)2nπ)2ππr2=πr2(n−2)/4n(Eq. 2) AR=12nπR2(Eq. 3) AΔ=12base ⋅ height = 12r(r+R)2−r2=12r(r+R)cos(π/n)(Eq. 4) Ac=AΔ−(Ar+AR)=1/2r(r+R)2−r2−(12nπR2+(n−24n)πr2)(Eq. 5) where we define R in Equation 6 as, R=((sin(π/n))−1−1)r(Eq. 6) To determine the relationship between the number (n) of α-helices and the area, these corrected data were best fit (correlation coefficient of 0.9991) in Fig. 7A by the polynomial Equation 7, area=7×10−12n2+9×10−11n−4×10−10(Eq. 7) The cross-sectional pore area was converted into predicted conductance that was corrected for access resistance using the method of Hille (36Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes, 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 291-314Google Scholar) through Equation 8. ρpore=(L+(πa)/2)(ρsol/πa2)(Eq. 8) where ρpore and ρsol are the resistivity of the pore and a solution of 0.15 m KCl; L is pore length (5.5 nm corresponds to the thickness of the outer membrane (37Mannella C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), and a is the radius of the pore. This equation established the relationship between the conductance and number of α-helices forming the MAC pore (Fig. 7B). MAC formation occurred in incremental steps of conductance (transition size) often of ∼300 pS. These same equations were used to estimate the number of α-helices inserted into the barrel of the MAC pore to generate the observed transitions. For example, an initial transition of ∼300 pS corresponds to insertion of 6–8 helices. However, the relationship between the transition size and the number of α-helices inserted into the barrel is not linear, i.e. transitions of ∼300 pS into moderately larger 1–3-nS channels likely correspond to the insertion of 1 α-helix to the pore (Fig. 7D). The predicted transition sizes generated by insertions of 1, 2, 4, or 6 α-helices into pores of varying conductance (Fig. 7D) were calculated using the method of Hille (36Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes, 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 291-314Google Scholar) and corrected for access resistance (Equation 8), where the radius (a) was calculated from the area in Equation 7. Analyses were done using Excel and Prism 4 from GraphPad Software. The presence of either Bax or Bak is sufficient to allow initiation of the mitochondria-dependent death program, although the absence of both proteins is necessary to inhibit cytochrome c release (38Kandasamy K.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). MEF lines deficient in either or both Bax and Bak were used to define the roles of these Bcl-2 family proteins in MAC formation and cytochrome c release. These cell lines include the Parental (Bax+/+Bak+/+), the single knockouts Bax KO (Bax-/-Bak+/+) and Bak KO (Bax+/+Bak-/-), as well as the double knock-out DKO (Bax-/-Bak-/-). The presence of Bax and Bak in cell extracts of each MEF line was assessed in the Western blots of Fig. 1A. The mitochondrial amounts of Bax and Bak for these cell lines treated without (control) or with (apoptotic) 1 μm staurosporine are shown in the histograms of Fig. 1B relative to VDAC, which is constitutively expressed in the outer membrane. Although the relative levels of Bak remained stable, Bax levels in mitochondria increased almost 2–4-fold after induction of apoptosis. MAC Forms in the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane of Apoptotic MEF Cells Expressing Bax and/or Bak—We previously found MAC could form in Bax KO but not DKO mitochondria (8Dejean L.M. Martinez-Caballero S. Guo L. Hughes C. Teijido O. Ducret T. Ichas F. Korsmeyer S.J. Antonsson B. Jonas E.A. Kinnally K.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); these studies were expanded to include Bak KO cells. Activity of the mitochondrial outer membrane channel, MAC, is detected as increased conductance when mitochondria of apoptotic cells are patch-clamped. This increase in membrane permeability ranged from 3 to 5 nS and was statistically significant (p = 0.0001; n = 20–23 patches) for mitochondria from Parental, Bak KO, and Bax KO lines after induction of apoptosis by staurosporine (Fig. 1C). MAC was scored “present” if the increase in conductance of the outer membrane was at least 1.5 nS. These data indicate MAC was formed by 16 h after induction of apoptosis in these cells. In contrast, the conductances of mitochondrial patches from untreated cells and apoptotic DKO cells were essentially identical (p = 0.8; n = 20–23 patches), indicating that MAC formation requires expression of either Bax or Bak (Fig. 1C). MAC is the outer membrane channel associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol during intrinsic apoptosis. The fraction of cytochrome c released to the cytosol was determined for the four MEF lines following treatment with staurosporine. As shown in Fig. 1D, cytochrome c was released to the cytosol in Parental, Bax KO, and Bak KO cells, but not DKO cells at the time MAC was detected during staurosporine treatment. These results show that expression of either Bax or Bak is necessary for cytochrome c release and MAC formation. Furthermore, these findings indicate that Bax and Bak are functionally redundant with respect to both processes. The MAC activity of MEF mitochondria showed electrophysiological properties similar to those reported previously for mitochondria from other apoptotic cells. As previously found, the peak conductances were large and variable (in the range 1.5–5 nS), showed no obvious dependence on voltage (±50 mV), and were slightly cation-selective (8Dejean L.M. Martinez-Caballero S. Guo L. Hughes C. Teijido O. Ducret T. Ichas F. Korsmeyer S.J. Antonsson B. Jonas E.A. Kinnally K.W. Mol. Biol.

To further explore the possibility that MAC activity of mitochondria containing only Bax is different from that of mitochondria containing only Bak, a system triggered by t-Bid was established in which MAC formation could be monitored in real time while cytochrome c is released. Cytochrome c Release Induced by t-Bid Is Dose-dependent and Requires Bax or Bak Expression—The BH3-only protein Bid is cleaved to form activated t-Bid during apoptosis and triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria of cells that express Bax and/or Bak (29Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 40Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Chachar M. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Fannjiang Y.

Mitochondria from the various MEF cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of t-Bid for up to 30 min, and the amounts of cytochrome c released were measured (Fig. 2). Although uncleaved Bid or vehicle alone had no effect, t-Bid induced a dose-dependent release of cytochrome c with EC50 (effective concentration for release of 50% of cytochrome c) of 7 nm for Parental, 17 nm for Bax KO, and ∼250 nm for Bak KO mitochondria (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). As expected, t-Bid failed to induce cytochrome c release in mitochondria from DKO cells. The kinetics show the release of cytochrome c occurs over minutes (Fig. 2B). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria lacking either Bax or Bak was delayed compared with that of Parental mitochondria. Increasing the dose of t-Bid from 20 nm to 1 μm increased the extent of release after 30 min most dramatically in mitochondria lacking Bak.TABLE 1Electrophysiological properties of MAC activity induced by t-BidParental (MAC)Bax KO (MAC-Bak)Bak KO (MAC-Bax)VDAC1VDAC3 KO (MAC)FL5.12 (MAC)aData were included for comparison with MAC recorded from mitochondria and proteoliposomes (8, 10, 13)[t-Bid] EC50 (nm) cytochrome c release71724720NAbNA means not applicable[t-Bid] micropipette (nm)20202501000NAMAC assembly frequency (% patches)64 (n = 11)cn = number of independent determinations68 (n = 12)67 (n = 12)75 (n = 12)NAPeak conductance (nS)3.5 ± 1.8 (n = 7)3.1 ± 2.0 (n = 8)3.0 ± 1.9 (n = 8)3.5 ± 1.5 (n = 9)2.5–4.5 (n = 57)Ion selectivity PK/PCl3.1 ± 1.4 (n = 5)3.7 (n = 1)3.4 ± 1.2 (n = 4)3.4 ± 1.5 (n = 7)3.0 ± 0.9Voltage-dependent (±50 mV)NoNoNoNoNoNo. of MAC assembled in under 10 min5 of 76 of 85 of 89 of 9NAPredicted diameter (nm)dSee under “Experimental Procedures”; data are based on peak conductance assuming 1.2-nm helices are inserted normal to the membrane to form circular pores65.65.564–7Predicted no. of helices forming poredSee under “Experimental Procedures”; data are based on peak conductance assuming 1.2-nm helices are inserted normal to the membrane to form circular pores1817171816–21a Data were included for comparison with MAC recorded from mitochondria and proteoliposomes (8Dejean L.M.

Because of differences in EC50 for cytochrome c release, the t-Bid concentration used to backfill the micropipette tip was 20 nm for mitochondria from Parental and Bax KO cells, 250 nm for Bak KO mitochondria, and 1 μm for DKO mitochondria.

The plant AtClC-a uses the pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane to accumulate the nutrient NO3- in this organelle. When AtClC-a was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it mediated NO3-/H+ exchange and less efficiently mediated Cl–/H+ exchange. Mutating the “gating glutamate” Glu-203 to alanine resulted in an uncoupled anion conductance that was larger for Cl– than NO3-. Replacing the “proton glutamate” Glu-270 by alanine abolished currents. These could be restored by the uncoupling E203A mutation. Whereas mammalian endosomal ClC-4 and ClC-5 mediate stoichiometrically coupled 2Cl–/H+ exchange, their NO3- transport is largely uncoupled from protons. By contrast, the AtClC-a-mediated NO3- accumulation in plant vacuoles requires tight NO3-/H+ coupling. Comparison of AtClC-a and ClC-5 sequences identified a proline in AtClC-a that is replaced by serine in all mammalian CLC isoforms. When this proline was mutated to serine (P160S), Cl–/H+ exchange of AtClC-a proceeded as efficiently as NO3-/H+ exchange, suggesting a role of this residue in NO3-/H+ exchange. Indeed, when the corresponding serine of ClC-5 was replaced by proline, this Cl–/H+ exchanger gained efficient NO3-/H+ coupling. When inserted into the model Torpedo chloride channel ClC-0, the equivalent mutation increased nitrate relative to chloride conductance. Hence, proline in the CLC pore signature sequence is important for NO3-/H+ exchange and NO3- conductance both in plants and mammals.

CLC proteins form dimers with two largely independent permeation pathways (22.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2347-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Each of the monomers displays two anion binding sites (22.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). A third binding site is observed when a certain key glutamate residue, which is located halfway in the permeation pathway of almost all CLC proteins, is mutated to alanine (23.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Mutating this gating glutamate in CLC Cl– channels strongly affects or even completely suppresses single pore gating (23.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), whereas CLC exchangers are transformed by such mutations into pure anion conductances that are not coupled to proton transport (17.Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 19.Scheel O. Zdebik A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J.

Another key glutamate, located at the cytoplasmic surface of the CLC monomer, seems to be a hallmark of CLC anion/proton exchangers. Mutating this proton glutamate to nontitratable amino acids uncouples anion transport from protons in the bacterial EcClC-1 protein (27.Accardi A. Walden M. Nguitragool W. Jayaram H. Williams C. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) but seems to abolish transport altogether in mammalian ClC-4 and -5 (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G.

In those latter proteins, anion transport could be restored by additionally introducing an uncoupling mutation at the gating glutamate (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P.

We report here the first functional expression of a plant CLC in animal cells. Expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant AtClC-a in Xenopus oocytes indicate a general role of gating and proton glutamate residues in anion/proton coupling across different isoforms and species. We identified a proline in the CLC signature sequence of AtClC-a that plays a crucial role in NO3-/H+ exchange. Mutating it to serine, the residue present in mammalian CLC proteins at this position, rendered AtClC-a Cl–/H+ exchange as efficient as NO3-/H+ exchange. Conversely, changing the corresponding serine of ClC-5 to proline converted it into an efficient NO3-/H+ exchanger. When proline replaced the critical serine in Torpedo ClC-0, the relative NO3- conductance of this model Cl– channel was drastically increased, and “fast” protopore gating was slowed. Molecular Biology—cDNAs of A. thaliana AtClC-a (12.Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol.

Capped cRNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (SP6 RNA polymerase for pTLN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression in Xenopus Oocyte and Two-electrode Voltage-Clamp Studies—Pieces of ovary were obtained by surgery from deeply anesthetized (0.1% tricaine; Sigma) pigmented or albino Xenopus laevis frogs. Oocytes were prepared by manual dissection and collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) digestion. 23 ng (ClC-5), 46–50 ng (AtClC-a), or 1–3 ng (ClC-0) of cRNA were injected into oocytes. Oocytes were kept in ND96 solution (containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl .2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) at 17 °C for 1–2 days (ClC-0), 3–4 days (ClC-5), or for 5–6 days (AtClC-a). Two-electrode voltage clamping was performed at room temperature (20–24 °C) using a TEC10 amplifier (npi Electronics, Tamm, Germany) and pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices). The standard bath solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm K+ gluconate, 5 mm Ca2+ d-gluconate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (or MES for buffering to pH 5.5 or 6.5; Tris for pH 8.5). For some experiments, NaCl was substituted with equal amounts of either NaNO3, NaBr, or NaI. Ag/AgCl electrodes and 3 m KCl agar bridges were used as reference and bath electrodes, respectively. Measurement of Relative Intracellular pH Changes Using the “Fluorocyte” Device—Proton transport was measured semiquantitatively by monitoring intracellular fluorescence signal changes using the Fluorocyte device (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 23 nl of saturated aqueous solution of the pH indicator BCECF (Molecular Probes) were injected into oocytes 10–30 min before measurements. Oocytes were placed over a hole 0.8 mm in diameter, through which BCECF fluorescence changes were measured in response to pulse trains, which served to reduce the possible activation of endogenous oocyte currents. Starting from a holding voltage of −60 mV, depolarizing pulse trains clamped oocytes to +90 mV for 400 ms and −60 mV for 100 ms, whereas hyperpolarizing pulse trains started from −30 mV and clamped to −160 mV for 400 ms and to −30 mV for 100 ms. BCECF fluorescence was measured with a photodiode and digitally Bessel-filtered at 0.3 Hz. These nonratiometric measurements generally show drifts owed to bleaching or intracellular dye distribution (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but allow for sensitive measurements of pH changes upon changes in voltage or external ion composition. Previous attempts to functionally express plant CLC proteins in animal cells proved unsuccessful (12.Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, when Xenopus oocytes were measured 5 or more days after injecting AtClC-a cRNA, currents well above background levels were observed in two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments (Fig. 1). These outwardly rectifying currents were roughly 30% larger when extracellular chloride was replaced by nitrate (NO3-) (Fig. 1, A–C), smaller with extracellular iodide, and nearly unchanged with a replacement by bromide (Fig. 1C). Reversal potentials indicated that the apparent anion permeability was larger for NO3- than for the other anions tested. It should be noted that for CLC exchangers, the observed apparent permeabilities and conductances represent those of coupled anion/proton exchange rather than diffusive anion transport. Contrasting with the slow activation of currents by depolarization observed in plant vacuoles (16.De Angeli A. Monachello D. Ephritikhine G. Frachisse J.M. Thomine S. Gambale F. Barbier-Brygoo H. Nature. 2006; 442: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), heterologously expressed AtClC-a currents almost totally lacked time-dependent relaxations (Fig. 1, A and B). Like currents elicited by ClC-4 or -5 (26.Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), AtClC-a currents were reduced by acidic extracellular pH (pHo) (Fig. 1, D–F). With extracellular NO3-, the extracellular pH had to be more acidic to obtain the same degree of current decrease as with Cl– (Fig. 1F). We next explored proton transport of AtClC-a by measuring semiquantitatively the pHi of voltage-clamped oocytes using the Fluorocyte system (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Net ion transport was elicited by strongly depolarizing oocytes to +90 mV. Because prolonged strong depolarization can elicit endogenous transport processes in oocytes, trains of depolarizing pulses were used instead (20.Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An inside-positive voltage should lead to anion influx and proton efflux through electrogenic anion/proton exchangers. Pulsing AtClC-a-expressing oocytes to positive voltages indeed induced intracellular alkalinization (Fig. 1G). Importantly, alkalinization was also observed when protons were extruded against their electrochemical potential (at pHo 5.5), suggesting that their transport is driven by the coupled anion entry (Fig. 1H). Under either condition (pHo 7.5 or 5.5), alkalinization occurred more rapidly with extracellular NO3- than with Cl–. This shows that AtClC-a more efficiently mediates NO3-/H+ exchange than Cl–/H+ exchange, a finding compatible with its role in accumulating NO3- in plant vacuoles (16.De Angeli A. Monachello D. Ephritikhine G. Frachisse J.M. Thomine S. Gambale F. Barbier-Brygoo H. Nature. 2006; 442: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 37.Geelen D. Lurin C. Bouchez D. Frachisse J.M. Lelièvre F. Courtial B. Barbier-Brygoo H. Maurel C. Plant J. 2000; 21: 259-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast with ClC-4 and -5 (26.Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), AtClC-a mediates robust currents also at negative voltages (Fig. 1, A–E). Accordingly, and in contrast to ClC-5 (see Fig. 5H), AtClC-a mediated proton influx when oocytes were pulsed to negative voltages (–160 mV) (Fig. 1I). Substituting extracellular Cl– by NO3- failed to influence the rate of acidification because proton influx is coupled to an efflux of anions from the interior of oocytes. In EcClC-1 and ClC-4 and -5, a certain gating glutamate is important for coupling chloride fluxes to proton countertransport (17.Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 19.Scheel O. Zdebik A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 20.Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In crystals of the bacterial protein, the negatively charged side chain of this glutamate seems to block the permeation pathway (22.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 23.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Mutating this glutamate to alanine in ClC-4 and -5 not only leads to flux uncoupling but also abolishes the strong outward rectification of either transporter (26.Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Likewise, currents of the E203A mutant lost their outward rectification (Fig. 2). Rather than being linear and again similar to the analogous mutants of ClC-4 and -5 (19.Scheel O. Zdebik A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 20.Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 26.Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), currents showed slight outward rectification at positive voltages and slight inward rectification at negative voltages. Contrasting with the moderate changes in ion selectivity observed with such mutations in ClC-4 and -5 (26.Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the E203A mutation drastically altered the anion selectivity of AtClC-a. Whereas reversal potentials indicated that the mutant remained more permeable for NO3- than for Cl– (Fig. 2C, inset), its conductance was now reduced rather than increased when extracellular Cl– was replaced by NO3- (Fig. 2, A–C; see Fig. 4F). With either external anion, currents were insensitive to changes in pHo (Fig. 2, D and E), and trains of depolarizing pulses failed to change pHi (Fig. 2F). Hence, the E203A mutant displayed uncoupled anion transport and drastically reduced conductance in the presence of NO3-.FIGURE 4A critical role of proline residue in AtClC-a in determining anion selectivity. A, shown is the sequence alignment of several CLC proteins in the region of the GSGIPE signature sequence. E. coli EcClC-1 as well as all animal CLC proteins have a serine between the two glycines. It is replaced by proline in plant AtClC-a and -b, but not in AtClC-c and -d. B and C, shown are typical two-electrode voltage-clamp traces of the AtClC-a P160S mutant in Xenopus oocytes with external Cl– (B) or NO3- (C) (voltage protocol as in Fig. 1). D, the current-voltage relationship of the mutant appears to be identical in extracellular Cl– and NO3- (mean of nine oocytes from six batches each). Currents were normalized to those in Cl– at +80 mV (where mean current was 2.33 ± 0.44 μA). E, depolarization (depol.)-induced H+ transport of AtClC-a (P160S) is similarly effective with extracellular Cl– or NO3-, in stark contrast to the WT (Fig. 1G,H). Similar results were obtained in 14 experiments (14 ooyctes from six batches). F, shown is the ratio of currents at + 80 mV in the presence of NO3- and Cl– for AtClC-a and several mutants, respectively. The number of oocytes is as follows: AtClC-a, 25; AtClC-a(E203A), 24; AtClC-a(P160S), 9; AtClC-a(P160G), 5; AtClC-a(P160S,E203A), 4; and AtClC-a(E203A,E270A), 9. rel. fluor., relative fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next studied the AtClC-a mutant E270A, which is equivalent to the proton glutamate mutations of EcClC-1 (27.Accardi A. Walden M. Nguitragool W. Jayaram H. Williams C. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and ClC-4 and -5 (Fig. 3) (21.Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.-Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Neither currents (Fig. 3, A–C) nor depolarization-induced H+ transport (Fig. 3, G and H) were different from background levels with this mutant. However, when combined with the uncoupling E203A mutation in the gating glutamate, the AtClC-a(E203A,E270A) double mutant gave currents that resembled those of the single E203A mutant (Fig. 3, D–F). Like AtClC-a(E203A), the double mutant failed to transport protons in response to depolarization (Fig. 3I). Two main biophysical differences between AtClC-a and ClC-4 and -5 are (i) the much stronger rectification of the mammalian isoforms and (ii) their partial uncoupling of anion from proton transport in the case of nitrate. We therefore searched for differences in their primary sequences that may underlie these differences. A salient feature is the presence of a proline in a stretch of highly conserved “signature” sequences (Fig. 4A). In AtClC-a, this proline replaces a serine that is found at this position in most CLC proteins. The importance of that serine was recognized early on (25.Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Even the conservative exchange of this serine for threonine (S123T) changed the ion selectivity, single-channel conductance, and open-channel rectification of the ClC-0 Cl– channel (25.Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the crystal of EcClC-1, the equivalent serine (Ser-107) participates in the coordination of Cl– in the central binding site (22.Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Mutating this particular proline in AtClC-a to the “consensus” serine (P160S) resulted in less rectifying currents (Fig. 4, B–D), indicating that the difference in rectification between WT AtClC-a and ClC-5 proteins is not determined by the residue at this position. Importantly, both the apparent permeability (from reversal potentials) and conductance no longer differed measurably between NO3- and Cl– solutions (Fig. 4, B–D). Furthermore,"

https://openalex.org/W2032880667,"N-Glycosylation of integrin alpha5beta1 plays a crucial role in cell spreading, cell migration, ligand binding, and dimer formation, but the detailed mechanisms by which N-glycosylation mediates these functions remain unclear. In a previous study, we showed that three potential N-glycosylation sites (alpha5S3-5) on the beta-propeller of the alpha5 subunit are essential to the functional expression of the subunit. In particular, site 5 (alpha5S5) is the most important for its expression on the cell surface. In this study, the function of the N-glycans on the integrin beta1 subunit was investigated using sequential site-directed mutagenesis to remove the combined putative N-glycosylation sites. Removal of the N-glycosylation sites on the I-like domain of the beta1 subunit (i.e. the Delta4-6 mutant) decreased both the level of expression and heterodimeric formation, resulting in inhibition of cell spreading. Interestingly, cell spreading was observed only when the beta1 subunit possessed these three N-glycosylation sites (i.e. the S4-6 mutant). Furthermore, the S4-6 mutant could form heterodimers with either alpha5S3-5 or alpha5S5 mutant of the alpha5 subunit. Taken together, the results of the present study reveal for the first time that N-glycosylation of the I-like domain of the beta1 subunit is essential to both the heterodimer formation and biological function of the subunit. Moreover, because the alpha5S3-5/beta1S4-6 mutant represents the minimal N-glycosylation required for functional expression of the beta1 subunit, it might also be useful for the study of molecular structures."
https://openalex.org/W1987920087,"Riboswitches are RNA elements that control gene expression through metabolite binding. The preQ1 riboswitch exhibits the smallest known ligand-binding domain and is of interest for its economical organization and high affinity interactions with guanine-derived metabolites required to confer tRNA wobbling. Here we present the crystal structure of a preQ1 aptamer domain in complex with its precursor metabolite preQ0. The structure is highly compact with a core that features a stem capped by a well organized decaloop. The metabolite is recognized within a deep pocket via Watson-Crick pairing with C15. Additional hydrogen bonds are made to invariant bases U6 and A29. The ligand-bound state confers continuous helical stacking throughout the core fold, thus providing a platform to promote Watson-Crick base pairing between C9 of the decaloop and the first base of the ribosome-binding site, G33. The structure offers insight into the mode of ribosome-binding site sequestration by a minimal RNA fold stabilized by metabolite binding and has implications for understanding the molecular basis by which bacterial genes are regulated. Riboswitches are RNA elements that control gene expression through metabolite binding. The preQ1 riboswitch exhibits the smallest known ligand-binding domain and is of interest for its economical organization and high affinity interactions with guanine-derived metabolites required to confer tRNA wobbling. Here we present the crystal structure of a preQ1 aptamer domain in complex with its precursor metabolite preQ0. The structure is highly compact with a core that features a stem capped by a well organized decaloop. The metabolite is recognized within a deep pocket via Watson-Crick pairing with C15. Additional hydrogen bonds are made to invariant bases U6 and A29. The ligand-bound state confers continuous helical stacking throughout the core fold, thus providing a platform to promote Watson-Crick base pairing between C9 of the decaloop and the first base of the ribosome-binding site, G33. The structure offers insight into the mode of ribosome-binding site sequestration by a minimal RNA fold stabilized by metabolite binding and has implications for understanding the molecular basis by which bacterial genes are regulated. Riboswitches are naturally occurring, structured motifs in the 5′-untranslated regions of a handful of mRNAs. It has been estimated that these elements regulate the expression of 3–4% of bacterial genes (1.Nudler E. Cell. 2006; 126: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Their mechanism of action entails “sensing” a cellular metabolite via a high affinity aptamer domain, which alters the accessibility of flanking mRNA sequences necessary for control of transcription or translation (2.Tucker B.J. Breaker R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 3.Wakeman C.A. Winkler W.C. Dann III, C.E. Trends Biochem.

Respective riboswitches have been discovered that sense more than a dozen distinct small molecules (reviewed in Ref. 4.Cochrane J.C. Strobel S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harb.). 2008; 14: 993-1002Google Scholar), and these RNA-regulatory elements have been identified in the genomes of several human pathogens (5.Barrick J.E. Corbino K.A. Winkler W.C.

As such, elucidating the principles by which riboswitches bind their cognate ligands is critical for the identification and validation of new antibiotic targets (8.Lea C.R. Piccirilli J.A. Nat. Chem.

Queuosine (Q) 5The abbreviations used are: Q, queuosine; preQ0, 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine; preQ1, 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine; RBS, ribosome-binding site; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. is a hypermodified variant of guanosine necessary for wobbling of certain tRNAs (10.Kasai H.

De novo Q synthesis occurs only in bacteria, requiring that humans acquire it from gut flora or dietary sources (14.Iwata-Reuyl D. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 24-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Production of Q begins with GTP and proceeds via formation of the metabolic intermediate preQ0 (see Fig. 1A, inset), the antecedent to preQ1 (15.Van Lanen S.G. Reader J.S. Swairjo M.A. de Crecy-Lagard V. Lee B. Iwata-Reuyl D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4264-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Breaker and co-workers (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) discovered recently that some genes encoding proteins whose function is preQ1 uptake or biosynthesis are regulated by riboswitches responsive to this metabolite and its analogs. Equilibrium dialysis revealed that a representative riboswitch aptamer favors preQ1 binding over preQ0 by only 5-fold, with preQ0 displaying a Kd of ∼100 nm (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic comparisons suggested a stem-loop secondary structure (see Fig. 1A) that could be divided further into two aptamer “types” based on sequence differences in the L1 region. In contrast to other riboswitches, the preQ1 aptamer is unusually small (∼34 nucleotides), which is ∼2.5-fold shorter than functionally similar purine riboswitches (17.Serganov A. Yuan Y.R. Pikovskaya O. Polonskaia A. Malinina L. Phan A.T. Hobartner C. Micura R. Breaker R.R. Patel D.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1729-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular basis by which this minimal riboswitch binds its cognate ligand to modulate gene expression, we determined the structure of a type I, preQ1 riboswitch at 2.75 Å resolution. The results reveal the mode of ligand binding and support a mechanism of translational regulation that features metabolite-induced RNA folding to sequester the RBS. This work represents an important step in elucidating a mode of gene regulation that controls cellular levels of a metabolite unique to bacteria. Choice of Aptamer Construct and RNA-Ligand Preparation—The preQ1 aptamer domain (see Fig. 1A) was derived from sequence and biochemical analyses that described its minimal architecture (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Conserved elements include the P1 stem and L1 loop, as well as a downstream A-rich sequence. These regions were protected in the presence of metabolite under “in-line” cleavage conditions (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although several aptamer sequences were prepared and subjected to crystallization, including that from the well studied Bacillus subtilis, a 33-mer from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (see Fig. 1A) was favored due to its small size and hot spring origins (18.Xue Y. Xu Y. Liu Y. Ma Y. Zhou P. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which has precedents for RNA crystallization (19.Klein D.J. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Science. 2006; 313: 1752-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). All RNA sequences were synthesized by Dharmacon Inc. (Fayette, CO) followed by in-house deprotection, high pressure liquid chromatography purification, and desalting (20.Wedekind J.E. McKay D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 149-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pure preQ0 was produced enzymatically (21.Quaranta D. McCarty R. Bandarian V. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5361-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of material was added to 25 ml of “Q0 buffer” comprising 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5% (v/v) 1,3-propanediol. This solution was heated to 85 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g. PreQ0 was soluble to ∼0.5 mm as assessed by absorbance at 275 nm using an extinction coefficient of 12.9 mm–1 cm–1. A 5-ml volume of Q0 buffer was then heated to 65 °C. Lyophilized aptamer RNA was suspended in 0.01 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, to a concentration of 0.7 mm. A total of 50 μl was mixed slowly with the 65 °C Q0 buffer. Once the entire 5-ml volume was added, the solution was incubated at 65 °C for 3 min and then moved to a 0.5-liter water bath at 65 °C. The bath was allowed to slow-cool to 28 °C over 2 h. Meanwhile, a Vivaspin 2 centrifugal filter with a 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off (GE Healthcare) was pre-equilibrated with 1 ml of Q0 buffer using a FIBERLite F21 rotor (FIBERLite, Santa Clara, CA) and a force of 4500 × g. The dilute aptamer solution was applied to the filter and centrifuged for 30-min intervals at 22 °C. Progress was monitored by UV absorption at 260 nm. To correct for the absorbance of preQ0 in the flow-through, a blank was prepared from water plus a volume of Q0 buffer equal to the volume of the measured sample. The sample solution remained clear throughout the concentrating process. The final concentration of the aptamer-preQ0 complex was ∼0.55 mm. Crystallization, Cryoprotection, and Heavy Atom Derivatization—Crystals of the aptamer-ligand complex were screened by hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments against a sparse matrix designed for RNA (20.Wedekind J.E. McKay D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 149-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple crystal habits were observed from precipitating agents such as 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, poly(ethylene) glycol, and high salt. Superior crystals were obtained at 20 °C from 2-μl:2-μl mixtures of RNA-ligand complex with precipitant comprising: 1.8 m Li2SO4, 0.10 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 0.01 m MgSO4, 5% (v/v) 1,3-propanediol, and 2 mm spermine. Crystals grew as hexagonal rods to dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm in 3–4 weeks and were harvested into a “stabilizing” mother liquor of 2.0 m Li2SO4, 0.10 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 0.02 m MgSO4, 5% (v/v) 1,3-propanediol, 2 mm spermine, and saturating amounts of preQ0. Native crystals were cryoprotected by passage through a fresh, 1:1 mixture of silicon and paratone-N oils (Hampton Research). The aqueous hydration layer around the crystal was removed by repeated grazing of the surface with a 20-μm nylon loop (Hampton Research). After ∼5 min under oil, the crystal was captured in a nylon loop and flash-cooled by plunging into N2(l). A heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking crystals in solutions of pentaammine-(trifluoro-methane-sulfonato) Os(III) triflate (Sigma-Aldrich). Due to the limited solubility and reactivity of heavy atom compounds in the Li2SO4 mother liquor, crystals were adapted from the stabilization solution into a final derivative solution of 4.0 m LiC2H3O2, 20 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2, 0.10 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 5% (v/v) 1,3-propanediol, 2 mm spermine, saturating preQ0, and 0.10 m Os(NH3)5-triflate. Gradual removal of SO2–4 and maintenance of ionic strength entailed 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 combinations of the stabilizing mother liquor with the derivative mother liquor. Each transfer lasted 15 min. Crystals were allowed to react with osmium for 4 h and showed no signs of osmotic shock or hysteresis. Previously, we reported that high acetate levels serve as a vitrification agent for RNA crystals (20.Wedekind J.E. McKay D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 149-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, crystals were flash-cooled by direct plunging into N2(l). Loop-mounted crystals were loaded into a 96-position cassette (Crystal Positioning Systems) at N2(l) temperature and shipped to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL, Menlo Park, CA) for x-ray data collection. X-ray Structure Determination and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected remotely at beamline 7-1 of SSRL using the Blu-Ice and Web-Ice interfaces (22.Soltis S.M. Cohen A.E. Deacon A. Eriksson T. Gonzalez A. McPhillips S. Chui H. Dunten P. Hollenbeck M. Mathews I. Miller M. Moorhead P. Phizackerley R.P. Smith C. Song J. van dem Bedem H. Ellis P. Kuhn P. McPhillips T. Sauter N. Sharp K. Tsyba I. Wolf G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Respective native and preliminary derivative data sets were recorded at a crystal-to-detector distance of 32.5 cm as 320 × 0.5° oscillations using a Quantum 315 CCD detector (ADSC); exposure times were 20 s per degree. Native crystals diffracted anistropically between 2.75 and 2.55 Å resolution. Intensity data were reduced using the HKL2000 suite (23.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) with intensity statistics provided in supplemental Table S1. Space group P6322 was assigned based on the Laue symmetry of 6/mmm and the observation of l = 2n + 1 systematic absences for the 00l class of reflections. Derivatization by Os(NH3)5-triflate was identified by local scaling of derivative and native data sets, which produced a 19% isomorphous difference. A fluorescence scan of a fresh Os(NH3)5-triflate crystal produced f′ and f″ values of: −15.6 e, 13.8 e (peak); −7.2 e, 10.8 e (remote); and −20.4 e, 8.9 (inflection) as determined by CHOOCH (24.Evans G. Pettifer R.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 82-86Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment was conducted using dose mode with inverse beam geometry collected in 30° wedges to match Friedel pairs. Reflections were reduced as described for native, but keeping Ihkl and Ih–k–l– separate. Intensity statistics for the MAD data sets are provided in supplemental Table S1. Two osmium sites were located and refined using SOLVE (25.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A useful MAD signal was observed to 3.5 Å resolution. The application of density modification and phase extension to 3.1 Å resolution in RESOLVE (26.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) revealed clear RNA structure (see Fig. 1B) corresponding to one molecule per asymmetric unit. The resulting experimental, density-modified phases were subjected to PHENIX (27.Adams P.D. Gopal K. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Pai R.K. Read R.J. Romo T.D. Sacchettin J.C. Sauter N.K. Storoni L.C. Terwilliger T.C. J. Synchrotron. Rad. 2004; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) for phase combination using the “build_rna” option. Although the resulting electron density maps were greatly improved by placement of the RNA polymer, PHENIX did not produce a reasonable aptamer model and could not fit the input sequence. Manual building was conducted using experimental and phase-combined maps in the graphics program O (28.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The resulting model was subjected to positional and individual B-factor refinement against the native data set in CNS (29.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The strong anisotropic component of the intensity data is reflected in the B-factor correction applied to Fobs (B11 = −21, B22 = −21, B33 = 42). Target geometry for preQ0 refinement was prepared using XPLO2D (30.Kleywegt G.J. Henrick K. Dodson E.J. van Aalten D.M. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1051-1059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) from a small molecule crystal structure BOVYEQ retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database (31.Allen F.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12531) Google Scholar). Two sulfate ions were observed and modeled with partial occupancy, which lowered Rfree. All structure-derived graphics were produced in PyMOL (32.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factor amplitudes are available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as entry 3gca. Structure Determination and Quality Indicators of the PreQ1 Aptamer Domain—To discover how a type I, preQ1 riboswitch employs a highly economical fold to recognize its cognate metabolite, we solved the structure of the T. tengcongensis aptamer domain in complex with preQ0 by MAD phasing. The quality of the experimental phases is indicated by the excellent agreement of initial electron density maps with the final refined coordinates (Fig. 1B). The presence of the A-rich backbone segment (orange) running parallel to the minor grove of the P1 stem (red) is distinctive at 3.1 Å resolution. Electron density was visible for several bases in this region as well, although the L1 region was less clear due to its irregular structural features. Electron density for the refined structure (Fig. 1C) is provided for comparison with the MAD maps. The refined structure exhibits strong, continuous electron density for all backbone atoms. All bases are ordered except U12 (Fig. 2), which is unstacked and protrudes into solvent. The average B-factor for all RNA atoms is 76 Å2 (on scale of 400 Å2). The final model produced an Rwork of 24.5% with Rfree = 27.2%, suggesting that the model was not over fit (33.Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations from ideal bonds and angles were 0.008 Å and 1.5°, respectively, which is comparable with other RNA structures of this size and resolution (34.Wedekind J.E. McKay D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35.Alam S. Grum-Tokars V. Krucinska J. Kundracik M.L. Wedekind J.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14396-14408Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Global Fold of the PreQ1 Riboswitch—When one considers that an RNA duplex is 20 Å, the triple-stranded preQ1 aptamer domain appears relatively compact with dimensions of 48 × 28 Å × 15 Å (Fig. 2A); indeed, more than half of all bases engage in triplet pairs (Fig. 2A). As one proceeds from the 5′- to 3′-end, nearly one-third of all bases comprise stem P1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The flanking L1 decaloop is the site of metabolite binding and reveals numerous non-canonical nucleotide interactions. A sharp bend in this loop occurs at residue A10. Here a Watson-Crick pair forms between C9 and G33, the 3′-most base of the aptamer construct, that facilitates the sharp change in direction. The nearby base G11 resides in the heart of the L1 loop and forms a Watson-Crick pair with C30 of the A-rich segment; G11 stacks directly upon preQ0 (discussed below). Thus, when the metabolite is bound, an uninterrupted base stack forms throughout the aptamer beginning with G33, passing through G11 and preQ0, and culminating with G20 at the 3′-end of the P1 stem. A ribose zipper (supplemental Fig. S1A) involving bases U2, A19, and A23 facilitates another sharp bend that joins the 3′-P1 stem to the A-rich segment (Fig. 2). A comparable interaction exists in the 23 S rRNA (36.Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) between C1476, C1477, and A2681 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Due to the intrastrand nature of these respective interactions, as well as the absence of a second canonical 2′-OH-to-minor-groove interaction, this motif has been classified as a “pseudo cis” ribose zipper (37.Klosterman P.S. Tamura M. Holbrook S.R. Brenner S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the presence of this structural feature in two highly divergent RNA sequences is illustrative of the point that RNA adopts recognizable tertiary contacts that are readily classified and potentially predictable. The ribose zipper represents a transition point for base stacking of residues in the A-rich segment. Beginning at A24 and proceeding through C30, a nearly continuous base stack forms (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, each base of the phylogenetically conserved A-rich segment (Fig. 1A) utilizes either its Watson-Crick or its Hoogsteen face to interact with the sugar edge of the P1 stem (Fig. 2). This trend continues beyond the stem and culminates with the A28-to-U6 Hoogsteen-to-Watson-Crick pairing. Importantly, this architecture primes the structure for formation of the metabolite-binding pocket in which the Watson-Crick face of A29 is poised to interact with ligand (Fig. 2B). The conserved C30 base is the last residue of the A-rich segment to stack upon the preceding 5′-bases and culminates with a canonical pairing to G11 located in the core of the L1 decaloop (Fig. 2). The Metabolite-binding Pocket—To discover the mode of ligand binding, we co-crystallized the aptamer in the presence of preQ0. A simulated annealing-omit electron density map (Fig. 3A) indicates the quality of the ligand model. The average B-factor for preQ0 was 58 Å2, which is among the lowest in the structure but comparable with the surrounding core RNA atoms. PreQ0 itself is sequestered in a deep pocket within the L1 loop of the aptamer. The walls of the pocket comprise three strands contributed by the decaloop and the A-rich segment (Fig. 3, A and B). Specific structural interactions to the ligand were predicted by phylogenetic and biochemical analyses (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The structure supports the observation that the conserved base C15 engages in a Watson-Crick pair with the ligand (Fig. 3A), which accounts for the dramatic loss of metabolite affinity when C15 is mutated or the ligand is substituted with adenine (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Such direct Watson-Crick readout of purine metabolites was observed for the guanine and adenine riboswitch aptamers (17.Serganov A. Yuan Y.R. Pikovskaya O. Polonskaia A. Malinina L. Phan A.T. Hobartner C. Micura R. Breaker R.R. Patel D.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1729-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 38.Batey R.T. Gilbert S.D. Montange R.K. Nature. 2004; 432: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, this shared mode of ligand recognition is simply an instance of convergent evolution. This is because the spatial organization of the preQ1 aptamer observed here, as well as its diminutive size, refutes the possibility that it originated from an ∼80-nucleotide purine-binding ancestor, which appears to be the case for the adenine and guanine riboswitches (17.Serganov A. Yuan Y.R. Pikovskaya O. Polonskaia A. Malinina L. Phan A.T. Hobartner C. Micura R. Breaker R.R. Patel D.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1729-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Additional hydrogen bond contacts to preQ0 include invariant bases U6 and A29. These interactions can be considered the walls of the binding pocket. Although the O4 keto group of U6 receives a hydrogen bond from the N-9 imino of preQ0, A29 utilizes its Watson-Crick face to recognize the N2 amino group of the ligand. These observations, as well as the aforementioned Watson-Crick pairing to C15, account for why hypoxanthine, which lacks an exocyclic amine at N2, loses ∼103-fold in binding affinity relative to guanine. Finally, an additional hydrogen bond interaction is observed between the O6 keto moiety of preQ0 and the 2′-hydroxyl of G11. This position is not highly conserved, which fits structural observations with regard to ligand binding. In addition to hydrogen bonding, the preQ0 ligand engages in several base-stacking interactions that promote core packing of the decaloop and A-rich tail elements. From the P1 stem, the G5:C16 pair forms a “floor” within the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 3A). Conversely, a ceiling is formed by a base quartet featuring C7, G11, A14, and C30 (Fig. 3B). This arrangement effectively buries 300 of 338 Å2 of preQ0 surface area with nitrogen of the nitrile moiety being most solvent-exposed (Fig. 3, A and B). An additional base triple stacks over the ligand ceiling (supplemental Fig. S2), forming a broad “roof” upon which to assemble the final tertiary interaction that unites C9 of the decaloop with G33 at the 3′-terminus. Implications for PreQ1 Binding and Translational Control—PreQ0 and preQ1 differ by a single amino group attached to atom C-7 of the nitrile moiety (Fig. 1A). This difference accounted for a 5-fold reduction in relative affinity for preQ0 (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). From an energetic standpoint, the N-7 amine of preQ1 contributes ∼1 kcal mole–1 to the stability of the RNA-ligand complex or two hydrogen bonds (39.Klostermeier D. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14095-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, although all the interactions described here are expected to dictate both preQ0 as well as preQ1 specificity and affinity, the mode of N-7 recognition for the latter is unknown at present. However, because the sp3 C-NH2 hybridization of preQ1 at the methyl-amine moiety allows it to freely rotate, it is plausible that preQ1 interacts with the neighboring O-6 of G5, an invariant residue. In contrast, the sp-hybridized nitrile group of preQ0 cannot donate a hydrogen bond and must remain linear. Another possibility is that nearby U12, which is unstacked from the core fold (Fig. 2B), changes conformation upon preQ1 binding to effectively close the “lid” on the metabolite-binding pocket. A pyrimidine is favored at this position, which would support base unstacking and the need for flexibility. Ultimately, elucidation of the final specificity determinant for preQ1 must await additional analyses. The riboswitch of this investigation was derived from the 5′-untranslated region of a gene encoding a putative preQ1 permease from T. tengcongensis (16.Roth A. Winkler W.C. Regulski E.E. Lee B.W. Lim J. Jona I. Barrick J.E. Ritwik A. Kim J.N. Welz R. Iwata-Reuyl D. Breaker R.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Import of preQ1 or its analogs would therefore promote riboswitch aptamer folding as described here. As such, the means by which permease translation is diminished in a preQ1-rich environment could be through the sequestration of the RBS sequence GGGAG, in which the underlined position is G33 of the aptamer domain. Furthermore, the ability of the metabolite to mediate core folding through RNA base stacking, as well as directed interactions to the A-rich segment at A29, suggests that the aptamer-ligand complex functions as an integrated unit to sequester the RBS and 5′-regions, thus blocking translation. Such a mechanism has been cited for other riboswitches (40.Winkler W. Nahvi A. Breaker R.R. Nature. 2002; 419: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). This mode of gene regulation is distinct from “kinetic” mechanisms that produce competing terminator versus anti-terminator structures (2.Tucker B.J. Breaker R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 41.Winkler W.C. Breaker R.R. ChemBioChem. 2003; 4: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The riboswitch presented here is one of the smallest known aptamer motifs and provides a plausible mechanism for metabolite recognition and translational arrest. Efforts to grow crystals in the absence of metabolites have not been fruitful, making it unclear to what extent the aptamer domain folds prior to ligand binding. Another open question is whether divergent bacterial species use the same principles of ligand recognition as the T. tengcongensis aptamer domain presented here. A phylogenetic comparison suggests that many organisms preserve the C9:G33 Watson-Crick pair, but this mode of binding to the RBS is not universal. As such, additional investigations will be required to develop an understanding of preQ1 aptamer recognition by a diverse number of organisms. This effort is likely to reveal subgroups within the type I and II domains. Such work will be essential to advance biomedical efforts aimed at targeting riboswitches that control production of bacterial-specific metabolites. We thank Prof. Clara L.

This general problem is particularly important in the kidney, because TNF-α, a major mediator of kidney injury, is known to increase paracellular permeability in tubular epithelia. Here we aimed to determine the effect of TNF-α on the Rho pathway in tubular cells (LLC-PK1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney), define the upstream signaling, and investigate the role of the Rho pathway in the TNF-α-induced alterations of paracellular permeability. We show that TNF-α induced a rapid and sustained RhoA activation that led to stress fiber formation and Rho kinase-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. To identify new regulators connecting the TNF receptor to Rho signaling, we applied an affinity precipitation assay with a Rho mutant (RhoG17A), which captures activated GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs). Mass spectrometry analysis of the RhoG17A-precipitated proteins identified GEF-H1 as a TNF-α-activated Rho GEF. Consistent with a central role of GEF-H1, its down-regulation by small interfering RNA prevented the activation of the Rho pathway. Moreover GEF-H1 and Rho activation are downstream of ERK signaling as the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 mitigated TNF-α-induced activation of these proteins. Importantly TNF-α enhanced the ERK pathway-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-678 of GEF-H1 that was key for activation. Finally the TNF-α-induced paracellular permeability increase was absent in LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing a non-phosphorylatable, dominant negative MLC. In summary, we have identified the ERK/GEF-H1/Rho/Rho kinase/phospho-MLC pathway as the mechanism mediating TNF-α-induced elevation of tubular epithelial permeability, which in turn might contribute to kidney injury.

Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Subsequently it is cleaved by the metalloprotease TNF-α convertase enzyme to release a 17-kDa soluble peptide (for a review, see Ref. 2.Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). TNF-α has two receptors, the constitutively expressed, ubiquitous TNF receptor 1 and the inducible TNF receptor 2. An increasing body of evidence supports a key role for TNF-α in both acute renal injury and chronic kidney diseases (for reviews, see Refs. 3.Vielhauer V. Mayadas T.N. Semin. Nephrol. 2007; 27: 286-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 4.Pascher A. Klupp J. BioDrugs. 2005; 19: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although TNF-α is almost undetectable in normal kidneys, elevated intrarenal, serum, or urine concentrations have been reported in various pathological states including ischemia-reperfusion, endotoxinemia, and early diabetic nephropathy (5.Noiri E. Kuwata S. Nosaka K. Tokunaga K. Juji T. Shibata Y. Kurokawa K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1159-1166PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Sato H. Tanaka T. Kita T. Yamaguchi H. Tanaka N. Int. J. Exp.

Suppl. 2005; 99: S98-S102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover kidney injury in various pathological states was prevented or mitigated by inhibition of TNF-α production, by addition of neutralizing antibodies, or in TNF receptor knock-out mice (for a review, see Ref. 3.Vielhauer V. Mayadas T.N. Semin. Nephrol. 2007; 27: 286-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The central role of TNF-α in mediating kidney injury is therefore well established. Importantly TNF-α can be produced in the kidney not only by infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes but by resident cells including the tubular epithelium. For example, in reperfusion injury TNF-α expression precedes macrophage infiltration and localizes mostly to the tubules (3.Vielhauer V. Mayadas T.N. Semin. Nephrol. 2007; 27: 286-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7.Donnahoo K.K. Meng X. Ao L. Ayala A. Shames B.D. Cain M.P. Harken A.H. Meldrum D.R. Immunology. 2001; 102: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tubular TNF-α production is also enhanced by endotoxin and hypoxia (9.Jevnikar A.M. Brennan D.C. Singer G.G. Heng J.E.

Although effects of locally released TNF-α on the tubular epithelium could contribute to its deleterious actions, the underlying mechanisms have been incompletely explored. Although a large number of studies have focused on the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling initiated by TNF-α in various cells, its cytoskeletal effects remain much less explored. In recent years Rho and its effector, Rho kinase (ROK), key regulators of both the actin cytoskeleton and myosin phosphorylation (13.Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar), have emerged as important mediators of TNF-α effects in endothelial cells (14.Petrache I. Crow M.T. Neuss M. Garcia J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15.Nubel T. Dippold W. Kleinert H. Kaina B. Fritz G. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16.VandenBerg E. Reid M.D. Edwards J.D. Davis H.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17.McKenzie J.A. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18.Mong P.Y. Petrulio C. Kaufman H.L. Wang Q. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similar effects in the tubular epithelium, however, have not been established. Even more importantly, the upstream signaling that connects the TNF receptor to activation of the Rho pathway remains completely unknown. Like other small GTPases, Rho cycles between an inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) form (13.Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). The exchange of GDP to GTP during activation is stimulated by GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs). The diverse family of Rho GEFs contains >70 members in humans (19.Garcia-Mata R. Burridge K. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), making it challenging to identify the specific factors involved in mediating Rho activation through receptor-mediated stimuli. In the case of TNF-α, neither the particular Rho GEF involved nor the mechanism of its regulation has been identified in any of the cell systems studied. A rise in epithelial paracellular permeability through the intercellular junctions is a prominent event during inflammation (“leaky epithelium”) (for reviews, see Refs. 20.Nusrat A. Turner J.R. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G851-G857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 21.Kapus A. Szaszi K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 870-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the junctions maintain the polarized phenotype of epithelial cells that is necessary for directional transport processes and constitute an important signaling platform that transmits environmental cues to the cells. Therefore, the consequences of junction disruption during inflammation might go beyond the compromised barrier functions. Interestingly TNF-α has been reported to affect the permeability of the tubular epithelium. Mullin et al. (22.Mullin J.M. Laughlin K.V. Marano C.W. Russo L.M. Soler A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F915-F924PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that in a tubular cell line TNF-α induced a temporary elevation in transepithelial resistance followed by a drop in transepithelial resistance and increased paracellular permeability. The transepithelial resistance decrease was blocked by genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor; however, the exact mechanism underlying the observed permeability changes remained incompletely explored. The actin cytoskeleton and especially phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) was shown to be essential for the permeability increase caused by pathogens, cytokines, and growth factors in various epithelial and endothelial systems (for reviews, see Refs. 21.Kapus A. Szaszi K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 870-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Walsh S.V. Hopkins A.M. Nusrat A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 41: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, and 24.Turner J.R. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 41: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly although myosin phosphorylation mediates the TNF-α-elicited permeability changes in intestinal cells (25.Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Gonzalez D.E. Quan C. Tom J. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26.Petrache I. Verin A.D. Crow M.T. Birukova A. Liu F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1168-L1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phospho-MLC was reported not to be involved in the TNF-α-induced permeability rise in endothelial cells (17.McKenzie J.A. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The possible role of the Rho pathway and myosin phosphorylation in the TNF-α-induced permeability changes in the tubular epithelium therefore remains to be established. The aim of this study was to explore the signaling pathways through which TNF-α causes cytoskeleton remodeling and elevates paracellular permeability in kidney tubular cells. Our findings show that TNF-α induces rapid activation of RhoA that leads to Rho/Rho kinase-dependent actin remodeling and myosin phosphorylation. Using an affinity precipitation assay followed by mass spectrometry, we identified GEF-H1 as a TNF-α-activated GEF. We showed that GEF-H1 mediates the TNF-α-induced stimulation of Rho and its effectors. In addition, activation of the GEF-H1/Rho pathway by TNF-α was downstream of ERK signaling and required GEF-H1 phosphorylation on Thr-678. Finally using a dominant negative MLC mutant, we showed that myosin phosphorylation is essential for the TNF-α-induced elevation in paracellular permeability. Materials—Y-27632, PD98059, SB202474 (a negative control for PD98059), and U0126 were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Human recombinant TNF-α and bovine serum albumin was from Sigma-Aldrich. The protease and phosphatase inhibitors used were: Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor tablet and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics), Protease Inhibitor Mixture (BD Pharmingen), and calyculin A (EMD Biosciences). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: RhoA, phospho-ERK1/2; phosphocofilin, cofilin, GEF-H1, and mono- and diphosphorylated MLC (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); phosphothreonine (Invitrogen); HA (Covance, Emeryville, CA); Myc (9E10); ERK1/2, RhoA, NFκB p65, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); β-actin and myosin light chain (Sigma-Aldrich); GFP (Nacalai USA, San Diego, CA); phospho (Thr)-MAPK/cyclin-dependent kinase substrate (Cell Signaling Technology); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EMD Biosciences). For the detection of monophosphorylated MLC by Western blotting we used antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (antimonophospho-MLC, serine 19) and Abcam (Cambridge, MA) (anti-phospho-MLC, Ser-20) with similar results. Rhodamine phalloidin was from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Peroxidase, Cy3-, and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-HA coupled to agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Cell Treatment—LLC-PK1 (CL-101), a kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell line, and MDCK, a canine distal tubular epithelial cell line, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained as in our previous studies (27.Szaszi K. Sirokmany G. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C673-C685Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For all experiments, cells were grown to confluence. Treatment with 10 ng/ml TNF-α was performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Hanks' buffered salt solution. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with different inhibitors as described in the figure legends followed by the addition of TNF-α in the presence of the inhibitor. Generation of a Polyclonal Stable AA-MLC Cell Line—The retroviral vector expressing a non-phosphorylatable, dominant negative version of MLC in which Thr-18 and Ser-19 were replaced with alanines (AA-MLC), was described previously (28.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Lodyga M. Fan L. Szaszi K. Hosoya H. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Viral particles were prepared, and LLC-PK1 cells were transduced as described previously (28.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Lodyga M. Fan L. Szaszi K. Hosoya H. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Control cells were transduced using the empty vector lacking the AA-MLC insert but harboring G418 resistance. Cells were selected using 1 mg/ml G418 starting at 48 h after transfection. AA-MLC expression was routinely checked by immunofluorescence using an anti-Myc antibody and was ≥80%. Vectors and Transient Transfection—The vectors used were kind gifts from the following investigators: cDNAs encoding for C3 transferase (an enzyme that inactivates Rho via ADP-ribosylation (29.Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)), the glutathione S-transferase-Rho binding domain (GST-RBD) portion of Rhotekin, and GST-RhoG17A (30.Garcia-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were from Dr. K. Burridge (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC); AA-MLC vector (28.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Lodyga M. Fan L. Szaszi K. Hosoya H. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was from Dr. H. Hosoya (Department of Biological Sciences, Hiroshima University); and HA-tagged GEF-H1 cDNA (31.Iwasaki T. Murata-Hori M. Ishitobi S. Hosoya H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was from Dr. G. Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute). The enhanced GFP vector, pEGFP, was from Clontech. The GFP-tagged wild type (WT) GEF-H1, the deletion mutant GEF-H1ΔC, and GEF-H1T678A were described previously (32.Fujishiro S.H. Tanimura S. Mure S. Kashimoto Y. Watanabe K. Kohno M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were transfected using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of DNA/well for 6-well plates and 5–10 μg of DNA for 10-cm dishes. For co-expression of C3 toxin and GFP, cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding for C3 transferase (1 μg) and GFP (0.2 μg). Transfection with GFP by itself had no effect on actin staining (not shown). Obtaining a Partial Sequence of Porcine GEF-H1—To obtain a partial DNA sequence of porcine GEF-H1 for identification of short interfering RNA (siRNA) targets, LLC-PK1 cells were grown to confluence, and total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ oligo(dT)12–18 as a template primer. The cDNA was subsequently subjected to PCR using GEF-H1-specific primers that were designed for highly conserved regions identified by alignment of human, chimp, murine, and canine GEF-H1 cDNA sequences. The following primers were used: GEF-H1, 5′-GAT GAA GGA AGC CAA GGA TG-3′ and 5′-CCA GCA ATG TTG GTG GTA GA-3′. The PCR was performed using 2 μl of cDNA as described previously (28.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Lodyga M. Fan L. Szaszi K. Hosoya H. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C68-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and the amplified 389-bp product was purified from the gel using the PureLink™ Quick Gel Extraction kit (Invitrogen) and sent for sequencing. Short Interfering RNA—The following sequences were targeted in porcine GEF-H1: siRNA 1, AAGCAGGGACTGCCGGAAGCT; siRNA 2, AACAAGAGCATCACAGCCAAG. The siRNAs were obtained from Applied Biosystems/Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotide using the Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control cells were transfected with 100 nm Silencer siRNA negative control 1 (non-related siRNA) (Ambion Inc.). Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. The levels of GEF-H1 were routinely checked by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Following treatment, cells were lysed on ice with cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with protease inhibitors). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (33.Fan L. Sebe A. Peterfi Z. Masszi A. Thirone A.C. Rotstein O.D. Nakano H. McCulloch C.A. Szaszi K. Mucsi I. Kapus A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing either 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% milk and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody (overnight for antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology and 1 h at room temperature for other antibodies). Antibody binding was visualized with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution) and the enhanced chemiluminescence method (kit from GE Healthcare). Equal loading was verified by reprobing blots using β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies. For the phosphospecific antibodies, loading was verified by reprobing with the corresponding total antibodies. Preparation of GST-RBD and GST-RhoG17A Fusion Proteins—GST-RBD and GST-RhoG17A beads were prepared essentially as described previously (30.Garcia-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Sirokmany G. Szaszi K. Arthur W.T. Masszi A. Peterson M. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C555-C566Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli expressing a construct encoding for a GST fusion protein containing either the RBD (amino acids 7–89) of Rhotekin or GST-RhoG17A were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 16 h at room temperature. Next the bacteria were sedimented and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. The bacterial suspensions were sonicated on ice for 1 min and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min (4 °C), and supernatants were added to pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). After rotating end over end for 45 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer followed by two washes with Triton X-100-free lysis buffer. Bound protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and the beads were kept at 4 °C for immediate use or stored frozen in the presence of glycerol. Rho Activity Assay—The amount of active RhoA was determined using an affinity precipitation assay with the RBD of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) as in our earlier studies (27.Szaszi K. Sirokmany G. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C673-C685Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34.Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Sirokmany G. Szaszi K. Arthur W.T. Masszi A.

Briefly confluent LLC-PK1 cells grown in 6- or 10-cm dishes were treated as indicated in the respective figure legends. Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.6), 20 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (1 min at 4 °C), aliquots for determination of total RhoA were removed. The remaining supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with 20–25 μg of GST-RBD beads followed by extensive washing. Total cell lysates and the pelleted beads were analyzed by Western blotting using RhoA antibody. Results were quantified by densitometry, and the active RhoA in each sample was normalized to the corresponding total RhoA. The data obtained in each experiment were expressed as -fold increase compared with the level of the control. Affinity Precipitation of Activated GEFs and Mass Spectrometry—Active GEFs were affinity-precipitated from cell lysates using the RhoG17A mutant that cannot bind nucleotide and therefore has high affinity for GEFs (30.Garcia-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The precipitation was performed as described previously (30.Garcia-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For initial identification of activated GEFs, the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye. Bands that appeared only in the precipitates obtained from TNF-α-activated cells (see Fig. 3) were excised from the gel and submitted for analysis to the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The peptide sequences were identified by screening against the canine genome. For detection of activated GEF-H1, affinity precipitation with GST-RhoG17A was followed by Western blotting using a GEF-H1-specific antibody or anti-GFP to detect the presence of the endogenous or GFP-GEF-H1 proteins, respectively. Precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing no fusion proteins resulted in no GEF-H1 precipitation (see Fig. 3B). GEF-H1 in total cell lysates was also detected for each sample (total GEF-H1). Precipitated (active) and total GEF-H1 was quantified by densitometry. The amount of active GEF-H1 in each sample was normalized to the corresponding total GEF-H1, and the data obtained in each experiment were expressed as -fold increase compared with the control taken as unity. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Confluent cells grown on coverslips were treated as indicated in the corresponding figure legends and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescent staining was carried out as described previously (27.Szaszi K. Sirokmany G. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C673-C685Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly following permeabilization with Triton X-100, the coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Next cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:100). Bound antibody was detected using the corresponding fluorescent secondary antibody (1:1000). For visualizing actin following treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin for 1 h. All samples were viewed using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Melville, NY) coupled to an Evolution QEi Monochrome camera (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Where indicated, out of focus fluorescent signal was removed by deconvolution using the Image Pro software. Immunoprecipitation and Identification of the Threonine Phosphorylation Site by Mass Spectrometry—LLC-PK1 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with HA-GEF-H1 or GFP-GEF-H1 constructs as indicated in the figure legends. 24–48 h later the cells were treated and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 nm calyculin A, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor, and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor tablets. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Samples from the supernatants (total cell lysate) were removed, and the remaining supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) for 30 min. After removal of the beads by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-HA or anti-GFP antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (for HA) or overnight (GFP) followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (25 μl/sample) for 1 h. After washing with RIPA buffer containing 1 mm Na3VO4, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis, and membranes were probed with anti-phosphothreonine followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-HA or anti-GFP. Control experiments in which either the HA or GFP antibody was omitted during the immunoprecipitation or lysates from non-transfected cells were used verified the specificity of the immunoprecipitation (not shown). Blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the amount of phosphothreonine in each sample was normalized to the amount of the corresponding precipitated HA-GEF-H1 or GFP-GEF-H1 and expressed as -fold increase from the control. To analyze phosphorylation site(s) in GEF-H1, LLC-PK1 cells transfected with HA-tagged GEF-H1 were pretreated for 30 min with 10 nm calyculin A and then treated with TNF-α for 2 min.

https://openalex.org/W2108975227,"Background The recently identified member of the TNF superfamily TL1A (TNFSF15) increases IFN-γ production by T cells in peripheral and mucosal CCR9+ T cells. TL1A and its receptor DR3 are up-regulated during chronic intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD). TL1A gene haplotypes increase CD susceptibility in Japanese, European, and US cohorts. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we report that the presence of TL1A gene haplotype B increases risk in Jewish CD patients with antibody titers for the E. coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC+) (Haplotype B frequency in Jewish CD patients: 24.9% for OmpC negative and 41.9% for OmpC positive patients, respectively, P≤0.001). CD14+ monocytes isolated from Jewish OmpC+ patients homozygous for TL1A gene haplotype B express higher levels of TL1A in response to FcγR stimulation, a known inducing pathway of TL1A, as measured by ELISA. Furthermore, the membrane expression of TL1A is increased on peripheral monocytes from Jewish but not non-Jewish CD patients with the risk haplotype. Conclusions and Significance These findings suggest that TL1A gene variation exacerbates induction of TL1A in response to FcγR stimulation in Jewish CD patients and this may lead to chronic intestinal inflammation via overwhelming T cell responses. Thus, TL1A may provide an important target for therapeutic intervention in this subgroup of IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2027250628,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive human malignancies. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anti-tumor agent. However, many HCC cells show resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In this study, we showed that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, overcame TRAIL resistance in HCC cells, including Huh-7, Hep3B, and Sk-Hep1. The combination of bortezomib and TRAIL restored the sensitivity of HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Comparing the molecular change in HCC cells treated with these agents, we found that down-regulation of phospho-Akt (P-Akt) played a key role in mediating TRAIL sensitization of bortezomib. The first evidence was that bortezomib down-regulated P-Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner in TRAIL-treated HCC cells. Second, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, also sensitized resistant HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Third, knocking down Akt1 by small interference RNA also enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. Finally, ectopic expression of mutant Akt (constitutive active) in HCC cells abolished TRAIL sensitization effect of bortezomib. Moreover, okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, reversed down-regulation of P-Akt in bortezomib-treated cells, and PP2A knockdown by small interference RNA also reduced apoptosis induced by the combination of TRAIL and bortezomib, indicating that PP2A may be important in mediating the effect of bortezomib on TRAIL sensitization. Together, bortezomib overcame TRAIL resistance at clinically achievable concentrations in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this effect is mediated at least partly via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2005253053,"The elevation of [cAMP](i) is an important mechanism of platelet inhibition and is regulated by the opposing activity of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase (PDE). In this study, we demonstrate that a variety of platelet agonists, including thrombin, significantly enhance the activity of PDE3A in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Stimulation of platelets with the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN resulted in rapid and transient phosphorylation of PDE3A on Ser(312), Ser(428), Ser(438), Ser(465), and Ser(492), in parallel with the PKC (protein kinase C) substrate, pleckstrin. Furthermore, phosphorylation and activation of PDE3A required the activation of PKC, but not of PI3K/PKB, mTOR/p70S6K, or ERK/RSK. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters also resulted in phosphorylation of the same PDE3A sites in a PKC-dependent, PKB-independent manner. This was further supported by the finding that IGF-1, which strongly activates PI3K/PKB, but not PKC, did not regulate PDE3A. Platelet activation also led to a PKC-dependent association between PDE3A and 14-3-3 proteins. In contrast, cAMP-elevating agents such as PGE(1) and forskolin-induced phosphorylation of Ser(312) and increased PDE3A activity, but did not stimulate 14-3-3 binding. Finally, complete antagonism of PGE(1)-evoked cAMP accumulation by thrombin required both G(i) and PKC activation. Together, these results demonstrate that platelet activation stimulates PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PDE3A on Ser(312), Ser(428), Ser(438), Ser(465), and Ser(492) leading to a subsequent increase in cAMP hydrolysis and 14-3-3 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2079580257,"Although parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) 1α-hydroxylase (1α(OH)ase) under hypocalcemic conditions, previous studies showed that calcitonin, not PTH, has an important role in the maintenance of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) under normocalcemic conditions. In this study we report that 1α(OH)ase transcription is strongly induced by calcitonin in kidney cells and indicate mechanisms that underlie this regulation. The transcription factor C/EBPβ is up-regulated by calcitonin in kidney cells and results in a significant enhancement of calcitonin induction of 1α(OH)ase transcription and protein expression. Mutation constructs of the 1α(OH)ase promoter demonstrate the importance of the C/EBPβ binding site at −79/–73 for activation of the 1α(OH)ase promoter by calcitonin. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex was found to cooperate with calcitonin in the regulation of 1α(OH)ase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that calcitonin recruits C/EBPβ to the 1α(OH)ase promoter, and Re-chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (sequential chromatin immunoprecipitations using different antibodies) showed that C/EBPβ and BRG1, an ATPase that is a component of the SWI/SNF complex, bind simultaneously to the 1α(OH)ase promoter. These findings are the first to address the dynamics between calcitonin, C/EBPβ, and SWI/SNF in the regulation of 1α(OH)ase and provide a mechanism, for the first time, for calcitonin induction of 1α(OH)ase. Because plasma calcitonin as well as 1,25(OH)2D3 have been reported to be increased during pregnancy and lactation and in early development, these findings suggest a mechanism that may account, at least in part, for the increase in plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 during these times of increased calcium requirement.

Thus, calcitonin has both skeletal and extra-skeletal effects. Although it had been thought that a major function of calcitonin is to lower serum calcium, it has been shown that patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, a neoplasm of C cells, have high calcitonin levels but normal serum calcium (24.Emmertsen K.

In the human 1α(OH)ase promoter, an SP1 site involved in basal expression and a negative vitamin D response element, which associates with VDR/retinoid X receptor as well as histone deacetylase complex in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, have been reported (27.Gao X.H.

Kimmel-Jehan C. Jehan F. Shinki T. Wakino S. Anazawa H. Suda T. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Kodera Y. Hosoya T. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), confers positive responsiveness to calcitonin. Maximal calcitonin activation is observed using the minimal promoter region (–85/+22). Mutation of a C/EBPβ binding site at −79/–73 resulted in marked attenuation of activation of 1α(OH)ase transcription by calcitonin. SWI/SNF, which remodels chromatin using the energy of ATP hydrolysis, is recruited by C/EBPβ to the 1α(OH)ase promoter and also mediates calcitonin regulation of 1α(OH)ase transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis also showed an increase in acetylated histone 4 in response to calcitonin, suggesting cooperation between acetylation and chromatin remodeling. These findings are the first to address the dynamics between calcitonin, C/EBPβ, and SWI/SNF in the regulation of 1α(OH)ase and provide a mechanism for the first time for calcitonin induction of 1α(OH)ase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Deoxy-[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A Random Primers DNA labeling kit was purchased from Invitrogen. The 1,25(OH)2D3 RIA kit was purchased from Immunodiagnostics Systems Inc. (Fountain Hills, AZ).

Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and changed to medium supplemented with 2% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum before treatment. C33A cells (from ATCC) that lack Brm and BRG1 were used in some studies and were similarly maintained. Cells were treated with the vehicle or the compounds noted at the indicated times and concentrations.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For transfection studies, the mouse 1α(OH)ase promoter −1651/+22 placed upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2b vector and the deletion constructs −144/+22, −85/+22, and −74/+22 were kindly provided by Dr. H. F. DeLuca (University of Wisconsin at Madison, Madison, WI). pMex-C/EBPβ was a gift of Dr. Simon Willimas, Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX). A-C/EBP, a dominant negative that heterodimerizes with C/EBP family members and blocks DNA binding, was provided by Dr. Charles Vinson (NIH, Bethesda, MD) (34.Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ promoter luciferase construct (–1400/+16) was provided by Dr. Christian Trautwein (35.Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-mutant Brm (with the ATPase site mutated that acts as a dominant negative inhibitor) was obtained from M. Yaniv (Institut Pasteur, Paris). PBJ5 BRG1 (K785R) with the ATPase site mutated was from J. DiRenzo and M. Brown (36.DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Mutant Brm and BRG1 (with the ATPase sites mutated) have previously been characterized and shown to be incorporated into the SWI/SNF complex resulting in interference in transcriptional activation (37.de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). LIP, the dominant negative isoform of C/EBPβ, originally described by Descombes and Schibler (38.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), was provided by A. Dusso (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Cells were seeded in a 24-well culture dish 24 h before transfection at 70% confluence. Empty vectors were transfected to keep the total DNA concentration equal. Cells in each well were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Efficiency of transfection, as assessed by green fluorescent protein cotransfection and subsequent visualization, was estimated at 75–85% for AOK-B50 cells. Efficiency of transfection of MCT cells, similarly analyzed, was 25–35%. Maximal induction of 1α(OH)ase transcription (using transfected promoter constructs) by calcitonin in MCT cells was 2.4 ± 0.3-fold (compared with 9–10-fold for AOK-B50 cells). Thus, for most studies examining transcriptional regulation of 1α(OH)ase using transfected cells, AOK-B50 cells were used. Cells were treated 24-h post-transfection for another 24 h. Time course studies with calcitonin indicated a peak of activation at 6 h (1 nm calcitonin resulted in a 20–21-fold induction in transcription using either the −1651/+22 or the −85/+22 promoter construct). Studies were done at 24 h (suboptimal conditions) similar to previous studies with calcitonin (100 nm) (9.Murayama A. Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Kodera Y. Hosoya T. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by incubating with 1× passive lysis buffer, supplied by the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). The luciferase activity assay was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer and normalized based on protein content of the cell lysates. Protein levels were determined by the Bradford assay (39.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The C/EBPβ binding site at −79/–73 was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides used to generate the mutated site at −79/–73 were as follows: 5′-GGA GTC TGG GAG ACT CTG AAG AGC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-GCT CTT CAG AGT CTC CCA GAC TCC-3′ (lower strand). The mutated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis of 1α(OH)ase, 50 μg of protein from total cell extracts was loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline for 30 min and incubated at room temperature with 1α(OH)ase antibody (from Armbrecht et al. laboratory (40.Armbrecht H.J. Boltz M.A. Ritter C.S. Brown A.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide consisting of the last 12 amino acids of the mouse/pig 1α(OH)ase sequence) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% milk, Tris-buffered saline for 60 min. Membranes were then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (sc-2004; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:10,000 in 1% milk, TBS for 30 min. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by the electrochemiluminescent detection system. For analysis of C/EBPβ protein, nuclear extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (41.Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 472-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).ChIP Assay—Cells were cultured to 95% confluence before the experiment and then treated with calcitonin for the different times to perform the ChIP assay as previously described (42.Shen Q. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40589-40598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to a cross-link reaction with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-link reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, collected by scraping, and lysed sequentially in 5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and then in 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, for 20 min individually. The chromatin pellets were sonicated to an average DNA size of 500 bp using a Fisher model 100 sonic dismembrator at a power setting of 2. The sonicated extract was centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed and then diluted into ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 1.2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with the indicated antibody. After a 1-h incubation with salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin-pretreated Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed sequentially in buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) twice. The protein-DNA was eluted by using 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min twice. Cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight in elution buffer with 0.2 m NaCl. DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kits (Valencia, CA) and subjected to PCR using the primers designed to amplify the fragment containing the C/EBP binding site (upper, 5′-CTA CAC AGA CCA CTT GCA AA-3′; lower, 5′-TCA TGT CTG TGT TTG GGG AG-′). PCR products were resolved in 1% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. PCR was carried out in the linear range of DNA amplification. DNA acquired before precipitation was collected and used as the input. 10% of input was used for PCR evaluation. PCR using the primers designed to amplify the upstream region of 1α(OH)ase promoter (–1300/–980) were used as a negative control. DNA acquired from immunoprecipitates performed with IgG was subjected to PCR using the primers designed to amplify the fragment containing the C/EBP binding site to exclude nonspecific binding.Re-ChIP experiments were also done using sequential chromatin immunoprecipitations and two different antibodies (α-C/EBPβ and α-BRG1) to assay for the simultaneous presence of these two factors at the same site in the 1α(OH)ase promoter. In Re-ChIP experiments, on the second day of the ChIP experiment complexes were eluted in 60 μl of elution buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. The eluted samples were diluted 50 times with ChIP dilution buffer and subjected again to the ChIP procedure using the second antibody (α-BRG1) (42.Shen Q. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40589-40598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—22-Mer complementary oligonucleotides spanning the C/EBP binding site at −79/–73 of the mouse 1α(OH)ase promoter or mutated C/EBP binding site were used for the gel shift assays. The sequences of the oligo nucleotides were 5′-CTT CAG CCA ATC CCA GAC GCG-3′ and 5′-CGC GTC TGG GAT TGG CTG AAG-3′ for the wild type and 5′-CTT CAG AGT CTC CCA GAC GCG-3′ and 5′-CGC GTC TGG GAG ACT CTG AAG-3′ for the mutant construct. Overlapping oligonucleotide strands were heat-denatured and annealed overnight. Fifty nanograms of duplex oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and purified using a Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of nuclear preparations from calcitonin-treated AOK-B50 cells (5 μg of protein) were incubated for 20 min at 27 °C with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) with or without unlabeled wild type or mutant DNA competitor or C/EBPβ antibody in binding buffer (4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by the addition of 0.3–0.5 ng of the labeled oligonucleotide probe (∼100,000 cpm) and incubation for 30 min at 27 °C. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide which had been pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 100 V/cm at 4 °C in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA for 2.5 h under identical conditions. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen.Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were done to examine the interaction of C/EBPβ and BRG1. Nuclear extracts were prepared from MCT cells, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (39.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar). 500 μg of each preparation was used for immunoprecipitation with the addition of 4 μg of C/EBPβ antiserum or 4 μg of BRG1 antiserum for 24 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each sample and, after further incubation by rotating at 4 °C for 3 h, the immunoprecipitated complex was collected by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The complex was separated by 7.5 or 15% SDS-PAGE and probed with BRG1 antibody or C/EBPβ antibody (42.Shen Q. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40589-40598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).1,25(OH)2D3 Production—To determine that 1α(OH)ase protein (examined by Western blot) was catalytically active, 1,25(OH)2D3 production in AOK-B50 cells in response to calcitonin was measured. Cells were cultured 60–70% confluent in T25 flasks before serum deprivation overnight and then treated with vehicle or calcitonin for different dos"
https://openalex.org/W2091913214,"Background Fossil tracks made by non-avian theropod dinosaurs commonly reflect the habitual bipedal stance retained in living birds. Only rarely-captured behaviors, such as crouching, might create impressions made by the hands. Such tracks provide valuable information concerning the often poorly understood functional morphology of the early theropod forelimb. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a well-preserved theropod trackway in a Lower Jurassic (∼198 million-year-old) lacustrine beach sandstone in the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation in southwestern Utah. The trackway consists of prints of typical morphology, intermittent tail drags and, unusually, traces made by the animal resting on the substrate in a posture very similar to modern birds. The resting trace includes symmetrical pes impressions and well-defined impressions made by both hands, the tail, and the ischial callosity. Conclusions/Significance The manus impressions corroborate that early theropods, like later birds, held their palms facing medially, in contrast to manus prints previously attributed to theropods that have forward-pointing digits. Both the symmetrical resting posture and the medially-facing palms therefore evolved by the Early Jurassic, much earlier in the theropod lineage than previously recognized, and may characterize all theropods."
https://openalex.org/W2010131812,"GPR3 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor endowed with constitutive Gs signaling activity, which is expressed broadly in the central nervous system, with maximal expression in the habenula. We investigated the consequences of its genetic deletion in several behavioral paradigms and on neurotransmission. Compared to wild-type, hippocampal neurons from Gpr3−/− mice displayed lower basal intracellular cAMP levels, consistent with the strong constitutive activity of GPR3 in transiently transfected cells. Behavioral analyses revealed that Gpr3−/− mice exhibited a high level of avoidance of novel and unfamiliar environment, associated with increased stress reactivity in behavioral despair paradigms and aggressive behavior in the resident-intruder test. On the contrary, no deficit was found in the learning ability to avoid an aversive event in active avoidance task. The reduced ability of Gpr3−/− mice to cope with stress was unrelated to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with Gpr3−/− mice showing normal corticosterone production under basal or stressful conditions. In contrast, dramatic alterations of monoamine contents were found in hippocampus, hypothalamus and frontal cortex of Gpr3−/− mice. Our results establish a link between tonic stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway by GPR3 and control of neurotransmission by monoamines throughout the forebrain. GPR3 qualifies as a new player in the modulation of behavioral responses to stress and constitutes a novel promising pharmacological target for treatment of emotional disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2056086335,"The Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) plays a positive role in HER2-induced signaling and transformation, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Given the significance of HER2 in breast cancer, defining a mechanism for SHP2 in the HER2 signaling pathway is of paramount importance. In the current report we show that SHP2 positively modulates the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 and the phospoinositide-3-kinase-Akt pathways downstream of HER2 by increasing the half-life the activated form of Ras. This is accomplished by dephosphorylating an autophosphorylation site on HER2 that serves as a docking platform for the SH2 domains of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). The net effect is an increase in the intensity and duration of GTP-Ras levels with the overall impact of enhanced HER2 signaling and cell transformation. In conformity to these findings, the HER2 mutant that lacks the SHP2 target site exhibits an enhanced signaling and cell transformation potential. Therefore, SHP2 promotes HER2-induced signaling and transformation at least in part by dephosphorylating a negative regulatory autophosphorylation site. These results suggest that SHP2 might serve as a therapeutic target against breast cancer and other cancers characterized by HER2 overexpression.

Furthermore, somatic activating SHP2 mutations were discovered in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic (18Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A.

SHP2 possesses two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains in the N-terminal region that allow the protein to localize to substrate microdomains after tyrosyl phosphorylation of interacting proteins. The phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (PTP) domain in the C-terminal region is responsible for dephosphorylation of target substrates (13Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 22Feng G.S. Pawson T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutation of the critical Cys residue in the active site of SHP2 abolishes its phosphatase activity, leading to the production of a dominant-negative protein (23Feng G.S. Shen R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Kazlauskas A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of SHP2 is regulated by an intramolecular conformational switch. SHP2 assumes a “closed conformation” when inactive and an “open conformation” when active. In the closed conformation the N-SH2 domain interacts with the PTP domain, physically impeding the activity of the enzyme. Upon engagement of the SH2 domains with phosphotyrosine, the PTP domain is relieved of autoinhibition and dephosphorylates target substrates (23Feng G.S. Shen R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Kazlauskas A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Mutation of these residues leads to a constitutively active SHP2, and the occurrence of such mutations in humans causes the development of Noonan syndrome and associated leukemia (16Tartaglia M.

Recently, we have shown that inhibition of SHP2 in the HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines abolishes mitogenic and cell survival signaling and reverses transformation, leading to differentiation of malignant cells into a normal breast epithelial phenotype (27Zhou X.D. Agazie Y.M. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given the significance of HER2 in breast cancer, the finding that SHP2 plays a positive role was very interesting. We, thus, sought to investigate the molecular mechanism that underlies the positive role of SHP2 in HER2-induced signaling and transformation. To do so, it was first necessary to decipher the identity of SHP2 substrates whose dephosphorylation promotes the oncogenic functions of HER2. Using the recently developed substrate-trapping mutant of SHP2 as a reagent (28Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we have identified HER2 itself as an SHP2 substrate. We have further shown that SHP2 dephosphorylates an autophosphorylation site on HER2 that serves as a docking site for the SH2 domains of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP), the down-regulator of Ras. This effect of SHP2 increases the intensity and duration of GTP-Ras levels with the overall impact of enhanced HER2 signaling and cell transformation. Cells, Cell Culture, and Reagents—The cells used in this study were the BT474 breast cancer cell line, the mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell line, and MCF-10A, the immortalized breast epithelial cell line, which were all purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). The BT474 and the MEF cells were grown in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The MCF-10A were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml recombinant human insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), and 5% horse serum as described previously (29Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). All cell types were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The anti-HER2, the anti-PTP1D (SHP2), and the anti-Ras monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen, the anti-β-actin and the anti-FLAG-tag monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma, the anti-EGFR antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Mike Hayman (Stony Brook University), and the anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and the anti-phospho-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and Alexa fluor 488 and rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Development of the SHP2 substrate-trapping mutant (D425A/C459S-SHP2, termed double mutant (DM)-SHP2) and the corresponding GST fusion forms were reported previously (10Burks J. Agazie Y.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7166-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study the full-length wild type SHP2 (WT-SHP2) and DM-SHP2, FLAG-tagged at the C terminus, were subcloned into REBNA/IRES/GFP retroviral vector using the same strategy described previously (9Agazie Y.M. Movilla N. Ischenko I. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6909-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The HER2 cDNA in the pCMV-SPORT6 plasmid was purchased from ATCC. The Tyr-1023 to Phe mutation was introduced using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit and protocol with the following complementary primers; the sense primer was 5′-GGGACCTGGTGGATGCTGAGGAGTTTCTGGTACCCCAGCAGGGCTTCTTCTG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CAGAAGAAGCCCTGCTGGGGTACCAGAAACTCCTCAGCATCCACCAGGTCCC-3′. For expression in the MEF and MCF-10A cells, both the wild type and the mutant HER2 cDNA were Myc-tagged at the C terminus and subcloned into the same retroviral vector as in SHP2 at XhoI and NotI sites with the forward primer, 5′-CTCGAGCGCCACCATGCGACCCTCCGGGAC-3′, and the Myc-tagged reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCACAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCCATTGCTCCAATAAATTACTGCTTTG-3′. Cell Transfection, Retrovirus Production, and Production of Stable Cell Lines—We used the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) for transfection of the SHP2 and HER2 retroviral constructs into appropriate packaging cells. The BT474, MEF, and MCF-10A cell lines stably expressing the SHP2 and/or the HER2 proteins were produced by infection with respective retroviruses in the presence of 1 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After incubation in growth medium for ∼48 h, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml Blasticidine, the selection antibiotic expressed by the viral vector, to remove non-expressing cells. Blasticidin-resistant cell populations were used for the various experiments described in the relevant sections. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting Analysis—All cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were briefly sonicated to break chromosomal DNA that could interfere with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of proteins. After clearing by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the lysates were analyzed as described in the respective experiments. For electrophoresis gel separation of proteins, samples were denatured by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer and run on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton-X-100, stained with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and detected using the chemiluminescence method. Substrate-trapping and Affinity Precipitation Studies—For substrate trapping, the BT474 breast cancer cells expressing vector alone, WT-SHP2, and DM-SHP2 were grown to about 80% confluency, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 10 min or left unstimulated. Lysates prepared from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) and anti-HER2 antibodies. The immunoprecipitation studies were further corroborated by affinity precipitation with the GST fusion constructs. The GST fusions of the PTP domains of the WT- and the DM-SHP2 and the SH2 domains of RasGAP were reported previously (12Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7875-7886Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Merritt R. Hayman M.J. Agazie Y.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For affinity precipitation, GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria (∼2 μg per reaction tube) were first captured on glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubation of cleared lysates for 30 min at 4 °C and then washing 3 times with eukaryotic cell lysis buffer. Cell lysates prepared from BT474 and MEF cells expressing WT-HER2 and Y203F-HER2 were then added to the beads, incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times with cell lysis buffer, eluted by boiling for 10 min with Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Immunocomplex PTPase Assay—In vitro dephosphorylation of HER2 by SHP2 was tested as described previously by us and others (28Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, HER2 was immunoprecipitated from the BT474 cell lysates and washed 2 times with lysis buffer and 1 times with phosphatase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA). Beads were resuspended in 100 μl of the phosphatase buffer and then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min after the addition of purified WT- or DM-PTP. The level of HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Analysis of Ras Activation—State of Ras activation was determined by affinity precipitation with the GST fusion of the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (GST-RBD) as described previously (12Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7875-7886Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 32Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST-RBD was captured on glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubation of cleared bacterial lysates containing the fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C and then washing 3 times with cell lysis buffer described above. Cleared test cell lysates prepared from MEF and MCF-10A cell-expressing vector, WT-HER2, and Y1023F-HER2 were incubated with immobilized GST-RBD for 4 h at 4 °C, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting protocols were as described above. Finally, the level of GTP-Ras bound to the GST-RBD was determined by immunoblotting with anti-Ras monoclonal antibody. Note that Raf-1 binds only to the activated f6torm of Ras (GTP-Ras). Anchorage-independent Growth in Soft Agar—Anchorage-independent growth in the soft agar was used as one of the assays to determine state of cell transformation (33Agazie Y. Ischenko I. Hayman M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). First, 6-cm cell culture plates were overlaid with 0.3% agar in the growth medium, and next, cells suspended in 3 ml of growth medium were mixed with melted agar to a final concentration of 0.3% and immediately poured onto the agar overlay. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature for the gar to solidify, the cells were transferred to a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 7 days. During this time the cells were fed with soft agar medium every 3 days. Colony formation was visualized under a microscope, and phase contrast pictures were taken using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with Olympus DP30BW digital camera. Cell Differentiation in Laminin-rich Basement Membrane Cultures—Laminin-rich basement membrane (LRBM) cultures were performed as described previously (29Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 34Bissell M.J. Radisky D.C. Rizki A. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 μl of growth factor reduced LRBM medium (BD Biosciences) was overlaid onto 4-well chamber slides (Falcon) and allowed to solidify for 15 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Approximately 103 cells resuspended in 250 μl of assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum, 10 μg/ml recombinant human insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 ng/ml EGF, and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin) were plated on a solidified LRBM and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were re-fed with assay medium every 4 days, and phase contrast pictures were taken after 15 days. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells in LRBM cultures were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (29Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 35Shaw K.R. Wrobel C.N. Brugge J.S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells in the LRBM cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 30 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The samples were then stained with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton-X-100, and incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times, the chambers were removed, and slides were covered with appropriate size coverslips and sealed. Finally, slides were inverted and scanned with laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss), and pictures were collected. SHP2 Interacts with the HER2 Signaling Complex—SHP2 interacts directly or indirectly with receptor-tyrosine kinase through its SH2 domains (23Feng G.S. Shen R. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Kazlauskas A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This interaction enables SHP2 to localize to substrate microdomains and positively modulate cell growth and survival signaling by PTP domain-mediated dephosphorylation of target substrates (10Burks J. Agazie Y.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7166-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 37Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It was, thus, logical to think that SHP2 interacts with the HER2 signaling complex to play its positive role. This possibility was tested by reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies on lysates prepared from the BT474 breast cancer cell line that overexpresses HER2 (38Pasleau F. Grooteclaes M. Gol-Winkler R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar) but has very low amount of the EGFR. SHP2 coprecipitated with HER2 in both the absence and the presence of EGF (Fig. 1A, left panel), suggesting constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 under conditions of overexpression. Indeed, anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting showed that HER2 was highly autophosphorylated even in the absence of EGF. Reciprocal experiments also showed that HER2 coprecipitates with SHP2 (Fig. 1A, right panel). Therefore, SHP2 forms a stable signaling complex with HER2. Identification of SHP2 Substrates in the BT474 Cells—The phosphatase function of SHP2 is critical for its positive role in receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling (39Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We, thus, decided to identify proteins whose dephosphorylation by SHP2 positively impacts HER2-induced signaling and transformation. The substrate-trapping mutant of SHP2, the DM-SHP2 (28Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which forms a stable complex with target substrates through its PTP domain, was used as a reagent to isolate and identify such proteins. First, BT474 cells stably expressing vector alone, WT-SHP2, and DM-SHP2 were obtained by retroviral transduction as described by us recently (10Burks J. Agazie Y.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7166-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To discriminate between endogenous and ectopically expressed SHP2, a FLAG tag was added to the C terminus. Analysis of input total cell lysates is shown in Fig. 1B. Ectopic expression of both SHP2 proteins was comparable, and it was approximately four times that of the endogenous. The level of the HER2 protein was similar as was the total protein concentration. In anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation studies, the DM-SHP2 brought down highly enriched phosphotyrosyl (Tyr(P)) proteins; major bands of ∼180 and 120 kDa (Fig. 1C). Very low amounts of corresponding proteins were also brought down by the WT-SHP2 protein, suggesting SH2 domain-mediated interactions. Based on size, we suspected that the 180-kDa protein could be HER2 itself. Indeed, reblotting with anti-HER2 antibody showed that it was HER2 (middle panel). EGF stimulation did not have a significant effect on substrate trapping, confirming the observations in Fig. 1A where HER2 was constitutively autophosphorylated in the BT474 cells. Further reblotting with anti-FLAG antibody showed that comparable amounts of the WT- and the DM-SHP2 proteins were recovered during the immunoprecipitation reaction (lower panel). The identity of the 120-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein remains unknown. The 70-KDa Tyr(P) protein was SHP2 as revealed by the anti-FLAG immunoblotting, but only the DM-SHP2 was phosphorylated. Note that SHP2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation and is able to autodephosphorylate itself (40Stein-Gerlach M. Kharitonenkov A. Vogel W. Ali S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24635-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation as in the DM-SHP2 abolishes this function, leading to a sustained tyrosine phosphorylation state. To confirm PTP domain-mediated trapping of HER2, in vitro binding studies with the GST fusions of the PTP domains of both the WT-SHP2 and the DM-SHP2 were performed. The GST-DM-PTP affinity precipitated HER2, whereas the GST-WT-PTP did not (Fig. 1D). These results were consistent with previous reports where the substrate-trapping mutant of SHP2 forms an active site-mediated stable complex with target substrates, whereas the wild type protein dephosphorylates and releases them (28Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Merritt R. Hayman M.J. Agazie Y.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, HER2 is a potential SHP2 substrate. Because SHP2 plays a positive role in receptor-tyrosine kinase-induced signaling and transformation, the discovery of HER2 as an SHP2 substrate was surprising. We were intrigued by these findings and focused on HER2 to see why its dephosphorylation by SHP2 promotes the signaling and cell transformation functions. SHP2 Targets the Tyr-1023 Autophosphorylation Site in HER2—The next logical step was to identity the autophosphorylation site(s) on HER2 targeted by SHP2. Reportedly, HER2 has six tyrosine (Tyr) autophosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region, including Tyr-1023 with unknown function, Tyr-1112 and Tyr-1139 that serve as docking sites for CBL and Grb2, respectively, and Tyr-1196, Tyr-1122, and Tyr-1248 that provide docking sites for Shc proteins (41Ono M. Kuwano M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 7242-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus ("
https://openalex.org/W2010125647,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3alpha1 (JNK3alpha1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase family member expressed primarily in the brain that phosphorylates protein transcription factors, including c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) upon activation by a variety of stress-based stimuli. In this study, we set out to design JNK3-selective inhibitors that had >1000-fold selectivity over p38, another closely related mitogen-activated protein kinase family member. To do this we employed traditional medicinal chemistry principles coupled with structure-based drug design. Inhibitors from the aminopyrazole class, such as SR-3576, were found to be very potent JNK3 inhibitors (IC(50) = 7 nm) with >2800-fold selectivity over p38 (p38 IC(50) > 20 microm) and had cell-based potency of approximately 1 microm. In contrast, indazole-based inhibitors exemplified by SR-3737 were potent inhibitors of both JNK3 (IC(50) = 12 nm) and p38 (IC(50) = 3 nm). These selectivity differences between the indazole class and the aminopyrazole class came despite nearly identical binding (root mean square deviation = 0.33 A) of these two compound classes to JNK3. The structural features within the compounds giving rise to the selectivity in the aminopyrazole class include the highly planar nature of the pyrazole, N-linked phenyl structures, which better occupied the smaller active site of JNK3 compared with the larger active site of p38."
https://openalex.org/W1998388036,"Since antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available in the developed world, the prevalence of unprotected sex and the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV have increased. We hypothesized that a similar phenomenon may be occurring in sub-Saharan Africa concomitant with the scale-up of HIV treatment.We conducted a general population-based survey in Kisumu, Kenya. Participants completed an interview that included demographics as well as ART-related attitudes and beliefs (AB) and then underwent HIV serological testing. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of AB about ART indicated two factors: 1) ART-related risk compensation (increased sexual risk taking now that ART is available); and 2) a perception that HIV is more controllable now that ART is available. Logistic regression was used to determine associations of these factors with HIV-seroprevalence after controlling for age.1,655 (90%) of 1,844 people aged 15-49 contacted, including 749 men and 906 women, consented to participate in the study. Most participants (n = 1164; 71%) had heard of ART. Of those who had heard of ART, 23% believed ART was a cure for HIV. ART-related risk compensation (Adjusted (A)OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.81), and a belief that ART cures HIV (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.22-3.76) were associated with an increased HIV seroprevalence in men but not women after controlling for age. In particular, ART-related risk compensation was associated with an increased HIV-seroprevalence in young (aged 15-24 years) men (OR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.12-2.19).ART-related risk compensation and a belief that ART cures HIV were associated with an increased HIV seroprevalence among men but not women. HIV prevention programs in sub-Saharan Africa that target the general population should include educational messages about ART and address the changing beliefs about HIV in the era of greater ART availability."
https://openalex.org/W2077168028,"Directional migration of transmigrated leukocytes to the site of injury is a central event in the inflammatory response. Here, we present an in vivo chemotaxis assay enabling the visualization and quantitative analysis of subtype-specific directional motility and polarization of leukocytes in their natural 3D microenvironment. Our technique comprises the combination of i) semi-automated in situ microinjection of chemoattractants or bacteria as local chemotactic stimulus, ii) in vivo near-infrared reflected-light oblique transillumination (RLOT) microscopy for the visualization of leukocyte motility and morphology, and iii) in vivo fluorescence microscopy for the visualization of different leukocyte subpopulations or fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Leukocyte motility parameters are quantified off-line in digitized video sequences using computer-assisted single cell tracking. Here, we show that perivenular microinjection of chemoattractants [macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha/Ccl3), platelet-activating factor (PAF)] or E. coli into the murine cremaster muscle induces target-oriented intravascular adhesion and transmigration as well as polarization and directional interstitial migration of leukocytes towards the locally administered stimuli. Moreover, we describe a crucial role of Rho kinase for the regulation of directional motility and polarization of transmigrated leukocytes in vivo. Finally, combining in vivo RLOT and fluorescence microscopy in Cx3CR1(gfp/gfp) mice (mice exhibiting green fluorescent protein-labeled monocytes), we are able to demonstrate differences in the migratory behavior of monocytes and neutrophils.Taken together, we propose a novel approach for investigating the mechanisms and spatiotemporal dynamics of subtype-specific motility and polarization of leukocytes during their directional interstitial migration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2074805821,"Background Wnts are secreted glycoproteins that regulate diverse aspects of development, including cell proliferation, cell fate specification and differentiation. More recently, Wnts have been shown to direct axon guidance in vertebrates, flies and worms. However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of Wnts in axon guidance. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that the posterior C. elegans Wnt protein LIN-44 repels the axons of the adjacent D-type motor neurons by activating its receptor LIN-17/Frizzled on the neurons. Moreover, mutations in mig-5/Disheveled, gsk-3, pry-1/Axin, bar-1/β-catenin and pop-1/TCF, also cause disrupted D-type axon pathfinding. Reduced BAR-1/β-catenin activity in D-type axons leads to undergrowth of axons, while stabilization of BAR-1/β-catenin in a lin-23/SCFβ-TrCP mutant results in an overextension phenotype. Conclusions/Significance Together, our data provide evidence that Wnt-mediated axon guidance can be transduced through a β-catenin-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2143311436,"The proper regulation of factors involved in mitosis is crucial to ensure normal cell division. Levels and activities of proteins are regulated in many ways, one of which is ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in targeting specific substrates for degradation by facilitating their ubiquitination. In seeking to elucidate additional biological roles for Cul3 we performed a two-hybrid screen and identified Ctb9/KLHDC5 as a Cul3-interacting protein. Overexpression of Ctb9/KLHDC5 resulted in an increase in microtubule density as well as persistent microtubule bridges between post-mitotic cells. Conversely, down-regulation of Ctb9/KLHDC5 showed a pronounced reduction in microtubule density. Based on these observations, we examined the interactions between Cul3, Ctb9/KLHDC5, and the microtubule-severing protein, p60/katanin. Here we show that p60/katanin interacts with a complex consisting of Cul3 and Ctb9/KLHDC5, which results in ubiquitin laddering of p60/katanin. Also, Cul3-deficient cells or Ctb9/KLHDC5-deficient cells show an increase in p60/katanin levels, indicating that Cul3/Ctb9/KLHDC5 is required for efficient p60/katanin removal. We demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism for p60/katanin that occurs at the level of targeted proteolysis to allow normal mitotic progression in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2168461884,"The identification of regulatory sequences in animal genomes remains a significant challenge. Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However, these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success, which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences, is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike in Drosophila, where virtually all non-coding DNA is highly conserved, blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence, similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos, six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast, none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos. Based on the landscape of non-coding conservation in tephritids, and our initial success in using conservation in tephritids to identify D. melanogaster regulatory sequences, we suggest that comparison of tephritid genomes may provide a systematic means to annotate the non-coding portion of the D. melanogaster genome. We also propose that large genomes be given more consideration in the selection of species for comparative genomics projects, to provide increased power to detect functional non-coding DNAs and to provide a less biased view of the evolution and function of animal genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2032332602,"Experiments under controlled laboratory conditions can produce decisive evidence for testing biological hypotheses, provided they are representative of the more complex natural conditions. However, whether this requirement is fulfilled is seldom tested explicitly. Here we provide a lab/field comparison to investigate the identity of an egg-marking signal of ant queens. Our study was based on ant workers resolving conflict over male production by destroying each other's eggs, but leaving queen eggs unharmed. For this, the workers need a proximate cue to discriminate between the two egg types. Earlier correlative evidence indicated that, in the ant Pachycondyla inversa, the hydrocarbon 3,11-dimethylheptacosane (3,11-diMeC(27)) is more abundant on the surface of queen-laid eggs.We first tested the hypothesis that 3,11-diMeC(27) functions as a queen egg-marking pheromone using laboratory-maintained colonies. We treated worker-laid eggs with synthetic 3,11-diMeC(27) and found that they were significantly more accepted than sham-treated worker-laid eggs. However, we repeated the experiment with freshly collected field colonies and observed no effect of treating worker-laid eggs with 3,11-diMeC(27), showing that this compound by itself is not the natural queen egg-marking pheromone. We subsequently investigated the overall differences of entire chemical profiles of eggs, and found that queen-laid eggs in field colonies are more distinct from worker-laid eggs than in lab colonies, have more variation in profiles, and have an excess of longer-chain hydrocarbons.Our results suggest that queen egg-marking signals are significantly affected by transfer to the laboratory, and that this change is possibly connected to reduced queen fertility as predicted by honest signaling theory. This change is reflected in the worker egg policing response under field and laboratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1972198495,"We analyzed whether polypurine hairpins (PPRHs) had the ability to knock down gene expression. These hairpins are formed by two antiparallel purine domains linked by a loop that allows the formation of Hoogsteen bonds between both domains and Watson-Crick bonds with the target polypyrimidine sequence, forming triplex structures. To set up the experimental conditions, the human dhfr gene was used as a model. The PPRHs were designed toward the template strand of DNA. The transfection of the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 with these template hairpins against the dhfr gene produced higher than 90% of cell mortality. Template PPRHs produced a decrease in DHFR mRNA, protein, and its corresponding enzymatic activity. In addition, the activity of DHFR PPRHs was tested against breast cancer cells resistant to methotrexate, observing high cell mortality. Given the difficulty in finding long polypyrimidine stretches, we studied how to compensate for the presence of purine interruptions in the polypyrimidine target sequence. The stability of PPRH was measured, resulting in a surprisingly long half-life of about 5 days. Finally, to test the generality of usage, template PPRHs were employed against two important genes involved in cell proliferation, telomerase and survivin, producing 80 and 95% of cell death, respectively. Taken together our results show the ability of antiparallel purine hairpins to bind the template strand of double strand DNA and to decrease gene transcription.

Repression of gene expression serves as a powerful therapeutical tool to inhibit the synthesis of proteins involved in pathological processes.

The ability of nucleic acids to form triple helices was discovered in 1957 by Felsenfeld and Rich (4.Felsenfeld G. Rich A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and since then there have been numerous improvements in the field. TFOs bind in a sequence-specific manner, but they present stability and binding affinity issues. To address these aspects, circular oligonucleotides (ODN) (5.Ryan K. Kool E.T. Chem.

Antiparallel hairpins are more promising in the biomedical field, because triplex forms regardless of pH, whereas in most cases, parallel hairpins require an acidic pH (13.Vasquez K.M. Wensel T.G.

According to the rules of Hoogsteen bonds, antiparallel hairpins bind to polypyrimidine stretches in the DNA target sequence, whereas parallel hairpins bind to polypurine stretches. The intramolecular linkage of the hairpin is formed by reverse Hoogsteen bonds, and the union with the target sequence is mediated by Watson-Crick, d(G#G·C) and d(A#A·T). Accordingly, PPRHs (polypurine reverse Hoogsteen) are formed by two antiparallel homopurine domains linked by a five-thymidine loop (11.Aviñó A. Frieden M. Morales J.C. Garcâia de la Torre B. Gèuimil Garcâia R. Azorâin F. Gelpâi J.L. Orozco M. Gonzâalez C. Eritja R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2609-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17.Coma S. Noe V. Eritja R. Ciudad C.J. Oligonucleotides. 2005; 15: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of the homopurine strands binds with antiparallel orientation (by Watson-Crick) to the polypyrimidine target sequence forming a triplex. Although it might be thought as difficult to find polypyrimidine stretches, triplex-forming oligonucleotide target sequences are more common in the human genome than predicted by random models, and they can be found mainly in regulatory regions, opening interesting possibilities for the use of triplexes in the control of gene expression (18.Goñi J.R. de la Cruz X. Orozco M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19.Goñi J.R. Vaquerizas J.M. Dopazo J. Orozco M. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 63Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We previously reported the ability of PPRHs to effectively bind dsDNA (17.Coma S. Noe V. Eritja R. Ciudad C.J. Oligonucleotides. 2005; 15: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) displacing the fourth strand away from the newly formed triplex. Here we describe the design and utilization of template PPRHs that bind to dsDNA as a new tool to decrease gene expression. This approach is different to that exerted by TFOs interfering with gene transcription (20.Postel E.H. Flint S.J. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2006; 12: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a model, we used as targets polypyrimidine sequences in the third intron of the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene, whose product is involved in the de novo synthesis of purines and TMP. We also evaluated the therapeutic ability of PPRHs targeting the telomerase and survivin genes. The cytotoxic activity of PPRHs when targeted at these essential genes was tested using human breast cancer cells. We also targeted the dhfr gene with PPRHs in cells resistant to methotrexate chemotherapy. The success of the latter might open a new way to fight against cancer. The PPRHs used in this study were made up of two antiparallel polypurine domains, bound by intramolecular reverse Hoogsteen bonds, and linked by a pentathymidine loop. The Triplex-Forming Oligonucleotide Target Sequence Search software, (Anderson Cancer Center; www.spi.mdanderson.org/tfo), was used to find the polypyrimidine stretches in the target sequence. BLAST analyses were performed to check for the specificity of all these sequences. Non-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (0.05 μmol scale). Purity was checked by gel electrophoresis. All concentrations were expressed in strand molarity. PPRHs were dissolved in sterile RNase-free TE buffer (1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and stored at -20 °C until use. Preparation of Polypurine/Polypyrimidine Duplexes—The duplexes to be targeted by the hairpins were formed by mixing 25 μg of each single-stranded polypurine and polypyrimidine oligodeoxynucleotides in 150 mm NaCl. After incubation at 90 °C for 5 min, solutions were allowed to cool down slowly to room temperature. Duplexes were purified in a non-denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel and quantified by their absorbance at 260 nm at 25 °C. Oligodeoxynucleotide Labeling—One hundred ng of single or double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Bio-Labs) in a 10-μl reaction mixture, according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 90 μl of TE buffer (1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) was added to the reaction mixture, which was subsequently filtered through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare) to eliminate the excess [γ-32P]ATP. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Triplex formation was analyzed by incubating radiolabeled single or double-stranded DNA targets (2 nm strand concentration; 20,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled PPRHs (250 nm strand concentration) in a buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Binding reactions (20 μl) were incubated 45 min at 37 °C before the electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed on a non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Gels were run for 3-4 h at 190 V at 4 °C, dried, and analyzed on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Quantification was performed using the ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). SKBR3 breast cancer cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. MCF7-R are breast cancer cells resistant to 10-6 m methotrexate, generated in our laboratory, bearing amplification of the dhfr locus. This cell line was grown in Ham's F-12 medium lacking the final products of DHFR activity: glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine (-GHT medium (23.Chasin, L. (1985) Mol. Cell Genet. 449–488Google Scholar)) containing 7% of dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin (Sigma). SKBR3 or MCF7-R cells were plated in 35-mm plates. PPRHs were mixed with N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP, Roche) at the appropriate oligonucleotide-DOTAP molar ratio (1:10-1:100) for 15 min at room temperature before lipofecting the cells. SKBR3 or MCF7-R cells (10,000) were plated in 35-mm plates. MTT assays using PPRHs against dhfr were performed in -GHT medium. After 7 days, 500 μg of MTT (Sigma) and 5.6 mg of succinate (Sigma) were added and allowed to react for 3 h at 37 °C before the addition of the solubilization reagent (0.57% acetic acid and 10% SDS in dimethyl sulfoxide). Cell viability was measured at 570 nm in a WPA S2100 Diode Array Spectrophotometer. 72 h after PPRH transfection, total RNA from 30,000 SKBR3 or MCF7-R cells, was extracted using the Ultraspec™ RNA Kit (Bioteck), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The amount of RNA was determined by measuring its absorbance (260 nm) at 25 °C in a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2-0.5 μg of total RNA, 125 ng of random hexamers (Roche), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs (AppliChem), 4 μl of 5× reverse transcriptase buffer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Three μl of the cDNA mixture was used for PCR amplification by real time. Real Time-PCR—The reaction was performed using the ABI-Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For dhfr, ugt1a10, and s100A4 (the two latter were used when checking for PPRH specificity), the reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 1× TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems), 3 μl of cDNA and H2O. For telomerase (tert) and survivin (bircs5), a SYBR Green PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 1× SYBR Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 μm of reverse and forward primers (Ecogen), 3 μl of cDNA and H2O. Either for the TaqMan or the SYBR Green reactions, the adenosylphosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) mRNA was used to normalize the results. The primer sequences were: Tert-Fw, 5′-AGGAGCTGACGTGGAAGATG-3′, Tert-Rv 5′-GCTCGACGACGTACACACTC-3′; Surv-Fw, 5′-AGCCAGATGACGACCCCATAG-3′, Sur-Rv, 5′-CACAGGAAGGCTGGTGGCAC-3′; Aprt-Fw, 5′-GCAGCTGGTTGAGCAGCGGAT-3′, Aprt-Rv, 5′-AGAGTGGGGCCTGGCAGCTTC-3′. PCR cycling conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The mRNA amount of the target gene, normalized to APRT, was given by the ΔΔCT method, where CT is the threshold cycle indicating the fractional cycle number at which the amount of amplified mRNA reached threshold. MCF7-R cells were used to detect DHFR protein. 30,000 MCF7-R were plated in 35-mm plates and treated with PPRHs. 72 h after transfection, total protein extracts were obtained after scraping the cells in Lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture by Sigma). The extracts were maintained at 4 °C for 1 h with vortexing every 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (based on the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Sigma)). Total protein cell extracts (35 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) using a semidry electroblotter. The membranes were probed with antibodies against DHFR (Davids Biotechnologie) and tubulin (Calbiochem) to normalize the results. Signals were detected by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2500 dilution) (GE Healthcare) and enhanced chemiluminescence, as recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Quantification was performed using ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare). 72 h after PPRH transfection, DHFR activity was determined by incorporation of radioactive deoxyuridine to cellular DNA (24.Ciudad C.J. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: 10,000 SKBR3 cells were plated in 35-mm plates with 1 ml of -T medium (Ham's F-12 medium lacking thymidine). Twenty-four hours before collecting the cells, 2 μCi of 6-[3H]deoxyuridine were added. The cells were then rinsed twice in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of 0.1% SDS. The lysate was collected on What-man 31ET papers (2.5 × 2.5 cm), which were immediately placed onto ice-cold 66% ethanol containing 250 mm NaCl, to precipitate DNA. After 3 washes in the same solution, the papers were dried and tritium was counted using liquid scintillation mixture (CytoScint, MP). The uptake of a fluorescein-labeled PPRH was monitored by flow cytometry on a Beckman Coulter Epics XL cytometer. 100,000 SKBR3 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes with Ham's F-12 medium and transfected with HpdI3-B fluoresceinated in the 5′ end (HpdI3-BF, Sigma). Cells were collected in 500 μl of ice-cold Ham's F-12 medium, centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was finally resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Propidium iodide (10 μg/ml, Sigma) was added and cells were kept on ice until the cytometric analysis. The percentage of fluorescein-positive cells after subtraction of the IP-positive fraction (dead cells) was used to express the cellular uptake of the PPRH. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test using SPSS 13.0 software for Mac OS X. Results were considered significant if p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), or p < 0.005 (***). Design of PPRHs—We searched for polypyrimidine stretches within the human dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), telomerase (tert), and survivin (birc5) genes, with a length of at least 20 or more bases to avoid PPRH unspecificity. Three polypyrimidine stretches were selected in the template strand of the dhfr gene (Table 1). All sequences were located within intron 3. Dhfr target-1 had no purine interruptions in the polypyrimidine stretch, whereas dhfr target-2 and -3 contained one purine interruption each, A and G, respectively. Template-PPRH Hp-B (blunted) was designed to bind the polypyrimidine reverse strand of the double helical DNA target by Watson-Crick base pairing. Additionally, PPRHs with the Watson-Crick domain extended with a tail (Hp-T), with both domains extended (Hp-BT, blunted and tailed) or with the loop on the contrary side (Hp-C) of the hairpin structure, were used. As negative control PPRHs, oligonucleotides bearing either: scrambled sequences (Hp-Sc) or intramolecular Watson-Crick bonds instead of Hoogsteen bonds (Hp-WC) were used. The effect of structures without the ability to form intramolecular reverse Hoogsteen bonds (No Hoogsteen, Hp-NH) but maintaining the target-binding domain was also explored. An antisense oligonucleotide (HATNL-24, 5′-gat-GcAGtttAGcGAAccAAccaT-3′), bearing the phosphothioate modification (at the 3′ of the bases indicated in lowercase) directed against the translational start of the dhfr gene, was used to test the responsiveness of cells when DHFR mRNA was targeted (25.Rodriguez M. Noe V. Alemany C. Miralles A. Bemi V. Caragol I. Ciudad C.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The selected template-PPRH against the telomerase gene was located in intron 8, and contained three purine interruptions. Regarding survivin, template-PPRHs were targeted toward exon 3 and the promoter region, and both contained three purine interruptions. To check for the specificity of all these sequences BLAST analyses were performed.

In Fig. 1B, the bindings of template-PPRHs to a duplex DNA containing the dhfr target 1 sequence are shown. We can observe a retardation of the duplex incubated with the three template-PPRHs (HpdI3-B, HpdI3-T, and HpdI3-BT) as compared with the probe alone. The negative controls HpdI3-WC and HpdI3-Sc did not cause any shift in mobility, indicating a lack of union between the PPRH and the duplex, whereas HpdI3-NH is responsible for a mobility retardation similar to that experimented by HpdI3-B. Binding specificity was tested by the addition of 2 μg of tRNA to the incubation reaction. Although template-PPRH can bind to ssDNA (data not shown), this molecular species cannot be found in the cellular context. Cytotoxicity of dhfr PPRHs—We analyzed the effect of PPRHs on SKBR3 survival (Fig. 2A). Template-PPRH HpdI3-B was lipofected with DOTAP, provoking 70% of cytotoxicity after 1 week of incubation, whereas the aODN HATNL-24, used for comparative purposes, produced 50% of cell death. DOTAP alone, at the concentration used to transfect PPRHs, HpdI3-B without DOTAP and the negative controls HpdI3-WC and HpdI3-Sc did not affect cell survival. HpdI3-NH showed a 43% cytotoxicity acting just as antisense. Increasing PPRH:DOTAP ratios in combination with decreasing HpdI3-B concentrations ranging from 500 to 100 nm with 10 μm DOTAP were tested to study the optimal PPRH: DOTAP relation (Fig. 2B). The best results were obtained with 100 nm HpdI3-B, 1:100 PPRH:DOTAP molar ratio, producing 87% cell mortality. Modifications in the PPRH structure were also studied (Fig. 2C). HpdI3-C is equivalent to HpdI3-B but with the loop on the other side. This change of orientation did not cause an increment in activity. HpdI3-T (tailed in the Watson-Crick domain) and HpdI3-BT (tailed and blunted) bear a single or double strand elongated sequence, respectively (see Table 1). Both produced less cytotoxicity than HpdI3-B. The time needed for HpdI3-B to develop its cytotoxic action was also studied. After treatment, PPRHs and liposome were removed by changing the medium at time intervals of 24 h for 4 days. Incubation of cells with HpdI3-B for 24 h already provoked high cell mortality, achieving 99% cytotoxicity when the cells were incubated with HpdI3-B for 96 h (Fig. 2D). Effects of PPRHs on DHFR Activity—The remaining DHFR activity in SKBR3 cells after 72 h of treatment with PPRHs was measured by the [3H]deoxyuridine assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, template-PPRH HpdI3-B was able to decrease DHFR activity in a dose-dependent manner, causing a drop in activity of about 60% at the concentration of 100 nm, using a 1:100 PPRH: DOTAP molar ratio. Transfection with DOTAP or with the negative control HpdI3-WC did not affect significantly DHFR activity, whereas HpdI3-NH caused a 47% decrease in activity. Effects of PPRHs on DHFR"
https://openalex.org/W1981210322,"Mechanosensation, the ability to detect mechanical forces, underlies the senses of hearing, balance, touch, and pain, as well as renal and cardiovascular regulation. Although the sensors are thought to be channels, relatively little is known about eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels or their molecular mechanisms. Thus, because of its tractable nature, a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that serves as an in vivo osmotic “emergency release valve,” MscL, has become a paradigm of how a mechanosensitive channel can sense and respond to membrane tension. Here, we have determined the structural rearrangements and interactions between transmembrane domains of MscL that occur upon gating. We utilize an electrostatic repulsion test: If two residues approach upon gating we predicted that substituting like-charges at those sites would inhibit gating. The in vivo growth and viability and in vitro vesicular flux and electrophysiological data all support the hypothesis that residues G26 and I92 directly interact upon gating. The resulting model predicted other interacting residues. One of these sets, V23 and I96, was confirmed to truly interact upon gating by disulfide trapping as well as the electrostatic repulsion test. Together, the data strongly suggest a model for structural transitions and residue-residue proximities that occur upon MscL gating.—Li, Y.,Wray, R., Eaton, C., Blount, P.

https://openalex.org/W2139374258,"Despite steady progress in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for bone phenotypes, relatively little progress has been made in moving from QTLs to identifying the relevant gene. We exploited the genetic structure of recombinant congenic mouse strains by performing a reciprocal intercross of the strains HcB-8 and HcB-23, phenotyped for body size, femoral biomechanical performance, and femoral diaphyseal geometry and mapped with R/qtl and QTL Cartographer. Significant QTLs are present on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10. We found significant sex x QTL and cross-direction x QTL interactions. The chromosome 4 QTL affects multiple femoral anatomic features and biomechanical properties. The known segregating segment of chromosome 4 contains only 18 genes, among which Ece1, encoding endothelin-converting enzyme 1, stands out as a candidate. Endothelin signaling has been shown to promote the growth of osteoblastic metastases and to potentiate signaling via the Wnt pathway. The colocalizing chromosome 4 QTL Bmd7 (for bone mineral density 7) increases responsiveness to mechanical loading. By exploiting the short informative segment of chromosome 4 and the known biology, we propose that Ece1 is the gene responsible for Bmd7 and that it acts by increasing responsiveness to mechanical loading through modulation of Wnt signaling."

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation (9;22) that generates the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by Bcr-Abl chimera protein and mediates the leukemogenesis in CML. However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates the PI3K/Akt pathway is not completely understood. In the present study, we found that pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2 (PHLPP1 and PHLPP2) were depleted in CML cells. We investigated the interaction between PHLPPs and Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines and Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells from CML patients. The Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, which dephosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3, resulting in inhibited proliferation of CML cells. The reduction of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression by short interfering RNA in CML cells weakened the Abl kinase inhibitor-mediated inhibition of proliferation. In colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte; colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage; and burst-forming unit-erythroid, treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression and inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells, whereas depletion of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 weakened the inhibition of colony formation activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors in Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells.

Furthermore the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A is also functionally inactivated by Bcr-Abl (11Neviani P. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Notari M. Blaser B.W. Liu S. Mao H. Chang J.S. Galietta A.

These signaling pathways, especially the Bcr-Abl-induced PI3K/Akt activation, play a role in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis.PP2A is inactivated in blast crisis CML through Bcr-Abl-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of the PP2A inhibitor SET. Hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic PP2A substrate kinases, such as phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), lead to their prolonged activation and ability to drive the survival and proliferative signaling pathway (11Neviani P.

The inactivation of PP2A is essential for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis and blastic transformation.Another serine/threonine protein phosphatase, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), terminates Akt signaling by dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif on Akt (12Gao T.

PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 decrease activity of Akt and increase apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation through the dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (Ser-473) in Akt. Depletion of either PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 causes a 30-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation after EGF stimulation in a normal breast cell line (22Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Knockdown studies have revealed that PHLPP1 influences the phosphorylation state of Akt2 and Akt3, whereas PHLPP2 affects the phosphorylation state of Akt1 and Akt3.In the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, defective PTEN activates Akt signaling by preventing conversion of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate back to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and contributes to retaining Akt phosphorylation. Nonetheless there are many examples of elevated Akt phosphorylation in cancer cells that have intact PTEN expression. PHLPP levels are markedly reduced in some cancer cell lines that have elevated Akt phosphorylation, and the reintroduction of PHLPP reduces cell growth (23Mendoza M.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, the role of PLHPP remains unclear.In the present study, we found that Bcr-Abl suppressed the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. We analyzed the role of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cell lines and the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients by inhibiting the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. We detected a change in Ser-473 upon Akt phosphorylation with CML-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells exhibiting more Akt phosphorylation than normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.DISCUSSIONWe investigated the role of PHLPP expression on the induction of apoptosis or growth inhibition of CML cells treated with Abl kinase inhibitors. We demonstrated that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and promoted the CML cell progression through continuous phospho-Akt activation.The PI3K/Akt pathway is a central node in determining cellular fate.

Depletion of PHLPP1 not only increases the phosphorylation state of many Akt substrates (glycogen synthase kinase-3β, tuberin (TSC2), and forkhead box O) but also increases the phosphorylation state of a unique set of Akt substrates including the E3 ligase, HDM2 (human homologue to murine double minute 2), and glycogen synthase kinase-3α (15Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).

In the present study, we found that treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors or depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells and that this expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells inhibited their proliferation.The development of Abl kinase inhibitors, such as STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825, has provided a beneficial treatment for CML patients as well as a new tool for studying the effect of inhibition of the Abl kinase activity in cells harboring the endogenous Bcr-Abl gene (30Andreu E.J.

In both Bcr-Abl+ cells and primary CML CD34+ cells, STI571 inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity results in a G1 cell cycle arrest mediated by the PI3K pathway. A study that used inhibitors of both Bcr-Abl and PI3K found that the decrease in the p27Kip1 protein levels in Bcr-Abl+ cells is due to regulation at the levels of transcription and degradation by activating the PI3K pathway (31Klejman A.

The PI3K pathway contributes to transformation by Bcr-Abl, and PI3K inhibitors synergize with Abl kinase inhibitors (imatinib) to greatly increase apoptosis of CML cells from chronic phase and blast crisis patients (22Sattler M.

The PI3K effecter most closely associated with cell transformation is Akt, and the substrates of activated Akt regulate the cell cycle, growth, metabolism, and survival. Our study may indicate that Akt isoforms phosphorylated by activated PI3K are maintained by the Bcr-Abl-mediated suppression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells. These mechanisms were clarified by our study. We found that the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 mRNA and protein was increased by Abl kinase inhibitors or depletion of Bcr-Abl expression. Moreover in K562 and Meg01 cells, the three Akt isoforms were constitutively phosphorylated on Ser-473, and the Abl kinase inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3. We also showed that the depletion of PHLPP1 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on AKt2 and Akt3, and the depletion of PHLPP2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on Akt1 and Akt3.We investigated the effects of depletion of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells. In both K562 and Meg01 cells, the cell proliferation was remarkably inhibited by treatment with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825, whereas cell proliferation was moderately inhibited when these cells transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825. These results reveal that PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 have an important role in the inhibition of CML cell proliferation by the Abl kinase inhibitors.The CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from normal progenitor cells were moderately reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, or BNM354825 (data not shown). In contrast, the CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from CML progenitor cells were significantly reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825 or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA. Moreover the relative expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 mRNA increased in CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E treated with the Abl kinase inhibitors or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA, respectively. In CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA, the inhibition effects of CFU by the Abl kinase inhibitors were weakened. These results indicate that the increased expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 induced by the Abl kinase reduced the committed colony-forming cells derived from CML progenitor cells. These findings indicate that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, resulting in continuously phosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3 and the promotion of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cell proliferation.In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that Bcr-Abl represses the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and that the Abl kinase inhibitors induced both PHLPPs. These induced PHLPPs play an important role in cell growth inhibition in CML cells in vitro.

Furthermore the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A is also functionally inactivated by Bcr-Abl (11Neviani P. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Notari M. Blaser B.W. Liu S. Mao H. Chang J.S. Galietta A.

PP2A is inactivated in blast crisis CML through Bcr-Abl-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of the PP2A inhibitor SET. Hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic PP2A substrate kinases, such as phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), lead to their prolonged activation and ability to drive the survival and proliferative signaling pathway (11Neviani P. Santhanam R. Trotta R. Notari M. Blaser B.W. Liu S. Mao H. Chang J.S. Galietta A. Uttam A. Roy D.C. Valtieri M. Bruner-Klisovic R. Caligiuri M.A. Bloomfield C.D. Marcucci G. Perrotti D.

The inactivation of PP2A is essential for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis and blastic transformation. Another serine/threonine protein phosphatase, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), terminates Akt signaling by dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif on Akt (12Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Brognard J. Newton A.C. Trends Endocrinol.

The PHLPP family of phosphatases includes PHLPP1α (1205 amino acids), PHLPP1β (1717 amino acids), and PHLPP2 (1323 amino acids) (14Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol.

Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 own a pleckstrin homology domain with a region of leucine-rich repeats, a PP2C phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal PDZ ligand (13Brognard J. Newton A.C. Trends Endocrinol.

PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 are present in the cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane fraction of cells and are expressed in cell lines including brain, breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancer cell lines (15Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 decrease activity of Akt and increase apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation through the dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (Ser-473) in Akt. Depletion of either PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 causes a 30-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation after EGF stimulation in a normal breast cell line (22Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Knockdown studies have revealed that PHLPP1 influences the phosphorylation state of Akt2 and Akt3, whereas PHLPP2 affects the phosphorylation state of Akt1 and Akt3. In the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, defective PTEN activates Akt signaling by preventing conversion of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate back to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and contributes to retaining Akt phosphorylation. Nonetheless there are many examples of elevated Akt phosphorylation in cancer cells that have intact PTEN expression. PHLPP levels are markedly reduced in some cancer cell lines that have elevated Akt phosphorylation, and the reintroduction of PHLPP reduces cell growth (23Mendoza M.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, the role of PLHPP remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Bcr-Abl suppressed the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. We analyzed the role of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cell lines and the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients by inhibiting the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. We detected a change in Ser-473 upon Akt phosphorylation with CML-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells exhibiting more Akt phosphorylation than normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. DISCUSSIONWe investigated the role of PHLPP expression on the induction of apoptosis or growth inhibition of CML cells treated with Abl kinase inhibitors. We demonstrated that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and promoted the CML cell progression through continuous phospho-Akt activation.The PI3K/Akt pathway is a central node in determining cellular fate. Hyperactivation or continuous activation of this pathway promotes cell survival, growth, and proliferation (24Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). This pathway is activated in cancer by mechanisms including amplification or gain-of-function mutations in upstream receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (25Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T.

In both K562 and Meg01 cells, the cell proliferation was remarkably inhibited by treatment with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825, whereas cell proliferation was moderately inhibited when these cells transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825. These results reveal that PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 have an important role in the inhibition of CML cell proliferation by the Abl kinase inhibitors.The CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from normal progenitor cells were moderately reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, or BNM354825 (data not shown). In contrast, the CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from CML progenitor cells were significantly reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825 or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA. Moreover the relative expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 mRNA increased in CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E treated with the Abl kinase inhibitors or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA, respectively. In CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA, the inhibition effects of CFU by the Abl kinase inhibitors were weakened. These results indicate that the increased expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 induced by the Abl kinase reduced the committed colony-forming cells derived from CML progenitor cells. These findings indicate that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, resulting in continuously phosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3 and the promotion of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cell proliferation.In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that Bcr-Abl represses the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and that the Abl kinase inhibitors induced both PHLPPs. These induced PHLPPs play an important role in cell growth inhibition in CML cells in vitro. We investigated the role of PHLPP expression on the induction of apoptosis or growth inhibition of CML cells treated with Abl kinase inhibitors. We demonstrated that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and promoted the CML cell progression through continuous phospho-Akt activation. The PI3K/Akt pathway is a central node in determining cellular fate. Hyperactivation or continuous activation of this pathway promotes cell survival, growth, and proliferation (24Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). This pathway is activated in cancer by mechanisms including amplification or gain-of-function mutations in upstream receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (25Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3097) Google Scholar, 26Marx J.L. Science. 1989; 244: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), activating mutations in PI3K and Akt (27Carpten J.D. Faber A.L. Horn C. Donoho G.P. Briggs S.L. Robbins C.M. Hostetter G.

Nature. 2007; 448: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), and loss-of-function mutations in the regulatory phosphatase PTEN (28Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). In addition, PP2A or PHLPPs play key roles in tumorigenesis. Growth factors and cytokines activate PI3K to initiate Akt signaling. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which binds the pleckstrin homology domains of the three Akt isoforms (Akt1, -2, and -3) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, recruiting them to the membrane. The Akt isoforms are activated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylation of their activation loop (Thr-308) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2 phosphorylation of their hydrophobic motif (Ser-473). Akt1 is ubiquitously expressed; controls organism size, adipogenesis, and skeletal muscle differentiation; and inhibits cell motility. The Akt2 expression is elevated in insulin-responsive tissues, such as muscle and liver. Akt2 is required for glucose homeostasis and promotes cell motility. Akt3 expression is more specific to neural tissue and is required for the development to the normal neuronal cell size (29Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Trends. Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 461-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Akt activity is directly repressed by PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 (14Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), which specifically dephosphorylate the hydrophobic motif (Ser-473) of Akt isoforms. This dephosphorylation decreases the activity of Akt isoforms, increases apoptosis, and inhibits cell proliferation. Coimmunoprecipitation studies have shown that an interaction between PHLPP1 and Akt2 or Akt3 influences their phosphorylation state, whereas PHLPP2 affects the phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt3 (13Brognard J. Newton A.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Depletion of PHLPP1 not only increases the phosphorylation state of many Akt substrates (glycogen synthase kinase-3β, tuberin (TSC2), and forkhead box O) but also increases the phosphorylation state of a unique set of Akt substrates including the E3 ligase, HDM2 (human homologue to murine double minute 2), and glycogen synthase kinase-3α (15Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Moreover depletion of PHLPP2 results in increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, TSC2, forkhead box O, and p27Kip1 (15Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 inactivate multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. In the present study, we found that treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors or depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells and that this expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells inhibited their proliferation. The development of Abl kinase inhibitors, such as STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825, has provided a beneficial treatment for CML patients as well as a new tool for studying the effect of inhibition of the Abl kinase activity in cells harboring the endogenous Bcr-Abl gene (30Andreu E.J. Lledo E. Poch E. Ivorra C. Albero M.P. Martinez-Climent J.A. Montiel-Duarte C. Rifon J. Perez-Calvo J. Arbona C. Prosper F. Perez-Roger I. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3264-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In both Bcr-Abl+ cells and primary CML CD34+ cells, STI571 inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity results in a G1 cell cycle arrest mediated by the PI3K pathway. A study that used inhibitors of both Bcr-Abl and PI3K found that the decrease in the p27Kip1 protein levels in Bcr-Abl+ cells is due to regulation at the levels of transcription and degradation by activating the PI3K pathway (31Klejman A. Rushen L. Morrione A. Slupianek A. Skorski T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PI3K signaling pathway is deregulated in many human cancers and is considered an attractive target for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents. The PI3K pathway contributes to transformation by Bcr-Abl, and PI3K inhibitors synergize with Abl kinase inhibitors (imatinib) to greatly increase apoptosis of CML cells from chronic phase and blast crisis patients (22Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). The PI3K effecter most closely associated with cell transformation is Akt, and the substrates of activated Akt regulate the cell cycle, growth, metabolism, and survival. Our study may indicate that Akt isoforms phosphorylated by activated PI3K are maintained by the Bcr-Abl-mediated suppression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells. These mechanisms were clarified by our study. We found that the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 mRNA and protein was increased by Abl kinase inhibitors or depletion of Bcr-Abl expression. Moreover in K562 and Meg01 cells, the three Akt isoforms were constitutively phosphorylated on Ser-473, and the Abl kinase inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3. We also showed that the depletion of PHLPP1 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on AKt2 and Akt3, and the depletion of PHLPP2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on Akt1 and Akt3. We investigated the effects of depletion of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in CML cells. In both K562 and Meg01 cells, the cell proliferation was remarkably inhibited by treatment with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825, whereas cell proliferation was moderately inhibited when these cells transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825. These results reveal that PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 have an important role in the inhibition of CML cell proliferation by the Abl kinase inhibitors. The CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from normal progenitor cells were moderately reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, or BNM354825 (data not shown). In contrast, the CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E derived from CML progenitor cells were significantly reduced when they were treated with STI571, AMN107, and BMS354825 or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA. Moreover the relative expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 mRNA increased in CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E treated with the Abl kinase inhibitors or transfected with Bcr-Abl siRNA, respectively. In CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, and BFU-E transfected with PHLPP1 and/or PHLPP2 siRNA, the inhibition effects of CFU by the Abl kinase inhibitors were weakened. These results indicate that the increased expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 induced by the Abl kinase reduced the committed colony-forming cells derived from CML progenitor cells. These findings indicate that Bcr-Abl inhibited the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, resulting in continuously phosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3 and the promotion of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cell proliferation. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that Bcr-Abl represses the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and that the Abl kinase inhibitors induced both PHLPPs. These induced PHLPPs play an important role in cell growth inhibition in CML cells in vitro.

Allosteric regulation of an intramolecular interaction between the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains of MAGUKs is thought to play a central role in regulating MAGUK function. Here we show that a mutant of the Drosophila MAGUK Discs large (Dlg), dlgsw, encodes a form of Dlg that disrupts the intramolecular association while leaving the SH3 and GK domains intact, providing an excellent model system to assess the role of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction in MAGUK function. Analysis of asymmetric cell division of maternal-zygotic dlgsw embryonic neuroblasts demonstrates that the intramolecular interaction is not required for Dlg localization but is necessary for cell fate determinant segregation to the basal cortex and mitotic spindle alignment with the cortical polarity axis. These defects ultimately result in improper patterning of the embryonic central nervous system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sw mutation of Dlg results in unregulated complex assembly as assessed by GukHolder association with the SH3-GK versus PDZ-SH3-GK modules of Dlgsw. From these studies, we conclude that allosteric regulation of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction is required for regulation of MAGUK function in asymmetric cell division, possibly through regulation of complex assembly.

MAGUKs are concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact (1Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and organize a variety of cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, receptors, ion channels, and associated signaling molecules at specialized regions of the membrane (2Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Protein complex organization by MAGUKs has been thought to occur, at least in part, through allosteric regulation that arises from an intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains. This interaction has been shown to regulate binding of numerous MAGUK ligands in vitro (3Qian Y. Prehoda K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35757-35763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Paarmann I. Spangenberg O. Lavie A. Konrad M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41192-41200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), very little data exists regarding its physiological relevance. Here we investigate the role of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction of Discs large (Dlg), a prototype of the MAGUK superfamily. Loss of dlg activity results in overgrowth of imaginal discs and tumor formation (9Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Dlg localizes to septate and neuromuscular junctions and is essential for establishing and maintaining apicobasal polarity of Drosophila epithelia (10De Lorenzo C. Mechler B.M. Bryant P.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dlg also plays an important role in regulating the process of asymmetric cell division (ACD) (11Peng C.Y. Manning L. Albertson R. Doe C.Q. Nature. 2000; 408: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Ohshiro T. Yagami T. Zhang C. Matsuzaki F. Nature. 2000; 408: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Siegrist S.E. Doe C.Q. Cell. 2005; 123: 1323-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ACD is a mechanism for generating cellular diversity via unequal mitotic divisions of progenitor cells. For instance, in wild-type Drosophila neuroblasts, cell signaling networks interact to allow for asymmetric segregation of basal cell fate determinants, followed by alignment of the mitotic spindle along the apical-basal cortical polarity axis (see Refs. 14Gonczy P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and 15Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) for review). ACD results in the formation of a self-renewing, stem-cell like neuroblast and a smaller ganglion mother cell, which has neuronal or glial fate. In dlg germline clone (dlgGLC) embryonic metaphase neuroblasts, ganglion mother cell fate determinants are not restricted to the basal cortex (11Peng C.Y. Manning L. Albertson R. Doe C.Q. Nature. 2000; 408: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Ohshiro T. Yagami T. Zhang C. Matsuzaki F. Nature. 2000; 408: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and the mitotic spindle does not reliably align with the apical-basal cortical polarity axis (13Siegrist S.E. Doe C.Q. Cell. 2005; 123: 1323-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Defects in neurogenesis have also been observed for dlgGLC embryos (16Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 392-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as well as embryos treated with RNA interference against an alternatively spliced isoform of Dlg (17Mendoza C. Olguin P. Lafferte G. Thomas U. Ebitsch S. Gundelfinger E.D. Kukuljan M. Sierralta J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing evidence for the function of Dlg in neuronal differentiation and axon guidance. Such defects in neurogenesis are thought to be attributed to defective localization of basal cell fate determinants during ACD (17Mendoza C. Olguin P. Lafferte G. Thomas U. Ebitsch S. Gundelfinger E.D. Kukuljan M. Sierralta J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Dlg function is important in a broad range of dynamic cellular processes, the role of the Dlg SH3-GK intramolecular interaction in Dlg activity is poorly understood. One potential role for the SH3-GK intramolecular association is to regulate MAGUK complex assembly. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that mutations disrupting this intramolecular interaction allowed mutant SH3-GK modules to associate with SH3 or GK domains of various MAGUK proteins in trans, providing a mechanism of regulating oligomerization of MAGUKs in vivo (6McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Nix S.L. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Walther Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41192-41200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A role in clustering of ion channels was also observed as mutations that disrupted the intramolecular association, whereas having no effect on association with the potassium channel KV1.4 or homo-oligomerization of PSD-95, resulted in loss of channel clustering in vivo (18Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple in vitro studies support its regulation of binding of protein ligands with the GK domain of MAGUKs: examples include interaction of GK domains of Dlg with GukHolder (GukH) (3Qian Y. Prehoda K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35757-35763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), SAP97 with guanylate kinase-associated protein (4Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and PSD-93 with the microtubule-associated protein 1A (5Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that allosteric modulation of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction is important for regulation of complex assembly, yet little evidence exists that such regulation of MAGUKs is required for their function in vivo. In crystal structures of the SH3-GK module of PSD-95, two β-strands that emerge from the SH3 and GK domains appear to mediate the interaction between the domains (Fig. 1A) (19McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the interaction of these β-strands demonstrate that a COOH-terminal truncation of the strand following the GK domain abrogates the intramolecular association of the SH3-GK module. This 13-amino acid truncation of PSD-95 is comparable with a dlg allele that had previously been identified in a genetic screen, dlgsw (21Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Drosophila containing only the sw form of Dlg (refer to COOH-terminal sequences in Fig. 1B) die in the latter stages of embryonic development due to failure of dorsal closure and terminal defects (21Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this mutation disrupts the intramolecular interaction while leaving the SH3 and GK domains largely intact, making the dlgsw allele an excellent model system for assessing the role of this interaction in MAGUK function. In the studies presented here, we utilized the dlgsw mutant allele to explore the role of the intramolecular interaction in regulating complex assembly and furthermore, to assess the in vivo, physiological significance of this interaction for Dlg function in neuroblast asymmetric cell division. We find that disruption of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction results in unregulated complex assembly. Such a loss in regulated complex assembly results in loss of Dlg function in the process of asymmetric cell division as assessed by localization of cell fate determinants in a dividing neuroblast and alignment of the mitotic spindle along the apical-basal cortical polarity axis, ultimately resulting in defects in neurogenesis. Thus, these data contribute to our understanding of how the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction regulates MAGUK function in formation and regulation of membrane specializations. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification—DNA encoding the G isoform of wild-type (WT) and the sw mutant of Dlg were cloned from cDNA libraries that were created by reverse transcription of mRNAs extracted from yw and dlgsw Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. DNA encoding full-length Cript was cloned from a cDNA library created by reverse transcription of mRNAs extracted from 3T1 Mus musculus cells. For bacterial expression, WT Dlg PDZ-SH3-GK (amino acids 474–975), SH3-GK-(598–975), SH3-(581–681), E-GK-F-(771–975), E-GK-(771–962), and corresponding sw mutant fragments were subcloned and ligated into the pET-19b derivative pBH and/or pGEX vectors. Recombinant His-tagged fusions of Dlg proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and Q-Sepharose anion exchange (Sigma) chromatography. In some instances, these proteins required further purification using HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) chromatography. For bacterial expression, WT Cript was subcloned and ligated into the pET-19b derivative pBH containing an N-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion. Recombinant His-tagged fusions of GFP-Cript required single step purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) chromatography. Purity of recombinantly expressed proteins was judged to be >90% using SDS-PAGE and high pressure liquid chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays and UV absorbance in the presence of 0.1 n NaOH using the extinction coefficient for Trp (22Beaven G.H. Holiday E.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1952; 7: 319-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). For S2 cell expression of a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GukH fragment, the sequence coding for amino acids 800–1044 of the isoform C of GukH was subcloned and ligated into a pMT-/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen). Drosophila embryo-derived Schneider cells (S2 cells) grown in Schneider's insect media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were transiently transfected using 0.8 μg of pMT-HA-(800–1044) GukH DNA and Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Protein expression was induced after 24 h with 0.5 mm CuSO4 and cells were collected 48 h post-induction. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche; 200 μl/transfection) for 30 min on ice. Following incubation, transfected S2 cells were passaged through a 23-guage needle and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. In Vitro Binding Assays—For qualitative in trans GST pull-downs (Fig. 1C), Escherichia coli cell lysates containing the GST fusion protein of interest were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and washed three times with binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100). A His-tagged fusion of the SH3 domain of Dlg was added to a concentration of 25 μm and incubated with the beads at room temperature for 15 min. The reactions were then washed three times with binding buffer to remove unassociated proteins. Bound proteins were eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads by the addition of SDS loading buffer and were screened by Western blot analyses using a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (1:1000; Qiagen). For qualitative GST pull-downs to assess HA-(800–1044) GukH association with Dlg in the absence and presence of GFP-Cript (Fig. 6C), E. coli cell lysates containing GST fusions of WT PDZ-SH3-GK or PDZ-SH3-GKsw were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and then washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, 150 μl of S2 cell extract, containing HA-(800–1044) GukH, was added in the absence or presence of 2.5 or 5 μm GFP-Cript or a GFP-peptide fusion derived from the mushroom body defect protein (GFP-MUDp) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The reactions were then washed three times with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.002% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted using SDS loading buffer and screened by Western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA (1:1000; Covance) and Ponceau stain. Circular Dichroism Scans—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected using a Jasco J-720 CD spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controlled cell holder, using a 1-nm bandpass and scanning from 260 to 190 in 0.5-nm increments. Three scans in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette were recorded and averaged. Spectra were collected in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at 22 °C. Spectra were corrected for contributions from buffer alone by subtraction (23Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity studies of WT PDZ-SH3-GK and PDZ-SH3-GKsw were conducted on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 50,000 × g at 20 °C. Proteins were equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Sedimentation was continuously monitored for 5 h using an absorbance of 280 nm. Sedimentation velocity data were subsequently analyzed using Sedfit (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar, 25Schuck P.

Fly Stocks and Collection of Embryos—Flies of the genotype yw,dlgsw/Basc,y+ were kindly provided by Francois Schweisguth (Ecole Normale Supêrieure, Paris, France). Flies were raised at 18 °C and virgin homozygous yw,dlgsw females, and heterozygous yw,dlgsw/Y males were sorted from flies containing the Basc balancer. These flies were crossed to allow for collection of embryos with no maternal or zygotic contribution of WT Dlg (i.e. dlgsw,m/z). Fixation and Antibody Staining of Drosophila Embryos and Dissociated Neuroblasts—Drosophila embryos were dechorinated by rinsing embryos in bleach solution for 1–2 min and then fixed using a biphasic solution of heptane over 4% formaldehyde in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4) for 25 min. Upon fixation, embryos were blocked in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin. In vitro neuroblast cultures from yw and dlgsw,m/z embryos were prepared using previously published methods (26Grosskortenhaus R. Pearson B.J. Marusich A. Doe C.Q. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were settled onto a coverslip for 30 min and fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Upon fixation, cells were blocked in PBS, 0.1% saponin, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Embryos and dissociated neuroblasts were then stained using various primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (1:500–1:1000; Upstate), mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), mouse anti-γ-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), mouse anti-Dlg 4F3E3 (1:100 (27Parnas D.

Goodman) followed by treatment with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and Invitrogen. Images were collected using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal using a ×63/1.4NA objective. ImageJ, Photoshop, and Illustrator software were used for subsequent data analysis and preparation of figures. Yeast Two-hybrid—For yeast two-hybrid, pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used to monitor association reactions. GUKHolder (amino acids 749–1044) was cloned into the DNA-binding domain vector (pGBKT7), whereas all Dlg constructs were cloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector (pGADT7). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 strain (Clontech) was cotransformed with pGADT7 and pGBKT7 plasmids and plated on SD medium (–Leu/–Trp). Colonies were subsequently screened for interaction by screening for growth on SD medium (–His/–Leu/–Trp + 20 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and for β-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate. The Dlgsw Mutant Selectively Disrupts the SH3-GK Intramolecular Interaction While Leaving the Domains Intact—As alternative splicing and multiple promoters lead to numerous Dlg isoforms (17Mendoza C.

Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we utilized the sw allelle that includes a frameshift mutation near the end of the coding region of the dlg locus to test for the role of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction. Although the truncation of the sequence after the GK domain caused by the frameshift is predicted to disrupt the intramolecular interaction, this has not been confirmed. Furthermore, this mutation could cause domain unfolding. We used in trans, qualitative binding assays of an SH3 domain construct by WT or mutant GK domains to test for the ability of wild-type and mutant proteins to form an intramolecular interaction. This analysis (Fig. 1C) revealed that a GST fusion of the WT GK domain construct that includes the F strand (i.e. E-GK-F) associates with the SH3 domain construct that contains β-strands A-E (i.e. SH3(A-E)), whereas constructs that lack the F strand (i.e. E-GK or E-GK-sw) are unable to associate with the SH3 domain. These results are consistent with previous reports that indicate the role of interaction of E and F β-strands in formation of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction (19McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although the intramolecular interaction is disrupted in Dlgsw, it is possible that the truncation encoded by this allele disrupts the integrity of the SH3 and GK domains. To ensure that the Dlgsw protein is correctly folded, we assessed the overall secondary structure of WT PDZ-SH3-GK and mutant PDZ-SH3-GKsw using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Circular dichroism-monitored wavelength scans (Fig. 1D) indicate that the Dlgsw mutations do not compromise the overall fold of the GK domain, as no significant change in α-helical content (i.e. Δ molar ellipticity at 222 nm) was observed. Dlg is known to oligomerize through a region NH2-terminal to the PDZ1 domain (33Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Marfatia S.M. Byron O. Campbell G. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13759-13770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, intermolecular interactions have also been proposed to occur between MAGUK SH3-GK modules. To determine whether the sw mutation affects the oligomerization state of the SH3 and GK domains, we monitored the oligomerization state of WT PDZ-SH3-GK and mutant PDZ-SH3-GKsw using analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments. Results from these experiments indicate that both the sw and wild-type proteins are monomeric in solution (Fig. 1E). Thus, we conclude that the oligomerization state of Dlg is unlikely to be affected in the context of full-length Dlgsw. This conclusion is also supported by analysis of a PSD-95 mutation, PSD-95ΔC, which lacks the 13 COOH-terminal residues, which does not disrupt its ability to associate with this NH2-terminal multimerization domain (18Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results support the use of Dlgsw as a model for understanding the role of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction in Dlg function, as this mutant specifically disrupts the interaction while leaving the SH3 and GK domains largely intact. Localization of Discs Large and Scribble Are Not Regulated by the SH3-GK Intramolecular Interaction—To assess the role of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction in Dlg function, we examined neuroblasts from dlgsw,m/z embryos (those lacking both maternal and zygotic wild-type dlg activity) for defects in asymmetric cell division. In wild-type embryos, Dlg localizes to the neuroblast cortex with enrichment at the apical region of the cell, and is required for cortical polarization and spindle positioning (11Peng C.Y. Manning L. Albertson R. Doe C.Q. Nature. 2000; 408: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Ohshiro T. Yagami T. Zhang C. Matsuzaki F. Nature. 2000; 408: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Siegrist S.E. Doe C.Q. Cell. 2005; 123: 1323-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We first determined if the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction is required for Dlg targeting by examining Dlgsw protein localization. Localization of Dlg to membrane specializations such as the postsynapse requires interaction of the HOOK domain (see Fig. 1A), as well as the first two PDZ domains of Dlg with cytoskeletal-binding partners (35Thomas U. Ebitsch S. Gorczyca M. Koh Y.H. Hough C.D. Woods D. Gundelfinger E.D. Budnik V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1108-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given the intervening position of the HOOK between the SH3 and GK domains of Dlg we determined whether the localization of Dlg in Drosophila neuroblasts is affected by disruption of the SH3-GK intramolecular interaction. However, as shown in Fig. 2D, localization of Dlgsw is indistinguishable from wild-type (Fig. 2A). We also assessed localization of Scribble (Scrib), which forms a tripartite complex with GukHolder and Dlg (36Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V.

https://openalex.org/W2089668892,"Five species of Metrosideros (Myrtaceae) are recognized in the Hawaiian Islands, including the widespread M. polymorpha, and are characterized by a multitude of distinctive, yet overlapping, habit, ecological, and morphological forms. It remains unclear, despite several previous studies, whether the morphological variation within Hawaiian Metrosideros is due to hybridization, genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, or some combination of these processes. The Hawaiian Metrosideros complex has become a model system to study ecology and evolution; however this is the first study to use microsatellite data for addressing inter-island patterns of variation from across the Hawaiian Islands.Ten nuclear microsatellite loci were genotyped from 143 individuals of Metrosideros. We took advantage of the bi-parental inheritance and rapid mutation rate of these data to examine the validity of the current taxonomy and to investigate whether Metrosideros plants from the same island are more genetically similar than plants that are morphologically similar. The Bayesian algorithm of the program structure was used to define genetic groups within Hawaiian Metrosideros and the closely related taxon M. collina from the Marquesas and Austral Islands. Several standard and nested AMOVAs were conducted to test whether the genetic diversity is structured geographically or taxonomically.The results suggest that Hawaiian Metrosideros have dynamic gene flow, with genetic and morphological diversity structured not simply by geography or taxonomy, but as a result of parallel evolution on islands following rampant island-island dispersal, in addition to ancient chloroplast capture. Results also suggest that the current taxonomy requires major revisions in order to reflect the genetic structure revealed in the microsatellite data."
https://openalex.org/W2014617038,"Background The HapMap samples were collected for medical-genetic studies, but are also widely used in population-genetic and evolutionary investigations. Yet the ascertainment of the samples differs from most population-genetic studies which collect individuals who live in the same local region as their ancestors. What effects could this non-standard ascertainment have on the interpretation of HapMap results? Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the HapMap samples with more conventionally-ascertained samples used in population- and forensic-genetic studies, including the HGDP-CEPH panel, making use of published genome-wide autosomal SNP data and Y-STR haplotypes, as well as producing new Y-STR data. We found that the HapMap samples were representative of their broad geographical regions of ancestry according to all tests applied. The YRI and JPT were indistinguishable from independent samples of Yoruba and Japanese in all ways investigated. However, both the CHB and the CEU were distinguishable from all other HGDP-CEPH populations with autosomal markers, and both showed Y-STR similarities to unusually large numbers of populations, perhaps reflecting their admixed origins. Conclusions/Significance The CHB and JPT are readily distinguished from one another with both autosomal and Y-chromosomal markers, and results obtained after combining them into a single sample should be interpreted with caution. The CEU are better described as being of Western European ancestry than of Northern European ancestry as often reported. Both the CHB and CEU show subtle but detectable signs of admixture. Thus the YRI and JPT samples are well-suited to standard population-genetic studies, but the CHB and CEU less so."
https://openalex.org/W2012221563,"Learning of stimulus sequences is considered as a characteristic feature of episodic memory since it contains not only a particular item but also the experience of preceding and following events. In sensorimotor tasks resembling navigational performance, the serial order of objects is intimately connected with spatial order. Mammals and birds develop episodic(-like) memory in serial spatio-temporal tasks, and the honeybee learns spatio-temporal order when navigating between the nest and a food source. Here I examine the structure of the bees’ memory for a combined spatio-temporal task. I ask whether discrimination and generalization are based solely on simple forms of stimulus-reward learning or whether they require sequential configurations. Animals were trained to fly either left or right in a continuous T-maze. The correct choice was signaled by the sequence of colors (blue, yellow) at four positions in the access arm. If only one of the possible 4 signals is shown (either blue or yellow), the rank order of position salience is 1, 2 and 3 (numbered from T-junction). No learning is found if the signal appears at position 4. If two signals are shown, differences at positions 1 and 2 are learned best, those at position 3 at a low level, and those at position 4 not at all. If three or more signals are shown these results are corroborated. This salience rank order again appeared in transfer tests, but additional configural phenomena emerged. Most of the results can be explained with a simple model based on the assumption that the four positions are equipped with different salience scores and that these add up independently. However, deviations from the model are interpreted by assuming stimulus configuration of sequential patterns. It is concluded that, under the conditions chosen, bees rely most strongly on memories developed during simple forms of associative reward learning, but memories of configural serial patterns contribute, too."

MPL belongs to the homodimeric type I cytokine receptor subfamily, which includes the receptors for erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, growth hormone, and prolactin (6Cosman D.

Instead, their signaling relies on the association with members of the cytoplasmic non-receptor Janus kinase (JAKs) family. TPO stimulation results in phosphorylation of MPL-bound JAKs and the subsequent activation of several downstream pathways, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (8Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt 3rd, V.E. Silvennoinen O. O'Shea J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Besides its function in mediating receptor signaling, JAKs also play an essential role as a chaperone protein for proper receptor cell surface localization (9Royer Y. Staerk J. Costuleanu M.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the EPO or growth hormone receptor dimerizes in the ER in a ligand-independent fashion and before their trafficking to the cell surface (11Gent J. van Kerkhof P.

Receptor signaling occurs at the cell surface after ligand binding and is believed to trigger changes in the dimeric receptor conformation allowing for JAK trans-phosphorylation and activation. Recent reports have suggested that MPL homodimerization, mimicking the ligand-bound state, is sufficient for signal activation. Dimerization was induced by TPO-mimetic peptides (Fab 59, AMG 531, and peg-TPOmp), TPO nonpeptide mimetics (eltrombopag AKR-501), and TPO bivalent agonist antibodies, but also by structural modifications such as the creation of a covalent disulfide bond between two receptor chains or via the fusion of a truncated MPL with FKBP12 and addition of FKBP12 membrane-permeant ligand AP20187 (reviewed in Ref. 13Kuter D.J.

However, there is no evidence that wild type (WT) or naturally occurring active MPL mutants would adopt a dimeric conformation inside the cell.

PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This motif was shown to be crucial for maintaining MPL in an inactive conformation state in the absence of ligand (19Staerk J. Lacout C. Sato T. Smith S.O. Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. Blood. 2006; 107: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These mutations lead to constitutive, ligand-independent activation of MPL signaling and generate a primitive myelofibrosis-like disease when expressed in murine bone marrow cells (18Pikman Y. Lee B.H. Mercher T. McDowell E. Ebert B.L. Gozo M. Cuker A. Wernig G. Moore S. Galinsky I. DeAngelo D.J. Clark J.J. Lee S.J. Golub T.R. Wadleigh M. Gilliland D.G. Levine R.L. PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The most common mutation involves a tryptophan to leucine (W515L) substitution. They are believed to trigger conformational changes in the receptor bringing in close proximity two molecules of bound JAK2 for trans-phosphorylation and signaling. Although it is suggested that the W515L mutation leads to the formation of MPL homodimers, it is worth noting that addition of TPO to MPLW515L-expressing cells has an additive effect on the constitutive signaling mediated by the mutant receptor. Thus, the exact mechanisms underlying the autonomous MPLW515L activation in myeloproliferative disorders remain unclear. In contrast to MPL signaling occurring at the cell surface after TPO binding, MPLW515L activation is not dependent on ligand binding. Therefore, it may be postulated that MPLW515L could signal before reaching the cell surface. This dysregulation might be involved in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders, as reported for activation of the receptor for the platelet-derived growth factor in cancer (20Bejcek B.E. Li D.Y. Deuel T.F. Science. 1989; 245: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or the receptor for the vascular endothelial growth factor in leukemia (21Santos S.C. Dias S. Blood. 2004; 103: 3883-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of such an abnormal intracellular signaling, we engineered a MPLW515L mutant molecule carrying the ER-retention KDEL sequence to prevent its cell surface expression. We expressed the KDEL-harboring or the unmodified MPLW515L receptor in the factor-dependent cell-progenitor 1 (FDC-P1) cell line and isolated cells expressing either the intracellular or the normally processed MPLW515L mutant. Our results demonstrate the strict requirement of receptor cell surface expression for MPLW515L-transforming activity using the FDC-P1 autonomous growth or tumor formation in nude mice as read-out. Moreover, MPLW515L-KDEL associated with JAK2 in the ER without activating the kinase nor the phosphorylation of STAT5, ERK1/2, and AKT signaling molecules. Interestingly, forced dimerization of MPLW515L-KDEL, using covalent disulfide modification, induced autonomous FDC-P1 cell growth and promoted cell surface receptor localization. These results demonstrate that MPLW515L binds to JAK2 in the ER/Golgi compartment in an inactive conformation and suggest that the intracellular receptor mutant is under a monomeric or a non-productive dimeric form. MPLW515L requires cell surface expression for ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of JAK2. Cytokines and Antibodies—Recombinant human TPO (hTPO) was from Stem Cell Technologies (Meylan, France) and murine IL-3 from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK). Conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells was used as a source of IL-3 for culture. The anti-TPO receptor/MPL monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (Millipore, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). The anti-phospho-STAT5 Tyr-694, phospho-JAK2 Tyr-1007/1008, phospho-ERK1/2 Thr-202/Tyr-204, phospho-AKT Thr-308, and anti-JAK2 polyclonal antibodies were all from Cell Signaling Technology (Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). The anti-HA (HA.11) mAb was purchased from Covance (Eurogentec, Angers, France), and mouse anti-β-actin was from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). mAbs were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and polyclonal Abs at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting. Cell Culture—The murine FDC-P1 hematopoietic cell line is dependent for growth upon exogenous factors such as IL-3. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). For retrovirus production, we used the human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line 293EBNA cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 90% confluence and transfected in antibiotic-free medium using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of Plasmids and Production of Retroviruses—The cDNA encoding the human MPLWT was tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence cloned at the N terminus after the signal peptide cleavage site. The sequence coding for the KDEL peptide was fused with MPL C terminus. The human MPL cDNA was mutated at nucleotide 1544 (W515L) or 1206 (S402C) by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method using the PfuUltra high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All constructs were cloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector pMX-IRES-CD4 and verified by sequencing. Viral particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein were produced into 293EBNA cells as previously described (22Lacout C. Pisani D.F. Tulliez M. Gachelin F.M. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2006; 108: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). FDC-P1 cells were infected with concentrated retrovirus supernatants for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and sorted by flow cytometry (FACS Vantage, BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) 48 h later to isolate CD4-positive and either HA-positive or -negative cell populations. Expression of MPL Constructs by FACS and Western Blotting—Surface expression of HA-MPL was analyzed by FACS after incubation of 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl cold phosphate-buffered saline with 10 μl of mouse anti-human CD4 mAb conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC, BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France) and mouse anti-HA mAb conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (PE) (Milteni Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C. Median fluorescence intensities of PE was used for proper quantification. For Western blotting, FDC-P1 cells were directly lysed in Laemmli buffer and boil for 10 min. Proteins extracted from 1.5 × 105 cells were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), washed, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Immunotech, Marseille, France) were then added at a 1:8000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Labeled proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Perbio Science, Brebières, France). Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 2 × 107 cells were harvested and lysed in 900 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 500 μm NaF, 500 μm orthovanadate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). For protein expression, a portion of cleared lysates was mixed with Laemmli buffer. For immunoprecipitation, 800 μl of the lysate was incubated with the anti-HA-specific mAb (20 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) was added to the samples, and the mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, suspended in 45 μl of Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 10 min to release bound proteins. Samples were resolved by Western blotting. Endo H Digestion—5 × 105 MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDEL-expressing FDC-P1 cells were lysed in 100 μl of the above Triton X-100-containing buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS for 20 min on ice and digested or not with Endo H (New England Biolabs, Ozyme) for 18 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling for 10 min. Products were analyzed by Western blotting. Proliferation Assay—MPL-expressing FDC-P1 cell lines were washed and cultured either in the absence of cytokine to assay for cytokine-independent growth or in presence of 10 ng/ml hTPO or 20 ng/ml mIL-3 for 7–10 days. Living cells determined by Trypan blue exclusion were manually counted at the indicated times. Cell Tumorigenicity in Nude Mice—FDC-P1 cells (4 × 106 cells in phosphate-buffered saline) were injected subcutaneously into nude female mice. Five animals were used for the control (FDC-P1) and 10 for the MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDEL groups. After 12 days, tumor nodules were checked, and their sizes were measured with a caliper and expressed for each group as the mean ± S.D. At days 18 and 56, tumors were dissected from 2 mice per group, and cells were mechanically dissociated with a Potter grinder for FACS analysis. Cell Cycle Analysis—FDC-P1 cells expressing MPLW515L, MPLW515L-KDEL, or MPLW515L-S402C-KDEL were washed and deprived of cytokine. After 7, 24, and 48 h in medium with no cytokine, 3 × 105 cells were suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3.4 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 50 μg/ml RNase (Sigma), and 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and kept overnight at 4 °C. Nucleus DNA content was evaluated by FACS. MPLW515L-KDEL Is Retained Intracellularly—To evaluate whether ligand-independent activation of mutant MPLW515L occurs intracellularly, we used the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence KDEL to block the receptor in its processing pathway. Wild-type and mutant MPL cDNAs, modified by addition of a HA tag in the N-terminal extracellular domain, were cloned in a bicistronic retroviral vector that also expressed the human CD4 as a cell surface reporter protein. We generated vectors encoding three different MPL forms: an MPLW515L mutant, a C-terminal KDEL-fused MPLW515L, and a wild-type MPLWT. Murine FDC-P1 cells were infected with each of the three retroviral supernatants. Labeling with the APC-coupled anti-CD4 antibody was used to identify virus-transduced cells and, combined with labeling with the anti-HA-PE antibody, allowed for sorting of cells expressing MPL at the cell surface (CD4-positive/HA-positive) or intracellularly (CD4-positive/HA-negative). Cells infected with the retrovirus encoding MPLWT or MPLW515L expressed MPL at the cell membrane (CD4+/HA+) as detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Cells infected with the retrovirus carrying MPLW515L-KDEL presented two CD4-positive populations, one being HA-negative (CD4+/HA–) and one being HA-positive (CD4+/HA+). These two cell groups were independently sorted. The CD4+/HA+ cells may be the result of a defect in the KDEL retrieval system allowing the MPLW515L-KDEL protein to reach or “leak” to the cell surface (Fig. 1A) and were therefore called MPLW515L-KDELleak. The CD4+/HA-cells, displaying no MPL at the cell surface were simply called MPLW515L-KDEL. The median fluorescence intensities of HA-PE staining demonstrated that both MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDELleak cells expressed similar levels of MPL at the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Total MPL proteins were examined by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C). In general, we detected slightly less MPLWT in our cells than MPLW515L. Expression of MPLW515L-KDEL was clearly detected in the sorted CD4+/HA–FDC-P1 cell population (Fig. 1C), although the mutant protein was not seen at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). Physiologically, MPL undergoes glycosylation in the ER and migrates as a doublet that includes a mature endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-resistant isoform (23Moliterno A.R. Spivak J.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Indeed, MPLWT, MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDELleak cells expressed a major 80 kDa band (Fig. 1C, arrow 2) and a 95 kDa band of weak intensity, especially seen in the MPLW515L-KDELleak cells (arrow 1). The MPLW515L-KDEL cells expressed two bands: the 80 kDa band and a lower size band of 65 kDa (arrow 3). The 80 and 65 kDa isoforms were sensitive to Endo H-treatment, as seen by their shift down in size, and represent maturing ER forms of MPL (Fig. 2). The 95 kDa band was resistant to Endo H and corresponds to the Golgi-processed (cell surface and intracellular mature pools) mature form of MPL. These data show that the KDEL system was efficient in retaining MPL in the ER/Golgi compartments. Furthermore, we confirm that MPL is mainly retained in the ER with only a minor fraction expressed at the cell surface. Intracellular MPLW515L Does Not Support Cytokine-independent Cell Growth—FDC-P1 cells depend upon cytokines such as IL-3 for their growth. FDC-P1 cell populations expressing the various MPL forms were tested for their ability to proliferate in absence of cytokines. As expected, all cell populations proliferated in response to IL-3 stimulation and MPLWT-expressing FDC-P1 cells grew when stimulated with TPO. Moreover, expression of MPLW515L, but not MPLWT, provided autonomous cell proliferation (Fig. 3). The addition of TPO had a small but significant additive effect on the proliferation induced by W515L alone. Interestingly, MPLW515L-KDEL did not support factor-independent cell growth, nor did it render the cells responsive to TPO stimulation. This was not due to a defect in MPLW515L function due to the fusion with the KDEL sequence on its C terminus sequence, because cells in which the retention system was leaking (MPLW515L-KDELleak) grew like the MPLW515L-transduced cells in the absence of cytokines. These data demonstrate that MPLW515L needs to be expressed at the cell surface to promote cell growth. Intracellular MPLW515L Does Not Display Constitutive Signaling—FDC-P1 cells expressing either MPLWT or the MPLW515L were serum- and cytokine-deprived for 4 h before being stimulated or not for 10 min with TPO (Fig. 4A). In non-stimulated condition, we detected by Western blotting a slight phosphorylation of JAK2 and of its downstream effectors STAT5, AKT and ERK solely in MPLW515L-expressing cells. These phosphorylation levels significantly increased following TPO stimulation. Similar levels of phosphorylation were observed after addition of TPO to cells expressing MPLWT. This data are in agreement with the proliferation assay (Fig. 3). Similarly, FDC-P1 cells expressing either MPLW515L or the MPLW515L-KDEL were stimulated or not for 10 min with TPO or IL-3 (Fig. 4B). In contrast to MPLW515L, MPLW515L-KDEL did not activate any of its signalization partners in the absence of stimulation or in the presence of TPO. The addition of IL-3 induced similar phosphorylation levels of JAK2 and its effectors in the three cell lines (Fig. 4B). These results show that MPLW515L activity requests cell surface localization. Intracellular MPLW515L Is Not Tumorigenic in Mice—To assay the tumorigenic potential of MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDEL, FDC-P1 cells expressing each receptor were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Throughout the experiment, none of the mice injected with parental FDC-P1 cells developed any tumor. In contrast, 1 week after injection, 70% of the mice injected with MPLW515L-expressing FDC-P1 cells invariably developed tumors of significant size. Surprisingly, small tumor nodules were seen in 20% of the mice injected with MPLW515L-KDEL-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). At day 56, oversized tumors were seen in all engrafted animals. Tumors were dissected from two mice of each group at days 18 and 56 (Fig. 5B). Cells were dissociated and labeled with anti-CD4-APC and anti-HA-PE antibodies for FACS analysis. CD4-positive cells recovered from tumors generated after injection of MPLW515L-expressing cells showed a significant receptor surface expression (HA labeling) at days 0, 18 and 56. As previously seen, HA-labeling was inexistent in MPLW515L-KDEL cells at day 0. However, cell surface expression of MPLW515L-KDEL became detectable at a low level at day 18 and reached a level similar to MPLW515L in cells isolated from oversized tumors at day 56. These data strongly suggest that MPLW515L must be expressed at the cell surface for its tumorigenic activity. JAK2 Binds Intracellularly to MPLW515L but Without Being Phosphorylated—Next, we investigated whether the absence of transforming activity of MPLW515L-KDEL could be attributed to an absence of JAK2 binding to MPL in the ER. We first verified whether and to what extent MPLWT could bind to JAK2. MPLWT- and MPLW515L-expressing cells were serum- and cytokine-deprived for 4 h before stimulation or not with TPO (Fig. 6A). MPL was immunoprecipitated using the HA tag. In basal and stimulated conditions, JAK2 was associated to both MPLWT and MPLW515L (Fig. 6A, second panel from top). In MPLW515L-expressing cells only we detected a weak phosphorylation of bound JAK2 in non-stimulated conditions (Fig. 6, A and B, top panels). As expected, addition of TPO resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of both MPLWT- and, to a greater extent, MPLW515L-bound JAK2. Similarly, MPLW515L- and MPLW515L-KDEL-expressing cells were stimulated or not with TPO or IL-3 before immunoprecipitating the HA-tag of MPL. Interestingly, results showed that JAK2 was bound to both MPLW515L and MPLW515L-KDEL at a similar extent in basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 6B, second panel from top). Then, we verified the phosphorylation status of the MPL-bound JAK2. Phospho-JAK2 bound to MPLW515L was clearly detected in TPO-stimulated cells and to a lesser extent in non-stimulated or IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 6B, top panel). In contrast, JAK2 bound to MPLW515L-KDEL was not phosphorylated under any condition. These data indicate that JAK2 and MPL associate intracellularly during the ER/Golgi maturation steps and that cell surface localization acquisition is necessary for phosphorylation of JAK2 associated to the MPLW515L mutant receptor. Forced Dimerization of the MPLW515L-KDEL Induced Factor-independent Cell Growth but Also Receptor Cell Surface Expression—Whether MPL homodimerizes in the ER is unknown. It is possible that MPL monomers bind to JAK2 in the ER and that the complex reaches the cell surface before W515L mutation induces dimerization leading to JAK2 autophosphorylation. However, an inactive homodimeric form of the receptor may be generated intracellularly as well. To investigate the role of dimerization in MPLW515L activation, we developed a preformed MPLW515L dimer that could be compared with MPLW515L. As previously obtained with mouse MPL, dimerization was initiated by substituting a Ser with a Cys at position 402 in the membrane-proximal extracellular domain (equivalent of mouse S368C) to force the creation of a covalent disulfide bond. This modification was shown to induce constitutive activity of mouse MPL (25Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We first verified whether it was also the case for human MPLWT-S402C. Firstly, treatment of lysates of cells expressing MPLWT-S402C with β-mercaptoethanol reduced species from a dimeric to a monomeric size on a Western blot probed with the anti-HA mAb, indicating the formation of 20.3% (ImageJ software, NIH, USA) of MPLWT dimers as a result of the S402C mutation (Fig. 7A). Secondly, we observed no major difference in cell surface expression of MPLWT-S402C compare with MPLWT by FACS analysis (Fig. 7B). Finally, the human MPLWT-S402C mutant was found to allow autonomous cell growth (Fig. 7C). Similarly, the S402C substitution induced dimerization of 4.1% of MPLW515L and 7.9% MPLW515L-KDEL (Fig. 8A). MPLW515L-KDEL- and MPLW515L-S402C-KDEL-expressing cells were sorted for retention of the receptors in the ER, as shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 8B), and tested for autonomous growth. Surprisingly, while MPLW515L-KDEL-expressing cells died within 3 days in the absence of cytokine, MPLW515L-S402C-KDEL-expressing cells grew in the same condition (Fig. 8C). However, FACS analysis revealed that the factor-independent MPLW515L-S402C-KDEL-expressing cells expressed the mutant receptor at the cell surface at low level at day 3 but significant level at day 7 (Fig. 8D). The cumulative cell numbers for MPLW515L-S402C-KDEL, in the absence of cytokine, were plotted on a linear scale between day 0 and day 3 (Fig. 8E) and demonstrated active cell proliferation rather than solely cell survival. These data show that the S402C d"
