https://openalex.org/W2100606224,"Circuits based on organic semiconductors are being actively explored for flexible, transparent and low-cost electronic applications. But to realize such applications, the charge carrier mobilities of solution-processed organic semiconductors must be improved. For inorganic semiconductors, a general method of increasing charge carrier mobility is to introduce strain within the crystal lattice. Here we describe a solution-processing technique for organic semiconductors in which lattice strain is used to increase charge carrier mobilities by introducing greater electron orbital overlap between the component molecules. For organic semiconductors, the spacing between cofacially stacked, conjugated backbones (the π-π stacking distance) greatly influences electron orbital overlap and therefore mobility. Using our method to incrementally introduce lattice strain, we alter the π-π stacking distance of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) from 3.33 Å to 3.08 Å. We believe that 3.08 Å is the shortest π-π stacking distance that has been achieved in an organic semiconductor crystal lattice (although a π-π distance of 3.04 Å has been achieved through intramolecular bonding). The positive charge carrier (hole) mobility in TIPS-pentacene transistors increased from 0.8 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for unstrained films to a high mobility of 4.6 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for a strained film. Using solution processing to modify molecular packing through lattice strain should aid the development of high-performance, low-cost organic semiconducting devices."

The optical equivalent, however, has been difficult to realize owing to the time-reversal symmetry of Maxwell's equations that describe electromagnetic propagation. Usually, a control input in the form of a magnetic field is required that breaks that symmetry. Such inputs are not practical for optical integrated circuits. Fan et al. (p. 447 , published online 22 December) developed a silicon-based microresonator device that could control the asymmetric transmission of light through it. The passive optical diode was compatible with current complementary metal-oxide semiconductor processing technology and thus should be readily integrated into optoelectronic circuitry."

https://openalex.org/W1975715632,"Most riboswitches are metabolite-binding RNA structures located in bacterial messenger RNAs where they control gene expression. We have discovered a riboswitch class in many bacterial and archaeal species whose members are selectively triggered by fluoride but reject other small anions, including chloride. These fluoride riboswitches activate expression of genes that encode putative fluoride transporters, enzymes that are known to be inhibited by fluoride, and additional proteins of unknown function. Our findings indicate that most organisms are naturally exposed to toxic levels of fluoride and that many species use fluoride-sensing RNAs to control the expression of proteins that alleviate the deleterious effects of this anion."

https://openalex.org/W1972390388,"A continuous record of hydrologic variability for the past 17,000 years at the mouth of the Zambezi River shows that hydrologic conditions in southeast Africa were controlled by variations in local insolation and migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, rather than by Indian Ocean temperature. Records of hydroclimatological variability in southern Africa since the last glacial maximum have produced a conflicting picture of the relative influences of events in the remote Northern Hemisphere and the more local Indian Ocean. This paper presents a continuous record of hydrological variability for the past 17,000 years from marine sediment core drilled off the mouth of the Zambezi River. The record shows that hydrological conditions in the region were influenced by variations in local insolation and migrations of the intertropical convergence zone, which were probably driven by events in the Northern Hemisphere rather than the Indian Ocean. Intense debate persists about the climatic mechanisms governing hydrologic changes in tropical and subtropical southeast Africa since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago. In particular, the relative importance of atmospheric and oceanic processes is not firmly established1,2,3,4,5. Southward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude climate changes have been suggested as a primary forcing2,3, whereas other studies infer a predominant influence of Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures on regional rainfall changes4,5. To address this question, a continuous record representing an integrated signal of regional climate variability is required, but has until now been missing. Here we show that remote atmospheric forcing by cold events in the northern high latitudes appears to have been the main driver of hydro-climatology in southeast Africa during rapid climate changes over the past 17,000 years. Our results are based on a reconstruction of precipitation and river discharge changes, as recorded in a marine sediment core off the mouth of the Zambezi River, near the southern boundary of the modern seasonal ITCZ migration. Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures did not exert a primary control over southeast African hydrologic variability. Instead, phases of high precipitation and terrestrial discharge occurred when the ITCZ was forced southwards during Northern Hemisphere cold events, such as Heinrich stadial 1 (around 16,000 years ago) and the Younger Dryas (around 12,000 years ago), or when local summer insolation was high in the late Holocene, that is, during the past 4,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2029273393,"The models and simulation tools available to design functionally complex synthetic biological devices are very limited. We formulated a design-driven approach that used mechanistic modeling and kinetic RNA folding simulations to engineer RNA-regulated genetic devices that control gene expression. Ribozyme and metabolite-controlled, aptazyme-regulated expression devices with quantitatively predictable functions were assembled from components characterized in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The models and design strategy were verified by constructing 28 Escherichia coli expression devices that gave excellent quantitative agreement between the predicted and measured gene expression levels (r = 0.94). These technologies were applied to engineer RNA-regulated controls in metabolic pathways. More broadly, we provide a framework for studying RNA functions and illustrate the potential for the use of biochemical and biophysical modeling to develop biological design methods."

https://openalex.org/W2085796844,"Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Mammalian DOT1L participates in the regulation of transcription, development, erythropoiesis, differentiation, and proliferation of normal cells. However, the role of DOT1L in cancer cell proliferation has not been fully elucidated. DOT1L siRNA-transfected A549 or NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells displayed a nonproliferating multinucleated phenotype. DOT1L-deficient cells also showed abnormal mitotic spindle formation and centrosome number, suggesting that DOT1L deficiency leads to chromosomal missegregation. This chromosomal instability in DOT1L-deficient cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase and induced senescence as determined by enhanced activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Meanwhile, overexpression of a catalytically active DOT1L, not an inactive mutant, restored DOT1L siRNA-induced phenotypes. Overall, these data imply that down-regulation of DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation disturbs proliferation of human cells. In addition, although H3K79 methylation is down-regulated in aged tissues, it is up-regulated in lung cancer cell lines and tumor tissues of lung cancer patients. Therefore, H3K79 methylation is a critical histone modification that regulates cell proliferation and would be a novel histone mark for aging and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031142206,"In eukaryotes, it is unknown whether mismatch repair (MMR) is temporally coupled to DNA replication and how strand-specific MMR is directed. We fused Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH6 with cyclins to restrict the availability of the Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex to either S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The Msh6-S cyclin fusion was proficient for suppressing mutations at three loci that replicate at mid-S phase, whereas the Msh6-G2/M cyclin fusion was defective. However, the Msh6-G2/M cyclin fusion was functional for MMR at a very late-replicating region of the genome. In contrast, the heteroduplex rejection function of MMR during recombination was partially functional during both S phase and G2/M phase. These results indicate a temporal coupling of MMR, but not heteroduplex rejection, to DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2161929921,"Interaction blockade occurs when strong interactions in a confined, few-body system prevent a particle from occupying an otherwise accessible quantum state. Blockade phenomena reveal the underlying granular nature of quantum systems and allow for the detection and manipulation of the constituent particles, be they electrons, spins, atoms or photons. Applications include single-electron transistors based on electronic Coulomb blockade and quantum logic gates in Rydberg atoms. Here we report a form of interaction blockade that occurs when transferring ultracold atoms between orbitals in an optical lattice. We call this orbital excitation blockade (OEB). In this system, atoms at the same lattice site undergo coherent collisions described by a contact interaction whose strength depends strongly on the orbital wavefunctions of the atoms. We induce coherent orbital excitations by modulating the lattice depth, and observe staircase-like excitation behaviour as we cross the interaction-split resonances by tuning the modulation frequency. As an application of OEB, we demonstrate algorithmic cooling of quantum gases: a sequence of reversible OEB-based quantum operations isolates the entropy in one part of the system and then an irreversible step removes the entropy from the gas. This technique may make it possible to cool quantum gases to have the ultralow entropies required for quantum simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. In addition, the close analogy between OEB and dipole blockade in Rydberg atoms provides a plan for the implementation of two-quantum-bit gates in a quantum computing architecture with natural scalability."

https://openalex.org/W1986995819,"Several groups of tetrapods have expanded sesamoid (small, tendon-anchoring) bones into digit-like structures (""predigits""), such as pandas' ""thumbs."" Elephants similarly have expanded structures in the fat pads of their fore- and hindfeet, but for three centuries these have been overlooked as mere cartilaginous curiosities. We show that these are indeed massive sesamoids that employ a patchy mode of ossification of a massive cartilaginous precursor and that the predigits act functionally like digits. Further, we reveal clear osteological correlates of predigit joint articulation with the carpals/tarsals that are visible in fossils. Our survey shows that basal proboscideans were relatively ""flat-footed"" (plantigrade), whereas early elephantiforms evolved the more derived ""tip-toed"" (subunguligrade) morphology, including the predigits and fat pad, of extant elephants. Thus, elephants co-opted sesamoid bones into a role as false digits and used them for support as they changed their foot posture."

https://openalex.org/W2020631826,"Slc26a2 is a ubiquitously expressed SO42− transporter with high expression levels in cartilage and several epithelia. Mutations in SLC26A2 are associated with diastrophic dysplasia. The mechanism by which Slc26a2 transports SO42− and the ion gradients that mediate SO42− uptake are poorly understood. We report here that Slc26a2 functions as an SO42−/2OH−, SO42−/2Cl−, and SO42−/OH−/Cl− exchanger, depending on the Cl− and OH− gradients. At inward Cl− and outward pH gradients (high Cl−o and low pHo) Slc26a2 functions primarily as an SO42−o/2OH−i exchanger. At low Cl−o and high pHo Slc26a2 functions increasingly as an SO42−o/2Cl−i exchanger. The reverse is observed for SO42−i/2OH−o and SO42−i/2Cl−o exchange. Slc26a2 also exchanges Cl− for I−, Br−, and NO3− and Cl−o competes with SO42− on the transport site. Interestingly, Slc26a2 is regulated by an extracellular anion site, required to activate SO42−i/2OH−o exchange. Slc26a2 can transport oxalate in exchange for OH− and/or Cl− with properties similar to SO42− transport. Modeling of the Slc26a2 transmembrane domain (TMD) structure identified a conserved extracellular sequence 367GFXXP371 between TMD7 and TMD8 close to the conserved Glu417 in the permeation pathway. Mutation of Glu417 eliminated transport by Slc26a2, whereas mutation of Phe368 increased the affinity for SO42−o 8-fold while reducing the affinity for Cl−o 2 fold, but without affecting regulation by Cl−o. These findings clarify the mechanism of net SO42− transport and describe a novel regulation of Slc26a2 by an extracellular anion binding site and should help in further understanding aberrant SLC26A2 function in diastrophic dysplasia.

https://openalex.org/W2020702642,"The observed weakness of Mercury's magnetic field poses a long-standing puzzle to dynamo theory. Using numerical dynamo simulations, we show that it could be explained by a negative feedback between the magnetospheric and the internal magnetic fields. Without feedback, a small internal field was amplified by the dynamo process up to Earth-like values. With feedback, the field strength saturated at a much lower level, compatible with the observations at Mercury. The classical saturation mechanism via the Lorentz force was replaced by the external field impact. The resulting surface field was dominated by uneven harmonic components. This will allow the feedback model to be distinguished from other models once a more accurate field model is constructed from MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) and BepiColombo data."
https://openalex.org/W2079969349,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across bacterial and plant thylakoid membranes. Most current models for the translocation mechanism propose the coalescence of a substrate-binding TatABC complex with a separate TatA complex. In Escherichia coli, TatA complexes are widely believed to form the translocation pore, and the size variation of TatA has been linked to the transport of differently sized substrates. Here, we show that the TatA paralog TatE can substitute for TatA and support translocation of Tat substrates including AmiA, AmiC, and TorA. However, TatE is found as much smaller, discrete complexes. Gel filtration and blue native electrophoresis suggest sizes between ∼50 and 110 kDa, and single-particle processing of electron micrographs gives size estimates of 70-90 kDa. Three-dimensional models of the two principal TatE complexes show estimated diameters of 6-8 nm and potential clefts or channels of up to 2.5 nm diameter. The ability of TatE to support translocation of the 90-kDa TorA protein suggests alternative translocation models in which single TatA/E complexes do not contribute the bulk of the translocation channel. The homogeneity of both the TatABC and the TatE complexes further suggests that a discrete Tat translocase can translocate a variety of substrates, presumably through the use of a flexible channel. The presence and possible significance of double- or triple-ring TatE forms is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2084374380,"Several intracellular pathogens have developed diverse strategies to avoid targeting to lysosomes. However, they universally recruit lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1); the mechanism of LAMP1 recruitment remains unclear. Here, we report that a Salmonella effector protein, SipC, specifically binds with host Syntaxin6 through its C terminus and thereby recruits Syntaxin6 and other accessory molecules like VAMP2, Rab6, and Rab8 on Salmonella-containing phagosomes (SCP) and acquires LAMP1 by fusing with LAMP1-containing Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, sipC knock-out:SCP (sipC(-):SCP) or sipC(M398K):SCP fails to obtain significant amounts of Syntaxin6 and is unable to acquire LAMP1. Moreover, phagosomes containing respective knock-out Salmonella like sipA(-), sipB(-), sipD(-), sopB(-), or sopE(-) recruit LAMP1, demonstrating the specificity of SipC in this process. In addition, depletion of Syntaxin6 by shRNA in macrophages significantly inhibits LAMP1 recruitment on SCP. Additionally, survival of sipC(-):Salmonella in mice is found to be significantly inhibited in comparison with WT:Salmonella. Our results reveal a novel mechanism showing how Salmonella acquires LAMP1 through a SipC-Syntaxin6-mediated interaction probably to stabilize their niche in macrophages and also suggest that similar modalities might be used by other intracellular pathogens to recruit LAMP1."

The measured active-export time through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is 18 ms, remarkably similar to the previously determined active-import rate.
