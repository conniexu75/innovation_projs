https://openalex.org/W2055704529,"Two new pulsating radio sources, designated NP 0527 and NP 0532, were found near the Crab Nebula and could be coincident with it. Both sources are sporadic, and no periodicities are evident. The pulse dispersions indicate that 1.58 +/- 0.03 and 1.74 +/- 0.02 x 10(20) electrons per square centimeter lie in the direction of NP 0527 and NP 0532, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1993042396,The first extensive measurements by remote-sensing correlation spectrometry of the sulfur dioxide emitted by volcanic plumes indicate that on the order of 103 metric tons of sulfur dioxide gas enter the atmosphere daily from Central American volcanoes. Extrapolation gives a minimum estimate of the annual amount of sulfur dioxide emitted from the world's volcanoes of about 107 metric tons.
https://openalex.org/W1975999917,A bonded pair of hamadryas baboons developed cooperative tool use without training. The male could get food with the tool but first had to get the tool from an adjoining cage which he could not enter. The female learned to give him the tool. Cooperation was temporarily disrupted by the terminal phase of the female's estrous inflation.
https://openalex.org/W1981724307,"Examination of the organic matter in some modern and fossil oolites has shown that it contains protein, with a high content of acidic amino acids. Artificial oolites from a water-processing plant contained no amino acids. The protein matrix may influence the formation of natural oolites by concentrating calcium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2092181858,"Kodiak Seamount and Giacomini Guyot have been dated at 22.6 +/- 1.1 and 19.9 +/- 1.0 [2sigma (standard deviation)] x 10(6) years, respectively. Concordant whole-rock and plagioclase potassium-argon dates and fission-track apatite ages demonstrate that significant quantities of excess radiogenic (40)Ar are not present in the dated samples. These seamounts are the northwesternmost edifices of the Pratt-Welker chain, which cuts obliquely across magnetic anomaly patterns in an older northeastern Pacific sea floor. The older of the two dated seamounts is in the Aleutian Trench, apparently about to be subducted. If one assumes that seamounts are generated by plate motion over a fixed hot spot in the mantle, a Pacific-plate motion of 6.6 centimeters per year during early Miocene time may be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2071115600,"The travel times of compressional waves from quarry explosions of well-known origin times, measured at the University of California network of seismographic stations for the period 1961 to the present, have been examined for evidence of premonitory changes prior to earthquakes of moderate magnitudes in the region. Velocities to seven station sites are generally constant to within +/- 1 percent, with occasional deviations of +/- 2 percent. Variations seem to bear no correlation to earthquake occurrence and are probably due to a combination of reading errors and changes in the source location within the quarry."
https://openalex.org/W2058117598,"Horizon beta is a subbottom reflector in the North Atlantic deep ocean sediments that extends over a large portion of the North America basin. Cores from an outcrop of beta contained shallow-water Aptian-Albian sediments and deep-water Cenomanian sediments. A core near an outcrop of a deeper horizon, horizon B, contained shallow-water Lower Cretaceous (Barremian-Hauterivian) sediments. These cores can be interpreted to support extensive subsidence of the eastern portion of the basin in early Cretaceous time. It is equally likely that the shallow-water deposits are a result of sediments slumping into an already deep basin. A reconciliation of these interpretations depends upon the JOIDES project."
https://openalex.org/W2078863878,"Palynology was used for dating a pre-Pleistocene deep-sea organic lutite layer situated stratigraphically near seismic horizon beta, below horizon A. The spores and pollen are closely identified, quantitatively, with nonmarine and marine Middle Cretaceous assemblages (Albian-Cenomanian) on the continents, an age designation that is confirmed by the occurrence of dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, foraminifers, and coccoliths in the investigated cores. The abundance of these well-preserved, land-derived assemblages in an area far removed from a source suggests some tectonic displacement since their deposition."

https://openalex.org/W2035242090,"The surface regions of polyethylene nucleated and crystallized in contact with both a high-energy surface (gold) and a low-energy surface (fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer Teflon) have been examined by means of glancing-angle electron-diffraction techniques. Examination of these surfaces has been confined to a maximum depth of 120 angstroms. The surface region of the polyethylene generated in contact with the gold is considerably more crystalline than the surface generated in contact with the fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer Teflon. These results tend to corroborate recent wettability and infrared studies. Apparently, the surface structure of polyethylene is highly dependent upon the method of preparation."
