https://openalex.org/W4212813338,"Fungal communities (the mycobiota) are an integral part of the gut microbiota, and the disruption of their integrity contributes to local and gut-distal pathologies. Yet, the mechanisms by which intestinal fungi promote homeostasis remain unclear. We characterized the mycobiota biogeography along the gastrointestinal tract and identified a subset of fungi associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice and humans. Mucosa-associated fungi (MAF) reinforced intestinal epithelial function and protected mice against intestinal injury and bacterial infection. Notably, intestinal colonization with a defined consortium of MAF promoted social behavior in mice. The gut-local effects on barrier function were dependent on IL-22 production by CD4+ T helper cells, whereas the effects on social behavior were mediated through IL-17R-dependent signaling in neurons. Thus, the spatial organization of the gut mycobiota is associated with host-protective immunity and epithelial barrier function and might be a driver of the neuroimmune modulation of mouse behavior through complementary Type 17 immune mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4213217070,"Dynamic fibroblast to myofibroblast state transitions underlie the heart's fibrotic response. Because transcriptome maturation by muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) promotes differentiated cell states, this study investigated whether tactical control of MBNL1 activity could alter myofibroblast activity and fibrotic outcomes. In healthy mice, cardiac fibroblast-specific overexpression of MBNL1 transitioned the fibroblast transcriptome to that of a myofibroblast and after injury promoted myocyte remodeling and scar maturation. Both fibroblast- and myofibroblast-specific loss of MBNL1 limited scar production and stabilization, which was ascribed to negligible myofibroblast activity. The combination of MBNL1 deletion and injury caused quiescent fibroblasts to expand and adopt features of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells, whereas transgenic MBNL1 expression blocked fibroblast proliferation and drove the population into a mature myofibroblast state. These data suggest MBNL1 is a post-transcriptional switch, controlling fibroblast state plasticity during cardiac wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W4213359145,"Despite their widespread use in research, there has not yet been a systematic genomic analysis of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines at a single-nucleotide resolution. We therefore performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 143 hESC lines and annotated their single-nucleotide and structural genetic variants. We found that while a substantial fraction of hESC lines contained large deleterious structural variants, finer-scale structural and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are ascertainable only through WGS analyses were present in hESC genomes and human blood-derived genomes at similar frequencies. Moreover, WGS allowed us to identify SNVs associated with cancer and other diseases that could alter cellular phenotypes and compromise the safety of hESC-derived cellular products transplanted into humans. As a resource to enable reproducible hESC research and safer translation, we provide a user-friendly WGS data portal and a data-driven scheme for cell line maintenance and selection."
https://openalex.org/W4213077816,"Path planning plays an essential role in mobile robot navigation, and the A* algorithm is one of the best-known path planning algorithms. However, the traditional A* algorithm has some limitations, such as slow planning speed, close to obstacles. In this paper, we propose an improved A*-based algorithm, called the EBS-A* algorithm, that introduces expansion distance, bidirectional search, and smoothing into path planning. The expansion distance means keeping an extra space from obstacles to improve path reliability by avoiding collisions. Bidirectional search is a strategy searching path from the start node and the goal node simultaneously. Smoothing improves path robustness by reducing the number of right-angle turns. In addition, simulation tests for the EBS-A* algorithm are performed, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by transferring it to a robot operating system (ROS). The experimental results show that compared with the traditional A* algorithm, the proposed algorithm improves the path planning efficiency by 278% and reduces the number of critical nodes by 91.89% and the number of right-angle turns by 100%."
https://openalex.org/W4213266487,"Presynaptic active zones are molecular machines that control neurotransmitter secretion. They form sites for vesicle docking and priming and couple vesicles to Ca2+ entry for release triggering. The complexity of active zone machinery has made it challenging to determine its mechanisms in release. Simultaneous knockout of the active zone proteins RIM and ELKS disrupts active zone assembly, abolishes vesicle docking, and impairs release. We here rebuild docking, priming, and Ca2+ secretion coupling in these mutants without reinstating active zone networks. Re-expression of RIM zinc fingers recruited Munc13 to undocked vesicles and rendered the vesicles release competent. Action potential triggering of release was reconstituted by docking these primed vesicles to Ca2+ channels through attaching RIM zinc fingers to CaVβ4-subunits. Our work identifies an 80-kDa β4-Zn protein that bypasses the need for megadalton-sized secretory machines, establishes that fusion competence and docking are mechanistically separable, and defines RIM zinc finger-Munc13 complexes as hubs for active zone function."

In these challenging times nursing students, facing academic and psychological issues, are advised to use augmented reality applications in the field of health sciences for increasing their motivations and academic performances. The main motive of the study was to examine the acceptance status of nursing students in implementing augmented reality technology in their education and training. The study is a quantitative research study, and it uses the causal-comparative screening method. The data used in the study was collected online from 419 nursing students. The hybrid method was preferred. First, the hypotheses based on the linear relationships were defined between the variables which were then tested by the method of structural equation modeling. Second, the method of artificial neural networks was used to determine the non-linear relationships between the variables. The results show that the nursing students have a high intention of using augmented reality technology as a way of self-learning. It was also found that the most emphasized motive behind this intention is the expectation that using augmented reality technology will increase their academic performance. They also think that AR technology has many potential benefits to offer in the future. It was observed that a considerable number of students already use augmented reality technology for its usefulness and with a hedonic motivation. In conclusion, nursing students have a high acceptance of using augmented reality technology during their education and training process. Since we live in a world where e-learning and self-learning education/training have become widespread, it is estimated that students will demand augmented reality applications as a part of holistic education, and as an alternative to traditional textbooks."
https://openalex.org/W4213343209,"Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) is a new type of regulatory RNA. LncRNA HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), as an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is one of the key determinants of tumor progression. However, its possible molecular mechanism and the immunomodulatory pathway involved in NSCLC are still unclear. This study aims to explore whether HOTAIR promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of the NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 22 (CCL22). We collected 30 clinical samples of cancer and adjacent normal tissues from the patients with NSCLC, using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the LncRNA HOTAIR and CCL22 mRNA expression in tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of CCL22 in cancer and adjacent normal tissues. Cell experiments were conducted to verify that LncRNA HOTAIR regulates the expression of CCL22 and participates in the progress of NSCLC. The antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) probe interfering with LncRNA HOTAIR and the interference fragment of CCL22 (si-CCL22) were constructed. A549 cells were co-transfected with ASO-HOTAIR and si-CCL22. We used RT-qPCR to detect the expression of LncRNA HOTAIR and CCL22 mRNA in the cells, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used to detect the CCL22 protein level in the cell supernatant. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay was applied to detect cell proliferation, the Flow cytometry to detect cell apoptosis. Finally, the Transwell test was utilized to detect cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, this study suggests that HOTAIR may promote proliferation, migration and invasion of the NSCLC cells by inhibiting CCL22 expression, which may play a key role in NSCLC cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4213219238,"A pressure ulcer is an injury of the skin and underlying tissues adjacent to a bony eminence. Patients who suffer from this disease may have difficulty accessing medical care. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this situation. Automatic diagnosis based on machine learning (ML) brings promising solutions. Traditional ML requires complicated preprocessing steps for feature extraction. Its clinical applications are thus limited to particular datasets. Deep learning (DL), which extracts features from convolution layers, can embrace larger datasets that might be deliberately excluded in traditional algorithms. However, DL requires large sets of domain specific labeled data for training. Labeling various tissues of pressure ulcers is a challenge even for experienced plastic surgeons. We propose a superpixel-assisted, region-based method of labeling images for tissue classification. The boundary-based method is applied to create a dataset for wound and re-epithelialization (re-ep) segmentation. Five popular DL models (U-Net, DeeplabV3, PsPNet, FPN, and Mask R-CNN) with encoder (ResNet-101) were trained on the two datasets. A total of 2836 images of pressure ulcers were labeled for tissue classification, while 2893 images were labeled for wound and re-ep segmentation. All five models had satisfactory results. DeeplabV3 had the best performance on both tasks with a precision of 0.9915, recall of 0.9915 and accuracy of 0.9957 on the tissue classification; and a precision of 0.9888, recall of 0.9887 and accuracy of 0.9925 on the wound and re-ep segmentation task. Combining segmentation results with clinical data, our algorithm can detect the signs of wound healing, monitor the progress of healing, estimate the wound size, and suggest the need for surgical debridement."
https://openalex.org/W4212916084,"CRC mortality rates are higher for individuals with a lower socioeconomic status (SES). Screening could influence health inequalities. We therefore aimed to investigate SES differences in participation and diagnostic yield of FIT screening.All invitees in 2014 and 2015 in the Dutch national CRC screening programme were included in the analyses. We used area SES as a measure for SES and divided invitees into quintiles, with Quintile 1 being the highest SES. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare the participation rate, positivity rate, colonoscopy uptake, positive predictive value (PPV) and detection rate across the SES groups.Participation to FIT screening was significantly lower for Quintile 5 (67.0%) compared to the other Quintiles (73.0% to 75.1%; adjusted OR quintile 5 versus quintile 1: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.72-0.74), as well as colonoscopy uptake after a positive FIT (adjusted OR 0.73, 95%CI: 0.69-0.77). The detection rate per FIT participant for advanced neoplasia gradually increased from 3.3% in Quintile 1 to 4.0% in Quintile 5 (adjusted OR 1.20%, 95%CI 1.16-1.24). As a result of lower participation, the yield per invitee was similar for Quintile 5 (2.04%) and Quintile 1 (2.00%), both being lower than Quintiles 2 to 4 (2.20%-2.28%).Screening has the potential to reduce health inequalities in CRC mortality, because of a higher detection in participants with a lower SES. However, in the Dutch screening programme, this is currently offset by the lower participation in this group."
https://openalex.org/W4213030813,"Organized into a global network of critical infrastructures, the oil & gas industry remains to this day the main energy contributor to the world's economy. Severe accidents occasionally occur resulting in fatalities and disruption. We build an oil & gas accident graph based on more than a thousand severe accidents for the period 1970-2016 recorded for refineries, tankers, and gas networks in the authoritative ENergy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD). We explore the distribution of potential chains-of-events leading to severe accidents by combining graph theory, Markov analysis and catastrophe dynamics. Using centrality measures, we first verify that human error is consistently the main source of accidents and that explosion, fire, toxic release, and element rupture are the principal sinks, but also the main catalysts for accident amplification. Second, we quantify the space of possible chains-of-events using the concept of fundamental matrix and rank them by defining a likelihood-based importance measure γ. We find that chains of up to five events can play a significant role in severe accidents, consisting of feedback loops of the aforementioned events but also of secondary events not directly identifiable from graph topology and yet participating in the most likely chains-of-events."
https://openalex.org/W4212798169,"The unprecedented experience of national lockdowns and uncertainty of academic career due to the COVID-19 pandemic has multifaceted impacts on mental health among university students worldwide. This study determined its impact on depression and anxiety level, and associated risk factors among engineering students studying at College of Science and Technology (CST), Phuentsholing, Bhutan during the first lockdown in the country. Self-reported depression and anxiety levels were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) respectively. Data was collected using an e-questionnaire link generated in Google form and the link was shared with students via the student's official email group. A total of 278 students (response rate, 26.9%) completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents were male (69.8%) and were aged from 18 to 30 (Mean: 21.7 ±SD 2.07) years. The prevalence of self-reported moderate to severe depression and anxiety were 44.2% (95% CI, 38.5-49.6) and 27.3% (95% CI, 22.3-32.4) respectively. Participants having their family members as frontline workers reported a significantly higher level of anxiety (χ2 = 4.85, p = 0.028). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, students who were academically lagging showed a higher risk of depression (AOR = 5.36, 95% CI = 2.86-10.04) and anxiety (AOR = 3.83, 95%CI = 1.86-7.88) as compared to students who were not academically behind. A high percentage of depression and anxiety was reported by students of CST during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from the study highlight the importance of adopting appropriate online-based teaching and learning methods to ensure timely academic and professional achievements. Moreover, the relevant stakeholders should put health system strategies in place to provide psychological support to university students during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4212813730,"Disease caused by Pepper yellow leaf curl virus (PepYLCV) is one of the greatest threats to pepper (Capsicum spp.) cultivation in the tropics and subtropics. Resistance to PepYLCV was previously identified in a few Capsicum accessions, but no resistance QTLs have been mapped. This study aimed to elucidate the genetics of PepYLCV resistance in C. annuum L. Augmented inoculation by the viruliferous whitefly Bemisia tabaci was used to evaluate parental lines and an F2 segregating population derived from a cross between resistant C. annuum line LP97 and susceptible C. annuum line ECW30R. Final evaluation was performed six weeks after inoculation using a standardized 5-point scale (0 = no symptoms to 4 = very severe symptoms). A high-density linkage map was constructed using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with PepYLCV resistance in the F2 population. QTL analysis revealed three QTLs, peplcv-1, peplcv-7, and peplcv-12, on chromosomes P1, P7, and P12, respectively. Candidate genes associated with PepYLCV resistance in the QTL regions were inferred. In addition, single markers Chr7-LCV-7 and Chr12-LCV-12 derived from the QTLs were developed and validated in another F2 population and in commercial varieties. This work thus provides not only information for mapping PepYLCV resistance loci in pepper but also forms the basis for future molecular analysis of genes involved in PepYLCV resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4212881458,"Telomeres are protein-DNA complexes that protect the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Mammalian telomeric DNA consists of 5′-(TTAGGG)n-3′ double-stranded repeats, followed by up to several hundred bases of a 3′ single-stranded G-rich overhang. The G-rich overhang is bound by the shelterin component POT1 which interacts with TPP1, the component involved in telomerase recruitment. A previously published crystal structure of the POT1 N-terminal half bound to the high affinity telomeric ligand 5′-TTAGGGTTAG-3′ showed that the first six nucleotides, TTAGGG , are bound by the OB1 fold, while the adjacent OB2 binds the last four, TTAG . Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of full-length POT1 bound by the POT1-binding domain of TPP1. The structures differ in the relative orientation of the POT1 OB1 and OB2, suggesting that these two DNA-binding OB folds take up alternative conformations. Supporting DNA binding studies using telomeric ligands in which the OB1 and OB2 binding sites were spaced apart, show that POT1 binds with similar affinities to spaced or contiguous binding sites, suggesting plasticity in DNA binding and a role for the alternative conformations observed. A likely explanation is that the structural flexibility of POT1 enhances binding to the tandemly arranged telomeric repeats and hence increases telomere protection."
https://openalex.org/W4212908825,"This study was aimed at determining the median days of calving to conception interval (days open) and identifying the major risk factors determining the days open in dairy cows. Both retrospective and longitudinal studies were conducted on dairy cows located in the Dessie and Kombolcha towns of South Wollo Zone, northeast Ethiopia from August 2019 to August 2020. The Kaplan-Meier model of survival analysis was used to determine the median days open and compare the survival distribution of each level of explanatory variables likely to influence the days open of dairy cows. Accordingly, the overall conception rate of dairy cows was 44.7%. The median days open in the study was 154 days. There is a 16% probability of surviving (i.e, the probability that the conception event has not yet occurred) at the end of 210 days postpartum period. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to quantify the effect of each of the explanatory variables on the days open in the first 210 days postpartum. Factors that had a significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on the calving to conception interval were the season of insemination, breeding system, calving to insemination interval, and herd milk yield level. However, the peripartum, postpartum disorders, and the town of the farm are not significant (p&gt;0.05). Accordingly, cows inseminated in the autumn season (HR = 4.45), cows less than or equal to 85 days calving to insemination interval (HR = 2.41), artificially inseminated cows (HR = 1.45), and high herd milk yield cow had a higher probability of becoming pregnant. In conclusion, the management practices and breeding decisions seem to be important determinants to improve the conception rate or decrease the days open in dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W4213135430,"Background In 2021, the International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (ISPRM) special interest group on sarcopenia included the quadriceps thickness assessed with ultrasound image as an indicator of muscle mass in the diagnosis criteria of sarcopenia. If quadriceps echo intensity of older inpatients is to be a strong predictor of quadriceps thickness, muscle quality of the quadriceps may be estimated by the muscle mass when diagnosing sarcopenia using the criteria of ISPRM. Objective This study aimed to examine the association between muscle mass and fraction of intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps in older inpatients. Methods This cross-sectional study included 399 inpatients aged ≥ 65 years. Primary outcomes were muscle mass and fraction of intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps. Images were acquired using a B-mode ultrasound. Muscle mass and fraction of intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps were assessed based on the muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. A multiple regression analysis (forced entry method) was performed to confirm whether quadriceps echo intensity was related to quadriceps thickness even after adjusting for other factors. Results In the multiple regression analyses for both male and female models, quadriceps echo intensity (male: β = − 0.537, p &lt; 0.001; female: β = − 0.438, p &lt; 0.001), Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (male: β = 0.236, p &lt; 0.001; female: β = 0.213, p &lt; 0.001), and subcutaneous fat thickness of the thigh (male: β = 0.197, p &lt; 0.001; female: β = 0.248, p &lt; 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with quadriceps thickness. Conclusions Our results show that there is a negative and significant association between muscle mass and fraction of intramuscular adipose tissue in older inpatients. Muscle quality of the quadriceps in older inpatients may be estimated to some extent by the muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W4212880336,"Introduction Healthy lifestyle practices including physical activity, healthy diets, non-smoking, reduced alcohol consumption and stress reduction are important in the prevention of metabollic CVD risk factors such as hypertension, overweight and obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia. Owing to current lifestyle changes, the increasing burden of CVD and importance of healthy behaviours, the need for strategies to increase uptake of healthy lifestyles among sub-Saharan African populations are apparent. This study explored the factors influencing uptake of healthy lifestyle practices among adults following implementation of a community CVD prevention programme. Methods This was a descriptive qualitative study conducted among purposively selected adults who had engaged in a community CVD prevention programme. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Study transcripts were read into NVIVO 12.6 software for coding and analysis guided by thematic analysis following the semantic approach. Results This study found variations in uptake of healthy lifestyle practices for CVD prevention with most changes reported for dietary behaviour especially in vegetable and fruit intake, reduction of salt intake and fats and oils consumption. Changes in physical activity were also notable. On the other hand, participants were slow in making changes in alcohol consumption, smoking behaviours and stress reduction. The barriers to uptake of healthy lifestyle practices were individual such as limited capability or skills, structural such as limited physical activity facilities, and social such as cultural and peer influence. Relatedly, the facilitators of practices uptake were individual including knowledge and personal determination to change, and social including social support from family and the community. Conclusions Insights from understanding the uptake of lifestyle practices should guide planning and design of community programmes with an emphasis on removing barriers and strengthening facilitators building on the intermediate motivating factors and considering individual needs and expectations."

The prevalence of PI episodes was 6% and the cumulative incidence was 2.9% during the first-wave of COVID-19. Risk of acute wounds was four times higher in the COVID-19 patient group (p<0.001). Most common locations were sacrum and heels. Among hospital acquired pressure injuries a significant association was observed between arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis.During the first wave of COVID-19, COVID-19 patients tend to present a higher number of acute wounds, mainly of hospital origin, compared to the profile of the non-COVID group.

https://openalex.org/W4213083250,"There is limited information on the efficacy of pioglitazone in diabetic kidney diseases (DKD). We evaluated whether pioglitazone exerts renal-protective effects in DKD patients. We designed a retrospective cohort study, which included 742 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with DKD in Taiwan, with eGFR between 30 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR level 300–5000 mg/g. Patients not meeting the target range for HbA1c (above 7%) were given additional medication with pioglitazone (n = 111) or received standard care (non-pioglitazone group, n = 631). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of composite renal endpoints, which was defined as sustained eGFR&lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (confirmed by two measurements within 90 days); doubling of serum creatinine (compared to baseline); and the presence of hemodialysis or renal transplantation. The median follow-up duration was two years. At baseline, the mean HbA1C levels in the pioglitazone and non-pioglitazone groups were 8.8% and 8.1%, respectively; mean ages were 64.4 and 66.2 years old, respectively; diabetes durations were 14.3 and 12.3 years, respectively. Baseline eGFR showed no significant difference between the pioglitazone and non-pioglitazone groups (55.8 and 58.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively). In terms of gender, 63% of patients were male in the pioglitazone group compared with 57% in the non-pioglitazone group. Pioglitazone use did not reduce the risk of composite renal endpoints in DKD patients (HR: 0.97, 95% CI = 0.53–1.77), including persistent eGFR&lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.46–2.52), doubling of serum creatinine (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.53–1.77), or ESRD (HR = 2.58, 95% CI = 0.29–23.04). The results were not changed after various adjustments. A non-significant albuminuria reduction was also noted after pioglitazone prescription in DKD patients. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the effects of pioglitazone definitively."
https://openalex.org/W4225863717,"The pig skin architecture and physiology are similar to those of humans. Thus, the pig model is very valuable for studying skin biology and testing therapeutics. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows quantitatively analyzing cell types, compositions, states, signaling, and receptor-ligand interactome at single-cell resolution and at high throughput. scRNA-seq has been used to study mouse and human skins. However, studying pig skin with scRNA-seq is still rare. A critical step for successful scRNA-seq is to obtain high-quality single cells from the pig skin tissue. Here we report a robust method for isolating and cryopreserving pig skin single cells for scRNA-seq. We showed that pig skin could be efficiently dissociated into single cells with high cell viability using the Miltenyi Human Whole Skin Dissociation kit and the Miltenyi gentleMACS Dissociator. Furthermore, the obtained single cells could be cryopreserved using 90% FBS + 10% DMSO without causing additional cell death, cell aggregation, or changes in gene expression profiles. Using the developed protocol, we were able to identify all the major skin cell types. The protocol and results from this study are valuable for the skin research scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W4212874703,"Jumping performance is one of the key components of volleyball game, thus evaluating jumping ability through different biomechanical variables offers opportunity for performance optimization. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between reactive strength index (RSI), reactive strength index modified (RSI mod ) and approach jump performance in male volleyball players. Forty volleyball players performed drop jump (DJ) form 40 cm high box, bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps (CMJ) and approach jump. RSI in DJ was calculated as the ratio between jump height and ground contact time, while the RSI in CMJ tasks (RSI mod ) was calculated as ratio between jump height and jump time. Our results indicate that the relationships among different RSI variants and approach jump in volleyball players are moderate to strong (r = 0.42–0.73), with the highest correlations being observed for RSI mod from bilateral CMJ (r = 0.676–0.727). Those observations are in line with the principle of movement specificity, which suggests that the best performance indicator should be the task that best resembles the demands of the sport-specific movements. Further research is needed to reveal more about the potential of implementing these findings for training optimization through monitoring RSI and RSI mod values."
https://openalex.org/W4213008001,"Despite research and public scrutiny over recent decades, discarding continues to be an issue for trawl fisheries. Previous research demonstrates that environmental, biological, operational, legislative and socioeconomic drivers affect a fisher’s decision to discard an organism. Therefore, the reduction of fishery discards requires a better understanding of fishery-specific drivers. Despite considerable research and mitigation, further work is required to reduce discarding to acceptable levels (currently ~ 50% in Australia). To better understand the drivers of discarding, this study used a modelling approach to determine environmental and operational factors that drive discarding in the New South Wales (NSW) ocean prawn trawl fishery (OPT). Further, the study investigated the relationship between the discarded number of individuals from all functional species groups (i.e. elasmobranchs, crustaceans and fish combined) and the retained catch weight. This model was also run on just fish partly due to their disproportionally high contribution to the discard assemblage (e.g. 76% of all species or higher taxon) and importance (e.g. to the ecosystem and fisheries). The results quantified relationships of environmental and operational drivers of discarding and the relationship of fish discarding and retained catch weight was found to be linear. However, the identified relationships appear complicated and, whilst an important first step, more work is required to identify all drivers influencing discarding practices. We, in combination with previous research, suggest implementation of effort quotas may be a suitable management initiative to reduce discarding and its impact; at least whilst more research is conducted to better understand this complex process. Furthering our understanding of discarding is urgent given its global impact and the rate of discarding in the OPT."
https://openalex.org/W4213182627,"Neonatal seizures have been associated with increased mortality and impaired neurodevelopment and, knowledge about risk factors may be useful for prevention. Clear associations have been established between labor-related risk factors and seizures in asphyxiated neonates. However, there is limited information about why some vigorous term-born infants experience seizures.Our aim was to assess antepartum and intrapartum risk factors for seizures in vigorous term-born neonates.This was a national cohort study of singleton infants born at term in Sweden from 2009-2015. Vigorous was defined as an Apgar score of at least 7 at 5 and 10 minutes. Data on the mothers and infants were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register. A diagnosis of neonatal seizures was the main outcome measure and the exposures were pregnancy and labor variables. Logistic regression analysis was used and the results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).The incidence of neonatal seizures was 0.81/1,000 for 656 088 births. Seizures were strongly associated with obstetric emergencies (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4), intrapartum fever and/or chorioamnionitis (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.1-5.3), and intrapartum fetal distress (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4-3.7). Other associated intrapartum factors were: labor dystocia, occiput posterior position, operative vaginal delivery, and Cesarean delivery. Some maternal factors more than doubled the risk: a body mass of more than 40 (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.8), hypertensive disorders (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.1) and diabetes mellitus (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7-4.1).A number of intrapartum factors were associated with an increased risk of seizures in vigorous term-born neonates. Obstetric emergencies, intrapartum fever and/or chorioamnionitis and fetal distress were the strongest associated risks. The presence of such factors, despite a reassuring Apgar score could prompt close surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4213196911,"The transition from compensated to decompensated liver cirrhosis is a hallmark of disease progression, however, reliable predictors to assess the risk of decompensation in individual patients from routine diagnostics are lacking. Here, we characterize serum levels of cell death-associated markers and routine biochemistry from patients with chronic liver disease with and without decompensation.A post-hoc analysis was based on prospectively collected clinical data from 160 patients with chronic liver disease, stably compensated or decompensated at baseline or during follow-up, over a median period of 721 days. Serum levels of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and routine biochemistry are quantified at baseline (for all patients) and during follow-up (for patients with acute decompensation). The panel of DAMPs assessed in this study comprises high-mobility group-box protein 1 (HMGB1), cytochrome C (cyt C), soluble Fas-ligand (sFasL), interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble cytokeratin-18 (CK18-M65) and its caspase-cleaved fragment CK18-M30.In this cohort study, 80 patients (50%) were diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, 60 patients (37.5%) with hepatitis C virus- and 20 patients (13.5%) with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis. At baseline, 17 patients (10.6%) showed decompensated liver disease and another 28 patients (17.5%) developed acute decompensation during follow-up (within 24 months). One hundred fifteen patients showed stable liver disease (71.9%). We found DAMPs significantly elevated in patients with decompensated liver disease versus compensated liver disease. Patients with acute decompensation during follow-up showed higher baseline levels of IL-6, sFasL, CK18-M65 and-M30 (P<0.01) compared to patients with stably compensated liver disease. In multivariate analyses, we found an independent association of baseline serum levels of sFasL (P = 0.02; OR = 2.67) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (P<0.001; OR = 2.1) with acute decompensation. Accuracy of the marker combination for predicting acute decompensation was high (AUC = 0.79). Elevated aminotransferase levels did not correlate with decompensated liver disease and acute decompensation.DAMPs are elevated in patients with decompensated liver disease and patients developing acute decompensation. The prognostic value of a marker combination with soluble Fas-ligand and GGT in patients with liver cirrhosis should be further evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W4212941698,"Maternal undernutrition is one of the most common causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Severe undernutrition among mothers leads to reduced lactation performance which further contributes to an increased risk of infant mortality. However, data regarding nutritional status of lactating mothers at Dessie town and its surrounding areas is lacking. This study assessed dietary diversity, nutritional status and associated factors of lactating mothers visiting health facilities at Dessie town, Amhara region, Ethiopia.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April, 2017 among 408 lactating mothers. Systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Data on socio-demographic and economic characteristics, health related characteristics, dietary diversity and food security status of participants were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI-INFO and analyzed using SPSS Version 22. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with dietary diversity and nutritional status of lactating mothers.More than half (55.6%) of lactating mothers had inadequate dietary diversity (DDS<5.3) and about 21% were undernourished (BMI<18.5 kg/m2). Household monthly income [AOR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.15, 3.65)], type of house [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI (1.15, 2.94)], nutrition information [AOR = 1.6, 95% CI (1.05, 2.61)] and household food insecurity [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI (1.05, 3.06)] were factors associated with dietary diversity of lactating mothers. Being young in age 15-19 years [AOR = 10.3, 95% CI (2.89, 36.39)] & 20-29 years [AOR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.57, 7.36)], being divorced/separated [AOR = 10.1, 95% CI (1.42, 72.06)], inadequate dietary diversity [AOR = 3.8, 95% CI (2.08, 7.03)] and household food insecurity [AOR = 3.1, 95% CI (1.81, 5.32)] were factors associated with maternal undernutrition.The dietary diversity of lactating mothers in the study area was sub optimal and the prevalence of undernutrition was relatively high. Public health nutrition interventions such as improving accessibility of affordable and diversified nutrient rich foods are important to improve the nutritional status of mothers and their children in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W4212946749,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease that escalates the risk of other associated complications such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a microvascular condition that leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are several genes involved in disease development and it is a challenging task to investigate all of these. Nonetheless, identifying individual gene roles can assist in evaluating the combinatorial effects with other genes. Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the key regulator of blood pressure in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that hydrolyzes angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) into angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilator). The association of different variants of the ACE2 with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been determined in various populations with susceptibility to other complications. This study was aimed to investigate the association of Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme 2 polymorphism, G8790A, with the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development with the complication of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in the Pakistani population.In this case-control study, a total of 100 healthy controls and 100 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus aged > 40 years, having disease duration ≥ 10 years were compared. The G8790A polymorphism in ACE2 was analyzed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). The urinary albumin excretion (UAE), urinary creatinine, and albumin to creatinine ratios (ACR) were determined to assess renal function status. Pearson bivariate correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationship among all the parameters. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were found to determine any risk association between ACE2 G8790A polymorphisms and disease development. The p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.A homogeneity was obtained regarding the distribution of data by sex, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and urinary creatinine levels between case and control groups. The ACR showed a significant correlation with UAE (r = 0.524, p = 0.001), urinary creatinine (r = -0.375, p = 0.001) and random blood sugar levels (r = 0.323, p = 0.005) with the complication of diabetic nephropathy in T2DM patient. Females with the AA genotype had a 10-fold increased risk for the development of type 2 Diabetes (OR = 9.5 [95% CI = 2.00-21.63] p<0.002). Males having A allele showed a significant association for susceptibility of type 2 Diabetes (OR = 3.807 [95% CI = 1.657-8.747] p<0.002). However, none of the genotypes or alleles revealed an association for diabetic nephropathy in male and female patients. Urinary ACR was also found to be positively correlated with UAE (r = 0.642 p = 0.001 & 0.524, p = 0.001) and random blood sugar levels (r = 0.302, p = 0.002 & r = 0.323, p = 0.005) in T2DM and T2DM+DN groups, respectively.The study finding indicated that female AG/AA genotype and male A genotype of G8790A polymorphism in the ACE2 gene were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus as a genetic risk factor but are not associated with diabetic nephropathy in the Pakistani population."
https://openalex.org/W4212988636,"Tilting is a poker-related phenomenon that involves cognitive and emotional dysregulation in response to unfavourable gambling outcomes. Tilting is characterised by an increase in irrational, impulsive and strategically weak betting decisions. This study aimed to adapt and investigate the concept of tilting amongst sport bettors in order to provide preliminary insight regarding previously unexplored instances of maladaptive sports betting. The sample consisted of 225 sports bettors who completed an online questionnaire that investigated their reported tilting episodes, awareness of tilting, impulsivity, perceived skill, gambling severity, gambling frequency, and product preferences. Cluster analyses revealed three distinct groups of sports bettors based on their reported tilting episodes and their awareness of this phenomenon. The first group were labelled 'Conscious tilters' due to being cognizant of their own tilting occurrence which was significantly higher than the other two groups. These 'Conscious tilters' had the highest mean problem gambling severity that was indicative of the 'problem gambler' categorisation. The second group were labelled 'Unconscious tilters' due to their underestimation of their own tilting occurrence and were categorised as 'moderate risk gamblers'. The third group were labelled 'Non-tilters' due to a relatively accurate perception of their low to non-existent tilting occurrence and were categorised as 'low-risk gamblers'. Additionally, there were significant differences between these groups in relation to reported gambling frequency, impulsivity, and product preferences. There is evidence of various classifications of 'tilters' within sports betting. Specific sports betting product features may also facilitate tilting and therefore require further research in this context. It is important for this research area to develop in order to mitigate harms associated with the rapidly changing sport betting environment."
https://openalex.org/W4213054010,"Objectives Previous studies on T2* and T2 relaxation time of the muscles have shown that exercise leads to an initial increase, presumably representing different intramuscular physiological processes such as increase in intracellular volume or blood oxygenation level dependent effects with a subsequent decrease after cessation of exercise. Their behaviour during prolonged exercise is still unknown but could provide important information for example about the pathophysiology of overuse injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the temporal course of T2* and T2 relaxation time in extrinsic foot muscles during prolonged exercise and determine the optimal mapping technique. Methods Ten participants had to run a total of 75 minutes at their individual highest possible running speed, with interleaved MR scans at baseline and after 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 45 and 75 minutes. The examined extrinsic foot muscles were manually segmented, and relaxation time were analysed regarding its respective time course. Results T2* and T2 relaxation time showed an initial increase, followed by a plateau phase between 2.5 and 15 minutes and a subsequent decrease. For the T2* relaxation time, this pattern was also apparent, but less pronounced, with more muscles not reaching significance (p&lt;0.05) when comparing different time points. Conclusions T2* and T2 relaxation time showed a similar course with an initial rapid increase, a plateau phase and a subsequent decrease under prolonged exercise. Moderate but long-term muscular activity appears to have a weaker effect on T2* relaxation time than on T2 relaxation time."
https://openalex.org/W4213071966,"Observers are better at discriminating upright bodies than inverted bodies, and this body inversion effect (BIE) is reliable with whole figures (bodies with heads), but not with bodies presented without heads or the heads occluded suggesting that heads may be key to BIEs. Some studies present whole figures and bodies without heads between groups, and BIEs are not found for bodies without heads [1]. Other studies present whole figures and bodies without heads in the same blocks and BIEs are found with bodies without heads [2]. Does seeing the heads of whole figures induce BIEs in bodies without heads? Here, participants discriminated bodies with either whole figures and bodies without heads presented within blocks, or in separate blocks with bodies without heads presented first. We tested body identity and posture discrimination and measured participants' gaze. BIEs were found with whole figures and bodies without heads in both identity and posture discrimination, and in both study designs. However, efficiency scores were better for the whole figures than the bodies without heads, but only when whole figures appeared in separate blocks. The magnitude of the BIE was overall stronger for whole figures compared to bodies without heads, but only in identity discrimination. BIE magnitudes were similar in the identity and posture tasks. Participants were better at identity discrimination, yet, there was greater looking at heads and less at bodies. During posture discrimination, greater looking at bodies and less at heads was associated with better performance. Faces might influence BIEs but are not essential. Configural representations of bodies without heads are sufficient for BIEs in posture and identity discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W4213230024,"East African highland banana (Musa acuminata genome group AAA-EA; hereafter referred to as banana) is critical for Uganda's food supply, hence our aim to map current distribution and to understand changes in banana production areas over the past five decades. We collected banana presence/absence data through an online survey based on high-resolution satellite images and coupled this data with independent covariates as inputs for ensemble machine learning prediction of current banana distribution. We assessed geographic shifts of production areas using spatially explicit differences between the 1958 and 2016 banana distribution maps. The biophysical factors associated with banana spatial distribution and geographic shift were determined using a logistic regression model and classification and regression tree, respectively. Ensemble models were superior (AUC = 0.895; 0.907) compared to their constituent algorithms trained with 12 and 17 covariates, respectively: random forests (AUC = 0.883; 0.901), gradient boosting machines (AUC = 0.878; 0.903), and neural networks (AUC = 0.870; 0.890). The logistic regression model (AUC = 0.879) performance was similar to that for the ensemble model and its constituent algorithms. In 2016, banana cultivation was concentrated in the western (44%) and central (36%) regions, while only a small proportion was in the eastern (18%) and northern (2%) regions. About 60% of increased cultivation since 1958 was in the western region; 50% of decreased cultivation in the eastern region; and 44% of continued cultivation in the central region. Soil organic carbon, soil pH, annual precipitation, slope gradient, bulk density and blue reflectance were associated with increased banana cultivation while precipitation seasonality and mean annual temperature were associated with decreased banana cultivation over the past 50 years. The maps of spatial distribution and geographic shift of banana can support targeting of context-specific intensification options and policy advocacy to avert agriculture driven environmental degradation."

By establishing a correspondence between an evolutionary game and Markov chain dynamics, we show that results obtained from the fundamental matrix method in Markov chain dynamics are equivalent to corresponding ones in the evolutionary game. In the conventional fundamental matrix method, quantities like fixation probability and fixation time are calculable. Using a theorem in the fundamental matrix method, conditional fixation time in the absorbing Markov chain is calculable. Also, in the ergodic Markov chain, the stationary probability distribution that describes the Markov chain's stationary state is calculable analytically. Finally, the Rock, scissor, paper evolutionary game are evaluated as an example, and the results of the analytical method and simulations are compared. Using this analytical method saves time and computational facility compared to prevalent simulation methods."

Potential strategies range from maintaining the current OAC to changing the substance class. We have queried the specific treatment standards on German stroke units (SUs).By means of a standardized online questionnaire via SurveyMonkey™ (San Mateo, CA, USA), all clinical heads of German SUs were asked about their treatment standards in the following clinical situations: first AIS of an OAC-naïve AF patient, AF patient with AIS despite administration of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), AF patient with AIS despite administration of direct OAC (DOAC). In addition, the performance of specific coagulation tests in AF patients with AIS despite OAC was queried.160 (48%) clinical heads of German SU responded. Data from pivotal trials (84%), own experience with substances (71%), and side-effect profiles (66%) determine the initial DOAC prescription. In case of an AIS despite OAC, 83 and 18% would switch from VKA to DOAC under certain conditions and always, respectively. Half of respondents would switch from DOAC to VKA under certain conditions, while the other half would decline. 96% would switch to an alternative DOAC. The vast majority of those who made preconditions considered concomitant diseases (92, 90, and 81%, respectively). Few would consider infarct pattern (<35%). 61% perform initial coagulation tests (only one-third substance-specific assessments); however, the majority do not use these to make further decisions.In the setting of an OAC-naïve AF patient with AIS, established pivotal data are most respected. In the unclear setting of an AIS despite OAC, most respondents consider concomitant diseases and give preference to switching to a (different) DOAC."
https://openalex.org/W4212851423,"Medical personnel may find it challenging to distinguish severe Exertional Heat Illness (EHI), with attendant risks of organ-injury and longer-term sequalae, from lesser forms of incapacity associated with strenuous physical exertion. Early evidence for injury at point-of-incapacity could aid the development and application of targeted interventions to improve outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether biomarker surrogates for end-organ damage sampled at point-of-care (POC) could discriminate EHI versus successful marathon performance.Eight runners diagnosed as EHI cases upon reception to medical treatment facilities and 30 successful finishers of the same cool weather marathon (ambient temperature 8 rising to 12 ºC) were recruited. Emerging clinical markers associated with injury affecting the brain (neuron specific enolase, NSE; S100 calcium-binding protein B, S100β) and renal system (cystatin C, cysC; kidney-injury molecule-1, KIM-1; neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL), plus copeptin as a surrogate for fluid-regulatory stress, were sampled in blood upon marathon collapse/completion, as well as beforehand at rest (successful finishers only).Versus successful finishers, EHI showed significantly higher NSE (10.33 [6.37, 20.00] vs. 3.17 [2.71, 3.92] ug.L-1, P<0.0001), cysC (1.48 [1.10, 1.67] vs. 1.10 [0.95, 1.21] mg.L-1, P = 0.0092) and copeptin (339.4 [77.0, 943] vs. 18.7 [7.1, 67.9] pmol.L-1, P = 0.0050). Discrimination of EHI by ROC (Area-Under-the-Curve) showed performance that was outstanding for NSE (0.97, P<0.0001) and excellent for copeptin (AUC = 0.83, P = 0.0066).As novel biomarker candidates for EHI outcomes in cool-weather endurance exercise, early elevations in NSE and copeptin provided sufficient discrimination to suggest utility at point-of-incapacity. Further investigation is warranted in patients exposed to greater thermal insult, followed up over a more extended period."
https://openalex.org/W4212882181,"Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a common extrarenal complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which causes compression-related syndrome and ultimately leads to liver dysfunction. Tolvaptan, a V2 receptor antagonist, is widely used to protect kidney function in ADPKD but its effect on PLD remains unknown. An observational cohort study was conducted to evaluate tolvaptan's effect on patients with PLD due to ADPKD. After screening 902 patients, we found the 107 ADPKD patients with PLD who met the criteria of tolvaptan use in Japan. Among them, tolvaptan was prescribed for 62 patients (tolvaptan group), while the other was defined as the non-tolvaptan group. Compared with the non-tolvaptan group, the tolvaptan group had larger height-adjusted total kidney volume (median 994(range 450-4152) mL/m, 513 (405-1928) mL/m, p = 0.01), lower albumin level (mean 3.9±SD 0.4 g/dL, 4.3±0.4g/dL, p<0.01), and higher serum creatinine level (1.2±0.4 mg/dL, 0.9±0.2 mg/dL, p<0.01). Although the median change in annual growth rate of total liver volume (TLV) was not statistically different between the tolvaptan group (-0.8 (-15.9, 16.7) %/year) and the non-tolvaptan group (1.7 (-15.6-18.7) %/year)(p = 0.52), 20 (43.5%) patients in the tolvaptan group experienced a decrease in the growth rate of TLV (responders). A multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for related variables showed that older age (odds ratio 1.15 [95% CI 1.01-1.32]) and a higher growth rate of TLV in the non-tolvaptan period (odds 1.45 95% CI 1.10-1.90) were significantly associated with responders. In conclusion, the change in annual growth rate of TLV in ADPKD patients taking tolvaptan was not statistically different compared with that in ADPKD patients without taking tolvaptan. However, tolvaptan may have the potential to suppress the growth rate of TLV in some PLD patients due to ADPKD, especially in older patients or those that are rapid progressors of PLD. Several limitations were included in this study, therefore well-designed prospective studies were required to confirm the effect of tolvaptan on PLD."

It is a four-kilometer-long cordoned-off strip from the Indo-Pak international border to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur located in Pakistan. The basic purpose of establishing this corridor is to give easy access to the Indian Sikh community. The initiative was taken into account in August 2018, which resulted in the appearance of a vast quantity of contemplations in the national print media of both countries, especially until the opening of the corridor in November 2019. Print media plays a key role in building knowledge and framing the general public’s opinion through interpreting an issue. The data were taken from Dawn , The News International (Pakistan), The Times of India , and Hindustan Times (India) from August 2018 to March 2020 using Lexus Nexus Library. The corpus analysis was carried out by applying the lexical study of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through its Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) tool to find out the general patterns or topics in the print media of both countries. It was found that Pakistani print media terms the Kartarpur corridor as a sign of regional peace, religious tourism, mediation, and diplomatic efforts. In contrast, Indian print media focuses on apprehensions related to traveling modalities, pilgrimage facilities, and tensions between the two states."
https://openalex.org/W4212767290,"Structural factors can influence hospital costs beyond case-mix differences. However, accepted measures on how to distinguish hospitals with regard to cost-related organizational and regional differences are lacking in Switzerland. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and assess a comprehensive set of hospital attributes in relation to average case-mix adjusted costs of hospitals. Using detailed hospital and patient-level data enriched with regional information, we derived a list of 23 cost predictors, examined how they are associated with costs, each other, and with different hospital types, and identified principal components within them. Our results showed that attributes describing size, complexity, and teaching-intensity of hospitals (number of beds, discharges, departments, and rate of residents) were positively related to costs and showed the largest values in university (i.e., academic teaching) and central general hospitals. Attributes related to rarity and financial risk of patient mix (ratio of rare DRGs, ratio of children, and expected loss potential based on DRG mix) were positively associated with costs and showed the largest values in children's and university hospitals. Attributes characterizing the provision of essential healthcare functions in the service area (ratio of emergency/ ambulance admissions, admissions during weekends/ nights, and admissions from nursing homes) were positively related to costs and showed the largest values in central and regional general hospitals. Regional attributes describing the location of hospitals in large agglomerations (in contrast to smaller agglomerations and rural areas) were positively associated with costs and showed the largest values in university hospitals. Furthermore, the four principal components identified within the hospital attributes fully explained the observed cost variations across different hospital types. These uncovered relationships may serve as a foundation for objectifying discussions about cost-related heterogeneity in Swiss hospitals and support policymakers to include structural characteristics into cost benchmarking and hospital reimbursement."
https://openalex.org/W4212842300,"The long-term storage stability and portability of hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers are important design criteria in the development of these therapeutics. Lyophilization or storing proteins in a freeze-dried form is known to increase storage lifetime and reduce overall weight. In this study, we lyophilized the extracellular mega-hemoglobin of the annelid Lumbricus terrestris and tested the storage stability at different temperatures and oxygenation conditions. Storage in refrigerated conditions for over 6 months in the presence of N2 reduced oxidation by 50% while storage at room temperature in the presence of N2 reduced oxidation by 60%, all while maintaining the structural stability of the mega-hemoglobin. We also demonstrated a reliable strategy to freeze dry Hbs in the presence of a minimally non-reducing disaccharide sugar that could be easily re-solubilized in deionized water. Overall, this study made significant advances towards long term storage stability of oxygen therapeutics for direct applications in transfusion medicine."

https://openalex.org/W4212957805,"Early marriage is not uncommon in Ethiopia, particularly for adolescent girls in rural settings. Social norms are among the factors believed to perpetuate early marriage practices. This qualitative study explores social norms surrounding adolescent girls' marriage practices in West Hararghe, Ethiopia.This study used the qualitative inquiry method to explore social norms in rural Ethiopia. Focus group discussions were conducted with purposively sampled married and unmarried adolescent girls, adolescent boys, and parents. A total of 158 individuals participated in the study, comprising 95 adolescents and 63 parents. Data were collected using locally developed vignettes. A thematic framework analysis approach using the Social Norms Analysis Plot (SNAP) was employed to diagnose and understand social norms.Adolescent girls' marriage was found to be mainly influenced by their peers who conform to prevailing social norms. Marrying one's first suitor was considered an opportunity not to be missed and a symbol of good luck. Relatives, neighbors, and marriage brokers facilitate adolescent girls' marriage in accordance with the local social norms. Girls usually accept the first marriage proposal regardless of their age, and they are highly expected to do so by their peers, parents, and influential others. Exceptions from the early marriage social norm include adolescent girls determined to continue their education and those having supportive teachers.In this study context, social norms strongly encourage early marriage and are mainly perpetuated by peers of adolescent girls and influential adults. A strong determination to continue education on the part of girls, strong school performance, and supportive schoolteachers are important conditions for circumventing social norms on early marriage. As social norms evolve slowly, we recommend periodical assessment in order to develop locally appropriate interventions against early marriage."
https://openalex.org/W4213120467,"Background Patients with sepsis and immobility in the intensive care unit are associated with muscle weakness, and early mobilisation can counteract it. However, during septic shock, mobilisation is often delayed due to the severity of the illness. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may be an alternative to mobilise these patients early. This study aims to identify whether NMES performed within the first 72 hours of septic shock diagnosis or later is safe from a metabolic perspective. Methods This is the analysis of two randomised controlled crossover studies. Patients with acute septic shock (within the first 72 hours of diagnosis) and sepsis and septic shock in the late phase (after 72 hours of diagnosis) were eligible. Patients were submitted in a random order to the intervention protocol (dorsal decubitus position with the lower limbs raised and NMES) and control (dorsal decubitus position with the lower limbs raised without NMES). The patients were allocated in group 1 (intervention and control) or group 2 (control and intervention) with a wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours. Metabolic variables were evaluated by indirect calorimetry. Results Sixteen patients were analysed in the acute septic shock study and 21 in the late sepsis/septic shock study. There were no significant differences between Oxygen Consumption (VO 2 ) values in the acute phase of septic shock when the baseline period, intervention, and control protocols were compared (186.59 ± 46.10; 183.64 ± 41.39; 188.97 ± 44.88, p&gt;0.05- expressed in mL/Kg/min). The same was observed when the VO 2 values in the late phase were compared (224.22 ± 53.09; 226.20 ± 49.64; 226.79 ± 58.25, p&gt;0.05). The other metabolic variables followed the same pattern, with no significant differences between the protocols. When metabolic variables were compared between acute to late phase, significant differences were observed (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions As metabolic rates in septic shock patients had no increase during NMES, either in the first 72 hours of diagnosis or later, NMES can be considered safe from a metabolic viewpoint, even despite the higher metabolic demand in the acute phase of shock.

Methods The severity of radiographic LSS was qualitatively graded on axial magnetic resonance images as follows: no stenosis, mild stenosis with ≤1/3 narrowing, moderate stenosis with a narrowing between 1/3 and 2/3, and severe stenosis with &gt; 2/3 narrowing. Patients less than 40 years of age and those who had undergone previous lumbar spine surgery were excluded from the study. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), which includes 10 sections, was used to assess the QOL. One-way analysis of variance was performed to determine the statistical relationship between radiographic LSS and ODI. Further, logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index was performed to detect the relationship. Results Complete data were available for 907 patients (300 men and 607 women; mean age, 67.3±12.4 years). The prevalence of severe, moderate, and non-mild/non-radiographic were 30%, 48%, and 22%, respectively. In addition, the mean values of ODI in each group were 12.9%, 13.1%, and 11.7%, respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups in logistic analysis (P = 0.55). In addition, no significant differences in any section of the ODI were observed among the groups. However, severe radiographic LSS was associated with low back pain in the ""severe"" group as determined by logistic analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index (odds ratio: 1.53, confidence interval: 1.13–2.07) compared with the non-severe group. Conclusion In this general population study, severe radiographic LSS was associated with low back pain (LBP), but did not affect ODI."

Teaching is a dynamic role and demands continuous adaptation. A teacher adopts teaching techniques suitable for a certain discipline and a situation. A thorough, detailed, and impartial observation of a teacher is a desideratum for adaptation of an effective teaching methodology and it is a laborious exercise. An automatic strategy for analyzing a teacher's teaching methodology in a classroom environment is suggested in this work. The proposed strategy recognizes a teacher's actions in videos while he is delivering lectures. In this study, 3D CNN and Conv2DLSTM with time-distributed layers are used for experimentation. A range of actions are recognized for a complete classroom session during experimentation and the reported results are considered effective for analysis of a teacher's teaching technique."

A customisable forensic intelligence panel that targeted 124 SNP markers (67 ancestry informative markers, 23 phenotype markers from the HIrisplex panel, and 35 Y-chromosome SNPs) was used to examine biogeographic ancestry, phenotype and sex and Y-lineage in samples from different ethnic populations of Pakistan including Pothwari, Gilgit, Baloach, Pathan, Kashmiri and Siraiki. Targeted sequencing and computational data analysis pipeline allowed filtering of variants across the targeted loci. Study samples showed an admixture between East Asian and European ancestry. Eye colour was predicted accurately based on the highest p-value giving overall prediction accuracy of 92.8%. Predictions were consistent with reported hair colour for all samples, using the combined highest p-value approach and step-wise model incorporating probability thresholds for light or dark shade. Y-SNPs were successfully recovered only from male samples which indicates the ability of this method to identify biological sex and allow inference of Y-haplogroup. Our results demonstrate practicality of using hybridisation enrichment and MPS to aid in human intelligence gathering and will open many insights into forensic research in South Asia."
https://openalex.org/W4213349416,"Accurate understanding of daily evapotranspiration (ET) at field scale is of great significance for agricultural water resources management. The operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model has been applied to estimate field scale ET with Landsat satellite imagery. However, there is still uncertainty in the ET time reconstruction for cloudy days based on limited clear days' Landsat ET fraction (ETf) computed by SSEBop. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data can provide daily surface observation over clear-sky areas. This paper presented an enhanced gap-filling scheme for the SSEBop ET model, which improved the temporal resolution of Landsat ETf through the spatio-temporal fusion with SSEBop MODIS ETf on clear days and increased the time reconstruction accuracy of field-scale ET. The results were validated with the eddy covariance (EC) measurements over cropland in northwestern China. It indicated that the improved scheme performed better than the original SSEBop Landsat approach in daily ET estimation, with higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE, 0.75 vs. 0.70), lower root mean square error (RMSE, 0.95 mm·d-1 vs. 1.05 mm·d-1), and percent bias (PBias, 16.5% vs. 25.0%). This fusion method reduced the proportion of deviation (13.3% vs. 25.5%) in the total errors and made the random error the main proportion, which can be reduced over time and space in regional ET estimation. It also evidently improved the underestimation of crop ET by the SSEBop Landsat scheme during irrigation before sowing and could more accurately describe the synergistic changes of soil moisture and cropland ET. The proposed MODIS and Landsat ETf fusion can significantly improve the accuracy of SSEBop in estimating field-scale ET."
https://openalex.org/W4212846788,"Lung tissue stiffness is altered with aging. Quantitatively evaluating lung function is difficult using a light microscope (LM) alone. Scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) calculates the speed-of-sound (SOS) using sections to obtain histological images by plotting SOS values on the screen. As SOS is positively correlated with stiffness, SAM has a superior characteristic of simultaneously evaluating tissue stiffness and structure. SOS images of healthy bronchioles, arterioles, and alveoli were compared among young, middle-aged, and old lung sections. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections consistently exhibited relatively higher SOS values than fresh-frozen sections, indicating that FFPE became stiffer but retained the relative stiffness reflecting fresh samples. All lung components exhibited gradually declining SOS values with aging and were associated with structural alterations such as loss of smooth muscles, collagen, and elastic fibers. Moreover, reaction to collagenase digestion resulted in decreased SOS values. SOS values of all components were significantly reduced in young and middle-aged groups, whereas no significant reduction was observed in the old group. Protease damage in the absence of regeneration or loss of elastic components was present in old lungs, which exbited dilated bronchioles and alveoli. Aging lungs gradually lose stiffness with decreasing structural components without exposure to specific insults such as inflammation."

Methods This cross-sectional study used data from 4,490 students (2,399 students in the fourth grade of elementary school and 2,541 students in the first grade of middle school). The data obtained were evaluated using living time (sleep time, study time, leisure time), emotions (happiness, self-esteem, emotional problems), capabilities (cooperative attitude, grit), health (life satisfaction, exercise time, number of breakfasts, quality of sleep), media (smartphone use and dependence), school (school life satisfaction, relationship with friends and teachers), and home (time spent with parents, parenting attitude). Results We confirmed that regardless of grade, living time (leisure time), emotion (happiness, self-esteem, emotional problems), capabilities (grit), health (life satisfaction, exercise time, quality of sleep), media (smartphone dependence), and school (school life satisfaction, friendly, and teacher relations) are related to subjective health conditions. These results confirmed that evaluation parameters are related to subjective health conditions regardless of grade. Conclusion This investigation revealed that the higher the quality of sleep enhanced positive emotions while increased exercise"
https://openalex.org/W4213022186,"This retrospective, cross-sectional study investigated changes in corneal lower- and higher-order aberrations that cause visual disturbance after lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection in children.Eighty-five eyes of 85 patients (44 boys; 8.64±2.88 years) who underwent lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection to correct intermittent exotropia were assessed. The Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer was used for wavefront analysis. Risk factors (age, sex, amount of surgery, preoperative axial length, preoperative intraocular pressure) were determined. Outcome measures included simulated and ray-tracing mode keratometry with secondary defocus, oblique, and vertical astigmatism (for lower-order aberrations) and the root mean square, 3rd-order vertical and horizontal coma, oblique and horizontal trefoil, 4th-order spherical aberration, oblique and vertical secondary astigmatism, and oblique and vertical quadrafoil (2nd‒8th sums) (for higher-order aberrations).Myopic with-the-rule changes in low-order aberrations and increases in simulated and ray-tracing mode keratometry during the 3 months following lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection were attributed to muscle healing and stability changes. High-order aberrations altered in the week following surgery almost returned to normal within 3 months. Axial length, the amount of surgery, age, and sex affected astigmatism due to differences in patients' scleral states.Clinicians should consider changes in high-order aberrations of young individuals who underwent lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection and may not be able to verbalize changes in vision."
https://openalex.org/W4213080619,"Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most important horticultural cash crops, and tea green leafhopper (Matsumurasca onukii) is an extremely harmful sap-sucking pest of tea plant. Serious generation overlapping, which is mainly caused by the long oviposition period, leads to poor control effect of pesticides on this pest in the tea plantation. But the intuitive evidences of continuous oogenesis and egg-laying of this pest are still lacking, which seriously hindered the development of genetic control methods. Here, we clarified the main structures of the inner reproductive system of tea green leafhopper female adult. Oviposition behaviors were monitored as well, and six oviposition steps were recorded. According to the maturity of oocytes, the maturity stages of the reproductive system under different copulation periods were classified into 4 stages. For female adults at stage IV, mature and immature oocytes were presented simultaneously, and the developmental levels of oocytes were asynchronous among different ovarioles. The proportion of gravid females with mature oocytes significantly increased when the continuous copulation time was prolonged. In sync with the development of the ovary maturity, female adults started to slightly deposit eggs at the 5th day, and then increased dramatically. In addition, we found that, whether mature or immature, oocytes in the ovarioles always emitted green fluorescence under blue light excitation, which in turn provide solid proof for the new egg detection method from the insect physiology point of view."
https://openalex.org/W4213134211,"Myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of poor outcomes in the post-cardiac arrest period. Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a selective small molecule activator of cardiac myosin that prolongs myocardial systole and increases stroke volume without apparent effects on myocardial oxygen demand. OM administration is safe and improves cardiac function in patients with acute heart failure. Whether OM improves post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of OM treatment on post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction and outcomes.Adult male rats were resuscitated after 9.5 min of asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest. OM and normal saline was continuously intravenously infused after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at 0.25 mg/kg/h for 4 h in the experimental group and control group, respectively (n = 20 in each group). Hemodynamic parameters were measured hourly and monitored for 4 h after cardiac arrest. Recovery of neurological function was evaluated by neurological functioning scores (0-12; favorable: 11-12) for rats 72 h after cardiac arrest. OM treatment prolonged left ventricular ejection time and improved post-resuscitation cardiac output. Post-resuscitation heart rate and left ventricular systolic function (dp/dt40) were not different between groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed non-statistically higher 72-h survival in the OM group (72.2% [13/18] and 58.8% [10/17], p = 0.386). The OM group had a higher chance of having favorable neurological outcomes in surviving rats 72 h after cardiac arrest (84.6% [11/13] vs. 40% [4/10], p = 0.026). The percentage of damaged neurons was lower in the OM group in a histology study at 72 h after cardiac arrest (55.5±2.3% vs. 76.2±10.2%, p = 0.004).OM treatment improved post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction and neurological outcome in an animal model. These findings support further pre-clinical studies to improve outcomes in post-cardiac arrest care."
https://openalex.org/W4213215583,"Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) mitigate the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Objective Elderly AF patients who were treated with OACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin) were compared against AF patients who were not treated with OACs with respect to their clinical and economic outcomes. Methods Newly diagnosed AF patients were identified between January 2013 and December 2017 in the Medicare database. Evidence of an OAC treatment claim on or after the first AF diagnosis was used to classify patients into treatment-defined cohorts, and these cohorts were further stratified based on the initial OAC prescribed. The risks of stroke/systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding (MB), and death were analyzed using inverse probability treatment weighted time-dependent Cox regression models, and costs were compared with marginal structural models. Results The two treatment groups were composed of 1,421,187 AF patients: OAC treated (N = 583,350, 41.0% [36.4% apixaban, 4.9% dabigatran, 0.1% edoxaban, 26.7% rivaroxaban, and 31.9% warfarin patients]) and untreated (N = 837,837, 59.0%). OAC-treated patients had a lower adjusted risk of stroke/SE compared to untreated patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68–0.72). Additionally patients receiving OACs had a lower adjusted risk of death (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.55–0.56) and a higher risk of MB (HR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.54–1.59) and this trend was consistent across each OAC sub-group. The OAC-treated cohort had lower adjusted total healthcare costs per patient per month ($4,381 vs $7,172; p &lt; .0001). Conclusion For the OAC-treated cohort in this elderly US population, stroke/SE and all-cause death were lower, while risk of MB was higher. Among OAC treated patients, total healthcare costs were lower than those of the untreated cohort."
https://openalex.org/W4213282687,"Directed signature is a special cryptographic technique in which only the verifier designated by the signer can verify the validity of the signature. Directed signature can effectively protect the privacy of the signer's identity, so it is very suitable for medical records, taxation, and other fields. To improve the security and performance of the directed signature scheme, Gayathri et al. proposed the first certificateless directed signature (CLDS) scheme without bilinear pairing and claimed that their CLDS scheme could withstand Type I and Type II attacks. In this article, we provide two attack methods to assess the security of their CLDS scheme. Unfortunately, our results indicate that their CLDS scheme is insecure against Type I and Type II attacks. That is, their CLDS scheme does not meet the unforgeability and cannot achieve the expected security goals. To resist these attacks, we present an improved CLDS scheme and give the security proof. Compared with similar schemes, our scheme has better performance and higher security."
