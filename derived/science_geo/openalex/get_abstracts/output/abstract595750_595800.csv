https://openalex.org/W2758672305,"The study aimed to evaluate the quantitative characteristics of the macular vessel density (VD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).Cross-sectional, age- and sex-matched case-control study.Fifty-two eyes of 52 patients with primary open angle glaucoma and 52 eyes from 52 healthy participants were recruited retrospectively. OCT-A was performed on a 3 x 3-mm macular region centered on the fovea. OCT-A scans were manually graded to define the FAZ. Parafoveal VD in superficial and deep retina were analyzed in the circular- and quadrant-segmented zone. The FAZ parameters included size, perimeter, and circularity index. The regression analysis among VD and FAZ-related parameters and ocular parameters was performed, and the diagnostic ability was calculated with refractive error adjusted.For both groups, the mean age and the sex ratio was not different between groups. With refractive error adjusted, the average macular VD was lower in glaucoma than in the control group for superficial (P = 0.013), deep (P<0.001), and the whole retina (P = 0.002). There were increased FAZ perimeter and decreased FAZ circularity index in glaucoma when compared with controls (P<0.001). In the multivariate regression models, FAZ circularity index were significantly associated with decreased peripapillary RNFL thickness (P = 0.007) and macular GCIPL thickness (P = 0.009) measured by OCT. The refractive-error adjusted area under receiver operating characteristics was highest for FAZ circularity index (0.905; 95% CI, 0.844-0.966), followed by temporal deep retinal VD (0.870; 95% CI, 0.803-0.937) and FAZ perimeter (0.858; 95% CI, 0.784-0.932).Decreased macular VD, increased FAZ perimeter, and decreased FAZ circularity index were observed in eyes with glaucoma using OCT-A. With refractive error adjusted, these parameters showed considerable diagnostic value for glaucoma. FAZ circularity index may be a novel biomarker representing disruption of the parafoveal capillary network in glaucoma, as supported by its association with structural parameters."

While the direct impact of coccidiosis on animal health and welfare is clear, its influence on the enteric microbiota and by-stander effects on chicken health and production remains largely unknown, with the possible exception of Clostridium perfringens (necrotic enteritis). This study evaluated the composition and structure of the caecal microbiome in the presence or absence of a defined Eimeria tenella challenge infection in Cobb500 broiler chickens using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The severity of clinical coccidiosis in individual chickens was quantified by caecal lesion scoring and microbial changes associated with different lesion scores identified. Following E. tenella infection the diversity of taxa within the caecal microbiome remained largely stable. However, infection induced significant changes in the abundance of some microbial taxa. The greatest changes were detected in birds displaying severe caecal pathology; taxa belonging to the order Enterobacteriaceae were increased, while taxa from Bacillales and Lactobacillales were decreased with the changes correlated with lesion severity. Significantly different profiles were also detected in infected birds which remained asymptomatic (lesion score 0), with taxa belonging to the genera Bacteroides decreased and Lactobacillus increased. Many differential taxa from the order Clostridiales were identified, with some increasing and others decreasing in abundance in Eimeria-infected animals. The results support the view that caecal microbiome dysbiosis associated with Eimeria infection contributes to disease pathology, and could be a target for intervention to mitigate the impact of coccidiosis on poultry productivity and welfare. This work highlights that E. tenella infection has a significant impact on the abundance of some caecal bacteria with notable differences detected between lesion score categories emphasising the importance of accounting for differences in caecal lesions when investigating the relationship between E. tenella and the poultry intestinal microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2758002845,"Sorafenib, an orally available kinase inhibitor, is the standard first-line systemic drug for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and it exerts potent inhibitory activity against epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and multidrug resistance (MDR) by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in HCC. However, after long-term exposure to sorafenib, HCC cells exhibit EMT and resistance to sorafenib. The activation of AKT by sorafenib is thought to be responsible for the development of these characteristics. The present study aims to examine the underlying mechanism and seek potential strategies to reverse this resistance and the progression to EMT. Sorafenib-resistant cells showed increased metastatic and invasive ability, with a higher expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), compared with the parental cells. This phenomenon was at least partially due to EMT and the appearance of MDR in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Moreover, MDR was a downstream molecular event of EMT. Silencing Snail with siRNA blocked EMT and partially reversed the MDR, thereby markedly abolishing invasion and metastasis in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, but silencing of MDR1 had no effect on the EMT phenotype. Additionally, HCC parental cells that were stably transfected with pCDNA3.1-Snail exhibited EMT and MDR. Two sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, established from human HCC HepG2 and Huh7 cells, were refractory to sorafenib-induced growth inhibition but were sensitive to MK-2206, a novel allosteric AKT inhibitor. Thus, the combination of sorafenib and MK-2206 led to significant reversion of the EMT phenotype and P-gp-mediated MDR by downregulating phosphorylated AKT. These findings underscore the significance of EMT, MDR and enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2759912964,"In this paper we address the problem of automated grading of invasive breast carcinoma through the encoding of histological images as VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) representations on the Grassmann manifold. The proposed method considers each image as a set of multidimensional spatially-evolving signals that can be efficiently modeled through a higher-order linear dynamical systems analysis. Subsequently, each H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) stained breast cancer histological image is represented as a cloud of points on the Grassmann manifold, while a vector representation approach is applied aiming to aggregate the Grassmannian points based on a locality criterion on the manifold. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, two datasets with different characteristics were used. More specifically, we created a new medium-sized dataset consisting of 300 annotated images (collected from 21 patients) of grades 1, 2 and 3, while we also provide experimental results using a large dataset, namely BreaKHis, containing 7,909 breast cancer histological images, collected from 82 patients, of both benign and malignant cases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method outperforms a number of state of the art approaches providing average classification rates of 95.8% and 91.38% with our dataset and the BreaKHis dataset, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2760357344,"The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a foundation species providing significant ecosystem services. However, the roles of oyster microbiomes have not been integrated into any of the services, particularly nitrogen removal through denitrification. We investigated the composition and denitrification potential of oyster microbiomes with an approach that combined 16S rRNA gene analysis, metabolic inference, qPCR of the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), and N2 flux measurements. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive gland, the oyster shell, and sediments adjacent to the oyster reef were examined based on next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Denitrification potentials of the microbiomes were determined by metabolic inferences using a customized denitrification gene and genome database with the paprica (PAthway PRediction by phylogenetIC plAcement) bioinformatics pipeline. Denitrification genes examined included nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), which was further subdivided by genotype into clade I (nosZI) or clade II (nosZII). Continuous flow through experiments measuring N2 fluxes were conducted with the oysters, shells, and sediments to compare denitrification activities. Paprica properly classified the composition of microbiomes, showing similar classification results from Silva, Greengenes and RDP databases. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive glands and shells were quite different from each other and from the sediments. The relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria inferred by paprica was higher in oysters and shells than in sediments suggesting that oysters act as hotspots for denitrification in the marine environment. Similarly, the inferred nosZI gene abundances were also higher in the oyster and shell microbiomes than in the sediment microbiome. Gene abundances for nosZI were verified with qPCR of nosZI genes, which showed a significant positive correlation (F1,7 = 14.7, p = 6.0x10-3, R2 = 0.68). N2 flux rates were significantly higher in the oyster (364.4 ± 23.5 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1) and oyster shell (355.3 ± 6.4 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1) compared to the sediment (270.5 ± 20.1 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1). Thus, bacteria carrying nosZI genes were found to be an important denitrifier, facilitating nitrogen removal in oyster reefs. In addition, this is the first study to validate the use of 16S gene based metabolic inference as a method for determining microbiome function, such as denitrification, by comparing inference results with qPCR gene quantification and rate measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2757893864,"Background and purpose Metabolome analyses have shown that plasma amino acid profiles reflect various pathological conditions, such as cancer and diabetes mellitus. It remains unclear, however, whether plasma amino acid profiles change in patients with sarcopenia. This study therefore aimed to investigate whether sarcopenia-specific changes occur in plasma amino acid profiles. Methods A total of 153 community-dwelling and seven institutionalized elderly individuals (56 men, 104 women; mean age, 77.7±7.0 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional analysis. We performed a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which included an evaluation of hand grip strength, gait speed, muscle mass and blood chemistry, including the concentration of 18 amino acids. Results Twenty-eight of the 160 participants met the criteria for sarcopenia established by the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Univariate analysis revealed associations between the presence of sarcopenia and a higher plasma concentration of proline and glutamine, lower concentrations of histidine and tryptophan. Multivariable analysis revealed that a higher concentration of proline was the only variable independently associated with sarcopenia. Conclusions The plasma concentration of proline may be useful for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2756748326,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major component in the global carbon cycle. Yet how input of plant litter may influence the loss of SOC through a phenomenon called priming effect remains highly uncertain. Most published results about the priming effect came from short-term investigations for a few weeks or at the most for a few months in duration. The priming effect has not been studied at the annual time scale. In this study for 815 days, we investigated the priming effect of added maize leaves on SOC decomposition of two soil types and two treatments (bare fallow for 23 years, and adjacent old-field, represent stable and relatively labile SOC, respectively) of SOC stabilities within each soil type, using a natural 13C-isotope method. Results showed that the variation of the priming effect through time had three distinctive phases for all soils: (1) a strong negative priming phase during the first period (≈0–90 days); (2) a pulse of positive priming phase in the middle (≈70–160 and 140–350 days for soils from Hailun and Shenyang stations, respectively); and (3) a relatively stabilized phase of priming during the last stage of the incubation (>160 days and >350 days for soils from Hailun and Shenyang stations, respectively). Because of major differences in soil properties, the two soil types produced different cumulative priming effects at the end of the experiment, a positive priming effect of 3–7% for the Mollisol and a negative priming effect of 4–8% for the Alfisol. Although soil types and measurement times modulated most of the variability of the priming effect, relative SOC stabilities also influenced the priming effect for a particular soil type and at a particular dynamic phase. The stable SOC from the bare fallow treatment tended to produce a narrower variability during the first phase of negative priming and also during the second phase of positive priming. Averaged over the entire experiment, the stable SOC (i.e., the bare fallow) was at least as responsive to priming as the relatively labile SOC (i.e., the old-field) if not more responsive. The annual time scale of our experiment allowed us to demonstrate the three distinctive phases of the priming effect. Our results highlight the importance of studying the priming effect by investigating the temporal dynamics over longer time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2758711313,"Accurate and robust tomographic reconstruction from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquired data is a difficult problem. Conventional methods, such as the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm for reconstructing the activity distribution-based on individual frames, may lead to inaccurate results due to the checkerboard effect and limitation of photon counts. In this paper, we propose a stacked sparse auto-encoder based reconstruction framework for dynamic PET imaging. The dynamic reconstruction problem is formulated in a deep learning representation, where the encoding layers extract the prototype features, such as edges, so that, in the decoding layers, the reconstructed results are obtained through a combination of those features. The qualitative and quantitative results of the procedure, including the data based on a Monte Carlo simulation and real patient data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method."
https://openalex.org/W2760155717,"Background No study has investigated the impact of the duration of untreated depression (DUD) on the severity of depression at the two-year follow-up point in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who discontinued pharmacotherapy. This study aimed to investigate this issue. Methods This study enrolled 155 subjects with MDD at baseline, and 101 subjects who had discontinued pharmacotherapy for 17.1 ± 5.8 months were assessed at the two-year follow-up point. DUD was defined as the interval between the onset of the index major depressive episode and the start of pharmacotherapy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate depression. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the impacts of DUD on the severity and improvement percentage (IP) of depression at follow-up. Results A longer DUD was significantly associated with a greater severity and a lower IP of depression at follow-up. After controlling for confounding factors, DUD was the most significant factor predicting the severity and IP of depression at follow-up. DUD was more strongly associated with the prognosis of depression at follow-up than depression and anxiety severities at baseline. Conclusions The DUD at baseline independently predicted the severity of depression at the two-year follow-up point. Although the patients had discontinued pharmacotherapy for nearly 1.5 years, the impact of the DUD on the severity of depression persisted at follow-up. The DUD was an important index that predicted the severity of depression at the two-year follow-up point."
https://openalex.org/W2758632822,"Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine mucosa due to permanent intolerance to dietary gluten. The aim was to elucidate the role of small intestinal epithelial cells in the immunopathology of celiac disease in particular the influence of celiac disease-associated bacteria.Duodenal biopsies were collected from children with active celiac disease, treated celiac disease, and clinical controls. Intestinal epithelial cells were purified and analyzed for gene expression changes at the mRNA and protein levels. Two in vitro models for human intestinal epithelium, small intestinal enteroids and polarized tight monolayers, were utilized to assess how interferon-γ, interleukin-17A, celiac disease-associated bacteria and gluten influence intestinal epithelial cells.More than 25 defense-related genes, including IRF1, SPINK4, ITLN1, OAS2, CIITA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOB, PSMB9, TAP1, BTN3A1, and CX3CL1, were significantly upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells at active celiac disease. Of these genes, 70% were upregulated by interferon-γ via the IRF1 pathway. Most interestingly, IRF1 was also upregulated by celiac disease-associated bacteria. The NLRP6/8 inflammasome yielding CASP1 and biologically active interleukin-18, which induces interferon-γ in intraepithelial lymphocytes, was expressed in intestinal epithelial cells.A key factor in the epithelial reaction in celiac disease appears to be over-expression of IRF1 that could be inherent and/or due to presence of undesirable microbes that act directly on IRF1. Dual activation of IRF1 and IRF1-regulated genes, both directly and via the interleukin-18 dependent inflammasome would drastically enhance the inflammatory response and lead to the pathological situation seen in active celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2759424023,"Inclusion of ecosystem services (ES) information into national-scale development and climate adaptation planning has yet to become common practice, despite demand from decision makers. Identifying where ES originate and to whom the benefits flow-under current and future climate conditions-is especially critical in rapidly developing countries, where the risk of ES loss is high. Here, using Myanmar as a case study, we assess where and how ecosystems provide key benefits to the country's people and infrastructure. We model the supply of and demand for sediment retention, dry-season baseflows, flood risk reduction and coastal storm protection from multiple beneficiaries. We find that locations currently providing the greatest amount of services are likely to remain important under the range of climate conditions considered, demonstrating their importance in planning for climate resilience. Overlap between priority areas for ES provision and biodiversity conservation is higher than expected by chance overall, but the areas important for multiple ES are underrepresented in currently designated protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas. Our results are contributing to development planning in Myanmar, and our approach could be extended to other contexts where there is demand for national-scale natural capital information to shape development plans and policies."
https://openalex.org/W2758635260,"Automated assessment and prediction of marital outcome in couples therapy is a challenging task but promises to be a potentially useful tool for clinical psychologists. Computational approaches for inferring therapy outcomes using observable behavioral information obtained from conversations between spouses offer objective means for understanding relationship dynamics. In this work, we explore whether the acoustics of the spoken interactions of clinically distressed spouses provide information towards assessment of therapy outcomes. The therapy outcome prediction task in this work includes detecting whether there was a relationship improvement or not (posed as a binary classification) as well as discerning varying levels of improvement or decline in the relationship status (posed as a multiclass recognition task). We use each interlocutor's acoustic speech signal characteristics such as vocal intonation and intensity, both independently and in relation to one another, as cues for predicting the therapy outcome. We also compare prediction performance with one obtained via standardized behavioral codes characterizing the relationship dynamics provided by human experts as features for automated classification. Our experiments, using data from a longitudinal clinical study of couples in distressed relations, showed that predictions of relationship outcomes obtained directly from vocal acoustics are comparable or superior to those obtained using human-rated behavioral codes as prediction features. In addition, combining direct signal-derived features with manually coded behavioral features improved the prediction performance in most cases, indicating the complementarity of relevant information captured by humans and machine algorithms. Additionally, considering the vocal properties of the interlocutors in relation to one another, rather than in isolation, showed to be important for improving the automatic prediction. This finding supports the notion that behavioral outcome, like many other behavioral aspects, is closely related to the dynamics and mutual influence of the interlocutors during their interaction and their resulting behavioral patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2759718627,"The design of a multimodal logistics service network with customer service time windows and environmental costs is an important and challenging issue. Accordingly, this work established a model to minimize the total cost of multimodal logistics service network design with time windows and environmental concerns. The proposed model incorporates CO2 emission costs to determine the optimal transportation mode combinations and investment selections for transfer nodes, which consider transport cost, transport time, carbon emission, and logistics service time window constraints. Furthermore, genetic and heuristic algorithms are proposed to set up the abovementioned optimal model. A numerical example is provided to validate the model and the abovementioned two algorithms. Then, comparisons of the performance of the two algorithms are provided. Finally, this work investigates the effects of the logistics service time windows and CO2 emission taxes on the optimal solution. Several important management insights are obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2760104920,"The Arabidopsis thaliana F-box gene HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) affects organ growth and the timing of floral organ abscission. The loss-of-function hws-1 mutant exhibits fused sepals and increased organ size. To understand the molecular mechanisms of HWS during plant development, we mutagenized hws-1 seeds with ethylmethylsulphonate (EMS) and screened for mutations suppressing hws-1 associated phenotypes. We isolated the shs1/hws-1 (suppressor of hws-1) mutant in which hws-1 sepal fusion phenotype was suppressed. The shs1/hws-1 mutant carries a G→A nucleotide substitution in the MIR164 binding site of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1 (CUC1) mRNA. CUC1 and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2 (CUC2) transcript levels were altered in shs1, renamed cuc1-1D, and in hws-1 mutant. Genetic interaction analyses using single, double and triple mutants of cuc1-1D, cuc2-1D (a CUC2 mutant similar to cuc1-1D), and hws-1, demonstrate that HWS, CUC1 and CUC2 act together to control floral organ number. Loss of function of HWS is associated with larger petal size due to alterations in cell proliferation and mitotic growth, a role shared with the CUC1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2757645865,"In numerous studies, liposomes have been used to deliver anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin to local heat-triggered tumor. Here, we investigate: (i) the ability of thermosensitive liposomal nanoparticle (TSLnp) as a delivery system to deliver poorly membrane-permeable anticancer drug, gemcitabine (Gem) to solid pancreatic tumor with the aid of local mild hyperthermia and, (ii) the possibility of using gadolinium (Magnevist®) loaded-TSLnps (Gd-TSLnps) to increase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast in solid tumor. In this study, we developed and tested gemcitabine-loaded thermosensitive liposomal nanoparticles (Gem-TSLnps) and gadolinium-loaded thermosensitive liposomal nanoparticles (Gd-TSLnps) both in in-vitro and in-vivo. The TSLnps exhibited temperature-dependent release of Gem, at 40-42°C, 65% of Gem was released within 10 min, whereas < 23% Gem leakage occurred at 37°C after a period of 2 h. The pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distribution of both Gem-TSLnps and Gd-TSLnps were significantly greater compared with free Gem and Gd, while Gem-TSLnps plasma clearance was reduced by 17-fold and that of Gd-TSLpns was decreased by 2-fold. Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Gem-TSLnps (35.17± 0.04 μghr/mL) was significantly higher than that of free Gem (2.09 ± 0.01 μghr/mL) whereas, AUC of Gd-TSLnps was higher than free Gd by 3.9 fold high. TSLnps showed significant Gem accumulation in heated tumor relative to free Gem. Similar trend of increased Gd-TSLnps accumulation was observed in non-heated tumor compared to that of free Gd; however, no significant difference in MRI contrast enhancement between free Gd and Gd-TSLnps ex-vivo tumor images was observed. Despite Gem-TSLnps dose being half of free Gem dose, antitumor efficacy of Gem-TSLnps was comparable to that of free Gem(Gem-TSLnps 10 mg Gem/kg compared with free Gem 20 mg/kg). Overall, the findings suggest that TSLnps may be used to improve Gem delivery and enhance its antitumor activity. However, the formulation of Gd-TSLnp needs to be fully optimized to significantly enhance MRI contrast in tumor."

With the help of GUI through a PC or smart phone, there are various applications that can be developed for energy saving. This work describes the design and prototype implementation of a wireless PV-powered home energy management system under a DC-distribution environment, which allows remote monitoring of appliances’ energy consumptions and power rate quality. The system can be managed by a central computer, which obtains the energy data based on XBee RF modules that access the sensor measurements of system components. The proposed integrated prototype framework is characterized by low power consumption due to the lack of components and consists of three layers: XBee-based circuit for processing and communication architecture, solar charge controller, and solar-battery-load matching layers. Six precise analogue channels for data monitoring are considered to cover the energy measurements. Voltage, current and temperature analogue signals were accessed directly from the remote XBee node to be sent in real time with a sampling frequency of 11–123 Hz to capture the possible surge power. The performance shows that the developed prototype proves the DC voltage matching concept and is able to provide accurate and precise results."
https://openalex.org/W2759575396,"‘Responsible drinking’ campaigns emerged in the early 1970s as a means of addressing hazardous drinking and its related consequences. While these were initially the product of public health agencies and health-related NGOs, they are increasingly being developed and disseminated by the alcohol industry. There is considerable debate as to whether industry-generated campaigns are designed to reduce hazardous drinking and related problems (as argued by their developers) or are designed to avoid government regulation or even to increase sales. The aim of the present study was to explore the way that recent industry-developed responsible drinking campaigns are perceived and interpreted by the general public. That is, do they promote low-risk drinking, promote risky drinking, or just muddy the waters. Two sub-studies were conducted. The first, a mall intercept study with 180 adults in two Australian shopping districts, explored participants’ understanding of slogans/taglines. The second, an online survey with 480 Australian adults, explored understandings and interpretations of television/online commercials. The results of the two studies revealed diversity in participants’ interpretation of the ‘responsible drinking’ advertisements. Terminology utilised in industry-developed advertisements was found to be ambiguous; for example, what age group was being referred to in the tagline ‘Kids and alcohol don’t mix’, and whether ‘Drink Properly’ meant not drinking to excess or drinking in a way that made you look more sophisticated. In Study Two, the government-developed campaign (‘Know when to say when’) was clearly interpreted as warning against risky consumption of alcohol; whereas the industry-developed campaigns (‘How to drink properly’, ‘Kids absorb your drinking’, ‘Friends are waiting’) were interpreted to have a range of different meanings, including some seemingly unrelated to alcohol. These findings are consistent with the literature evaluating anti-smoking campaigns developed by the tobacco industry, and previous research showing that industry communications serve to soften public opinion and create the impression of a ‘socially responsible’ industry but are likely to be less effective than initiatives focused on the availability and promotion of alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W2760446961,"Vermelha Lagoon is a hypersaline shallow transitional ecosystem in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). This lagoon is located in the protected area of Massambaba, between the cities of Araruama and Saquarema (Brazil), and displays two quite uncommon particularities: it exhibits carbonate sedimentation and displays the development of Holocene stromatolites. Due to both particularities, the salt industry and property speculation have been, increasingly, generating anthropic pressures on this ecosystem. This study aims to apply a multiproxy approach to evaluate the trophic state of Vermelha Lagoon based on physicochemical parameters and geochemical data for the quantification and qualification of organic matter (OM), namely total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), total phosphorus (TP) and biopolymeric carbon (BPC), including carbohydrates (CHO), lipids (LIP) and proteins (PTN). The CHO/TOC ratio values suggest that OM supplied to the sediment is of autochthonous origin and results, essentially, from microbial activity. The cluster analyses allowed the identification of four regions in Vermelha Lagoon. The Region I included stations located in shallow areas of the eastern sector of Vermelha lagoon affected by the impact of the artificial channel of connection with Araruama Lagoon. The Region II, under the influence of salt pans, is characterized by the highest values of BPC, namely CHO promoted by microbiological activity. The Region III include stations spread through the lagoon with high values of dissolved oxygen and lower values of TP. Stromatolites and microbial mattes growth was observed in some stations of this sector. Region IV, where the highest values of TOC and TS were found, represents depocenters of organic matter, located in general in depressed areas. Results of this work evidences that the Vermelha Lagoon is an eutrophic but alkaline and well oxygenated environment (at both water column and surface sediment) where the autotrophic activity is greater than heterotrophic one. These particular conditions make this a special and rare ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2756599047,"Purpose Intraocular pressure (IOP) is known to have a strong circadian rhythm, yet how light/dark cycles entrain this rhythm is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether, like the retina, the mammalian ciliary body and IOP clocks have an intrinsic ability to entrain to light/dark cycles. Methods Iris-ciliary body complexes were obtained from period2:luciferase (PER2::LUC) mice and cultured to measure bioluminescence rhythmicity. Pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex were exposed to antiphasic 9:15 h light/dark cycle in vitro. After 4 days of exposure to light/dark cycles, bioluminescence was recorded to establish their circadian phases. In addition, pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex co-cultured with the retinas or corneas of wild-type mice were also investigated. The IOP circadian changes of free-running Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice whose behavior was antiphasic to wild-type were measured by a rebound tonometry, and compared with wild-type mice. Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA expression in the iris-ciliary body were analyzed using RT-PCR. Results The iris/ciliary body complex expressed Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA; however, unlike in retina and cornea, neither the iris-CB complex nor the co-cultured complex was directly entrained by light-dark cycle in vitro. The diurnal IOP change of Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice showed an antiphasic pattern to wild-type mice and their rhythms followed the whole-animal behavioral rhythm. Conclusions Despite expressing mRNA for several non-visual opsins, circadian rhythms of the iris-ciliary body complex of mice do not entrain directly to light-dark cycles ex vivo. Unlike retina, the iris/ciliary body clocks of blind mice remain synchronized to the organismal behavioral rhythm rather than local light-dark cycles. These results suggest that IOP rhythm entrainment is mediated by a systemic rather than local signal in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2760270932,"Introduction Inconsistency in the time trade-off (TTO) task in EQ-5D-5L occurs when a respondent gives a higher value to a logically worse health state, the occurrence of inconsistency compromises the quality of the data. It is not yet clear which factors are associated with individual level inconsistency. Relating inconsistency to the characteristics of the respondent, interviewer, and the interview process could be helpful in understanding the causes of inconsistency. The objective of this paper is to discover the factors associated with individual level inconsistencies. Methods Twenty interviewers interviewed 1,296 respondents and each respondent valued 10 health states using the EQ-VT platform in 5 cities in China. At the respondent level, inconsistency was identified in terms of severity and quantity and related to the respondent’s background characteristics, the time and iterations spent on the wheelchair example task, and the formal TTO tasks, using multilevel multinomial regression analyses. Interviewers’ impact on inconsistencies was analyzed using single level multinomial regression analyses. Results In the full dataset, slight inconsistency was more related to the interview process (Time spent on TTO task: RRR = 1.246 with 95%CI: 1.076,1.441; time spent on Wheelchair example: RRR = 0.815 with 95%CI:0.699,0.952) while severe inconsistency was more related to respondent’s gender (Gender: RRR = 2.347 with 95%CI:1.429,3.855). One Interviewer (Interviewer 7: RRR = 7.335 with 95%CI:1.908,28.195) and interviewer’s experience (Sequence: RRR = 0.511 with 95%CI:0.385,0.678) in general showed strong influence over inconsistency in the TTO task. Conclusion In conclusion, logical inconsistency in the valuation of EQ-5D-5L health states is associated not only with respondents’ characteristics but also with interviewers’ performance and the interview process. The role of interviewers and the importance of interviewer training may be more crucial than hitherto believed. This finding could be generalizable to other interviewer-administered health-state valuation study."

Many studies suggest that cognitive impairments are more closely correlated with synaptic loss than the burden of amyloid deposits in AD progression. To date, there is no effective treatment for this disease. Paeonol has been widely employed in traditional Chinese medicine. This compound improves learning behavior in an animal model; however, the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, Paeononlsilatie sodium (Pa), a derivative of Paeonol, attenuated D-galactose (D-gal) and AlCl3-induced behavioral damages in rats based on evaluations of the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and Morris water maze test (MWMT). Pa increased the dendritic complexity and the density of dendritic spines. Correlation analysis indicated that morphological changes in neuronal dendrites are closely correlated with behavioral changes. Pa treatment reduced the production of Aβ, affected the phosphorylation and redistribution of cofilin1 and inhibited rod-like formation in hippocampal neurons. The induction of D-gal and AlCl3 promoted the expression of RAC1/CDC42 expression; however, the tendency of gene expression was inhibited by pretreatment with Pa. Taken together, our results suggest that Pa may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the improvement of cognitive and emotional behaviors and dendritic morphology in an AD animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2758628316,"A filamentous bacteriophage, designated ϕRs551, was isolated and purified from the quarantine and select agent phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 strain UW551 (phylotype IIB sequevar 1) grown under normal culture conditions. Electron microscopy suggested that ϕRs551 is a member of the family Inoviridae, and is about 1200 nm long and 7 nm wide. ϕRs551 has a genome of 7929 nucleotides containing 14 open reading frames, and is the first isolated virion that contains a resolvase (ORF13) and putative type-2 phage repressor (ORF14). Unlike other R. solanacearum phages isolated from soil, the genome sequence of ϕRs551 is not only 100% identical to its prophage sequence in the deposited genome of R. solanacearum strain UW551 from which the phage was isolated, but is also surprisingly found with 100% identity in the deposited genomes of 10 other phylotype II sequevar 1 strains of R. solanacearum. Furthermore, it is homologous to genome RS-09-161, resulting in the identification of a new prophage, designated RSM10, in a R. solanacearum strain from India. When ORF13 and a core attP site of ϕRs551 were either deleted individually or in combination, phage integration was not observed, suggesting that similar to other filamentous R. solanacearum ϕRSM phages, ϕRs551 relies on its resolvase and the core att sequence for site-directed integration into its susceptible R. solanacearum strain. The integration occurred four hours after phage infection. Infection of a susceptible R. solanacearum strain RUN302 by ϕRs551 resulted in less fluidal colonies and EPS production, and reduced motilities of the bacterium. Interestingly, infection of RUN302 by ϕRs551 also resulted in reduced virulence, rather than enhanced or loss of virulence caused by other ϕRSM phages. Study of bacteriophages of R. solanacearum would contribute to a better understanding of the phage-bacterium-environment interactions in order to develop integrated management strategies to combat R. solanacearum."
https://openalex.org/W2759350634,"There are different phenotypes of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), many of which have not been characterised. Identification of these different phenotypes is important in defining prognosis and guiding the therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to characterise the entire population of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated patients in Catalonia and identify specific patient profiles using cluster analysis. A total of 72,217 CPAP-treated patients who contacted the Catalan Health System (CatSalut) during the years 2012 and 2013 were included. Six clusters were identified, classified as ""Neoplastic patients"" (Cluster 1, 10.4%), ""Metabolic syndrome patients"" (Cluster 2, 27.7%), ""Asthmatic patients"" (Cluster 3, 5.8%), ""Musculoskeletal and joint disorder patients"" (Cluster 4, 10.3%), ""Patients with few comorbidities"" (Cluster 5, 35.6%) and ""Oldest and cardiac disease patients"" (Cluster 6, 10.2%). Healthcare facility use and mortality were highest in patients from Cluster 1 and 6. Conversely, patients in Clusters 2 and 4 had low morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource use. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of CPAP-treated patients, and suggest that OSA is associated with a different prognosis in the clusters identified. These results suggest the need for a comprehensive and individualised approach to CPAP treatment of OSA."
https://openalex.org/W2757001716,"Rationale Post-ischemic changes in cellular metabolism alter myocardial and neurological function. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the limiting step in mitochondrial glucose oxidation, is inhibited by increased expression of PDH kinase (PDK) during ischemia/reperfusion injury. This results in decreased utilization of glucose to generate cellular ATP. Post-cardiac arrest (CA) hypothermia improves outcomes and alters metabolism, but its influence on PDH and PDK activity following CA are unknown. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following CA is associated with the inhibition of PDK activity and increased PDH activity. We further hypothesized that an inhibitor of PDK activity, dichloroacetate (DCA), would improve PDH activity and post-CA outcomes. Methods and results Anesthetized and ventilated adult female C57BL/6 wild-type mice underwent a 12-minute KCl-induced CA followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Compared to normothermic (37°C) CA controls, administering TH (30°C) improved overall survival (72-hour survival rate: 62.5% vs. 28.6%, P<0.001), post-resuscitation myocardial function (ejection fraction: 50.9±3.1% vs. 27.2±2.0%, P<0.001; aorta systolic pressure: 132.7±7.3 vs. 72.3±3.0 mmHg, P<0.001), and neurological scores at 72-hour post CA (9.5±1.3 vs. 5.4±1.3, P<0.05). In both heart and brain, CA increased lactate concentrations (1.9-fold and 3.1-fold increase, respectively, P<0.01), decreased PDH enzyme activity (24% and 50% reduction, respectively, P<0.01), and increased PDK protein expressions (1.2-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, P<0.01). In contrast, post-CA treatment with TH normalized lactate concentrations (P<0.01 and P<0.05) and PDK expressions (P<0.001 and P<0.05), while increasing PDH activity (P<0.01 and P<0.01) in both the heart and brain. Additionally, treatment with DCA (0.2 mg/g body weight) 30 min prior to CA improved both myocardial hemodynamics 2 hours post-CA (aortic systolic pressure: 123±3 vs. 96±4 mmHg, P<0.001) and 72-hour survival rates (50% vs. 19%, P<0.05) in normothermic animals. Conclusions Enhanced PDH activity in the setting of TH or DCA administration is associated with improved post-CA resuscitation outcomes. PDH is a promising therapeutic target for improving post-CA outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2757751668,"The early Cambrian Guanshan biota of eastern Yunnan, China, contains exceptionally preserved animals and algae. Most diverse and abundant are the arthropods, of which there are at least 11 species of trilobites represented by numerous specimens. Many trilobite specimens show soft-body preservation via iron oxide pseudomorphs of pyrite replacement. Here we describe digestive structures from two species of trilobite, Palaeolenus lantenoisi and Redlichia mansuyi. Multiple specimens of both species contain the preserved remains of an expanded stomach region (a “crop”) under the glabella, a structure which has not been observed in trilobites this old, despite numerous examples of trilobite gut traces from other Cambrian Lagerstätten. In addition, at least one specimen of Palaeolenus lantenoisi shows the preservation of an unusual combination of digestive structures: a crop and paired digestive glands along the alimentary tract. This combination of digestive structures has also never been observed in trilobites this old, and is rare in general, with prior evidence of it from one juvenile trilobite specimen from the late Cambrian Orsten fauna of Sweden and possibly one adult trilobite specimen from the Early Ordovician Fezouata Lagerstätte. The variation in the fidelity of preservation of digestive structures within and across different Lagerstätten may be due to variation in the type, quality, and point of digestion of food among specimens in addition to differences in mode of preservation. The presence and combination of these digestive features in the Guanshan trilobites contradicts current models of how the trilobite digestive system was structured and evolved over time. Most notably, the crop is not a derived structure as previously proposed, although it is possible that the relative size of the crop increased over the evolutionary history of the clade."
https://openalex.org/W2757268310,"The pear is an important temperate fruit worldwide that is produced by a group of species in the genus Pyrus. Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana Decne) is characterized by high resistance to multiple diseases, good adaptability, and high ornamental value, and is therefore widely planted in pear orchards for edible fruit production or as stock. Plant pathogens are a major threat to pear yield. Black spot disease, caused by the filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata, is one of the most serious diseases in pear. Elucidation of resistant genes to black spot disease is extremely important for understanding the underlying mechanisms as well as for the development of resistant cultivars. In this study, high-throughput single-strand RNA-sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome profiles of Callery pear leaves before and after A. alternata incubation for 7 days. The analysis yielded 73.3 Gb of clean data that were mapped onto the reference genome of the Chinese pear, and differentially expressed gene(DEG)s were identified with |log2FC| ≥ 1. Functional annotation demonstrated that black spot disease promoted great changes in the overall metabolism, and enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms showed that most of them are closely linked to signalling network and photosynthesis. Specifically, the genes included mainly transcription factors and genes involved in calcium signalling and ethylene and jasmonate pathways. Eight members of the ethylene response factor transcription factor gene family Group IX, including ERF1, ERF7, and ERF105, were up-regulated to 2.03–3.37-fold compared with CK, suggesting their role in the defence response to pathogen infection. Additionally, multiple transcription factors involved in biotic stresses, such as NAC78, NAC2, MYB44, and bHLH28, were up-regulated. Furthermore, we identified 144 long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, providing new insight into the involvement of lncRNAs in the response to black spot disease. Our study provides valuable data on the molecular genetics and functional genomic mechanisms of resistance to black spot disease in Callery pear. A good understanding of the molecular response to this disease will allow the development of durable and environmentally friendly control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2758813973,"CcmK proteins are major constituents of icosahedral shells of β-carboxysomes, a bacterial microcompartment that plays a key role for CO2 fixation in nature. Supported by the characterization of bidimensional (2D) layers of packed CcmK hexamers in crystal and electron microscopy structures, CcmK are assumed to be the major components of icosahedral flat facets. Here, we reassessed the validity of this model by studying CcmK isoforms from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Native mass spectrometry studies confirmed that CcmK are hexamers in solution. Interestingly, potential pre-assembled intermediates were also detected with CcmK2. Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) imaging under quasi-physiological conditions confirmed the formation of canonical flat sheets with CcmK4. Conversely, CcmK2 formed both canonical and striped-patterned patches, while CcmK1 assembled into remarkable supra-hexameric curved honeycomb-like mosaics. Mutational studies ascribed the propensity of CcmK1 to form round assemblies to a combination of two features shared by at least one CcmK isoform in most β-cyanobacteria: a displacement of an α helical portion towards the hexamer edge, where a potential phosphate binding funnel forms between packed hexamers, and the presence of a short C-terminal extension in CcmK1. All-atom molecular dynamics supported a contribution of phosphate molecules sandwiched between hexamers to bend CcmK1 assemblies. Formation of supra-hexameric curved structures could be reproduced in coarse-grained simulations, provided that adhesion forces to the support were weak. Apart from uncovering unprecedented CcmK self-assembly features, our data suggest the possibility that transitions between curved and flat assemblies, following cargo maturation, could be important for the biogenesis of β-carboxysomes, possibly also of other BMC."
https://openalex.org/W2759119544,"To evaluate causes and impact of delay in the door-to-balloon (D2B) time for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).From January 2009 to December 2012, 1268 patients (86% male, mean age of 58 ± 12 years) presented to our hospital for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent PPCI. They were divided into two groups: Non-delay defined as D2B time ≤ 90 mins and delay group defined as D2B time > 90 mins. Data were collected retrospectively on baseline clinical characteristics, mode of presentation, angiographic findings, therapeutic modality and inhospital outcome.202 patients had delay in D2B time. There were more female patients in the delay group. They were older and tend to self-present to hospital. They were less likely to be smokers and have a higher prevalence of prior MI. The incidence of posterior MI was higher in the delay group. They also had a higher incidence of triple vessel disease. The 3 most common reasons for D2B delay was delay in the emergency department (39%), atypical clinical presentation (37.6%) and unstable medical condition requiring stabilisation/computed tomographic imaging (26.7%). The inhospital mortality was numerically higher in the delay group (7.4% versus 4.8%, p = 0.12).Delay in D2B occurred in 16% of our patients undergoing PPCI. Several key factors for delay were identified and warrant further intervention."

SLE associated with cardiovascular disease is one of the most important causes of death. In this study, we demonstrated that Lactobacillus paracasei GMNL-32 (GMNL-32), a probiotic species, exhibits anti-fibrosis and anti-apoptotic effects on the cardiac tissue of NZB/WF1 mice. Female NZB/W F1 mice, a well-known and commonly used lupus-prone mouse strain, were treated with or without GMNL-32 administration for 12 weeks. Oral administration of GMNL-32 to NZB/WF1 mice significantly increased the ventricular thickness when compared to that of NZB/WF1 mice. Administration of GMNL-32 significantly attenuated the cardiac cell apoptosis that was observed in exacerbate levels in the control NZB/WF1 mice. Further, the cellular morphology that was slightly distorted in the NZB/WF1 was effectively alleviated in the treatment group mice. In addition, GMNL-32 reduced the level of Fas death receptor-related pathway of apoptosis signaling and enhanced anti-apoptotic proteins. These results indicate that GMNL-32 exhibit an effective protective effect on cardiac cells of SLE mice. Thus, GMNL-32 may be a potential therapeutic strategy against SLE associated arthrosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2758053042,"The aim of this study was to examine the contamination of game meat with copper and zinc and establish whether the use of alternative (non-lead) ammunition can lead to higher or unsafe levels of copper and zinc in the meat of roe deer, wild boar and red deer. The research project “Safety of game meat obtained through hunting” (LEMISI) was conducted in Germany with the purpose of examining the entry of lead as well as copper and zinc into the meat of hunted game when using either lead or non-lead ammunition. The outcome of this study shows that the usage of both lead-based ammunition and alternative non-lead ammunition results in the entry of copper and zinc into the edible parts of the game. Using non-lead ammunition does not entail dangerously elevated levels of copper and zinc, so replacing lead ammunition with alternative ammunition does not introduce a further health problem with regard to these metals. The levels of copper and zinc in game meat found in this study are in the range found in previous studies of game. The content of copper and zinc in game meat is also comparable to those regularly detected in meat and its products from livestock (pig, cattle, sheep) for which the mean human consumption rate is much higher. From the viewpoint of consumer health protection, the use of non-lead ammunition does not pose an additional hazard through copper and zinc contamination. A health risk due to the presence of copper and zinc in game meat at typical levels of consumer exposure is unlikely for both types of ammunition."
https://openalex.org/W2758668477,"The contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is unclear. The LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-p53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) tumor model, which is widely utilized to faithfully recapitulate human pancreatic cancer, depends on Cre-mediated recombination in the epithelial lineage to drive tumorigenesis. Therefore, specific Cre-loxP recombination in stromal cells cannot be applied in this model, limiting the in vivo investigation of stromal genetics in tumor initiation and progression. To address this issue, we generated a new Pdx1FlpO knock-in mouse line, which represents the first mouse model to physiologically express FlpO recombinase in pancreatic epithelial cells. This mouse specifically recombines Frt loci in pancreatic epithelial cells, including acinar, ductal, and islet cells. When combined with the Frt-STOP-Frt KrasG12D and p53Frt mouse lines, simultaneous Pdx1FlpO activation of mutant Kras and deletion of p53 results in the spectrum of pathologic changes seen in PDAC, including PanIN lesions and ductal carcinoma. Combination of this KPF mouse model with any stroma-specific Cre can be used to conditionally modify target genes of interest. This will provide an excellent in vivo tool to study the roles of genes in different cell types and multiple cell compartments within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2759434309,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain tumor in adults. It is known that amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) occurs in approximately 40% of GBM, leading to enhanced activation of the EGFR signaling pathway and promoting tumor growth. Although GBM mutations are stably maintained in GBM in vitro models, rapid loss of EGFR gene amplification is a common observation during cell culture. To maintain EGFR amplification in vitro, heterotopic GBM xenografts with elevated EGFR copy number were cultured under varying serum conditions and EGF concentrations. EGFR copy numbers were assessed over several passages by quantitative PCR and chromogenic in situ hybridization. As expected, in control assays with 10% FCS, cells lost EGFR amplification with increasing passage numbers. However, cells cultured under serum free conditions stably maintained elevated copy numbers. Furthermore, EGFR protein expression positively correlated with genomic amplification levels. Although elevated EGFR copy numbers could be maintained over several passages in vitro, levels of EGFR amplification were variable and dependent on the EGF concentration in the medium. In vitro cultures of GBM cells with elevated EGFR copy number and corresponding EGFR protein expression should prove valuable preclinical tools to gain a better understanding of EGFR driven glioblastoma and assist in the development of new improved therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2756831021,"Alterations in myocardial structure and reduced cardiomyocyte adhesions have been previously described in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We studied the transcriptome of cell adhesion molecules in these patients and their relationships with left ventricular (LV) function decay. We also visualized the intercalated disc (ID) structure and organization. The transcriptomic profile of 23 explanted LV samples was analyzed using RNA-sequencing (13 DCM, 10 control [CNT]), focusing on cell adhesion genes. Electron microscopy analysis to visualize ID structural differences and immunohistochemistry experiments of ID proteins was also performed. RT-qPCR and western blot experiments were carried out on ID components. We found 29 differentially expressed genes, most of all, constituents of the ID structure. We found that the expression of GJA3, DSP and CTNNA3 was directly associated with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.741, P = 0.004; r = 0.674, P = 0.011 and r = 0.565, P = 0.044, respectively), LV systolic (P = 0.003, P = 0.003, P = 0.028, respectively) and diastolic dimensions (P = 0.006, P = 0.001, P = 0.025, respectively). Electron microscopy micrographs showed a reduced ID convolution index and immunogold labeling of connexin 46 (GJA gene), desmoplakin (DSP gene) and catenin α-3 (CTNNA3 gene) proteins in DCM patients. Moreover, we observed that protein and mRNA levels analyzed by RT-qPCR of these ID components were diminished in DCM group. In conclusion, we report significant gene and protein expression changes and found that the ID components GJA3, DSP and CTNNA3 were highly related to LV function. Microscopic observations indicated that ID is structurally compromised in these patients. These findings give new data for understanding the ventricular depression that characterizes DCM, opening new therapeutic perspectives for these critically diseased patients."
https://openalex.org/W2758149521,"Xuezhikang (XZK), an extract of Chinese red yeast rice, is recommended as an optimal choice for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) with markedly elevated triglyceride (TG) levels. This study was designed to compare the hypotriglyceridemic effects between XZK and simvastatin. The role of apolipoprotein A5 (apoA5), a key regulator of TG metabolism and a target gene of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), was to be identified in XZK-related hypotriglyceridemic actions. For these goals, hypertriglyceridemia of rats was induced by a high-fructose diet. In order to investigate the hypotriglyceridemic effects of XZK and simvastatin on these animals based on an equivalent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering power, we titrated their doses (XZK 80 mg/kg/d versus simvastatin 1 mg/kg/d) according to plasma LDL-C reduction of rats. Similarly, we titrated the target doses of the two agents (XZK 500 μg/ml versus simvastatin 10 μM) according to hepatocyte LDL receptor expressions, and then compared the effects of the two agents on TG and apoA5 of hepatocytes in vitro. Our results showed that XZK (80 mg/kg/d) had higher hypotriglyceridemic performance than simvastatin (1 mg/kg/d) on these animals albeit their equivalent LDL-C lowering power. Higher plasma apoA5 levels and hepatic apoA5 expressions were observed in rats treated with XZK (80 mg/kg/d) than simvastatin (1 mg/kg/d). Further, XZK (80 mg/kg/d) contributed to higher hepatic PPARα expressions of rats than simvastatin (1 mg/kg/d). Although the two agents led to an equivalent up-regulation of LDL receptors of hepatocytes, more TG reduction and apoA5 elevation were detected in hepatocytes treated with XZK (500 μg/ml) than simvastatin (10 μM). However, PPARα knockdown eliminated the above effects of XZK on hepatocytes. Therefore, our study indicates that XZK has greater hypotriglyceridemic performance than simvastatin in the setting of an equivalent LDL-C lowering power, which is attributed to more apoA5 up-regulation by this agent via the PPARα signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2758196363,"Cholera remains an important public health problem in many low- and middle-income countries. Vaccination has been recommended as a possible intervention for the prevention and control of cholera. Evidence, especially data on disease burden, cost-of-illness, delivery costs and cost-effectiveness to support a wider use of vaccine is still weak. This study aims at estimating the cost-of-illness of cholera to households and health facilities in Machinga and Zomba Districts, Malawi. A cross-sectional study using retrospectively collected cost data was undertaken in this investigation. One hundred patients were purposefully selected for the assessment of the household cost-of-illness and four cholera treatment centres and one health facility were selected for the assessment conducted in health facilities. Data collected for the assessment in households included direct and indirect costs borne by cholera patients and their families while only direct costs were considered for the assessment conducted in health facilities. Whenever possible, descriptive and regression analysis were used to assess difference in mean costs between groups of patients. The average costs to patients’ households and health facilities for treating an episode of cholera amounted to US$65.6 and US$59.7 in 2016 for households and health facilities, respectively equivalent to international dollars (I$) 249.9 and 227.5 the same year. Costs incurred in treating a cholera episode were proportional to duration of hospital stay. Moreover, 52% of households used coping strategies to compensate for direct and indirect costs imposed by the disease. Both households and health facilities could avert significant treatment expenditures through a broader use of pre-emptive cholera vaccination. These findings have direct policy implications regarding priority investments for the prevention and control of cholera."
https://openalex.org/W2759425522,"A novel symmetrical split ring resonator (SSRR) based microwave sensor with spurline filters for detecting and characterizing the properties of solid materials has been developed. Due to the weak perturbation in the interaction of material under test (MUT) and planar microwave sensor, spurline filters were embedded to the SSRR microwave sensor which effectively enhanced Q-factor with suppressing the undesired harmonic frequency. The spurline filter structures force the presented sensor to resonate at a fundamental frequency of 2.2 GHz with the capabilities of suppressing rejected harmonic frequency and miniaturization in circuit size. A wide bandwidth rejection is achieved by using double spurlines filters with high Q-factor achievement (up to 652.94) compared to single spurline filter. The new SSRR sensor with spurline filters displayed desired properties such as high sensitivity, accuracy, and performance with a 1.3% typical percentage error in the measurement results. Furthermore, the sensor has been successfully applied for detecting and characterizing solid materials (such as Roger 5880, Roger 4350, and FR4) and evidently demonstrated that it can suppress the harmonic frequency effectively. This novel design with harmonic suppression is useful for various applications such as food industry (meat, fruit, vegetables), biological medicine (derived from proteins and other substances produced by the body), and Therapeutic goods (antiseptics, vitamins, anti-psychotics, and other medicines)."
https://openalex.org/W2759883058,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause for dementia in human. Currently, more than 46 million people in the world suffer from AD and it is estimated that by 2050 this number increases to more than 131 million. AD is considered as a complex disease. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of AD is a universal challenge. Nowadays, a huge number of disease-related high-throughput “omics” datasets are freely available. Such datasets contain valuable information about disease-related pathways and their corresponding gene interactions. In the present work, a three-way interaction model is used as a novel approach to understand AD-related mechanisms. This model can trace the dynamic nature of co-expression relationship between two genes by introducing their link to a third gene. Apparently, such relationships cannot be traced by the classical two-way interaction model. Liquid association method was applied to capture the statistically significant triplets which are involved in three-way interaction. Subsequently, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene regulatory network (GRN) inference were applied to analyze the biological relevance of the statistically significant triplets. The results of this study suggest that the innate immunity processes are important in AD. Specifically, our results suggest that H2-Ob as the switching gene and the gene pair {Csf1r, Milr1} form a statistically significant and biologically relevant triplet, which may play an important role in AD. We propose that the homeostasis-related link between mast cells and microglia is presumably controlled with H2-Ob expression levels as a switching gene."
https://openalex.org/W2758444622,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in children and young adults. The median survival of osteosarcoma patients has not significantly improved since 1990, despite administration of different classes of chemotherapy agents, such as methotrexate, cisplatin and doxorubicin. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the resistance of osteosarcoma to chemotherapy and OCT4, SOX2 and SSEA4 have been used to identify CSCs in osteosarcoma. Here, we used low-passage patient-derived osteosarcoma cells and osteosarcoma cells directly isolated from patients before and after chemotherapy treatments to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy on stem cell markers expression. We demonstrate that primary osteosarcoma cells are resistant to methotrexate treatment and sensitive to cisplatin and doxorubicin in vitro. We also verified that cisplatin and doxorubicin reduce the expression of SOX2 and OCT4 in primary osteosarcoma cells whereas methotrexate does not alter SOX2 and OCT4 expression, however it increases SSEA4 expression in primary osteosarcoma cells. Finally, we found that, although the combination treatment cisplatin plus doxorubicin inhibited the in vivo growth of osteosarcoma cells in NOD-SCID gamma mice subcutaneously injected with SaOs2, the combination treatment cisplatin plus doxorubicin plus methotrexate did not inhibit the in vivo growth of these cells. These observations may provide an explanation for the poor response of osteosarcomas to chemotherapy and point to the need of reevaluating the therapeutic strategies for human osteosarcomas."

The aim of this work was (i) to provide information about abundance and temporal dynamics of this Larroussius species in a hot spot area of visceral leishmaniasis in Tunisia, (ii) to detect L. infantum DNA in wild caught female sandflies and (iii) to measure Phlebotomus perniciosus infection rate throughout the active season. Sandflies were collected monthly during one year using CDC miniature light-traps in house and in animal shelters. Male specimens were identified at species level according to morphological characters. Female specimens were conserved individually for molecular study. Leishmania infection was tested by kinetoplast DNA real-time PCR and ITS-1 PCR-sequencing. Subsequent sandfly species identification of infected specimens was done by mitochondrial cytochrome b sequencing. In one year period, overall 4,441 specimens (2230 males and 2211 females) were collected. Sandfly activity started in end-April and ended in early-November. Mean sandfly density in house was significantly lower than in animal shelters (51 ± 50 versus 504 ± 460 sandflies /CDC night, p<0.05). However, a higher proportion of females was found in house (58.4% versus 49.2%, p<0.001). Based on species identification of male specimens, Phlebotomus perniciosus was the dominant species (56% of the whole male sandfly fauna, p<0.0001). It showed two peaks of density in the active season, a sharp one in early May and a higher long lasting one from end-July to end-September. DNA was extracted from 190 female specimens randomly sampled and corresponding to 96 specimens from house and 94 from animal shelters. Twenty four female sandfly were infected by Leishmania infantum. All infected specimens were recognized as Phlebotomus perniciosus. Leishmania infantum infection rate in female sandflies was 2.3 fold higher in house than in animal shelters (17.7% versus 7.4%, p<0.05). In house, estimated number of infected specimens was the highest at the end of the active season. Abundance, dynamics of density and Leishmania infantum infection prevalence of Phlebotomus perniciosus in Tunisian hot spot of visceral leishmaniasis highlight the major role of this Phlebotominae species in L. infantum transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2758522164,"Background Electroencephalography (EEG) can capture the cortical response evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The TMS pulse provokes a large artefact, which obscures the cortical response in the first milliseconds after TMS. Removing this artefact remains a challenge. Methods We delivered monophasic and biphasic TMS to a melon as head phantom and to four healthy participants and recorded the pulse artefact at 5 kHz with a TMS-compatible EEG system. Pulse delivery was either synchronized or non-synchronized to the clock of the EEG recording system. The effects of synchronization were tested at 10 and 20 kHz using the head phantom. We also tested the effect of a soft sheet placed between the stimulation coil and recording electrodes in both human and melon. Results & conclusion Synchronizing TMS and data acquisition markedly reduced trial-to-trial variability of the pulse artefact in recordings from the phantom or from the scalp. Reduced trial-to-trial variability was also observed at high sampling frequencies. The use of a soft sheet reduced the variability in recordings on the head phantom, but not in human participants. Effective reduction of the trial-to-trial variability renders it possible to create an artefact template for off-line filtering. Template-based subtraction of the artefact from the EEG signals is a prerequisite to effectively recover the immediate physiological response in the stimulated cortex and inter-connected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2760175060,"Emotions play a significant role in internal regulatory processes. In this paper, we advocate four key ideas. First, novelty detection can be grounded in the sensorimotor experience and allow higher order appraisal. Second, cognitive processes, such as those involved in self-assessment, influence emotional states by eliciting affects like boredom and frustration. Third, emotional processes such as those triggered by self-assessment influence attentional processes. Last, close emotion-cognition interactions implement an efficient feedback loop for the purpose of top-down behavior regulation. The latter is what we call ‘Emotional Metacontrol’. We introduce a model based on artificial neural networks. This architecture is used to control a robotic system in a visual search task. The emotional metacontrol intervenes to bias the robot visual attention during active object recognition. Through a behavioral and statistical analysis, we show that this mechanism increases the robot performance and fosters the exploratory behavior to avoid deadlocks."
https://openalex.org/W2759240469,"Objectives To investigate the association between fetal growth between first and early second trimester ultrasound scan and the risk of severe small for gestational age (SGA) birth. Methods This cohort study included 69 550 singleton pregnancies with first trimester dating and an early second trimester growth scan in Stockholm and Gotland Counties, Sweden between 2008 and 2014. Exposure was difference in biparietal diameter growth between observed and expected at the second trimester scan, calculated by z-scores. Risk of birth of a severe SGA infant (birth weight for gestational age by fetal sex less than the 3rd centile) was calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis and presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Results Parietal growth less than 2.5 percentile between first and second trimester ultrasound examination was associated with elevated risk of being born severe SGA. (aOR 1.67; 95% Confidence Interval 1.28–2.18). The risks of preterm severe SGA (birth before 37 weeks) and term severe SGA (birth 37 weeks or later) were at similar levels, and risk of severe SGA were also elevated in the absence of preeclampsia, hypertensive diseases or gestational diabetes. Conclusions Fetuses with slow growth of biparietal diameter at ultrasound examination in early second trimester exhibit increased risk of being born SGA independent of gestational age at birth and presence of maternal hypertensive diseases or diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2756791650,"Hereditary Huntington’s disease (HD) is associated with progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. A primary consequence of the HD mutation is the preferential loss of medium spiny projection cells with relative sparing of local interneurons in the striatum. In addition, among GABAergic striatal projection cells, indirect pathway cells expressing D2 dopamine receptors are lost earlier than direct pathway cells expressing D1 receptors. To test in vivo the functional integrity of direct and indirect pathways as well as interneurons in the striatum of male R6/1 transgenic mice, we assessed their c-Fos expression levels induced by a striatal-dependent cognitive task and compared them with age-matched wild-type littermates. We found a significant increase of c-Fos+ nuclei in the dorsomedial striatum, and this only at 2 months, when our HD mouse model is still pre-motor symptomatic, the increase disappearing with symptom manifestation. Contrary to our expectation, the indirect pathway projection neurons did not undergo any severer changes of c-Fos expression regardless of age in R6/1 mice. We also found a decreased activation of interneurons that express parvalbumin in the dorsomedial striatum at both presymptomatic and symptomatic ages. Finally, analysis of c-Fos expression in extended brain regions involved in the cognitive learning used in our study, demonstrates, throughout ages studied, changes in the functional connectivity between regions in the transgenic mice. Further analysis of the cellular and molecular changes underlying the transient striatal hyperactivity in the HD mice may help to understand the mechanisms involved in the disease onset."
https://openalex.org/W2757252398,"The physics of wound and unwound strings on the electric guitar are presented here, and the pitch intervals produced by the movements of a Fender Stratocaster tremolo unit are explained. Predicted changes in pitch sensitivity of different strings are given, and experimentally verified, for changes in saddle height, the distance of string free to move behind the nut and ratio of diameters/masses of the core and windings of wound strings. Also, it is shown that changes to the gauge of strings (assuming the string tension is sufficient for linear behaviour and in absence of changes to other construction details) don't alter the pitch intervals produced by a given angle of tremolo arm use assuming the instrument is set up with the same sounding pitches and starting bridge angle. It is demonstrated that it not possible to equalise the relative sensitivity of unwound steel stings on a Fender Stratocaster type tremolo unit through string construction techniques. The ratio of core to winding mass in the string, on the other hand, was found to be a very powerful design parameter for choosing the sensitivity of the string to tremolo arm use and standard pitch bends. For instance, the pitch intervals produced by operation of tremolo arm for wound strings may be made to approximately match that for one of the unwound strings if they share very similar core gauges (assuming the winding masses are chosen to give approximately the same tension at their sounding pitches). Such a design, only available currently by custom order, also delivers the optimum equalisation in sensitivity of strings for standard string bends (due to these also being produced by altering the length of the string to generate changes in tension and therefore pitch)."
https://openalex.org/W2758277684,"Malaria continues to be a devastating disease, largely caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. We investigated the effects of opioid and cannabinoid receptor antagonists on the growth of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. The delta opioid receptor antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX) and the cannabinoid receptor antagonists rimonaband and SR144528 caused growth arrest of the parasite. Notably BNTX and the established antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin induced prominent pyknosis in parasite cells after a short period of incubation. We compared genome-wide transcriptome profiles in P. falciparum with different degrees of pyknosis in response to drug treatment, and identified 11 transcripts potentially associated with the evoking of pyknosis, of which three, including glutathione reductase (PfGR), triose phosphate transporter (PfoTPT), and a conserved Plasmodium membrane protein, showed markedly different gene expression levels in accordance with the degree of pyknosis. Furthermore, the use of specific inhibitors confirmed PfGR but not PfoTPT as a possible factor contributing to the development of pyknosis. A reduction in total glutathione levels was also detected in association with increased pyknosis. These results further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for P. falciparum development and the antimalarial activity of dihydroartemisinin, and provide useful information for the development of novel antimalarial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2759841303,"Histidine-Proline-rich Glycoprotein (HPRG) is a plasma protein of vertebrates and several marine bivalves. Due to its multidomain structure consisting of several regions HPRG can interact with a variety of ligands, however the exact physiological role has not been discovered yet. Past purification approaches out of plasma or serum often led to co-purification of other proteins so that for a profound understanding of the function it is important to obtain a protein of high purity. Recent purification strategies were based upon metale chelate affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography or size exclusion chromatography, respectively. A large amount of serum albumin, the major plasma protein, also elutes from metale chelate affinity chromatography columns. Separation of rabbit HPRG from rabbit serum albumin could not be achieved via the above named methods by us. We present a method of purification of rabbit serum HPRG by means of metal affinity chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis, which makes it possible to obtain HPRG practically devoid of impurities as assessed by mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, we characterize the amount of glycosylation of HPRG and–to the best of our knowledge for the first time–the glycosylation pattern of rabbit HPRG."
https://openalex.org/W2760625318,"Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) increasingly absorb knowledge from Hard Sciences, i.e., Science, Technology, Agriculture and Medicine (STAM), as testified by a growing number of citations. However, whether citing more Hard Sciences brings more citations to HSS remains to be investigated. Based on China’s HSS articles indexed by the Web of Science during 1998–2014, this paper estimated two-way fixed effects negative binomial models, with journal effects and year effects. Findings include: (1) An inverse U-shaped curve was observed between the percentage of STAM references to the HSS articles and the number of citations they received; (2) STAM contributed increasing knowledge to China’s HSS, while Science and Technology knowledge contributed more citations to HSS articles. It is recommended that research policy should be adjusted to encourage HSS researchers to adequately integrate STAM knowledge when conducting interdisciplinary research, as over-cited STAM knowledge may jeopardize the readability of HSS articles."
https://openalex.org/W2757263905,"Our aim was to develop a new experimental model for in vivo hyperthermia using non-directional microwaves, applicable to small experimental animals. We present an affordable approach for targeted microwave heat delivery to an isolated liver lobe in rat, which allows rapid, precise and stable tissue temperature control.A new experimental model is proposed. We used a commercial available magnetron generating 2450 MHz, with 4.4V and 14A in the filament and 4500V anodic voltage. Modifications were required in order to adjust tissue heating such as to prevent overheating and to allow for fine adjustments according to real-time target temperature. The heating is controlled using a virtual instrument application implemented in LabView® and responds to 0.1° C variations in the target. Ten healthy adult male Wistar rats, weighing 250-270 g were used in this study. The middle liver lobe was the target for controlled heating, while the rest of the living animal was protected.In vivo microwave delivery using our experimental setting is safe for the animals. Target tissue temperature rises from 30°C to 40°C with 3.375°C / second (R2 = 0.9551), while the increment is lower it the next two intervals (40-42°C and 42-44°C) with 0.291°C/ s (R2 = 0.9337) and 0.136°C/ s (R2 = 0.7894) respectively, when testing in sequences. After reaching the desired temperature, controlled microwave delivery insures a very stable temperature during the experiments.We have developed an inexpensive and easy to manufacture system for targeted hyperthermia using non-directional microwave radiation. This system allows for fine and stable temperature adjustments within the target tissue and is ideal for experimental models testing below or above threshold hyperthermia."
https://openalex.org/W2759676050,"A recent study found that three recurrent deletions of X chromosome linked copy number variations (CNVs), CNV64, CNV67 and CNV69 were associated with idiopathic male infertility in Spanish and Italian populations, especially CNV67 resembling the azoospermia factor deletions. That merits further investigations among different populations. This study was conducted to examine the prevalence of the three CNVs deletions and their associations with idiopathic male infertility in Chinese Han population. The present study included a large population of 1550 Chinese Han subjects recruited between 2014 and 2016. In total, 714 infertile participants were diagnosed as idiopathic infertility with different conditions (288 with non-obstructive azoospermia, 210 oligozoospermia and 216 asthenospermia) and 836 fertile participants (vasectomized men). The fertile participants were recruited from the representative areas: the north (Hebei and Shanxi), center (Hubei and Jiangsu), and south (Guangdong) of China. All patients were recruited from Hubei province. A multiplex PCR system was established to screen the deletion of the three CNVs, and deletion was confirmed by general PCR. Similar rates of these deletions were observed in infertile men and fertile participants (Hubei), and among the different conditions of infertility. Moreover, CNV64 and CNV67 map distribution geographically differed across China. The three CNVs in fertile groups of other regions were similar, except for Guangdong. No association between the three CNVs deletions and idiopathic male infertility was observed. CNV67 is rare in central China, albeit large sample size study for confirmation is warranted. It seems that the association between these CNVs deletions and idiopathic male infertility is ethnic dependent. There is still need to screen the CNVs deletions in other ethnicities. We suggested to consider the stratification patterns and geographic differences when prescribing CNVs deletions screening as a test in male infertility."
