https://openalex.org/W2009371644,"A phylogenetic comparison of the protein sequences of 146 genes from 14 deuterostome species has come up with a result that could alter current thinking on the origin of the vertebrates. Based on overall morphology and on complexity, it was thought that the cephalochordates (marine organisms known as lancelets, or in old textbooks as amphioxus) were the vertebrates' closest living relatives. Closer than the tunicates (appendicularians, salps, and sea squirts), that were regarded as the earliest chordate lineage. But the new data suggest that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, are the closest living relatives of vertebrates. As well as the implications for vertebrate origins, this has a bearing on developmental studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals. Tunicates or urochordates (appendicularians, salps and sea squirts), cephalochordates (lancelets) and vertebrates (including lamprey and hagfish) constitute the three extant groups of chordate animals. Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earliest chordate lineage1,2. This view is mainly justified by overall morphological similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative to tunicates2. Despite their critical importance for understanding the origins of vertebrates3, phylogenetic studies of chordate relationships have provided equivocal results4,5,6,7. Taking advantage of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit with a non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and has important implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals."

Formation of these non–close-packed structures is a consequence of electrostatic effects specific to the nanoscale, where the thickness of the screening layer is commensurate with the dimensions of the assembling objects. Because of electrostatic stabilization of larger crystallizing particles by smaller ones, better-quality crystals can be obtained from more polydisperse nanoparticle solutions."

https://openalex.org/W1519557512,"PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio pulsar during active phases that are 5 to 10 days long. However, when the radio emission ceases, it switches off in less than 10 seconds and remains undetectable for the next 25 to 35 days, then switches on again. This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin of this behavior is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar rotation slows down 50% faster when it is on than when it is off. This indicates a massive increase in magnetospheric currents when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind plays a substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us, for the first time, to estimate the magnetospheric currents in a pulsar magnetosphere during the occurrence of radio emission."
https://openalex.org/W2055176361,"Electronic transport through nanostructures is greatly affected by the presence of superconducting leads. If the interface between the nanostructure and the superconductors is sufficiently transparent, a dissipationless current (supercurrent) can flow through the device due to the Josephson effect. A Josephson coupling, as measured via the zero-resistance supercurrent, has been obtained via tunnel barriers, superconducting constrictions, normal metals, and semiconductors. The coupling mechanisms vary from tunneling to Andreev reflection. The latter process has always occurred via a normal-type system with a continuous density of states. Here we investigate a supercurrent flowing via a discrete density of states, i.e., the quantized single particle energy states of a quantum dot, or artificial atom, placed in between superconducting electrodes. For this purpose, we exploit the quantum properties of finite-sized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). By means of a gate electrode, successive discrete energy states are tuned ON and OFF resonance with the Fermi energy in the superconducting leads, resulting in a periodic modulation of the critical current and a non-trivial correlation between the conductance in the normal state and the supercurrent. We find, in good agreement with existing theory, that the product of the critical current and the normal state resistance becomes an oscillating function, in contrast to being constant as in previously explored regimes."

https://openalex.org/W2129344046,"Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W2039780432,"Tiny transparent larvae of the Japanese eel collected in the open ocean reveal a strategic spawning site. The reproductive cycle of Japanese anguillid eels involves a remarkable journey. The eel's spawning area has now been located with pinpoint accuracy to a spot around a seamount in the Philippine Sea, thousands of kilometres away from their freshwater rivers. The precise positioning of this zone contrasts to the much larger swathe of the Sargasso Sea that attracts European and American anguillid eels, and may have developed in order to place the eel's tiny larvae into the ocean currents that take them to their growth habitat in east Asia. These eels are a popular delicacy in Japan and in the 1990s their population collapsed in the face of growing demand. Better knowledge of the hitherto mysterious spawning patterns of these eels may help in their conservation. Discoveries of the larvae of the European and American eels, Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata, in the Sargasso Sea1,2 and of the Japanese eel, A. japonica, in the Philippine Sea3 indicate that these freshwater eels migrate thousands of kilometres into the open ocean to spawn. Here we pinpoint a spawning location for Japanese eels after genetically identifying newly hatched larvae that we collected from the site. The restricted size of this spawning area ensures that the eel larvae enter a particular current that transports them to the freshwater areas in east Asia where they mature, and it also prevents them from being carried southwards away from their species range by a different local current."

https://openalex.org/W2007630314,"Cellular remodeling during differentiation is essential for lifecycle progression of many unicellular eukaryotic pathogens such as Leishmania, but the mechanisms involved are largely uncharacterized. The role of endosomal sorting in differentiation was analyzed in Leishmania major by overexpression of a dominant-negative ATPase, VPS4. VPS4E235Q accumulated in vesicles from the endocytic pathway, and the mutant L. major was deficient in endosome sorting. Mutant parasites failed to differentiate to the obligate infective metacyclic promastigote form. Furthermore, the autophagy pathway, monitored via the expression of autophagosome marker GFP-ATG8, and shown to normally peak during initiation of metacyclogenesis, was disrupted in the mutants. The defect in late endosome-autophagosome function in the VPS4E235Q parasites made them less able to withstand starvation than wild-type L. major. In addition, a L. major ATG4-deficient mutant was found also to be defective in the ability to differentiate. This finding, that transformation to the infective metacyclic form is dependent on late endosome function and, more directly, autophagy, makes L. major a good model for studying the roles of these processes in differentiation.

Cargo destined for the lysosome/vacuole compartment in eukaryotic cells requires sorting from the biosynthetic, secretory, and endocytic pathways. Transport of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomal compartment involves the delivery of cargo into the endosomal system, which serves as a sorting compartment as well as a collection site for endocytosed materials. The endocytic process, which is important for internalization of portions of the plasma membrane as well as extracellular fluids, involves a number of mechanisms (many of them receptor-mediated), including phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, caveolae, and clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytosis (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). Once internalized, receptor-bound ligands, solutes, and lipids are subject to complex intracellular trafficking pathways and can be recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the lysosomal compartment. The endosomal system itself is complex, and several types of vacuoles have been identified, including late endosomes having a multivesicular aspect and called multivesicular bodies (MVB 2The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; MVT, multivesicular tubule; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; EF1α, elongation factor 1α; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. ; see Refs. 2Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar and references therein for a review). A screen for vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) mutants in yeast led to the discovery of the molecular machinery responsible for MVB formation and, in particular, the class E group of Vps mutants, which contained a large multilamellar cisternal compartment thought to represent an endosome unable to form intraluminal vesicles (3Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 4Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer J.M. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Vps class E proteins are organized in several sub-complexes named “endosomal sorting complexes required for transport” (ESCRT) I, II, and III (5Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Snyder W.B. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 283-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 6Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev.

Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). The ESCRT proteins are recruited from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membrane where they function sequentially in the formation of MVB vesicles and the sorting of proteins into the MVB pathway. It has been proposed that a multimeric AAA-type ATPase, Vps4, binds to ESCRT III and catalyzes the disassembly of this complex in an ATP-dependent manner (9Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This Vps4-dependent dissociation of the ESCRT machinery is the final step of protein sorting into the MVB and is a prerequisite for vesicle formation (6Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The Vps4 homologue in mammals, SKD1, is involved in membrane transport through endosomes and overexpression of a dominant negative mutant, SKD1E235Q, resulted in the production of aberrant endosomes defective in membrane transport between late endosomes and lysosomes (10Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the protozoan parasite Leishmania, as in related kinetoplastid flagellates such as Trypanosoma, there is a complex membrane network highly polarized around the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane where the flagellum emerges from the cell body (11Landfear S.M. Ignatushchenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This is an important zone of interaction between the parasite and its environment, because it is the only site in the cell for endocytosis and exocytosis and so is responsible for crucial exchanges such as uptake of nutrients via receptor-mediated endocytosis (12Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Singh S.B. Patel N. Agarwal S. Mukhopadhyay G. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5884-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and secretion of virulence factors that can interact with the host. Another characteristic of Leishmania parasites is that their promastigote (insect stage) form possesses a rather unusual lysosomal compartment, named the multivesicular tubule (MVT)-lysosome (13Mullin K.A. Foth B.J. Ilgoutz S.C. Callaghan J.M. Zawadzki J.L. McFadden G.I. McConville M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2364-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Weise F. Stierhof Y.D. Kühn C.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This compartment has a low lytic capacity and a relatively high luminal pH in multiplicative procyclic promastigotes but acquires the properties of mature lysosomes as the parasite differentiates into its infective, but non-replicative, metacyclic form (13Mullin K.A. Foth B.J. Ilgoutz S.C. Callaghan J.M. Zawadzki J.L. McFadden G.I. McConville M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2364-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). So far, only a few components of the Leishmania endosomal machinery have been characterized at the molecular level such as earlyendosomal Rab5 (16Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and late-endosomal Rab7 (17Denny P.W. Lewis S. Tempero J.E. Goulding D. Ivens A.C. Field M.C. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, although it has been shown that the MVT-lysosome is downstream of a MVB-like network of vesicular endosomes that surrounds the flagellar pocket (13Mullin K.A. Foth B.J. Ilgoutz S.C. Callaghan J.M. Zawadzki J.L. McFadden G.I. McConville M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2364-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), very little is known about them in Leishmania. Among the pathways involving vesicular traffic in eukaryotic cells is autophagy, a process that is important for protein and organelle degradation during cellular differentiation and also as a defense against starvation conditions (18Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). The autophagic pathways of yeast and mammals have been characterized, and, although they have many common features, they appear to differ in some ways (19Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004Google Scholar, 20Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Central to the process in both is a vesicular compartment called the autophagosome, which is formed by a membranous structure that engulfs the cytoplasm/organelles that are to be degraded. The genesis of autophagosomal structures requires the activity of two protein conjugation systems, one involving ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 proteolytically processed by Atg4, and a second involving ubiquitin-like protein Atg12, covalently attached to Atg5 (18Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar, 20Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 21Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The autophagosome delivers the internalized material to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. It seems that, at least in mammals, but perhaps not in yeast, autophagosomes first fuse with endosomal vesicles (22Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 23Nara A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Shirahama K. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus in this case, the autophagosome requires strong interactions with the endosomal compartments to reach its full degradative potential. Among the cellular functions proposed for autophagy is a role in the architectural changes occurring during development and differentiation, although experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is not extensive (18Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Recent reports, however, have shown that stress-induced differentiation is impaired in autophagy mutants of Dictyostelium discoideum (25Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17636-17645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (26Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), and even yeast, where autophagy genes seem to be important for sporulation (27Deutschbauer A.M. Williams R.M. Chu A.M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15530-15535Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the function of MVBs in Leishmania major by characterizing the leishmanial Vps4 homologue. A dominantnegative VPS4 mutant (VPS4E235Q) accumulated the mutated protein around vesicular structures of the endocytic system and showed a defect in transport to the MVT-lysosome. This is similar to what has been observed in yeast and mammalian Vps4 mutants, suggesting a conservation of role for this protein in MVB architecture from the early branching kinetoplastid flagellate lineage to mammals. Moreover, L. major-overexpressing VPS4E235Q were impaired in their differentiation in culture and their resistance to starvation, suggesting a crucial role for VPS4 and the MVB compartment in these processes. In addition, by demonstrating the presence of autophagosomes in Leishmania using ATG8 as a marker and showing that these structures accumulated and were not functional in the VPS4E235Q mutant, we have revealed that the autophagic pathway is intimately involved with the endosomal system. Production of an L. major ATG4.2 null mutant, which could not undergo metacyclogenesis, further confirms that the lack of a functional autophagic pathway correlates with, and probably mediates, the differentiation defect of the VPS4 mutant parasite that impairs its virulence. Parasites—L. major (MHOM/JL/80/Friedlin) promastigotes were grown in modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (designated complete HOMEM medium) at 25 °C. Metacyclic promastigotes were isolated by the peanut agglutinin method (28Sacks D.L. Hieny S. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 564-569PubMed Google Scholar) from cultures that had been in stationary growth phase for 2-5 days. When referring to the stage of growth of the different cell lines throughout this report, early log phase corresponds to ∼5 × 105 parasites/ml and mid-log phase to ∼5 × 106 parasites/ml. Early stationary phase corresponds to ∼9 × 106 parasites/ml for pXG-VPS4E235Q and to ∼2 × 107 parasites/ml for pXG-VPS4 or wild type L. major. Unless otherwise stated, the pXG-VPS4 and pXG-VPS4E235Q cell lines were maintained in culture with 12.5 μg/ml G418. Generation of VPS4-expressing L. major Cell Lines—LmjVPS4 was obtained by PCR from L. major genomic DNA with primers OL1478 and OL1479 (Table 1) containing PvuII and BamHI sites, respectively. The 1340-bp fragment was then digested by PvuII/BamHI and cloned into SmaI/BamHI-digested pXG vector (29Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pXG-VPS4. Plasmid expressing LmjVPS4E235Q was produced by site-directed mutagenesis of pXG-VPS4, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers OL1480 and OL1481 to yield plasmid pXG-VPS4E235Q.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyOL14785′-CAATTCAGCTGATGTCCGTCGACTTCAC-′OL14795′-CTCATGGATCCTTAGCCCTCCTGACCA-3′OL14805′-CCATCATCTTTGTGGATCAGATCGACTCTCTCGTC-3′OL14815′-GACGAGAGAGTCGATCTGATCCACAAAGATGATGG-3′OL15435′-CTCATAAGATCTATGTCCGTCGACTTCA-3′OL15445′-CACAAGGGTACCTTAGCCCTCCTGACCA-3′OL15065′-ACCTCGAGATCTATGTCTTCCAGAGTA-3′OL15075′-GCCATTCTCGAGCTAGTGCAGCCCCTGC-3′NT1585′-CATATGCTCCGCTACGTGCAAGATT-3′NT1595′-CTCGAGATCCAGATACTCCCACGAA-3′NT1685′-AAGCTTGGTGTGGTGTGCGTGCGTCACGAGCCTCTGT-3′NT1695′-GTCGACCGATGTATGCTGGGGCAGGGAGGGAGGGCA-3′NT1705′-CCCGGGTGATGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTCCACGCGCCCA-3′NT1715′-AGATCTAAAAGAGGCATGTGCGCCAAGAGAGAGGTG-3′ Open table in a new tab The GFP fusion constructs were obtained as follows. LmjVPS4 was obtained by PCR from plasmid pXG-VPS4 with primers OL1543 and OL1544 and cloned into BglII/KpnI-digested GFP-containing pNUS-GFPnH vector (30Tetaud E. Lecuix I. Sheldrake T. Baltz T. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was named GFP-VPS4 and contained LmjVPS4 in-frame with the 3′-end of GFP. A plasmid (GFP-VPS4E235Q) containing LmjVPS4E235Q was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis on plasmid GFP-VPS4, as described above. L. major ATG8 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with primers OL1506 and OL1507 and cloned into BglII/XhoI-digested pNUS-GFPnH vector to give GFP-ATG8. Generation of a L. major ATG4.2 Null Mutant and Re-expressing Cell Lines—The 1005-bp 5′-flank fragment of LmATG4.2 (LmjF30.0270) was generated by PCR from L. major genomic DNA with primers NT168 and NT169 (Table 1), digested with HindIII and SalI, and inserted into HindIII/SalI-digested pGL345-HYG (31Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) to give pGL345ATG4.2-HYG5′. The 3′-fragment was generated by PCR using primers NT170 and NT171. The resulting 1104-bp fragment was digested by SmaI and BglII and cloned into pGL345ATG4.2-HYG5′ to give pGLATG4.2-HYG5′3′. The cassette used for transfection was released by HindIII/BglII digestion. pGLATG4.2-BSD5′3′ plasmid, used for the replacement of the second ATG4.2 allele, was generated from plasmid pGLATG4.2-HYG5′3′ by replacing the SpeI/BamHI cassette containing the hygromycin resistance gene by a SpeI/BamHI cassette containing the blasticidin S deaminase gene. A population of parasites resistant to hygromycin was generated after transfection with pGLATG4.2-HYG5′3′. This population was used for a second round of transfection with the pGLATG4.2-BSD5′3′ construct. Two blasticidin-resistant clones from independent transfection events, designated Δatg4.2A1 and Δatg4.2B4, were selected for analysis. For the re-expression experiments, the ATG4.2 gene, modified with a poly-histidine tag at its C-terminal end, was inserted into the pNUS episomal vector. PCR using the primers NT158 and NT159 produced the poly-histidine-tagged version of ATG4.2. The resulting 1185-bp fragment was digested by NdeI/XhoI and ligated into pNUS-HnN plasmid (30Tetaud E. Lecuix I. Sheldrake T. Baltz T. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), previously digested by the same enzymes, to give the pN-ATG4.2 plasmid. L. major wild-type promastigotes were electroporated with 15 μg of the episome, and transfectants were selected with the appropriate antibiotic (Geneticin, G148, Invitrogen). Complement-mediated Lysis and Macrophage Infections—The sensitivity of procyclic and metacyclic promastigotes to complement lysis was assessed with a protocol modified from (32Franke E.D. McGreevy P.B. Katz S.P. Sacks D.L. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2713-2718PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 parasites were incubated at 37 °C in PBS mixed with an appropriate volume of fresh normal human serum. After 20 min, the samples were diluted 2-fold in PBS. The percentage of lysis, assessed by loss of promastigote motility and morphological changes, was calculated relative to control samples incubated in heat-inactivated serum, in which all cells remained viable. Peritoneal macrophages from CD1 mice were adhered overnight in RPMI medium (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air onto eight-chamber tissue culture plastic slides (Labtech) and then infected using late stationary phase promastigotes or peanut lectin-purified metacyclics at a ratio of 10 promastigotes per macrophage. After incubation for 3 h at 35 °C in 5% CO2/95% air, non-phagocytosed promastigotes were removed by washing gently with RPMI four times, and the cultures were then incubated at 35 °C in 5% CO2/95% air. The initial uptake of promastigotes by macrophages and their subsequent intracellular survival and growth as amastigotes was determined by counting the number of infected macrophages and the number of intracellular parasites in stained slides 3, 24, and 120 h after infection. Slides were fixed in methanol and stained with Giemsa to identify the parasites. The number of L. major per 100 macrophages was determined by examination of ∼200 macrophages per assay. Monitoring Autophagy—Live promastigotes of wild-type or VPS4-expressing L. major expressing GFP-ATG8 were observed daily by fluorescence microscopy, and the proportion of autophagosome-bearing cells as well as the number of these structures per cell were assessed. At least four series of 200 cells were counted per experiment for each point. To inhibit the formation of autophagosomes, promastigotes were grown with either 10 μm wortmannin (Sigma, 1 mm stock solution in Me2SO) or 10 mm 3-methyladenine (Sigma, 30 mg/ml stock solution in water). To investigate responses to starvation conditions, promastigotes from early log phase cultures were sedimented by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS before being resuspended in pre-warmed PBS and incubated at 25 °C for up to 2 h. Parasite Viability Assay—Viability of L. major during starvation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) assay as adapted for Leishmania species (33Kiderlen A.F. Kaye P.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 127: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 promastigotes were starved in PBS as described above and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with MTT to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm using a microtiter plate reader. Control cells were grown in complete medium during the same period of time and similarly assessed with MTT. The results were expressed as a fraction of the values obtained for the starved cells relative to the values of the control cells (in percentages). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-LmjVPS4 antibodies were raised in a rabbit using a peptide comprising the 15-amino acid C-terminal sequence (residues 361-375: CHFKRVVGPDPHDPTR). 10 mg of the peptide was linked to an Aminolink column (Pierce) on which the antibodies were affinity-purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (34Besteiro S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used and their respective dilutions were rabbit anti-LmjVPS4 (1/1,000), rabbit anti-HASPB (1/5,000) (35Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-SHERP (1/5,000) (36Knuepfer E. Stierhof Y.D. McKean P.G. Smith D.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and mouse monoclonal anti-TbEF1α (Upstate, 1/10,000). The West-Pico chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce) was used to visualize antigens. Fluorescent Staining of Cells—107 L. major promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in serum-free HOMEM. For FM4-64 labeling, the cells were incubated with 40 μm FM4-64 (from a 12 mm stock solution in Me2SO; Invitrogen) for 15 min at 4 °C and then washed in fresh medium and incubated for various times at 25 °C. Cells were then washed in cold PBS and processed for microscopy. For dextran endocytosis, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated dextran at 500 μg/ml (Mr 10,000, Invitrogen) in complete HOMEM medium for various times at 25 °C. Cells were then washed five times in cold PBS and processed for microscopy. For tomato lectin labeling, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cold serum-free HOMEM, and 1 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated tomato lectin (1.3 mg/ml solution, Sigma) was added for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and fixed for fluorescence after a 30-min further incubation in the absence of tomato lectin at 25 °C. Cells were fixed with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in PBS, and allowed to dry onto glass slides. For concanavalin A lectin labeling, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cold serum-free HOMEM, 1 μl of Texas red-conjugated concanavalin A (5 mg/ml solution, Invitrogen) was added, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. They were then washed in cold PBS and processed as described above for microscopic observation. Statistical Analyses—Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data from macrophage infections, MTT assay, GFP-ATG8 puncta, and motile cell analyses during starvation were pooled (n = 15) for comparison using unpaired t-tests. A p value of <0.05 was used as the level of significance. Expression Profile of L. major VPS4 and Generation of a Dominantnegative Mutant—The L. major VPS4 (LmjF29.2500 gene) was identified by searching the L. major-predicted proteins data base (www.genedb.org/) with the yeast Vps4 (P52917) as a query. Sequence comparisons of LmjVPS4 with yeast (Vps4) and mouse (SKD1) orthologues revealed 53.7% and 52.9% amino acid identity, respectively. SKD1/VPS4 proteins belong to the AAA ATPase family (supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). An antiserum raised to a peptide located in the C-terminal region of LmjVPS4 detected the 50-kDa VPS4 protein in lysates of L. major promastigotes from various growth stages (Fig. 1A, insets, and Fig. 2A, arrowed), as well as a cross-reacting protein of ∼25 kDa. The only difference in VPS4 levels during in vitro growth was an apparent downregulation of the protein in the non-dividing metacyclic form of the parasite. To investigate the function of the VPS4 protein in L. major,a line overexpressing a LmjVPS4E235Q mutant was generated. This Leishmania mutant is equivalent to the Vps4E233Q yeast mutant (37Finken-Eigen M. Röhricht R.A. Köhrer K. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the SKD1E235Q mouse mutant (10Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and the amino acid change introduced was expected to cause a defect in ATP hydrolysis (9Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). L. major promastigotes were transfected with pXG plasmid expressing VPS4 and VPS4E235Q. The wild-type parasite and cell line containing pXG-VPS4 grew normally as promastigotes in vitro, but the pXG-VPS4E235Q mutant showed a premature exit from exponential growth phase. Indeed, the promastigotes overexpressing pXG-VPS4E235Q grew similarly to wild-type parasites throughout most of the logarithmic phase of growth in vitro but went into stationary phase at a lower density than wild-type or pXG-VPS4 promastigotes (Fig. 1B). During this growth phase in culture, an increasing number of promastigotes expressing VPS4E235Q showed morphological peculiarities and became broader and shorter (for example see GFP-fused VPS4E235Q in Fig. 2B, right). The use of an episomal vector for the expression of the VPS4 gene allowed us to increase expression levels with higher amounts of selective drug. This way we have shown that the growth defect was even more pronounced when the pXG-VPS4E235Q mutant was grown in higher concentrations of G418 (Fig. 1A, lower panel), with growth being hindered even in early logarithmic phase, and this correlated with increased amounts of VPS4E235Q protein at the higher G418 concentrations (Fig. 1A, lower panel inset). In contrast, cells transfected with the empty vector (pXG cell line) could withstand concentrations of G418 up to 50 μg/ml with little or no effect on growth (Fig. 1A, upper panel), confirming that neither the vector nor the resistance marker per se were toxic to the cells. Moreover, overexpression of VPS4 was shown not to be toxic to the cells as the pXG-VPS4 cell line grew normally in the presence of increased amounts of G418 and only showed a slight growth defect at 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1A, middle panel).FIGURE 2VPS4 expression and localization.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the only known source of 3-chlorotyrosine in vivo, indicating that MPO oxidizes HDL in humans. We previously reported that Tyr-192 is the major site that is chlorinated in apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the chief protein in HDL, and that chlorinated apoA-I loses its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) pathway. However, the pathways that promote the chlorination of specific Tyr residues in apoA-I are controversial, and the mechanism for MPO-mediated loss of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux of apoA-I is unclear. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we now demonstrate that lysine residues direct tyrosine chlorination in apoA-I. Importantly, methionine residues inhibit chlorination, indicating that they can act as local, protein-bound antioxidants. Moreover, we observed near normal cholesterol efflux activity when Tyr-192 of apoA-I was mutated to Phe and the oxidized protein was incubated with methionine sulfoxide reductase. Thus, a combination of Tyr-192 chlorination and methionine oxidation is necessary for depriving apoA-I of its ABCA1-dependent cholesterol transport activity. Our observations suggest that biologically significant oxidative damage of apoA-I involves modification of a limited number of specific amino acids, raising the feasibility of producing oxidation-resistant forms of apoA-I that have enhanced anti-atherogenic activity in vivo.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which accounts for ∼70% of the total protein in HDL, promotes cholesterol and phospholipid efflux largely by an active transport process mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1).

Moreover, HDL is chlorinated in human atherosclerotic lesions and the blood of subjects with established coronary artery disease, suggesting that apoA-I oxidation might promote atherogenesis. One potential pathway for apoA-I oxidation involves myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein expressed by macrophages in human atherosclerotic tissue (6Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W.

The pathways that promote the MPO-dependent oxidation of specific residues in apoA-I and loss of its ABCA1 activity are controversial. The mechanism we have proposed is based on the observation that Tyr-192 lies in an YXXK motif (Y = Tyr, K = Lys, X = unreactive amino acid) and therefore is adjacent to a Lys residue on the same face of an amphipathic α-helix (12Bergt C.

Moreover, HOCl reacts rapidly with the ϵ amino group of lysine to form long-lived chloramines (8Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Using synthetic peptides, we demonstrated that lysine residues can direct the regiospecific chlorination of Tyr residues by a pathway involving chloramine formation. In this model, the site-specific chlorination of Tyr-192 in apoA-I requires the participation of a nearby lysine residue (12Bergt C. Fu X. Huq N.P. Kao J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7856-7866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An alternative proposal is that MPO must bind directly to the region of apoA-I containing Tyr-192 to promote site-specific chlorination of the residue (5Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Based on studies of mutated apoA-I, it was also concluded that tyrosine chlorination is not a prerequisite for loss of ABCA1 transport activity when MPO oxidizes apoA-I (15Peng D.Q. Wu Z. Brubaker G.

ApoA-I can reduce lipid hydroperoxides to alcohols in concert with oxidation of Met residues to Met(O) (17Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol.

The alkyl thiol of Met is the most HOCl-reactive moiety in the 20 common amino acids (20Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res.

Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), but the role of oxidation of Met residues in the impaired cholesterol efflux activity of MPO-oxidized apoA-I has received surprisingly little attention. Met(O) residues in proteins are reduced to methionine by a family of intracellular enzymes termed methionine sulfoxide reductases (22Weissbach H. Etienne F. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Lowther W.T.

In the current studies, we used mutated apoA-I and methionine sulfoxide reductase to probe the role of specific amino acids residues in Tyr chlorination and the loss of ABCA1-cholesterol efflux activity that occurs when apoA-I is exposed to MPO. Isolation of MPO, PilB, and ApoA-I—MPO (EC 1.11.1.7) was isolated from human neutrophils (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L.D. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol.

Efflux of [3H]cholesterol was measured after a 2-h incubation in medium without or with apoA-I (31Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol.

The YXXK Motif Directs Tyr Chlorination in ApoA-I—To determine whether lysine residues in the YXXK motif direct the regiospecific chlorination of Tyr residues in proteins, we used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer a series of mutations in the cDNA of human apoA-I. After isolating the wild-type or mutant apoA-I proteins, we exposed them to reagent HOCl or the MPO-H2O2-Cl– system. Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant and terminated by adding Met, a scavenger of HOCl. After digesting the oxidized apoA-I with trypsin, we used LC-ESI-MS and reconstructed ion chromatograms of precursor and product peptides to quantify the yields of chlorinated tyrosine peptides. This approach detected all seven peptides predicted to contain Tyr. As with apoA-I isolated from human HDL (12Bergt C. Fu X. Huq N.P. Kao J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5983-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), Tyr-192 was the major site of chlorination in recombinant wild-type apoA-I (Fig. 1A). In the K195R mutant, Tyr-192 chlorination was markedly decreased, suggesting that Lys-195 plays a critical role in directing the chlorination of Tyr-192. Tyr-166, which does not reside in a YXXK motif in apoA-I, was chlorinated in low yield when the protein was exposed to HOCl or the complete MPO system (Fig. 1B). However, when Glu-169 was mutated to lysine, chlorination of Tyr-166 increased 20-fold (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that lysine residues located in the YXXK motif can direct tyrosine chlorination in apoA-I. Methionine Residues in the MXXK Motif Inhibit Tyrosine Chlorination— Protein-bound Met residues have been proposed to act as local scavengers of H2O2 (32Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). To determine whether Met residues might similarly scavenge oxidants derived from HOCl, we mutated glutamic acid 198 (which lies 2 residues away from the Lys-195 that directs chlorination of Tyr-192) to Met. In this mutant, Tyr-192 chlorination was dramatically decreased (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Met residues can inhibit Tyr chlorination by scavenging lysine chloramines. Tyr-115, which also resides in a YXXK motif in apoA-I, was chlorinated poorly (Fig. 1D) by HOCl or the complete MPO system. When we mutated Met-112 to Ala, however, HOCl generated a high yield of chlorinated Try-115 (data not shown). Thus, chlorination of Tyr-115 appears to be inhibited by the adjacent Met residue in wild type apoA-I. When Met-112 was mutated to Lys, chlorination of Tyr-115 also increased markedly (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these observations suggest that protein-bound Met residues that reside in MXXYor KXXM motifs can inhibit Tyr chlorination by scavenging lysine chloramines. Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase Converts Met(O) to Methionine in Oxidized ApoA-I—ApoA-I contains 3 Met residues, but it is unknown how oxidizing them with HOCl affects apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. When we exposed apoA-I to HOCl or the MPO system and then digested it with trypsin or Glu-C, LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed that each Met had been targeted for oxidation to Met(O) (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, methionine sulfone was not detected in oxidized apoA-I. When apoA-I was first exposed to the complete MPO system and then incubated with the methionine sulfoxide reductase PilB, Met(O) was converted back to methionine (Fig. 2C). Chlorination of Tyr192 and Oxidation of Met Residues Play Critical Roles in the Oxidative Inactivation of the Cholesterol Efflux Activity of ApoA-I—To test the role of tyrosine chlorination of apoA-I in the loss of ABCA1 activity, we engineered the Tyr-192 → Phe mutant of apoA-I. LC-ESI-MS analysis confirmed that HOCl fails to chlorinate Phe-192 of this mutant protein. We then investigated the ability of apoA-I and its Tyr-192 → Phe mutant form to promote cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-transfected BHK cells. The rates of cholesterol efflux were virtually identical as concentrations of the native and Tyr-192 → Phe mutant proteins increased (Fig. 3A), indicating that substituting Phe for Tyr had little effect on the biological activity of the apolipoprotein. We next compared the effects of oxidation on the ability of apoA-I and Tyr-192 → Phe apoA-I to remove cholesterol from cells by the ABCA1 pathway. Whereas H2O2 alone had no effect, oxidation by the complete MPO system significantly decreased the cholesterol efflux promoted by apoA-I or Tyr-192 → Phe apoA-I (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4A). However, the mutant protein appeared somewhat resistant to oxidative inactivation by MPO when the concentration of H2O2 was high. Similar results were observed when apoA-I was directly oxidized with HOCl (Fig. 4B). After apoA-I was exposed to the complete MPO system with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 4A) or increasing HOCl concentrations (Fig. 4B), incubating apoA-I with PilB to reduce Met(O) back to Met partially restored its ability to promote cholesterol efflux at all oxidant concentrations. Similar partial protective effects of the Tyr-192 → Phe substitution or methionine sulfoxide reduction were observed when cellular cholesterol efflux was monitored over a range of apoA-I concentrations (Fig. 3B). Thus, neither inhibition of Tyr-192 chlorination nor reduction of Met(O) alone markedly protected apoA-I from oxidative inactivation. We next determined the effect of a combination of Met(O) reduction and the Tyr-192 → Phe mutation on the ability of oxidized apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. Remarkably, when the mutant protein was first exposed to increasing H2O2 concentrations in the complete MPO system and then incubated with PilB, its ability to promote cholesterol efflux was nearly the same as that of native apoA-I (Fig. 4A). This was true even at low concentrations of apoA-I (Fig. 3B). We obtained similar results after exposing Tyr-192 → Phe to HOCl (Fig. 4B). Our observations strongly suggest that two oxidation events, chlorination of Tyr-192 and oxidation of Met residues, account for most of the decrease in the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. In the current study, we engineered mutations in apoA-I to determine whether the YXXK motif plays a critical role in Tyr chlorination and whether chlorination of Tyr-192 accounts for the loss of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux that is seen when apoA-I is exposed to MPO. Studies with a series of mutations provided strong evidence that YXXK can direct the regiospecific chlorination of Tyr residues in apoA-I. Indeed, we blocked Tyr-192 chlorination with the Lys-195 → Arg mutation and chlorinated normally resistant Tyr residues by creating the KXXY motif in the protein. Virtually identical results were observed with either the complete MPO system or reagent HOCl. These observations strongly support the proposed role of the YXXK motif (12Bergt C. Fu X. Huq N.P. Kao J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7856-7866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and argue against the hypothesis that the selective chlorination of Tyr-192 requires MPO to interact directly with the apolipoprotein (5Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). We previously noted that two other Tyr residues in apoA-I (Tyr-115 and Tyr-236) that reside in YXXK motifs are resistant to chlorination (13Shao B. Bergt C. Fu X. Green P. Voss J.C. Oda M.N. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5983-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Importantly, Tyr-115 lies close to Met-112 in a YXXM motif. When we mutated Met-112 to Ala, which does not react with HOCl, the yield of chlorinated Tyr-115 in apoA-I exposed to MPO increased. When we introduced a Met residue 2 residues away from the Lys residue in apoA-I, Tyr-192 chlorination was inhibited. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that protein-bound Met residues act as local antioxidants (32Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) by scavenging chlorinating intermediates. Met oxidation might affect Tyr chlorination by additional mechanisms. The α-helical structure of apoA-I depends critically upon hydrophobic amino acids, which form the lipid-associating face of the amphipathic helix (14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygenation markedly decreases the hydrophobicity of Met. By disrupting the secondary structure of the apolipoprotein, Met oxidation could alter the ability of nearby Lys residues located in the YXXK motif to promote the site specific chlorination of apoA-I. A key question is whether or not Tyr chlorination impairs the ability of apoA-I to promote ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux. We had noted the strong linear association between the extent of Tyr-192 chlorination and loss of biological activity, which suggests that Tyr oxidation might be an important contributor (3Bergt C. Pennathur S. Fu X. Byun J. O'Brien K. McDonald T.O. Singh P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chait A. Brunzell J. Geary R.L. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5983-5993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, recent studies of a mutant form of apoA-I in which Phe replaced all 7 Tyr residues led to the proposal that Tyr chlorination is irrelevant to the loss of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux that occurs when MPO oxidizes apoA-I (15Peng D.Q. Wu Z. Brubaker G. Zheng L. Settle M. Gross E. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33775-33784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we measured the cholesterol efflux activity of apoA-I containing a Phe substituted for Tyr-192, which makes this residue completely resistant to chlorination. In contrast to the previous report with murine macrophages (15Peng D.Q. Wu Z. Brubaker G. Zheng L. Settle M. Gross E. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33775-33784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we found using ABCA1-transfected BHK cells that this mutation had a small but reproducible protective effect against apoA-I inactivation by either HOCl or the MPO system. The difference between our study and the previous one may reflect the fact that our transfected BHK cells express much higher ABCA1 levels than murine macrophages, allowing us to detect modest changes in apoA-I activity. Our observation that protein-bound Met is a potent local scavenger of HOCl led us to investigate the role of Met oxidation in the biological activity of apoA-I. When we exposed apoA-I to HOCl or to H2O2 with the complete MPO system, we observed near-quantitative oxidation of the 3 Met residues in apoA-I. Met oxidation was completely reversed by treatment with PilB, a methionine sulfoxide reductase that reduces both the (R) and (S) epimers of Met(O) (22Weissbach H. Etienne F. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Lowther W.T. Matthews B. St. John G. Nathan C. Brot N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Remarkably, when the Tyr-192 → Phe mutant was exposed to HOCl or the complete MPO system and then incubated with the methionine reductase PilB, its ability to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway was almost completely restored. These observations indicate that Met oxidation and Tyr chlorination together, in contrast to Met oxidation alone (33Panzenbock U. Kritharides L. Raftery M. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19536-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are necessary for depriving apoA-I of its cholesterol efflux activity. This synergism between the Tyr-192 → Phe mutation and Met(O) reduction implies that the functional defect induced by oxidation of apoA-I arises from a cooperative interaction between oxidation of Tyr-192 and one or more Met residues. Alternatively, it is possible that other structural modifications in oxidized apoA-I are involved in the loss of ABCA1 activity. It is noteworthy that Tyr-192 resides in the middle of the random coil loop that changes its conformation when it encounters lipid, driving the remodeling of apoA-I to its lipid-associated form (34Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Chlorination of this Tyr residue, in concert with Met oxidation, may stabilize a conformational variant that fails to either associate strongly with lipid or interact productively with ABCA1. In conclusion, oxidation by MPO impairs the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway, suggesting that this oxidative process might contribute to foam cell formation and atherogenesis. Studies with mutant forms of apoA-I strongly support the proposal that specific amino acid sequences direct the regioselective chlorination of Tyr. Moreover, oxidation of Met and Tyr residues plays a critical role in the oxidative inactivation of the protein. Our observations raise the possibility that modified forms of apoA-I that are resistant to oxidation might be especially anti-atherogenic in vivo."

Vaccination is expected to make a major contribution to the goal of eliminating tuberculosis worldwide by 2050. But developing a new effective vaccine will require innovation in scientific research, a proactive approach to clinical trials of new vaccine candidates, and application of vaccines as part of an integrated approach to disease control. After decades of neglect, the immense public health impact of tuberculosis (TB) is now widely recognized. In 2004 alone, around 9 million people developed active TB, with up to 2 million deaths attributable to the disease (WHO, 2006WHO (World Health Organization)Global Tuberculosis Control: Surveillance, Planning, Financing, WHO/HTM/TB/2006.362. World Health Organization, Geneva2006Google Scholar). Strategies to combat TB—announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month—are set out in The Global Plan to Stop TB (Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO, 2006Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO (World Health Organization)The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006–2015, WHO/HTM/STB/2006.35. World Health Organization, Geneva2006Google Scholar). This plan addresses the UN Millennium Development Goal of halving TB prevalence and death rates by the year 2015, that is, reducing the annual death toll from TB to less than 1 million worldwide. This would be a big step toward the target of eliminating TB worldwide by 2050 (set at one case per million population). The current strategy for TB control is based on reducing the spread of infection through effective treatment of individuals with active disease using drug combinations that include rifampicin and isoniazid. However, there are many problems with this approach, including the identification of TB patients living in conditions of poverty with little or no access to basic health services, the dramatic increase in susceptibility to TB of individuals who are coinfected with HIV, the emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant to front-line drugs, and the logistics of delivering a treatment that requires administration of multiple drugs over periods of 6 months or more. The Global Plan to Stop TB (Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO, 2006Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO (World Health Organization)The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006–2015, WHO/HTM/STB/2006.35. World Health Organization, Geneva2006Google Scholar) addresses each of these issues in a 50 billion dollar program that will treat 50 million patients and save 14 million lives over the next 10 years. It is anticipated that the 2015 goals will be reached through optimized use of existing tools in combination with improvements in diagnostics and drugs, but vaccination is a critical component in the battle to control TB. The current vaccine—BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin)—is widely used in many parts of the world (although not in the United States) to protect against severe childhood forms of TB but is unreliable against the highly infectious pulmonary form of TB characteristically found in adults. There is a pressing need for new and better vaccines to fight TB. Benefits of prevention over cure are self-evident, and vaccination has long been recognized as an optimal strategy to control TB. At first glance, prospects seem very attractive. Aerosols from the lungs of untreated TB patients provide a very effective means of spreading M. tuberculosis, resulting in annual rates of infection (detected by measuring antigen-specific T cells) in the range of 0.5%–2.0% in TB endemic communities (B. Bourdin Trunz, P.E.M. Fine, and C.D., unpublished data). The estimate that one-third of the global population is infected with M. tuberculosis is commonly used to emphasize the huge overall burden of TB (Dye et al., 1999Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. JAMA. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). For the vast majority, induction of an immune response is the only detectable sign of infection. As a rule of thumb, around 5%–10% of infected individuals will develop active TB; half within the first few years after infection and half in later life as a result of reinfection or reactivation of an original infection. This risk is increased by an order of magnitude in individuals co-infected with HIV. Of the remaining 90% of healthy infected individuals, autopsy results show that a significant proportion continue to harbor viable bacteria in the form of a latent infection (Stewart et al., 2003Stewart G.R. Robertson B.D. Young D.B. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). From a vaccine standpoint, the key lesson is that the natural immune response already protects 90% of the population from clinical disease. The question is whether a modest increase in this immune response would increase protection to 100%. The simplest way to assist the natural immune response is to prime it in advance of exposure to the pathogen. This was the strategy underlying development of an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis by laboratory passage in the early decades of the twentieth century, generating BCG, one of the world's most widely used vaccines. BCG performs as expected in a wide range of animal models by establishing a population of primed T cells that respond more rapidly to subsequent challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Vaccination restricts the early phase of bacterial growth and prolongs survival. Consistent with this, neonatal BCG vaccination in humans reduces the childhood incidence of severe forms of disseminated disease. According to recent estimates, the 100 million BCG vaccinations given to infants in 2002 will have prevented 30,000 TB meningitis cases in children during their first 5 years of life, and about 11,000 cases of disseminated or miliary TB (B. Bourdin Trunz, P.E.M. Fine, and C.D., unpublished data). However, BCG is less effective against the major infectious form of pulmonary TB. BCG vaccination of schoolchildren in the United Kingdom reduced the incidence of TB over the next 15 years by more than 70%. In contrast, no protection was observed following BCG vaccination in south India. The variable effects of BCG in different locations may be associated with differing levels of background immunity induced by exposure to mycobacteria in the environment. Where BCG does work, the protective effect has been shown to last for as long as 60 years (Aronson et al., 2004Aronson N.E. Santosham M. Comstock G.W. Howard R.S. Moulton L.H. Rhoades E.R. Harrison L.H. JAMA. 2004; 291: 2086-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Also encouraging is a recent study that used measurement of responses to antigens that are absent from the vaccine strain (ESAT6/CFP10, see below) to demonstrate that BCG vaccination is able to arrest infection at an early stage, without the induction of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells (Soysal et al., 2005Soysal A. Millington K.A. Bakir M. Dosanjh D. Aslan Y. Deeks J.J. Efe S. Staveley I. Ewer K. Lalvani A. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1443-1451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the global TB epidemic is clearly thriving in spite of widespread BCG vaccination. The partial protection that has been observed in clinical trials, together with the failure to identify alternative candidates that substantially outperform BCG in experimental models, has encouraged a search for new vaccines that can be used in combination with BCG. The dominant immunological consequence of infection with M. tuberculosis or vaccination with BCG is priming of Th1-oriented CD4+ T cells that potentiate the antimicrobial function of macrophages through release of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). There is extensive genetic and functional evidence that the Th1 response is essential for resistance to mycobacterial infection in humans and in animal models. Indeed, induction of IFN-γ-positive T cells is a central theme in the search for new vaccines. A common approach is to select antigens that are prominent targets of the immune response to natural infection. This includes a diverse repertoire, with a few favorite proteins selected as a result of repeated identification in multiple experimental systems. The “antigen 85 complex” is a family of proteins secreted in large amounts into the growth medium of M. tuberculosis cultures; antigens 85A and 85B have both been used in vaccines. ESAT6 is another prominent target found in culture filtrates. It is released from the bacteria by a specialized secretion system and forms a complex with a partner protein, CFP10. The genes encoding ESAT6 and CFP10 were deleted during attenuation of BCG, and these antigens have an important diagnostic role in distinguishing BCG vaccination from M. tuberculosis infection (e.g., Soysal et al., 2005Soysal A. Millington K.A. Bakir M. Dosanjh D. Aslan Y. Deeks J.J. Efe S. Staveley I. Ewer K. Lalvani A. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1443-1451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This diagnostic application argues against use of ESAT6 in vaccines, but further members of the same low-molecular-weight protein family are conserved in BCG and offer alternative candidates. Although the biological function of the ESAT6 family is unknown, there is evidence that their unusual mode of secretion may play some role in immunogenicity (Pym et al., 2003Pym A.S. Brodin P. Majlessi L. Brosch R. Demangel C. Williams A. Griffiths K.E. Marchal G. Leclerc C. Cole S.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Proteins present inside the bacteria are also effective in vaccines: Mtb72f, for example, is a fusion protein derived from two cytoplasmic proteins (Skeiky et al., 2004Skeiky Y.A. Alderson M.R. Ovendale P.J. Guderian J.A. Brandt L. Dillon D.C. Campos-Neto A. Lobet Y. Dalemans W. Orme I.M. Reed S.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7618-7628PubMed Google Scholar). To induce a Th1 immune response, these antigens have been delivered as purified proteins in adjuvant, as components of recombinant viral or bacterial vaccine vectors, or in the form of DNA vaccines. Hundreds of formulations have been screened in experimental animal models (Orme, 2006Orme I.M. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 2-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); those going forward to clinical trials have shown efficacy at least comparable to BCG. Experience with BCG illustrates fundamental problems inherent in predicting the clinical impact of TB vaccines by extrapolation from their efficacy in animal models. New vaccines must be assessed for immunogenicity and ultimately protective efficacy in human trials. Four new Th1 vaccines entered phase I trials by the end of 2005: MVA85A (the antigen 85A gene delivered in recombinant vaccinia virus Ankara), Mtb72f fusion protein delivered in AS02 adjuvant, rBCG30 (a recombinant BCG overexpressing antigen 85B), and an ESAT6-85B fusion protein delivered in IC31 adjuvant. All of the vaccines will undergo extensive safety analysis in individuals lacking prior antimycobacterial immunity, in individuals with evidence of previous infection, and in individuals infected with HIV. Testing of MVA85A is most advanced, with trials in the United Kingdom and the Gambia showing evidence of strong IFN-γ responses following BCG vaccination and an MVA85A boost (McShane et al., 2004McShane H. Pathan A.A. Sander C.R. Keating S.M. Gilbert S.C. Huygen K. Fletcher H.A. Hill A.V. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although Th1 boosting is the most obvious approach to TB vaccine development, it is important to consider alternative vaccine strategies. TB often occurs as a secondary disease in individuals who had been able to control a primary infection; this is the reverse of the simple vaccine model based on the premise that prior exposure enhances subsequent protection. BCG vaccination and M. tuberculosis infection already induce Th1 responses to the prominent antigens, and it is not clear that more IFN-γ will necessarily translate into better protection. Given that the same Th1 response contributes to the pathology associated with clinical TB, it is conceivable that vaccination could in fact exacerbate subsequent disease. This was the outcome of Robert Koch's ill-fated exploration of therapeutic vaccination for TB in the 1890s and is reflected in adverse effects that can result from reconstitution of immune responses following antiretroviral treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and M. tuberculosis. In addition to CD4+ T cells, multiple immune mechanisms are induced in response to mycobacterial infection and represent potential targets for vaccination. CD8+ T cells are required for optimal protection in mice, and recombinant adenovirus vectors provide an attractive strategy for induction of human CD8+ T cell responses to specific mycobacterial antigens. A recombinant BCG strain (rBCGΔUre-Hly) has been engineered to elicit a broad repertoire of CD8+ T cells by delivery of antigens into the cytoplasm of infected cells or by crosspriming of other antigen-presenting cells and is scheduled to enter clinical trials this year (Kaufmann, 2005Kaufmann S.H.E. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 660-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although their functional contribution to protection and patterns of priming and recall are as yet poorly understood, CD1-restricted T cells capable of recognizing mycobacterial lipid antigens, and T cells expressing a γδ receptor, provide future scope for immune modulation. Cytokine pathways outside of the major Th1 axis may be important in the balance between protective and pathological effects of immune activation. Th2 responses resembling those associated with allergy and worm infection are thought to exacerbate immunopathology during progressive TB and may also influence disease susceptibility. These responses may be open to manipulation by Th2-suppressing vaccine strategies (Rook et al., 2005Rook G.A.W. Dheda K. Zumla A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The 10% “failure” rate of the natural immune response is clearly sufficient to support the lifestyle of M. tuberculosis and may represent the outcome favored by the pathogen. Indications that M. tuberculosis can contribute to programming of the host immune response are emerging from molecular epidemiology studies. For example, members of the “Beijing” family of M. tuberculosis suppress innate immune responses by expressing a phenolic glycolipid molecule (Reed et al., 2004Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N. Kaplan G. Barry 3rd, C.E. Nature. 2004; 431: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Also, fine tuning of pathogenic interactions by mutations affecting expression of immune modulators provides one possible explanation for the observed association of particular phylogenetic branches of M. tuberculosis with particular human ethnic groups (Hirsh et al., 2004Hirsh A.E. Tsolaki A.G. DeRiemer K. Feldman M.W. Small P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4871-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). If M. tuberculosis has evolved a comfortable symbiosis with natural immunity, perhaps vaccines should aim to change this balance rather than to enhance the status quo. The simplest application of a new TB vaccine would involve delivery in tandem with neonatal BCG. Anticipated outcomes would be an enhancement of BCG protection against childhood TB and, crucially, a reduction in subsequent rates of infectious pulmonary TB. However, since the peak onset of pulmonary disease in high-burden countries is among young-adult age groups, there will be a prolonged delay between administration of a new vaccine and measurement of its key impact. Direct vaccination of high-risk age groups would accelerate the impact of vaccination but has to address the fact that the majority of young adults have already been infected with M. tuberculosis. The requirements for a vaccine that augments a preexisting immune response are not well understood. It may be that boosting of the response during latent infection will be analogous to boosting of prior BCG vaccination and that the same vaccine will have a dual application for pre- and postexposure delivery. Alternatively, it can be envisaged that the immune response involved in containment of latent infection will comprise a tightly constrained network of effector and regulatory T cells. A postexposure vaccine would then have to operate by inducing responses outside of the established immune repertoire, for example, by targeting antigens preferentially expressed by the form of M. tuberculosis that persists during latent infection. We can explore the potential impact of these different kinds of vaccines and different vaccination strategies using mathematical modeling (Dye et al., 1998Dye C. Garnett G.P. Sleeman K. Williams B.G. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Figure 1 illustrates the potential impact of vaccines in an area of the world where TB is highly endemic but in slow decline—in this case, south Asia (WHO, 2006WHO (World Health Organization)Global Tuberculosis Control: Surveillance, Planning, Financing, WHO/HTM/TB/2006.362. World Health Organization, Geneva2006Google Scholar ). This general pattern is typical of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. For illustration, we suppose that the incidence rate is around 200 per 100,000 population in 2010, falling at 1%–2% per year (Figure 1, black line). The model can then be used to explore the potential effects of different kinds of vaccine, assuming that all would be available for use in 2015 and that the combination of population coverage and efficacy would protect 70% of the target population from developing infectious or noninfectious forms of TB. If a pre-exposure vaccine were used to protect infants only, the impact on the TB epidemic would become significant after a delay of 10–15 years (Figure 1A, red line). Incidence could be reduced much sooner in a mass vaccination campaign targeted at uninfected people of all ages. One round of vaccination in 2015 (in addition to routine neonatal vaccination) would cause a sharp reduction in incidence within about 5 years (Figure 1A, green line). The decline would continue slowly thereafter, aided by the continuing effect of vaccinating infants. A vaccine with dual action, which protects infected (postexposure) as well as uninfected (pre-exposure) people from developing active TB, would of course have greater impact. But the extra effect is likely to be modest between 2015 and 2050 (Figures 1A and 1B, purple line). The additional benefits of protection postexposure are relatively small because, in an area of moderate transmission, the annual incidence of TB among infected people is smaller than among previously uninfected people. There are therefore fewer cases to be prevented. This comparatively small effect is also visible for a single-action vaccine that protects postexposure but not pre-exposure (Figure 1A, blue line). This is not to say that protection postexposure is any less desirable. Protecting infected people from progressing to active TB is going to be crucial during the endgame of TB control. As transmission and incidence are reduced, a growing proportion of patients arises from the reactivation of latent infections, acquired when the transmission rate was still high. Eventually, such patients will be in the majority. The only way to prevent TB arising from reactivation is with a postexposure vaccine or by preventive drug therapy. Although it is possible that researchers will discover a “blockbuster” vaccine that can transform global TB on its own, a more realistic scenario is that a partially effective vaccine will work together with new drugs. Figure 1B illustrates the impact of a drug treatment program, introduced from 2015 onward, meeting the WHO targets of treating 70% of the new cases arising each year and curing 85% of them (Figure 1B, red line). A dual-action vaccine, also introduced in 2015, would supplement the effect of drug treatment (Figure 1B, green line), but the additional impact of the vaccine is less than would be obtained by vaccination alone. Drug treatment and vaccination are substitutive rather than synergistic because they partly serve the same function. Drugs prevent the transmission of infection from patients (as well as curing them), whereas vaccines prevent the acquisition of infection by unexposed people. Periodic mass vaccination campaigns with the dual-action vaccine could further push down incidence (Figure 1B, dark red line). Although a new vaccine would undoubtedly be used worldwide, its efficacy (like that of BCG) might not be the same everywhere. In particular, it remains to be seen whether a TB vaccine can protect immunocompromised people who are HIV positive, whether they are vaccinated before or after exposure to one or both pathogens. In sum, the impact of vaccination is likely to be greater where drug treatment programs have been less successful. Although the prevention of infection is of the highest importance in areas of intense transmission, the protection of people who have already been infected will be vital during the elimination phase of TB control. The availability of an effective, licensed vaccine by the year 2015 has been proposed as a realistic target within The Global Plan to Stop TB (Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO, 2006Stop T.B. Partnership and WHO (World Health Organization)The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006–2015, WHO/HTM/STB/2006.35. World Health Organization, Geneva2006Google Scholar). To reach this goal, it is estimated that at least 20 vaccine candidates should enter phase I safety trials, with around half going forward for immunological evaluation in phase II trials and leading to four phase III efficacy trials. Based on the number and cost of individuals enrolled in the trials, together with costs associated with vaccine production and trial-site development, a budget in the region of $600 million will be required to carry out this program. Success in the clinical trials program will depend on continued close integration with discovery research. Basic research input will be required to provide immunological evidence to underpin the crucial decisions that have to be taken in selecting candidates for progression from immunogenicity studies to expensive efficacy trials; optimizing the chances of success will depend on interpretation of phase II data in the context of a broad understanding of fundamental immunology and parallel findings in experimental models. It will also be important to continue to develop new candidates, using the data emerging from clinical trials to inform increasingly rational design in an iterative learning process. Extrapolating from the current level of support for TB vaccine-related research, it is estimated that a sustained level of funding of around $120 million per year will be required. Taken together, the research, clinical trial, and production requirements for a new TB vaccine by the year 2015 amount to 1.8 billion dollars. The costs for maintaining global BCG vaccination amount to 1.3 billion dollars over the same period. This represents a formidable multidisciplinary program requiring collaboration of scientists in academia and industry, clinicians and public-health professionals, and communities participating in trials. TB vaccine development has been fostered by important large-scale initiatives including the standardization of reagents and preclinical testing funded by the National Institutes of Health and the support for collaborative research consortia by the European Commission. Funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation supports the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, which interacts with academic and industrial partners in a dynamic program to accelerate clinical trials of new TB vaccines. Aeras uses processes that parallel those of a commercial vaccine manufacturer, but within a global access framework designed to deliver products at affordable costs in high-burden countries. As part of a recent initiative to address “Grand Challenges in Global Health,” the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also funds two new research consortia focused on development of vaccines for latent TB and identification of biomarkers for use in TB clinical trials. These initiatives and more will play an essential role in making good on the promise of vaccination for control of global TB."
https://openalex.org/W1985062043,"DREB1/C-repeat binding factor (CBF) is a plant-specific family of transcription factors and plays a crucial role in freeze tolerance. In the present work, two groups of drought-responsive element binding factor (DREB)-like genes were isolated from Brassica napus, named Group I and Group II. The two groups of genes were both induced by low temperature, but the expression of Group I preceded that of Group II. The Group I DREBs could specifically bind with the DRE cis-acting element and activate the expression of downstream genes, but Group II factors were trans-inactive although they still had the ability to bind with DRE, which was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fluorescence quenching assays indicated that the DRE binding ability of the two groups was similar. Co-expression of Group II could depress the trans-activation activity of Group I DREB in a concentration-dependent manner. These results strongly suggested that the trans-active Group I DREBs were expressed at the early stage of cold stress to open the DRE-mediated signaling pathway in cold stress, whereas the trans-inactive Group II DREBs were expressed at the later stage to close the signal pathway in a competitive manner. The results herein provide a new insight into the regulation mechanisms of the DRE-mediated signaling pathway in response to cold stress.

The results herein provide a new insight into the regulation mechanisms of the DRE-mediated signaling pathway in response to cold stress. Low temperature is a major factor limiting the geographical locations of many crops and horticultural plants, and it can usually result in significant losses in plant productivity (1Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Many plants have increased tolerance to freezing temperatures after exposure to low non-freezing temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation (2Guy C.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 187-223Crossref Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 3Hughes M. Dunn M. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 291-305Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 4Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). A key function of cold acclimation is to acquire tolerance to multiple forms of membrane damage due to freeze-induced cellular dehydration including expansion-induced-lysis, lamellar-to-hexagonal-II phase transitions, and fracture jump lesions (1Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 5Steponkus P.L. Uemura M. Webb M.S. Curr.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1997: 171-179Google Scholar, 7Pearce R.S. Plant Growth Regul. 1999; 29: 47-76Crossref Google Scholar). A large number of genes have been identified to be cold-inducible and to function in freeze tolerance (1Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). In 1994, a drought-responsive element (DRE) 3The abbreviations used are: DRE, drought-responsive element; DREB, DRE binding factor; CRT, C-repeat; CBF, CRT binding factor; WDRE, wide-type DRE element with the sequence 5′-AGCTACCGACATAAGGC-3′; MDRE, mutated DRE element with the sequence 5′-AGCTATTTTCATAAGGC-3′; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; MES, 4-mor-pholineethanesulfonic acid; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; EREBP, ethylene-responsive element-binding protein; SD, synthetic dropout. was identified to be involved in responsiveness to drought, low temperature, and high salt stress (8Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), and a similar cis-acting element, C-repeat (CRT), was also reported (9Baker S.S. Whihelm K.S. Thomashow M.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 710-713Crossref Scopus (684) Google Scholar). A family of transcriptional factors known as DREBs or CBFs has been reported to bind with this cis-element and activate the transcription of the downstream genes related to cold, drought, and high salinity (10Stockinger E.J. Gilmour S.J. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DREB1B/CBF1 or DREB1A/CBF3 resulted in strong expression of stress-inducible genes, and the transgenic plants acquired higher tolerance to drought, low temperature, and high salinity (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar, 12Jaglo-Ottosen K.R. Gilnour S.J. Zarka D.G.

Plant J. 1998; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, DREB1/CBF genes play a central role in tolerance to abiotic stresses. Since the first report about the cloning of CBF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (10Stockinger E.J. Gilmour S.J. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), many studies have been carried out on the regulation mechanisms of this special gene family to promote better understanding of the responses of the plants to abiotic stresses. Genetic screening of Arabidopsis plants expressing the firefly luciferase gene driven by the DRE/CRT-containing rd29A promoter (15Ishitani M. Xiong L.M. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1935-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) has identified several mutants with abnormal expression of cold-inducible genes. Detailed analysis of these mutants revealed that HOS1 (16Lee H. Xiong L. Gong Z. Ishitani M. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 912-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), LOS1 (17Guo Y. Xiong L. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), LOS2 (18Lee H. Guo Y. Ohta M. Xiong L. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2692-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and LOS4 (19Gong Z. Lee H. Xiong L. Jagendorf A. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) could indirectly affect the expression of DREB1/CBF and thus lead to the deregulated expression of downstream genes. Genetic analysis of the Arabidopsis plants expressing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the DREB1A/CBF3 promoter indicated that ICE1, a Myc-like basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional activator, could bind with the promoter of DREB1A/CBF3 and regulate the transcription of DREB1/CBF (20Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Further evidence of the direct regulation of the DRE/CRT-mediated signaling pathway was that DREB1C/CBF2 could function as a negative regulator of CBF1/DREB1B and DREB1A/CBF3 expression (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These studies contributed much to an understanding of the regulation of the signaling pathway mediated by DREB1/CBF. That is, the expression of stress-response genes (CBF1/DERB1B and DREB1A/CBF3) can be regulated at the transcriptional level. However, it is not clear yet whether or not there is a molecular mechanism to shut down the DREB1/CBF-mediated stress-response pathway at the protein level in higher plants. In this research, two distinct groups of DREBs were cloned from the cold-induced cDNA library of Brassica napus and were named Group I and II, respectively. The two groups of genes had high sequence homology, except that Group I DREBs had two additional insertions in the C-terminal region. Analysis of the expression level and the trans-active activity of these two groups of genes indicated that they functioned in synergy to regulate the DRE-mediated signaling. The trans-active Group I DREBs were expressed at the early stage of cold stress and opened the signal pathway, and then the inactive Group II DREBs were expressed, which competed with the Group I DREBs and closed the stress-induced signaling. The results herein should improve our understanding of the regulation mechanisms of DREB1/CBF-mediated signal transduction pathways at the protein level. Plant Materials and Stress Treatments—Seeds of B. napus Jinghong H15 were sterilized and were germinated in germination medium (Murashige and Skoog medium) solidified with 0.8% (w/v) agar. The plants were grown at 25 °C under a long day photoperiod (16 h of cool white fluorescent light). Low temperature treatment was performed on 2-week-old plants. The plants were transferred into a growth chamber set to 4 °C for different periods of time. Isolation and Identification of the Two Groups of DREBs—According to the published DREB1/CBF sequences, nested primers were designed to amplify the sequence of the conserved AP2/EREBP domain from the cold-induced cDNA library of B. napus. Then 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were conducted to get the 5′- and 3′-end of the cDNAs according to the manufacturer's instructions (Takara, Japan). Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the two groups of DREBs. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Analysis—For RNA analysis, 2-week-old seedlings were subjected to cold stress for various periods. Total RNA was extracted as described previously (22Janssen B.J. Williams A. Chen J.J. Mathern J. Hake S. Sinha N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for preparation of cDNA. I-5 and II-1 (see Fig. 1) were selected to detect the expression levels during cold stress. Actin was amplified as an internal control. The primers used were: BnI-For, 5′-TATGAACTCAGTCTCTACTTTTTCTG-3′; BnI-Rev, 5′-CTAATAATTCCAGAGGTTTATGTC-3′; BnII-For, 5′-GATTATGACCTCATTTTC-3′; BnII-Rev, 5′-ATAACTCCAAAGGGACACGTC-3′; actin-For, 5′-CATGTTCGAAACTTTCAATGTCC-3′; and actin-Rev, 5′-CCTTGATCTTCATGCTGCTTG-3′. The amplified products were separated on 1.2% agarose for quantitative analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green I dye was performed on Mx3000PTM (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each sample was run in triplicate. Data were analyzed according to the threshold cycle (Ct) method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (127156) Google Scholar). The amount of the target genes, normalized to the internal reference actin), is given in 2–ΔΔCt. The amount of I-5 transcripts accumulated after 0.5 h of cold stress was taken as 1.0. DNA Binding Analysis of the Two Groups of Genes—The full-length genes of I-5 and II-1 were fused with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a molecular chaperone, to produce I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI fusion proteins, as described previously (24Liu Y. Zhao T.-J. Yan Y.-B. Zhou H.-M. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 44: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified and were demonstrated to be homogenous on 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out using 0.5 μg of DNA elements and 15 μg of PDI fusion proteins. The wild-type DRE (WDRE) and the mutated DRE (MDRE) elements were synthesized as duplex with the following sequences: WDRE, 5′-AGCTACCGACATAAGGC-3′, and MDRE, 5′-AGCTATTTTCATAAGGC-3′. The proteins and the cis-element were dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and equilibrated at room temperature for 20 min. Then the samples were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA buffer, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide for visualization of DNA bands. Quantitative analysis of the binding abilities of I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI was monitored by the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra (24Liu Y. Zhao T.-J. Yan Y.-B. Zhou H.-M. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 44: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Kelly R.C. Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7240-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were prepared according to the same method used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis samples. Fluorescence spectra were collected on an F-2500 spectrofluorometer using a 1-ml cuvette, with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 300–400 nm. The apparent binding constants of I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI for WDRE were calculated as described previously (26Kelly R.C. Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7240-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast One-hybrid Assay—To detect the trans-activation ability of the two groups of DREBs, the coding regions of the genes were cloned into the yeast expression vector YepGAP (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into the yeast harboring the dual reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ under the control of tandem repeats of WDRE or MDRE as described previously (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The transformants were cultured on SD/–His/–Trp/–Ura with or without 30 mm 3-AT. Colony-lift filter assay and quantitative β-galactosidase activity analysis were carried out according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (36Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar) (Clontech), using o-nitrophenyl p-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Co-transformation of I-5 and II-1 in Yeast—To detect the effect of the expression of II-1 on the trans-activation role of I-5, we constructed a co-transformation yeast one-hybrid system, including two effective vectors, pGBKT7 (Clontech) and pGBDL, and the reporter yeast (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 4A. pGBDL was constructed by replacing the GAL4-AD of pGADT7 (Clontech) with the GAL4-BD of pGBKT7. Then genes constructed into these two vectors should be expressed at the same level since they are both fused to GAL4-BD and driven by the promoter of ADH1. The effector plasmids were constructed by inserting I-5 or II-1 downstream of the GAL4-BD of pGBKT7 or pGBDL. The co-transformants were grown on SD/–His/–Trp/–Leu/–Ura. Quantitative analysis of β-galactosidase activity was performed as described above. Western Blot Assay—I-5 and II-1 were cloned into the pET28a (Novagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS (Stratagene). The expressed proteins were mostly in the inclusion bodies, and the guanidine-denatured proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen). The purified proteins were used to prepare mouse multiclonal antibody. Yeast protein preparation was according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). Western blot was carried out after 10% SDS-PAGE, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Transient Expression Assay—To detect the trans-active activity of the two groups of genes, a dual reporter system was constructed, as shown in Fig. 6. For the F reporter construct, the cis-acting element DRE was multimerized three times, placed upstream of the minimal TATA box from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and fused transcriptionally to the firefly luciferase gene (Promega). For the R reporter construct, the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in pBI221 (Clontech) was replaced with the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega). The tobacco mosaic virus Ω sequence (27Gallie D.R. Sleat D.E. Watts J.W. Turner P.C. Wilson T.M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8693-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in pBI221 to enhance the transcription. For effector plasmids, the construct was similar to that of the R reporter, except that the genes used were I-5 and II-1 instead of Renilla luciferase. The tobacco protoplasts were isolated from the BY2 suspension cultures in a digestion buffer (0.4 m mannitol, 1% cellulase “onzuka” R-10, 0.1% pectolyase, 8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.8). The mixture was shaken at 40–50 rpm in the dark for 4–5 h until most of the cells became single protoplasts. Transient expression assays were performed by polyethylene glycol-mediated DNA transformation as described previously (28Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 196Google Scholar). 10 μg of the F reporter, 0.5 μg of the R reporter, and 10 μg of the effector plasmid (if not stated elsewhere) were used for each transformation. The Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured according the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Dual-Lucif-erase reporter assay system). Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis of the DREB1/CBF Proteins—In the present work, seven DREBs were obtained from the library of cold-induced cDNA of B. napus. Sequence alignment (Fig. 1A) showed that the genes could be divided into two groups, Group I (including I-4 and I-5) and Group II (including II-1, II-2, II-3, II-19, and II-23). Group I had a sequence of about 750 bp, whereas Group II had a sequence of about 650 bp. The two groups of genes showed high homology in their sequences, except that Group I had two additional insertions in the C-terminal region. The genes in each group had greater than 90% homology. The genes of Group I are quite similar to the previously reported BnCBF-like gene (29Jaglo K.R. Kleff S. Amundsen K.L. Zhang X. Haake V. Zhang J.Z. Deits T. Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and BNCBF17 (30Gao M.J. Allard G. Byass L. Flanagan A.M. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the Group II genes are quite similar to BNCBF5/7/16 (30Gao M.J. Allard G. Byass L. Flanagan A.M. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In fact, we did clone two genes identical to BNCBF7 and BNCBF17 (data not shown). Therefore, the two groups of genes cloned here might be new alleles of DREB1/CBF of B. napus, and it is also possible that the slight difference between the genes reported here and those reported previously was due to the different cultivars used for cloning of these genes. According to the classification of DREBs based on amino acid sequence (31Sakuma Y. Liu Q. Dubouzet J.G. Abe H. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar), these two groups of DREBs belong to the DREB1/CBF subfamily. To fully comprehend the occurrence of these proteins, we searched GenBank™ and made a phylogenetic comparison of all known DREB1/CBF proteins (Fig. 1B). As can be expected, the two groups of genes are classified into two clusters, which are in the same phylogenetic clade containing some other DREB1/CBF genes from crucifer, such as AtDREB1A-C from Arabidopsis, CbCBF25 from shepherd's purse, and ApCBF from Arabis pumila. It should be noted that in addition to B. napus, some other species also have DREB1/CBF genes belonging to different clusters. In Arabidopsis, AC010795 and AC025417 are in a different phylogenetic clade than AtDREB1A-C. In Oryza sativa, OsDREB1A and OsCBF1 are in a different cluster from OsDREB1E, OsDREB4, and OsCBF1like.In Vitis vinifera, VvCBF4 is in a different phylogenetic clade than the other four VvCBFs. In addition, the DREB1/CBF genes in Hordeum vulgare and Triticum aestivum are also classified into two different clusters. Therefore, the occurrence of these two groups of DREB1/CBF genes might be common in plant, implying that these two groups of genes might have different functions in vivo. The Expression of Group I Genes in Response to Cold Preceded That of Group II—To explore the expression patterns of the two groups of genes in response to cold stress, total RNAs were extracted from cold-stressed B. napus at different periods. I-5 and II-1 in each group were selected for analysis by reverse transcription (Fig. 2A) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2B), with actin amplified as an internal control. The transcripts of I-5 started to accumulate immediately after cold treatment was begun and reached the maximum at 1.5 h. Subsequently, the transcripts decreased rapidly and disappeared after 4.5 h. II-1 transcripts accumulated at a much slower rate and reached the maximum at about 4–5 h, and then gradually declined. These results indicated that the expression of Group I in response to cold preceded that of Group II, similar to what has been reported in an earlier study of the expression patterns of similar genes (30Gao M.J. Allard G. Byass L. Flanagan A.M. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was reported in another study, in which the expression of Arabidopsis CBF1/DREB1B and DREB1A/CBF3 preceded that of DREB1C/CBF2 (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The Genes of Group I Were Trans-active, whereas Those of Group II Were Inactive—As mentioned above, genes similar to those identified here have been reported to be able to bind with the DRE/CRT element and to activate the downstream genes when they are fused to the activation domain of GAL4 (30Gao M.J. Allard G. Byass L. Flanagan A.M. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear yet whether these genes are trans-active. Thus a yeast one-hybrid experiment was carried out to test the trans-activation abilities of the two groups of genes (Fig. 3A). The reporter yeasts containing WDRE transformed with I-5 grew well on both 3-AT-containing and -non-containing plates (Fig. 3, A and B), and the yeasts showed good expression of the reporter LacZ gene (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, the reporter yeasts containing MDRE transformed with I-5 could neither grow on the 30 mm 3-AT medium plates (Fig. 3B) nor show the expression of LacZ (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that I-5 could specifically bind with WDRE and activate the expression of the downstream genes. In contrast, transformants harboring II-1 could neither grow on the plates containing 3-AT (Fig. 3B) nor show the expression of LacZ (Fig. 3, C and D). To confirm that the results here were not specific to II-1, the other members were also tested, and the results were identical to those observed in II-1 (data not shown). Thus from the results above, Group II, in the DRE-specific reporter system, was trans-inactive, but it was not clear whether the trans-inactivation was due to its failure to bind with DRE or lack of trans-active ability. Sequence alignment revealed that the Group II genes contain the conserved DNA binding domain AP2/EREBP, and therefore it is expected that the failure of Group II to activate the downstream genes might be due to the lack of trans-activation activity instead of its inability to bind with DRE. To further confirm this deduction, a chimera IINIC was constructed by fusing the N-terminal region including the AP2/EREBP domain of II-1 with the C-terminal region of I-5 without the AP2/EREBP domain. Similar to the I-5 protein, IINIC also had the ability to bind with the DRE element and activate the expression of its downstream genes, indicating II-1 had the ability to bind WDRE. In fact, II-1, when fused to GAL4-AD, did trans-activate the downstream genes in yeasts (data not shown), which also confirmed that Group II was able to bind with the DRE element. To verify that the inability of II-1 to activate the downstream reporter genes was not due to its failure of expression in the yeasts, Western blot was carried out in yeasts harboring WDRE (Fig. 3D, inset). Due to the high sequence similarity, the multiclonal antibody against I-5 can recognize the II-1 protein and vice versa. The antibody against II-1 was used in the following assay. As is shown in Fig. 3D, inset, II-1, I-5, and the chimera protein IINIC were all expressed in the corresponding yeasts. These results confirmed the deduction that Group II DREBs were able to bind with WDRE but were unable to activate the downstream genes. I-5 and II-1 Showed Similar Efficiency for Binding with WDRE—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 4A) and fluorescence quenching assay (Fig. 4B) were carried out to characterize the DNA binding ability of I-5 and II-1 more precisely. To increase the solubility of the recombinant proteins, I-5 and II-1 were expressed in the PDI fusion system constructed by us previously (24Liu Y. Zhao T.-J. Yan Y.-B. Zhou H.-M. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 44: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the PDI fusion proteins, I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI, were used in the following assays. Two stranded WDRE and MDRE elements were used to test the binding specificity of the recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, both I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI can specifically bind with WDRE. As a control, PDI can bind with neither WDRE nor MDRE. The results here further confirmed the above conclusions that both Group I and Group II had the ability to bind with WDRE. Fluorescence quenching was carried out to quantify the binding affinities of I-5 and II-1 with wild-type DRE (Fig. 4B). The intrinsic fluorescence of both I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI were quenched gradually with the increase of WDRE until saturation, and finally, about 20% of the intrinsic fluorescence intensity would be quenched. As calculated according to the previous method (26Kelly R.C. Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7240-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the apparent binding constants for WDRE of I-5-PDI and II-1-PDI were (2.4 ± 0.4) ×107 m–1 and (1.8 ± 0.2) ×107m–1, respectively. These results indicated that the affinity of Group II to bind with WDRE was similar to, or slight weaker than, that of Group I. Co-expression of II-1 Decreases the Trans-activation Activity of I-5—The results above clearly indicated that Group II genes were expressed at a later stage upon cold stress (Fig. 2) and were trans-inactive (Fig. 3). Then what is the physiological role of Group II genes? Do the later expressed Group II genes affect the trans-activation activity of the Group I genes? To explore these questions, a yeast co-transformation system was constructed, including two effectors, pGBKT7 and pGBDL (Fig. 5A). I-5 and II-1 were constructed to pGBKT7 and pGBDL, named I-5/pGBKT7 and II-1/pGBDL, respectively. The two constructs were then co-transformed into the reporter yeast harboring the WDRE, and the transformants were grown on SD/–His/–Ura/–Trp/–Leu. Quantitative assay of β-galactosidase activity was performed to investigate the effect of II-1 on the trans-activation activity of I-5 (Fig. 5B). Taking the β-galactosidase activity of the transformants harboring only I-5/pGBKT7 as 100%, yeasts transformed with II-1/pGBDL showed almost no expression of β-galactosidase, consistent with the results above (Fig. 4B). When the yeasts were co-transformed with II-1/pGBDL and I-5/pGBKT7, the activity of β-galactosidase decreased to 35.9% (Fig. 5B). To confirm that the inhibition effect was due to the expression of II-1, pGBDL was co-transformed with I-5/pGBKT7, and the results showed that the β-galactosidase activity decreased only a little (Fig. 5B). The GAL4-BD fusion proteins were detected in the yeasts harboring different constructs. As shown in Fig. 5B, inset, GAL4-BD fusion proteins of I-5 and II-1 were almost equally expressed in the yeast transformed with II-1/pGBDL and I-5/pGBKT7. Therefore, it can be concluded that the co-expression of II-1 decreased the trans-activation activity of I-5. This conclusion was also confirmed by the results that co-expressed II-1/pGBKT7 could still depress the trans-activation activity of I-5/pGBDL (data not shown). To further confirm the inhibition effect of II-1 on the trans-activation of I-5, a dual reporter system was constructed for transient expression assay in tobacco BY2 protoplasts, consisting of the F reporter, R reporter, and effector plasmid (Fig. 6A). If the expressed protein is a trans-active DREB, it will bind with the DRE elements in the F reporter and activate the expression of firefly luciferase. The R reporter was an internal control. The ratio of the activity of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase is a reflection of the trans-active ability of the DREBs. I-5 and II-1 were constructed into the effector plasmid, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6B, the trans-activation activity of I-5 was about 25-fold of that of the empty effector vector (35S-Ω), whereas II-1 showed quite weak trans-active activity, only about 4-fold of that of 35S-Ω. Similar to the results of yeast co-transformation (Fig. 5B), the expression of II-1 depressed the trans-activation activity of I-5, and the depression effect of II-1 functioned in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). The trans-activation activity of I-5 decreased to 40.86%, when the two effector plasmids containing I-5 and II-1 were equally used for transient expression (Fig. 6B). The results here further demonstrated that the co-expression of II-1 could depress the trans-activation activity of I-5. Although much research has been conducted since the cis-acting element DRE was first identified (8Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), detailed mechanisms by which the DREB1/CBF family is regulated are still unclear. The induction of these genes has been proposed to be regulated at the transcriptional level, and it is possible that they are not subject to autoregulation (14Gilmour S.J. Zarka D.G. Stockinger E.J. Salazar M.P. Houghton J.M. Thomashow M.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Medina J. Bargues J. Perol M. Pérez-Alonso J. Salinas J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Recently, a transcriptional activator, named ICE1, was identified to be the upstream gene of DREB1A/CBF3 (20Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the DREB1/CBF gene expression is controlled, at least in part, by the DREB1/CBF themselves because DREB1C/CBF2 has been identified to function as a negative regulator of CBF1/DREB1B and DREB1A/CBF3 expression (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcription of DREB1/CBF has also been suggested to be under feedback repression by its own gene product or its downstream target gene products (17Guo Y. Xiong L. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). According to the sequence features (Fig. 1) and the response to cold stress (Fig. 2), the two groups of genes reported here and the previously reported BnCBFs (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Janssen B.J. Williams A. Chen J.J. Mathern J. Hake S. Sinha N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) belong to the DREB1/CBF family. Also, the occurrence of these two groups of genes seemed be common in plants according to phylogenetic analysis because the DREB1/CBF genes reported in other species can also be divided into two different groups similar to the two groups defined here. Since the DREB1/CBF-mediated signal pathway is highly conserved in plants (1Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 33Jiang C. Iu B. Singh J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 679-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ouellet F. Vazquez-Tello A. Sarhan F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Vazquez-Tello A. Ouellet F. Sarhan F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the findings here provide another possible regulatory mechanism of DREB1/CBF. Since the initial cloning of DREB1/CBF and DREB2 from Arabidopsis plants (10Stockinger E.J. Gilmour S.J. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), many genes have been cloned from various plant species. Among all the DREB-like genes, only DREB2A of Arabidopsis, which was induced by salt and drought, was reported to show quite weak or no trans-active ability (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), but there has been no such report about genes in the DREB1/CBF family. Here for the first time, we reported the transinactive Group II and studied its functions in the DRE-mediated signal pathway. Although the two groups of genes were demonstrated to have similar binding affinity for WDRE, they exhibited quite different transactivation activity; Group I was trans-active, whereas Group II was trans-inactive. Strictly speaking, Group II, similar to AtDREB2A, might have slight trans-activation ability (Fig. 6B), but this kind of activation ability was really too poor to activate the expression of the target genes, just like what has been reported in AtDREB2A (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). It was also notable that the two groups of genes showed different expression patterns in response to cold stress. The expression of the trans-active Group I preceded the expression of the trans-inactive Group II, which was quite similar to what has been reported in DREB1C/CBF2, CBF1/DREB1B, and DREB1A/CBF3 (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, Group II could possibly function in a pattern similar to DREB1C/CBF2 to act as a negative regulator of Group I. However, there must be some other roles of Group II genes since they are trans-inactive, unlike the trans-active DREB1C/CBF2 (11Liu Q. Sakuma Y. Abe H. Kasuga M. Miura S. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1391-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Then what is the significance of the expression of the trans-active Group I at the early stage of cold stress, whereas the trans-inactive Group II is expressed at a later stage? Through co-expression of these two groups of genes in yeast and tobacco BY2 cells, we found that the expression of Group II could depress the trans-activation activity of Group I in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 5 and 6). Since both Group I and II DREBs had the ability to bind with WDRE and the binding affinities were similar (Figs. 2 and 3), it is most likely that the two groups of genes function in a competent pattern. The Group I factors expressed early can efficiently bind with the WDRE cis-element on the promoters of the target genes, activate their expression, and open the DREB1/CBF-mediated signal pathway. The Group II factors that are expressed later will compete with Group I to bind with the DRE elements on the promoters of the target genes, prevent their activation, and thus close the signal pathway. The expression of the trans-inactive Group II might be an important form on the regulation of the DRE-mediated signaling pathway, and the two groups of genes might function in synergy to switch on/off this special pathway. Combining the observations here and the previous findings, we propose a hypothetical model for the roles of the two groups of genes in the regulation of the cold-inducible DRE-mediated signaling pathway, as presented in Fig. 7. When plants are subjected to cold stress, Group I genes are rapidly induced by its upstream transcription factors, like ICE1 (20Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B. Hong X. Agarwal M. Zhu J.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Then the expressed trans-active Group I factors bind efficiently with DRE on the promoters of the downstream genes, activate the transcription of these genes, and thus switch on the DRE-mediated signaling pathway to increase the resistance of plants to cold stress. When the proteins of Group I reach a certain level, the trans-inactive Group II is induced by some unknown mechanism, perhaps activated by Group I (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Then the expressed Group II proteins compete with Group I to bind with DRE elements on the promoters of the target genes and decrease their expression. Group II might also function as a negative regulator of Group I to depress the expression of Group I factors (21Novillo F. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Salinas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). With the decrease in Group I and the increase in Group II protein levels, the activation of DREB1/CBF target genes are gradually prevented. In this way, the cold-inducible DRE-mediated signaling pathway is switched off."

https://openalex.org/W2012941672,"To respond to emerging and re-emerging infections, it is necessary to understand the interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts and the impact of environmental and social factors on these interactions. The importance of understanding host-pathogen interactions is underscored by the emergence of virulent H5N1 avian influenza viruses and their transmission to humans, and the potential pandemic threat they pose. To respond to emerging and re-emerging infections, it is necessary to understand the interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts and the impact of environmental and social factors on these interactions. The importance of understanding host-pathogen interactions is underscored by the emergence of virulent H5N1 avian influenza viruses and their transmission to humans, and the potential pandemic threat they pose. Infectious diseases have always afflicted mankind and always will. New infectious diseases emerge and old diseases re-emerge as microbes adapt to new hosts and new environments. To remain one step ahead of our pathogenic microbial foes, we must understand in detail how pathogens interact with their hosts, and how biological, environmental, and social factors combine to allow pathogens to infect new organisms. Deciphering each step in the different processes by which microbes adapt to new hosts is critical to developing effective countermeasures to detect, prevent, and treat infectious diseases. Our current efforts to prepare for the unpredictable event of a possible global influenza pandemic and to minimize the burden of highly predictable, seasonal influenza epidemics exemplify the challenges of trying to keep up with and hopefully stay ahead of the influenza virus, a constantly evolving pathogen. Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death throughout the world. In 2002, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002WHO (2002). World Health Organization. Avian Influenza http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/.Google Scholar), more than a quarter of approximately 57 million deaths worldwide were caused by infectious diseases. Millions of additional deaths are due to the secondary effects of infections. Among people under the age of 50 years, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death and account for nearly one-third of all healthy years lost to illness (Morens et al., 2004Morens D.M. Folkers G.F. Fauci A.S. Nature. 2004; 430: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). An estimated 75 percent of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic in origin, that is, they arise from microbes that infect other animals (Taylor et al., 2001Taylor L.H. Latham S.M. Woolhouse M.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Most microbes have evolved to reach an equilibrium with their natural hosts without causing disease. However, factors such as economic development and land use leading to perturbations in the natural microbial environment, human demographics and behavior, and international travel and commerce can create an imbalance in the established microbe-host equilibrium and trigger the emergence of new infectious diseases. Human intrusion into settings such as rainforests has led to exposure of humans to viruses and other microbes that otherwise would not have occurred. For example, the practice of butchering nonhuman primates for “bushmeat” may be in part responsible for the “jumping” of HIV from its natural animal hosts to human hosts, as well as for the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in Central Africa. The flow of rural populations into cities, urban poverty, and weakening of traditional family and social structures have led to increased sexual promiscuity, prostitution, and other practices that undoubtedly fueled the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia occurred when pigs penned near fruit orchards contracted the virus from the droppings of bats, whose habitat had shifted as a result of deforestation. The infected pigs readily transmitted the virus to their handlers. The spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease in cattle, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, primarily in the United Kingdom, resulted from the practice of feeding cows grain containing the remains of scrapie-infected sheep (Morens et al., 2004Morens D.M. Folkers G.F. Fauci A.S. Nature. 2004; 430: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). New diseases do not emerge or re-emerge in a vacuum—they do so against a background of established infectious diseases and host-microbe interactions that have existed for centuries. The diseases that make up this matrix were at some point emerging diseases that had never been previously observed in human populations but eventually became so entrenched in the population that they became part of the background infectious disease burden. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, HIV/AIDS clearly was an emerging disease, but now it is an endemic matrix (background) disease. More recent examples of newly emerging infectious diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus encephalitis, Lassa fever, and most recently, human disease caused by the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus. Infectious diseases that have previously occurred in humans also can re-emerge or resurge in different forms or in different environments. Examples include West Nile virus in the western hemisphere; monkeypox in the United States; dengue fever in Brazil, other parts of South and Central America, and even the Caribbean; and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis throughout the world (Morens et al., 2004Morens D.M. Folkers G.F. Fauci A.S. Nature. 2004; 430: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Humans and microbes coexist in a delicate balance amid an ever-present tension. Microbes possess the ability to adapt naturally to their hosts, to their environment, and to new ecological niches offered to them as humans encroach upon their territory. They are also adept at circumventing efforts to suppress them, whether as a result of internal host pressures such as innate and adaptive immune responses or in reaction to external pressure applied by antibiotics, antivirals, or vaccines. In the face of our efforts to eliminate them, microbes almost always adapt successfully, thwarting our efforts to destroy them. A prototypic example of the constant struggle between microbes and man is the evolutionary success of influenza viruses as they adapt to their many hosts, including humans. Research to understand how influenza viruses coexist with hosts that serve as their natural reservoirs and attempts to delineate the factors that result in viruses adapting to new hosts and triggering disease serve at least two purposes. This information is crucial to controlling yearly, seasonal influenza epidemics and preventing the devastation that may occur should a global influenza pandemic emerge. In addition, research into the natural evolution of influenza viruses and their adaptation to different hosts may inform our efforts to understand other infectious diseases that emerge and re-emerge in unpredictable ways. Influenza is fundamentally a recurring background or matrix disease that usually re-emerges each year in a slightly different form (antigenic drift). However, it occasionally assumes a presentation as a newly emerging disease, very different from what the global society has previously experienced (antigenic shift). Seasonal influenza kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people worldwide each year, mostly older individuals; in the United States, an average of 36,000 influenza-related deaths occur each year. In addition to the ever-present and largely predictable threat of seasonal influenza, the world also faces the threat of a much more unpredictable pandemic influenza, caused by the emergence of a new strain of influenza virus to which humans have never been exposed. Over the past two years, the risk of an influenza pandemic has grown, as an exceptionally virulent form of the H5N1 avian influenza virus has circulated widely among domestic poultry and wild migratory birds in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. As of February 9, 2006, the virus also has infected more than 166 people since late 2003, of whom half have died (WHO) (see Figure 1). Pandemics occur when a new influenza virus variant emerges to which the human population has no immunity. Influenza A viruses are most dangerous to humans because of their wide host range, their rapid mutation rate, and their capacity to cause serious disease (Wright and Webster, 2001Wright P.F. Webster R.G. Orthomyxoviruses.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Fields Virology. 4th edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1533-1579Google Scholar). Influenza A subtypes are defined by the expression of two key surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Sixteen hemagglutinins are known to exist, each of which can be “paired” with one of nine neuraminidase proteins. These influenza A subtypes are all maintained in aquatic birds, which serve as a continual source of new viruses. A key factor in the possible emergence of an avian influenza virus as a human pandemic strain is the evolution and adaptation of the virus to the human species. By understanding the etiology of previous influenza pandemics, scientists are trying to elucidate the steps that currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza viruses would need to take to become capable of efficient transmission from human to human. In 1918, the H1N1 avian influenza virus subtype emerged, and the ensuing pandemic called the Spanish Flu killed an estimated 40–50 million people worldwide. In subsequent years, humans built up a degree of immunological memory to H1N1 influenza as it circulated in the general population, causing less severe yearly influenza epidemics. Then, in 1957, another strain to which humans had no prior experience—the H2N2 influenza virus—appeared and triggered a pandemic that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1–2 million people globally. In 1968, the H3N2 subtype emerged, yet another strain to which humans had no prior exposure; this pandemic resulted in the deaths of approximately 700,000 individuals. Since 1968, variants of H3N2 have circulated to cause seasonal epidemics; in 1977, human H1N1 viruses reappeared, and these also continue to circulate (Wright and Webster, 2001Wright P.F. Webster R.G. Orthomyxoviruses.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Fields Virology. 4th edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1533-1579Google Scholar). The 1918 virus was an avian virus that adapted to humans through a series of point mutations (Taubenberger et al., 2005Taubenberger J.K. Reid A.H. Lourens R.M. Jin G. Fanning T.G. Nature. 2005; 437: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 1957 and 1968 pandemic influenza viruses were the products of reassortment, that is, they derived three genes from an avian influenza virus and their remaining five genes from the previously circulating human influenza viruses (Wright and Webster, 2001Wright P.F. Webster R.G. Orthomyxoviruses.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Fields Virology. 4th edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1533-1579Google Scholar). The H5N1 virus was first recognized in chickens in Scotland in 1959. At an unknown point in time, the H5N1 avian influenza virus began to appear in poultry flocks in Southeast Asia, causing only mild symptoms of disease in birds before the mid 1990s. In late 1996, it became evident that the virus had mutated to a highly pathogenic form that could kill chickens within 48 hr, with a nearly 100 percent mortality rate. In 1997, the first human cases of highly lethal H5N1 influenza occurred in Hong Kong; 18 people were infected, and 6 died. Public health authorities in Hong Kong ordered a massive culling of poultry, which apparently prevented further spread of the virus at that time. However, in early 2003, the virus reappeared in a Hong Kong family who had recently visited mainland China. In late 2003, H5N1 surfaced again, first in Vietnam and then Thailand (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza). The highly pathogenic H5N1 strains of influenza currently circulating—predominantly in poultry—are primarily animal pathogens and already constitute a true pandemic among chickens. Whether the virus develops into a strain capable of spreading from human to human in an efficient and sustained manner, thereby triggering a human pandemic, will depend on how the virus evolves and adapts to new hosts. Since its re-emergence in Southeast Asia in 2003, the virus has appeared in poultry in at least 18 countries and in multiple species of migratory birds. The virus also has been found in other animals, including pigs, tigers, and leopards. The virus has infected at least 93 people and killed 42 people in Vietnam. As of February 9, 2006, there have been at least 22 human cases and 14 deaths in Thailand, 4 cases (all fatal) in Cambodia, 25 cases and 18 deaths in Indonesia, 12 cases and 8 deaths in China, 12 cases and 4 deaths in Turkey, and 1 fatal case in Iraq, with the toll continuing to rise every week (see Figure 1). H5N1 influenza viruses had originally circulated in wild birds without causing disease and without mutating into highly virulent forms. Ominously, however, the currently circulating H5N1 viruses appear to have the ability to mutate in domestic poultry to highly pathogenic forms. As the virus has infected chickens and other domestic poultry, it has become increasingly virulent and has achieved the capability of jumping species to humans and to other animals with lethal consequences. Most alarmingly, the virus now seems to be transmitted from poultry back to migratory birds and, for the first time, is causing disease in the migrating bird population. This unprecedented pattern of transmission is an important reason why public health officials are watching the H5N1 virus carefully because it is a strain with the potential to cause the next influenza pandemic (see Figure 2) (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/special_avian.html). Researchers recently reconstructed the entire coding sequence of the H1N1 virus that triggered the 1918 influenza pandemic (Taubenberger et al., 2005Taubenberger J.K. Reid A.H. Lourens R.M. Jin G. Fanning T.G. Nature. 2005; 437: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). They found that this virus, presumably avian in origin, did not reassort with putative human viruses circulating at that time. Rather, the virus accumulated a series of mutations that enabled it to more efficiently infect and replicate in human cells, explaining its rapid propagation among humans. By comparing sequences of the 1918 virus with known avian and human influenza viruses, it was possible to identify a set of 10 amino acid residues among the three viral polymerase proteins that are associated with the ability of the virus to infect and replicate efficiently in human cells. Thus far, the H5N1 virus has accumulated five of the ten changes in the encoded polymerase protein sequences that were found in the 1918 virus and are commonly found in human influenza viruses. This suggests that the H5N1 virus may be accumulating changes associated with an increased likelihood of human-to-human transmission (Taubenberger et al., 2005Taubenberger J.K. Reid A.H. Lourens R.M. Jin G. Fanning T.G. Nature. 2005; 437: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The 1918 pandemic caught public health officials completely by surprise—it was not even known then that the illness was caused by a virus. Today, however, as we face the prospect of another global influenza pandemic, we have a unique opportunity that did not exist in 1918. We have the tools to monitor genetic sequences of influenza viruses as they evolve in both humans and birds. We also have the capacity to develop and manufacture countermeasures against new strains of influenza. As we prepare for the possibility of the next pandemic influenza it will be important to optimize the use of available public health measures and scientific tools and technologies. An effective response to H5N1 avian influenza virus or any emerging and re-emerging infection requires a comprehensive, multifaceted approach. Surveillance, public health measures, and biomedical research—including the ability to isolate infectious agents, decipher pathogenic mechanisms, and develop appropriate diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines—are all critical components of a multipronged response to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including both seasonal and pandemic influenza. As noted, H5N1 avian influenza viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens with the potential to trigger a possible pandemic. It will be critical to maintain diligent surveillance of the virus in both animal and human populations in order to monitor its evolution and capacity to sustain efficient human-to-human spread. Isolation and characterization of the virus in real time are critical as we develop vaccines and antiviral drugs that are effective among the circulating viruses with potential to cause widespread disease. Antiviral medications such as oseltamivir and zanamivir have been shown to reduce the severity and duration of seasonal influenza. However, their efficacy in treating a potential influenza pandemic is uncertain. Therefore, a vaccine against circulating strains of the H5N1 virus will be critical in preventing widespread transmission of the virus should it develop the ability to spread readily among humans. In this regard, techniques to rapidly isolate and sequence circulating influenza viruses have been developed. Using a technique known as reverse genetics, researchers in academia and industry have developed prototype vaccines against the H5N1 virus and are currently testing their safety and immunogenicity in human volunteers. In a recent clinical trial, 451 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated with two intramuscular doses of an inactivated H5N1 vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur. Preliminary data indicate that the vaccine was well-tolerated and induced an antibody response predictive of protection, albeit at high doses (unpublished data). A trial of the same vaccine among >260 elderly volunteers is underway, with a third trial in pediatric volunteers planned for the spring of 2006. Scientists also are investigating ways to increase the immunogenicity of H5N1 vaccines, including the use of adjuvants, employing intradermal rather than intramuscular administration, and developing live-attenuated vaccines. In this regard, a library of live-attenuated vaccines against all 16 major avian influenza subtypes is being developed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between MedImmune, Inc. and researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Once generated, production of these pre-existing stock vaccines could be scaled up and used to “pre-prime” individuals in an emergency situation while more specific vaccine formulations are being developed. Recent collaborative studies by researchers in the United States and China, involving genetic analysis of samples from 13,000 migratory birds and 50,000 domestic poultry, reveal that H5N1 viruses have been circulating among both wild and domestic birds in China for the past 10 years. These viruses have evolved into distinct genetic clusters associated with particular geographic regions. The studies suggest that the virus originated in China and has spread to neighboring and distant regions over the past decade (Chen et al., 2006Chen H. Smith G.J.D. Li K.S. Wang J. Fan X.F. Rayner J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0511120103Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization, along with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations (FAO, 2006FAO (2006). Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Animal Health: Avian Influenza. http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/special_avian.html.Google Scholar), are coordinating efforts to monitor transmission of the H5N1 virus throughout the world and to prepare for the possibility of an influenza pandemic. Activities include increased surveillance of viral evolution and transmission among wild birds, domestic poultry, and humans, confirmation of etiologic agents in symptomatic patients and contacts, vaccine development and distribution, and stockpiling of antiviral treatments. WHO oversees a network of laboratories that monitor evolution of the H5N1 virus and prepare prototype vaccine strains for vaccine manufacturers. Currently ten countries have domestic vaccine manufacturers and several of these companies are developing pandemic vaccines. Although several countries have reported that efforts to vaccinate poultry are planned or underway, no companies are currently prepared to produce pandemic vaccines commercially for use in humans. A major challenge to an effective response to influenza and the threat of a pandemic is the need to repair our fragile vaccine production enterprise. In the 1970s, more than two dozen pharmaceutical companies were licensed to sell vaccines in the United States. Today, only four are licensed to manufacture influenza vaccine for distribution within the United States. It is important to develop partnerships among government, academia, and industry to increase the capability of developing new vaccine manufacturing technologies, such as cell-based culture techniques that will allow for greater flexibility and surge capacity in the production of vaccines. Indeed, it is essential for the U.S. Federal government to partner with pharmaceutical companies to develop and sustain the manufacturing capacity for vaccines and therapies that can be made available in an expeditious manner in the eventuality of a pandemic. Equally important is the institution of policies that will provide incentives to vaccine manufacturers to enter and remain in business. Influenza and the threat of an influenza pandemic present a unique challenge to public health and the biomedical research enterprise worldwide. Although available technology offers sophisticated tools with which to monitor the evolution and characteristics of the virus, it will also be essential to use our knowledge and resources wisely. Increased cooperation among governments and public health agencies will be critical. The sharing of epidemiological data and deployment of countermeasures in the geographic areas where they are most likely to result in disease containment are equally important. Ongoing efforts in basic biomedical research also are critical to the comprehensive pandemic preparedness effort, including studies to understand viral pathogenesis; the ongoing search for new antivirals; new platforms and targets for vaccines, such as recombinant DNA and vector approaches; as well as improved vaccine manufacturing methods. We do not know whether H5N1 will be the virus that triggers the next influenza pandemic. However, as we increase our efforts to improve our capacity to respond to this virus, we also will increase the likelihood that we can efficiently and effectively respond to any future pandemic influenza as well as to any emerging or re-emerging pathogen that threatens mankind.

https://openalex.org/W2095577036,"The neural microtubule-associated protein Tau binds directly to microtubules and regulates their dynamic behavior. In addition to being required for normal development, maintenance, and function of the nervous system, Tau is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. One group of neurodegenerative dementias known as FTDP-17 (fronto-temporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17) is directly linked genetically to mutations in the tau gene, demonstrating that Tau misfunction can cause neuronal cell death and dementia. These mutations result either in amino acid substitutions in Tau or in altered Tau mRNA splicing that skews the expression ratio of wild-type 3-repeat and 4-repeat Tau isoforms. Because wild-type Tau regulates microtubule dynamics, one possible mechanism underlying Tau-mediated neurodegeneration is aberrant regulation of microtubule behavior. In this study, we microinjected normal and mutated Tau protein into cultured cells expressing fluorescent tubulin and measured the effects on the dynamic instability of individual microtubules. We found that the FTDP-17 amino acid substitutions G272V (in both 3-repeat and 4-repeat Tau contexts), ΔK280, and P301L all exhibited markedly reduced abilities to regulate dynamic instability relative to wild-type Tau. In contrast, the FTDP-17 R406W mutation (which maps in a regulatory region outside the microtubule binding domain of Tau) did not significantly alter the ability of 3-repeat or 4-repeat Tau to regulate microtubule dynamics. Overall, these data are consistent with a loss-of-function model in which both amino acid substitutions and altered mRNA splicing in Tau lead to neurodegeneration by diminishing the ability of Tau to properly regulate microtubule dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2110913360,"MAGE-A1 belongs to a group of germ line-specific genes that rely primarily on DNA methylation for repression in somatic tissues. In many types of tumors, the promoter of these genes becomes demethylated and transcription becomes activated. We showed previously that, although MZ2-MEL melanoma cells contain an active unmethylated MAGE-A1 gene, they lack the ability to induce demethylation of newly integrated MAGE-A1 transgenes that were methylated in vitro before transfection. In the same cells, unmethylated MAGE-A1 transgenes were protected against remethylation, and this appeared to depend on the level of transcriptional activity. We therefore proposed that hypomethylation of MAGE-A1 in tumors relies on a past demethylation event and on the presence of appropriate transcription factors that maintain the promoter unmethylated. Here, we tested this hypothesis further by examining whether induction of a transient demethylation phase in MZ2-MEL would suffice to convert a previously methylated MAGE-A1 transgene into a permanently hypomethylated and active one. For induction of the demethylation phase, we used antisense oligonucleotides targeting the three known human DNA methyltransferases. We found that down-regulation of DNMT1, but not of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, induces activation of the MAGE-A1 transgene, suggesting that DNMT1 has a predominant role for methylation maintenance in MZ2-MEL cells. By using a selectable MAGE-A1 transgene construct, we were able to isolate a cell population in which DNMT1 depletion had resulted in transgene activation. The promoter region of the transgene was almost completely unmethylated in these cells, and this active and unmethylated state was maintained for over 60 days after restoration of normal DNMT1 expression.

Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are often methylated in mammalian genomes. This epigenetic modification of DNA exerts a potent repressive effect on transcription by preventing the binding of transcription factors and by recruiting methyl-CpG-binding proteins, which in turn attract repressor complexes that modify chromatin structures by deacetylating or methylating specific residues on histones (1Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar). DNA methylation has an essential role in the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells (2Riggs A.D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). DNA methylation patterns are acquired during development by a process that involves a phase of extensive demethylation in the early embryo, followed by an active phase of de novo methylation (8Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 9Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development. 1987; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once established, methylation patterns are inherited through cell generations by a maintenance process that copies pre-existing methylation sites onto the newly synthesized strand (10Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In mammals, the transfer of a methyl group to cytosines is catalyzed by three DNA methyltransferases, namely DNMT1, 3The abbreviations used are: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; MAGE-A1, melanoma antigen gene A1; RT-PCR; reverse transcription PCR; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DNMT-AS, DNA methyltransferase antisense. DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (11Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). The two latter enzymes have de novo methylation activity and are responsible for the establishment of DNA methylation patterns during embryonic development (12Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Consistently, DNMT3A and -3B are highly expressed in the embryo, whereas they are expressed at low levels in adult somatic cells (13Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). DNMT1, which has a preference for hemimethylated DNA, is the major maintenance methyltransferase (14Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 15Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In embryonic cell lines, however, DNMT3A and DNMT3B appear to cooperate with DNMT1 to maintain methylation patterns (19Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 20Hattori N. Abe T. Suzuki M. Matsuyama T. Yoshida S. Li E. Shiota K. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cancer cells show altered patterns of DNA methylation (21Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally unmethylated promoters often become densely methylated in tumor cells, and this results in silencing of critical genes such as tumor suppressor genes. In many tumors, including these same tumors, the global level of DNA methylation is usually decreased (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1983; 301: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 23Gama-Sosa M.A. Slagel V.A. Trewyn R.W. Oxenhandler R. Kuo K.C. Gehrke C.W. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Using a mouse model in which DNMT1 was inhibited by a genetic approach, Gaudet et al. (24Gaudet F. Hodgson J.G. Eden A. Jackson-Grusby L. Dausman J. Gray J.W. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Science. 2003; 300: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) provided evidence that genome-wide hypomethylation promotes tumor formation by increasing genomic instability. Another consequence of the overall demethylation process in tumors is the activation of genes that are controlled by DNA methylation (25Feinberg A.P. Tycko B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). This is the case for a group of germ line-specific genes that rely primarily on DNA methylation for silencing in normal somatic tissues (7De Smet C. Lurquin C. Lethé B. Martelange V. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 26De Smet C. De Backer O. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Brasseur F. Boon T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, these genes become aberrantly activated in many different types of tumors, where they direct the expression of tumor-specific antigens recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (28Van Der Bruggen P. Zhang Y. Chaux P. Stroobant V. Panichelli C. Schultz E.S. Chapiro J. Van Den Eynde B.J. Brasseur F. Boon T. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 188: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To date, more than 30 genes or gene families showing specific expression in germ line and cancer cells have been identified. They are named cancer-germ line or cancer-testis genes. The mechanisms leading to DNA hypomethylation in tumors are still unclear. In a previous report we addressed this issue by using the MAGE-A1 cancer-germ line gene as a model (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We found that in tumor cells expressing this gene, hypomethylated CpGs are not randomly distributed over the MAGE-A1 locus but are clustered within the 5′-region of the gene. In the MZ2-MEL melanoma cell line for instance, where MAGE-A1 is expressed, hypomethylation within the gene is restricted to a ∼3-kb region centered on the transcription start site. This site-specific hypomethylation does not appear to be due to a permanent targeted demethylating activity, because in vitro methylated MAGE-A1 sequences did not undergo demethylation following stable transfection into MZ2-MEL cells. Remarkably, in the same cells unmethylated MAGE-A1 transgenes were progressively remethylated at all sites except those located in the 5′-region of the gene. This local inhibition of de novo methylation appeared to depend on the level of transcriptional activity. Based on these observations, we proposed that MAGE-A1 hypomethylation in tumors might be the result of a past event of demethylation, which would be maintained by the presence of potent transcriptional activators (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the experiments described above, protection of the MAGE-A1 promoter region against de novo methylation was observed after transfection of naked unmethylated DNA. In the present study, we investigated whether a previously methylated transgene would similarly become permanently protected against remethylation following induction of a transient demethylation phase. To this end, we introduced an in vitro methylated MAGE-A1 construct into MZ2-MEL cells. We then induced a transient demethylation phase by treating the cells for a limited period of time with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the DNA methyltransferases (30Beaulieu N. Morin S.

Chute I.C. Barsalou A. MacLeod A.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). By testing different combinations of anti-DNMT1, anti-DNMT3A, and anti-DNMT3B oligonucleotides, we found that depletion of only DNMT1 resulted in transgene activation. However, anti-DNMT1 oligonucleotides produced transgene derepression in only a small fraction of the treated cells. By using a transgene construct in which the last exon of MAGE-A1 was replaced by the sequence encoding resistance to hygromycin, we were able to select the cells in which transgene activation occurred. Selected cells were then assessed for stability of demethylation and activation of the transgene. Plasmid Constructions—The pMAGEA1/EGFP plasmid was constructed by removing the EBFP sequence from pEBFPM1-WT plasmid (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) following digestion with NotI and AgeI and by replacing it with the EGFP coding unit released from the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) following digestion with the same enzymes. For construction of the pMAGEA1/hph plasmid, the hph sequence from -12 to +1077 relative to the translation initiation site was amplified by PCR from pHMR272 (32Bernard H.U. Krammer G. Rowekamp W.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 158: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with primers 5′-ACGCGTCGACGATCCGGGAGATATGAAAAA and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGTTCTCGAAATCAGCT, which carry a 5′-overhang containing a SalI or a NotI restriction site, respectively. On the other hand, the MAGE-A1 sequence located between position -1055 and position -3 relative to the translation start site and containing a KpnI site at position -1022 was amplified by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GCGTTCGGGTGAGGAACA and an antisense primer carrying a 5′-overhang with a SalI site, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCTCGTCAGGGCAGCA. The MAGE-A1 and hph fragments were digested with KpnI and SalI or with SalI and NotI, respectively, and were co-ligated to the pEBFPM1-WT in which part of the MAGEA1/EBFP insert had been removed by KpnI and NotI digestion. Both pMAGEA1/EGFP and pMAGEA1/hph plasmids contain a geneticin resistance gene for selection of transfected cells. For construction of pDNMT3A and pDNMT3B, the open reading frame of DNMT3A or DNMT3B was amplified from human MZ2-MEL cells using Prime-STAR DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.). The DNMT3A PCR product was introduced into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) between the Hin-dIII (blunted) and EcoRI sites. The DNMT3B open reading frame was introduced into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) between the KpnI and XbaI sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. In Vitro Methylation and Transfections of Plasmids—pMAGEA1/EGFP and pMAGEA1/hph DNAs were prepared using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Plasmids were methylated in vitro with the SssI methylase, which methylates cytosines in CpG dinucleotides, as previously described (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Efficient methylation of the plasmids was confirmed by their resistance to digestion upon incubation with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII. The MZ2-MEL3.1 cell line and conditions of cell culture have been described previously (33De Smet C. Courtois S.J. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Szikora J.-P. De Backer O. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cells (4 × 105) were inoculated in 75-cm2 flasks 48 h before transfection. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Traversari C. van der Bruggen P. Van den Eynde B. Hainaut P. Lemoine C. Ohta N. Old L. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1992; 35: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA (carrying a geneticin resistance gene) diluted in 20 μg of EcoRI-digested human genomic DNA. Dilution of the plasmid in genomic DNA was previously shown to minimize the integration of multiple copies in MZ2-MEL cells (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in medium containing 2 mg of geneticin/ml for 15-16 days. Transfected cell populations were cloned by limiting dilutions. Several clones were cultured in the absence or in the presence of 2 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine during 3 days, and expression of the transgene was tested by RT-PCR (see RT-PCR conditions below). This led to the selection of clone MZ2-MEL.Tr4 (containing an in vitro methylated pMAGEA1/EGFP plasmid) and clone MZ2-MEL. TrHM (containing an in vitro methylated pMAGEA1/hph plasmid) in which the transgene was completely repressed but was strongly induced upon treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Western Blots—Nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation kit (Biovision Inc, Palo Alto, CA). Protein samples were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the Xcell Surelock electrophoresis and transfer apparatus (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in a first phosphate-buffered saline blocking solution containing 2.5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. They were then transferred into a second phosphate-buffered saline blocking solution supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with an α-DNMT1 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), α-DNMT3A antibodies P-16 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ab16704 monoclonal (Abcam Ltd.), α-DNMT3B antibodies N-19 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and IMG-184 monoclonal (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA), or with an α-p80 Ku monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Upstate BioScientific, Lake Placid, NY). Membranes were washed, incubated with either α-rabbit IgG-HPR (1:10000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or α-mouse IgG-HPR secondary antibodies (Pierce) and revealed using the SuperSignal West-Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). As positive controls for detection of DNMT3A and DNMT3B proteins, 1 × 106 MZ2-MEL.Tr4 cells were transfected with increasing amounts (5-25 μg) of pDNMT3A or pDNMT3B plasmids, respectively. Total RNA and nuclear proteins were extracted 2 days after transfection. The level of DNMT3A and DNMT3B transcription in the transfected cell population was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Antisense Oligonucleotide Transfections—2 × 106 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed in 4.5 ml of OPTIMEM-1 medium (Invitrogen) containing 6.25 μg/ml of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and 50-100 nm of each 2′-O-methyl phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides, which were commercially synthesized (Eurogentec SA, Seraing, Belgium). After 4 h of incubation, cells were transferred in complete medium. Cells were transfected in this way every other day and split 24 h after the transfections. The antisense oligonucleotide sequences were described elsewhere, with DNMT1-AS oligonucleotide referring to MG98 oligonucleotide (30Beaulieu N. Morin S. Chute I.C. Robert M.F. Nguyen H. MacLeod A.R.

The sequence of the control scramble phosphorothioate oligonucleotide is 5′-CCTAGCAAGATCCGTCATCT, with the four nucleotides at each end carrying 2′-O-methyl modifications. For selection of MZ2-MEL.TrHM cells in which DNMT1 depletion resulted in transgene activation, cells were transferred in medium containing 180 μg/ml of Hygromycin B (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA). Conventional and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA samples were extracted using TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription was performed on 2 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers as described previously (35Weynants P. Lethé B. Brasseur F. Marchand M. Boon T. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Conditions of conventional RT-PCR have been described elsewhere (33De Smet C. Courtois S.J. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Szikora J.-P. De Backer O. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For amplification of MAGEA1/EGFP and MAGEA1/hph we used a common sense primer, 5′-CCAACCCAGAGGACAGGATT, but specific antisense primers, 5′-GGTGGTGCAGATGAACTTCA or 5′-GCCGATAAACATAACGATCTT, respectively. Primers for β-actin have been previously described (33De Smet C. Courtois S.J. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Szikora J.-P. De Backer O. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR amplifications were performed as previously described (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) except that uracyl-N-glycosylase was omitted. Primers and probes for β-actin quantification are described elsewhere (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Primers and probes for MAGEA1/EGFP quantification are the same as those used in our previous study for quantification of MAGEA1/EBFP (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Other PCR primers were 5′-CCTCAGCTACTGCGACTACT (sense) and 5′-GCACTCATGTCCTTACAGATGT (antisense) for DNMT1, 5′-GGCTCTTTGAGAATGTGGT (sense) and 5′-CAAATACCCTTTCCATTTCA (antisense) for DNMT3A, 5′-CATGAAGGTTGGCGACAA (sense) and 5′-GCCTGGCTGGAACTATTCACA (antisense) for DNMT3B. The 5′-FAM/3′-TAMRA probe sequences were 5′-ATGGTCCTGAAGCTCACCCTCC for DNMT1, 5′-TCCAACCCTGTGATGATTGATGC for DNMT3A, and 5′-TGCCTGTCATCCGACACCTCTT for DNMT3B. For each specific quantitative RT-PCR, calibration curves were made by diluting known copy number of pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) in which the PCR product had been cloned. Samples were always analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—Sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed as described previously (29De Smet C. Loriot A. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Primers for the first round of PCR amplification of the MAGE-A1 promoter region were as described elsewhere (7De Smet C. Lurquin C. Lethé B. Martelange V. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). For the second semi-nested PCR, we used the same sense primer together with 5′-CTAAAACRTCTTCCCRCRCTCTAA as antisense primer. Generation of an MZ2-MEL Clone Containing a Methylated MAGE-A1 Transgene (MZ2-MEL.Tr4)—To produce an MZ2-MEL clone containing a methylated MAGE-A1 transgene, we transfected MZ2-MEL cells with an in vitro methylated construct carrying a 6.9-kb fragment of MAGE-A1 (-3255 to +3639 relative to the transcription start site) fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transcription unit (Fig. 1A). Transfectants were selected according to their resistance to geneticin, which was conferred by the transgene vector, and several clones were isolated. Among these, we selected clone MZ2-MEL.Tr4, because the transgene in these cells was completely repressed but could be strongly activated upon treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Fig. 1B). Methylation of the MAGEA1/EGFP transgene was maintained in untreated MZ2-MEL.Tr4 cells even after long-term culture (data not shown). This confirms our previous observations that, although MZ2-MEL cells contain an endogenous unmethylated MAGE-A1 gene, they lack the ability to induce demethylation of newly integrated MAGE-A1 transgenes. Efficient Inhibition of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B Expression by Antisense Oligonucleotides—To induce demethylation of the MAGE-A1 transgene in MZ2-MEL.Tr4, we decided to transiently deplete the maintenance DNA methyltransferase(s) by treating the cells with specific antisense oligonucleotides. Although methylation maintenance has been classically attributed to DNMT1, recent evidence suggests that in some tumor cells DNMT3 methyltransferases participate in this process (36Leu Y.W. Rahmatpanah F. Shi H. Wei S.H. Liu J.C. Yan P.S. Huang T.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6110-6115PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rhee I. Bachman K.E. Park B.H. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Schuebel K.E. Cui H. Feinberg A.P. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Baylin S.B. Vogelstein B. Nature. 2002; 416: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of depleting each of the three DNMTs in MZ2-MEL.Tr4. To this end, we used the phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (DNMT1-AS, DNMT3A-AS, and DNMT3B-AS) previously described by Robert et al. (30Beaulieu N. Morin S. Chute I.C. Robert M.F. Nguyen H. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28176-28181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Robert M.F. Morin S. Beaulieu N. Gauthier F. Chute I.C. Barsalou A. MacLeod A.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the level of expression of the three DNMTs in MZ2-MEL.Tr4 by quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the amount of DNMT1 mRNA in these cells is ∼15 and 10 times higher than that of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, respectively (Fig. 2A). We also performed Western blot analysis on a nuclear extract from MZ2-MEL.Tr4. Although α-DNMT1 antibodies revealed a clear signal at a size corresponding to the DNMT1 protein (∼191 kDa; Fig. 2B), α-DNMT3A and α-DNMT3B antibodies did not allow detection of a band of the expected size above the background (Fig. 2B). Lack of detection of DNMT3A and DNMT3B proteins is likely related to the low level of transcription of the corresponding genes in MZ2-MEL.Tr4. The proteins became detectable in MZ2-MEL.Tr4 that were induced to express increased levels of DNMT3A (10- and 86-fold increase) or DNMT3B transcripts (15- and 61-fold increase) following transfection of different amounts of pDNMT3A and pDNMT3B expression vectors (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that DNMT1 is the major DNA methyltransferase in MZ2-MEL.Tr4. Although the efficiency of the DNMT-AS oligos has been demonstrated previously in different cell lines (30Beaulieu N. Morin S. Chute I.C. Robert M.F. Nguyen H. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28176-28181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Robert M.F. Morin S. Beaulieu N. Gauthier F. Chute I.C. Barsalou A. MacLeod A.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we evaluated the ability of these antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit expression of their corresponding DNMT gene in MZ2-MEL.Tr4 cells. To this end, the cells were transfected with different combinations of the three DNMT-AS oligos or with an unrelated scramble oligonucleotide, and the level of mRNA expression of the three DNMTs was evaluated 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2C, the DNMT-AS oligos specifically inhibited their target gene with a ∼70% reduction in the corresponding mRNA expression level. In contrast, the scramble oligonucleotide had no significant effect on DNMT expression levels. We confirmed by Western blot analysis that the reduction in DNMT1 mRNA induced by the DNMT1-AS oligo was associated with depletion of the corresponding protein (Fig. 2D). Derepression of the MAGEA1/EGFP Transgene in DNMT1-depleted MZ2-MEL.Tr4 Cells—Having shown that the DNMT-AS oligos specifically inhibit expression of the corresponding gene in MZ2-MEL.Tr4, we tested their ability to induce derepression of the methylated MAGEA1/EGFP transgene. In the first set of experiments, activation of MAGEA1/EGFP was compared following depletion of DNMT1 or both DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The two latter enzymes were targeted simultaneously because they are known to act redundantly (12Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). DNA demethylation upon inhibition of methylation maintenance occurs by a passive replication-dependent process. We therefore maintained depletion of the DNMTs for several days by transfecting the cells every 48 h with the antisense oligonucleotides. MZ2-MEL.Tr4 cells that had been treated in this way during 5 and 9 days were collected and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the level of expression of the MAGEA1/EGFP transgene. At day 5, MAGEA1/EGFP expression was slightly higher in DNMT1-depleted cells as compared with cells depleted of both DNMT3A and -3B or control cells (Fig. 3A). This difference became clearly significant at day 9 (Fig. 3A). However, even after 9 days of DNMT1 depletion, the level of expression of the transgene in MZ2-MEL.Tr4 was 24 times lower than that in MZ2-MEL cells that were transfected with the unmethylated pMAGEA1/EGFP plasmid. This suggested that treatment with DNMT1-AS oligos either resulted in activation of the transgene in only a fraction"

Increasing resistance of pathogens to anti-infective drugs is an urgent public health problem that must be addressed through more prudent use of these drugs in human medicine and in animal husbandry, agriculture, and aquaculture. Almost all microbes that infect humans, and for which there are anti-infective drugs, have developed some degree of resistance to these drugs, and at a pace more rapid than anticipated (Table 1) . Anti-infective drug resistance costs money and human lives. Infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, greater direct and indirect costs, prolonged periods during which individuals are infectious, and greater opportunities for the spread of infection to others. Recent estimates of the relationship between resistance of pathogens to anti-infective drugs and health care costs suggest that patients in the United States infected with drug-resistant organisms incur average costs ranging from $6000 to $30,000; and that mortality, morbidity, and length of hospitalization all increase as anti-infective drug resistance continues to develop in staphylococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacilli (Cosgrove, 2006Cosgrove S.E. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2006; 42: S82-S89Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar).Table 1Antimicrobial Resistance Rates (2005)Malaria0%–82% chloroquine resistanceTuberculosis0%–17% primary multi-drug resistance (3% mean worldwide)HIV0%–25% primary resistance to at least one antiretroviral drugGonorrhea5%–98% penicillin resistancePneumonia and bacterial meningitis0%–70% penicillin resistance(Streptococcus pneumoniae)Hospital infections0%–70% resistance to all penicillins and cephalosporinsSource: WHO Policy Perspectives on Medicine, 2005. Open table in a new tab Source: WHO Policy Perspectives on Medicine, 2005. The microbes that cause infectious diseases are complex, dynamic, and constantly evolving. They reproduce rapidly, mutate frequently, freely exchange genetic material, and adapt with relative ease to new environments and hosts. Through these mechanisms, microbes readily develop resistance to the anti-infective drugs used to treat them. A few years after antimicrobial drugs became widely available post-World War II, warning signs of anti-infective drug resistance began to appear. By the end of the 1940s, for example, soon after the introduction and widespread use of penicillin, the prevalence of penicillin-resistant hospital strains of staphylococcus in the United Kingdom was 14%. By the end of the 1990s, staphylococcal resistance worldwide had risen to levels of 95% or greater, and Staphylococcus aureus had accumulated resistance genes to virtually all currently available antimicrobial drugs, with methicillin-resistant infections disseminated in hospital settings and communities (Levy, 1992Levy S.B. The Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle. Plenum Press, New York1992Crossref Google Scholar). These warning signs were largely ignored, however, as new anti-infective drugs continued to be developed, and as the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases in industrialized countries steadily declined. With the widespread availability of antimalarial drugs and intensified control of its mosquito vector in the early part of the twentieth century, the incidence of malaria rapidly decreased, and in the case of the Southern United States and Southern Europe disappeared. In the 1940s, tuberculosis (TB) hospitals in Europe and the United States started to empty as living conditions improved and effective drugs became available to treat those with acute TB, preventing infection of patient contacts (also see the Essay by D. Young and C. Dye, page 683 of this issue). Simultaneously, a host of hospital-acquired infections that had endangered the lives of hospitalized patients and health workers came under better control, and sexually transmitted infections could easily be cured (Armstrong et al., 1999Armstrong G.L. Conn L.A. Pinner R.W. JAMA. 1999; 281: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, more than 14 million humans continue to die each year from infectious diseases, mostly in developing countries where it is estimated that infectious diseases represent 46% of all deaths (Figure 1) . Approximately 90% of these deaths are from six major infections: diarrhoeal diseases; acute respiratory infections; malaria and measles among children less than 5 years of age; and AIDS and tuberculosis, mainly among adults (WHO, 1999WHO Removing Obstacles to Healthy Development.http://www.who.int/infectious-disease-report/index-rpt99.htmlDate: 1999Google Scholar). Anti-infective drugs save lives, but as resistance to them continues to emerge in a host of pathogens their effectiveness wanes. Resistance to anti-infective drugs has contributed to recent increases in infectious disease mortality worldwide and is an urgent public health problem. In New York City in the 1990s, multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis gained a foothold in hospitals and prisons and among homeless populations. Simultaneously, multidrug-resistant TB emerged in the Russian Federation and its incidence more than doubled in less than seven years, with over 20% of TB patients in prison settings infected with multidrug-resistant strains. In 2000, it was estimated that approximately 3% of all TB infections worldwide were multidrug resistant, and that percentage continues to increase (Dye et al., 2002Dye C. Espinal M.A. Watt C.J. Mbiaga M. Williams B.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whereas a single six-month course of drug treatment for nonresistant pulmonary TB costs as little as $20, treatment for multidrug-resistant TB can cost well over $2000 because of increased costs for second-line drugs, prolonged hospitalization, and longer treatment regimens. Such high costs put these drugs beyond the realm of many developing countries, and in some TB can no longer be effectively managed, resulting in increased mortality from this disease. Finally, treatment failure in TB patients with multidrug-resistant infections who are then treated with second-line drugs range from 20% to 40%, necessitating additional treatment with even more expensive drugs that often have unpleasant side effects. By 1976, resistance of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to the cheap and effective frontline drug, chloroquine, was widespread in southeastern Asia; by the mid-1990s resistance to chloroquine was worldwide. Worse yet, the malaria parasite has also developed high-level resistance to two second-level antimalarials, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and mefloquine. Currently resistance is developing to antimalarial drugs with increasing rapidity, and it is now recommended that multidrug combinations be used, each with independent modes of action and different biochemical targets, in an effort to slow the development of resistance and better preserve existing antimalarial drugs. This is especially true for the newer antimalarial drugs such as the artemesinin derivatives (Jung et al., 2004Jung M. Lee K. Kim H. Park M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1265-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mortality estimates from public health records in Africa indicate 2- to 11-fold increases in malaria-associated mortality among children when drug resistance develops, with hospital attendance and admissions showing similar increasing trends. In the 1970s, Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistant to the usual doses of penicillin was introduced into Europe and the United States from Southeast Asia, where it is thought to have emerged; by the mid-1990s resistance of this bacterium to penicillin had spread worldwide. Low-cost antibiotics such as penicillin can no longer be used to treat gonorrhea, and gonococcal strains resistant to all major families of antibiotics have now been identified wherever these antibiotics have been widely used. Some countries report that more than 70% of gonococcal infections are caused by bacteria that are resistant to the quinolone ring (the active moiety of many antibiotics). Nor have antiviral drugs been spared. Resistance to antiretroviral drugs among 96 treatment naive HIV-infected individuals in Mexico, for example, was reported at 6% for delaviridine and nevirapine, 4% for efavirenz, and 2% for almivudine and nelfinavir (Escoto-Delgadillo et al., 2005Escoto-Delgadillo M. Vazquez-Valls E. Ramirez-Rodriguez M. Corona-Nakamura A. Amaya-Tapia G. Quintero-Perez N. Panduro-Cerda A. Torres-Mendoza B.M. HIV Med. 2005; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar levels of resistance have been found among HIV treatment naive patients in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere, necessitating the use of multidrug combinations in order to slow the evolution of HIV strains resistant to current antiretrovirals. Last year, 91% of influenza infections in the United States—caused by influenza virus A strain H3N2—were found to be resistant to both adamantadine and rimantadine, two drugs regularly used to treat seasonal influenza (CDC, 2005CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. High levels of adamantine resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses and interim guidelines for use of antivital agents, United States, 2005 -06 influenza season.http://www.cdc.gov/flu/han011406.htmDate: 2005Google Scholar). Resistance has not yet developed to two other drugs (oseltamivir and zenamivir) used to treat this strain of influenza, but there is great fear that resistance to these two drugs will also eventually develop. In Thailand, low-level resistance to oseltamivir appears to have developed in sporadic human infections caused by the H5N1 avian influenza virus strain (de Jong et al., 2005de Jong M.D. Tran T.T. Truong H.K. Vo M.H. Smith G.J. Nguyen V.C. Bach V.C. Phan T.Q. Do Q.H. Guan Y. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 2667-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). This has raised serious concerns given that the H5N1 strain continues to cause sporadic human infections and poses a pandemic threat (see the Commentary by A. Fauci, page 665 of this issue). The natural phenomena that cause the development of drug resistance—mutation at anti-infective target sites, the acquisition of resistance mechanisms by genetic transfer—are exacerbated and amplified by events that increase the selective pressure on anti-infective drugs. These include the misuse of anti-infective drugs in the treatment of human and animal illnesses and indiscriminate use in animal husbandry, aquaculture, and agriculture. It is paradoxical that selective pressure due to misuse of anti-infective drugs can be increased by either under use or over use. In developing countries, it is inadequate or inconsistent access to drugs leading to truncated treatment, or a failure to take the full course of therapy, that increase selective pressure. This is compounded by self-prescription and purchase of anti-infective drugs on the open market due to lack of enforcement of legislation or the sale of counterfeit drugs with substandard or insufficient active ingredients. Between January 1999 and October 2000 alone, among 46 confidential reports of counterfeit drugs from 20 countries, 32% contained no active ingredient, and the rest either had incorrect quantities of active ingredients, extraneous ingredients, or impurities. In many developing countries, the higher cost and limited availability of the few remaining second-line anti-infective drugs makes them an unrealistic choice where they are most needed. In industrialized countries, it is often the overprescribing of antibiotics by health workers and excessive demand for antibiotics by the general population that increase selective pressure and amplify the selection and survival of resistant microbes. Antibiotics are often prescribed empirically in the absence of laboratory confirmation of infection. In a study on the management of tonsillitis in 17 European countries, for example, between 68% and 100% of patients were prescribed antibiotics, and in more than 40% of these cases prescription was empirical. In Canada, as many as half of the 26 million antibiotic prescriptions dispensed annually are estimated to be unnecessary (Kondro, 1997Kondro W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and during a recent year in the United States, 12 million antibiotic prescriptions were provided to adults for upper respiratory tract infections where they have little or no effect. Over-use and under-use of antibiotics occurs simultaneously in most countries, however, and is linked to economic status and the ability to pay for healthcare. In Thailand, over the course of a year, 60% of viral infections were improperly treated with an antibiotic, and 89% of bacterial infections were correctly treated with an antibiotic, most often amoxicillin (Suttajit et al., 2005Suttajit S. Wagner A.K. Tantipidoke R. Ross-Degnan D. Sitthi-amorn C. Southeast Asian J. Trop. Med. Public Health. 2005; 36: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). Those receiving antibiotics were young, male, and could afford to pay, whereas significantly fewer antibiotics were used to treat nonpaying patients. Anti-infective drugs are vital in the treatment of infections in animals. In many countries, 50% of all anti-infective drug production each year is for animal husbandry. Antibiotics are added to animal feed (particularly that of pigs and poultry) for mass prophylaxis against infections or for growth promotion, and to water to treat fish diseases. Anti-infective drugs are considered important for sustainable livestock production and for the control of animal infections that can be passed on to humans as zoonoses. Certain anti-infective drugs administered to animals are also used for disease control in humans resulting in selection for crossresistance in microbes that are important in human medicine or for resistant organisms that can be passed from animals to humans. The relationship between the increase in prevalence and distribution of drug-resistant infections and the use of antibiotics in animals is poorly understood, but they are clearly related. Anti-infective drugs are often used as pesticides for treating fruit trees and other agricultural products ranging from rice to orchids. In the United States, about 300,000 pounds of oxytetracycline and streptomycin are sprayed on fruit trees each year to prevent infection with Erwinia amylovora, the bacterial cause of fire blight (NAS, 1998NAS US Environmental Protection Agency in Antimicrobial Resistance. Issues and Options, Forum on Emerging Infections. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1998Google Scholar). Development and transfer of drug resistance to other organisms may be caused by such agricultural use. There is, however, little hard evidence to show the importance that anti-infective use in agriculture has on the environment and on human infections, principally because of the difficulty in attributing risk to practice. Drug-resistant organisms are not only a problem locally, they can also spread rapidly throughout the world in humans, animals, vectors, or food (WHO, 2001WHO Global strategy for containment of antimicrobial resistance. Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO/CDS/CSR/DRS/2001.2).http://www.who.int/emc/amr.htmlDate: 2001Google Scholar). In 1997, the multidrug-resistant serotype 23F of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which caused an outbreak of infection in a daycare center in South Africa, was found to be identical to a clone isolated in Spain and also to strains circulating in Korea. Meanwhile, multidrug-resistant salmonella isolates arrived in Denmark through importing infected boar from Canada; such isolates have spread internationally via livestock including horses. Greater efforts must be made to reduce selective pressure on anti-infective drugs. There is a lack of scientific and medical evidence to indicate how this can be done, but all aspects of anti-infective drug use in humans, animals, and agriculture must be addressed. It is not clear how to prioritize interventions, and so a broad strategy is required. This strategy necessitates more prudent use of antibiotics in human medicine, in animal medicine, and in animal husbandry/agriculture and measures to prevent the spread of drug-resistant organisms, including better surveillance because border controls are difficult to enforce and are not effective. Although these measures apply to both developed and developing countries, the balance between activities must be tailored to the quantity and patterns of anti-infective drug use. Many infections can be prevented and transmission reduced through simple, cheap, and effective measures such as hand washing, the use of bed nets, condoms, and vaccination, and avoidance of unnecessary injections, especially where syringes and needles are re-used. The general population can be educated through targeted campaigns with a clear message that emphasizes when anti-infective drugs should be used and when they should not, as well as the dangers of their overuse. In Singapore, hand washing during the 2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection (SARS) was shown to be protective in preventing transmission of SARS within hospitals (Curtis and Cairncross, 2003Curtis V. Cairncross S. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2003; 5: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (675) Google Scholar), and a meta-analysis of seven intervention studies suggests that hand washing in the community can reduce the risk of diarrhoeal disease by up to 47%. Current television campaigns in France emphasize the correct use of anti-infective drugs, and similar campaigns in Canada during the 1990s were shown to markedly decrease requests for antibiotics. Healthcare providers should be taught about the importance of accurate diagnosis and management of common infections, infection control, and disease prevention throughout their training as well as through in-service education. The development and use of clinical guidelines at each level of care containing currently recommended doses and duration of treatment (as well as the maximum use of the recommended drug combinations for treating HIV, TB, and malaria) are also strongly recommended. Other measures include stronger and more rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases and restricting availability to prescriptions to licensed outlets, establishment of infection control programs in hospitals, and vigilance against counterfeit drugs by restricting marketing authorization to those anti-infective drugs meeting international standards of quality, safety, and efficacy. Finally, the development of simple diagnostic tests and technologies that facilitate accurate diagnosis would permit more sparing use of anti-infective drugs. Farmers and policy-makers should be educated about the appropriate use of anti-infective drugs in animal husbandry, aquaculture, and farming. In particular, they should understand the importance of anti-infective drugs in human health, the need to prevent infection by vaccinating animals when possible, and the need to stop using anti-infective drugs for promoting growth of livestock. It is often those working in human public health who are most able to convince those in the animal and agricultural industries about the importance of safe anti-infective drug use. In addition, safe levels of residues from anti-infective drugs in animal and plant products for human consumption should be established, and regulation of the bulk use of anti-infective drugs should be enforced through legislation at the national level. Resistance to anti-infective drugs is an urgent public health problem threatening the treatment and control of infectious diseases ranging from those that have long been endemic in human populations—malaria, TB, and sexually transmitted infections—to those that have recently emerged and become endemic such as HIV. Drug resistance is also a threat to the control of seasonally occurring infections such as meningitis and influenza, and to those that pose pandemic threats such as the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A. Drug-resistant pathogens—whether parasites, bacteria, or viruses—can no longer be effectively treated with common anti-infective drugs. The risk is great that because of drug resistance many more people will die from infectious diseases, and infections associated with major surgery and invasive hospital procedures will become more dangerous. One of the major responses of medical workers to the problem of drug resistance has been to switch patients from older to newer drugs. Although effective initially, this strategy has resulted in the emergence of resistance to the newer drugs. This, combined with a declining investment in research and development of new classes of anti-infective drugs, has serious consequences for public health. The ultimate solution to anti-infective drug resistance is prevention of infection through vaccination, and continued research and development of vaccines is an important part of any strategy to address drug resistance. Smallpox, which killed approximately 3 million persons each year as recently as 1967, has been eradicated using an effective and widely available vaccine (Fenner et al., 1988Fenner F. Henderson D.A. Arita I. Jezek Z. Ladnyi I.D. Smallpox and Its Eradication. World Health Organization, Geneva1988Google Scholar), and poliomyelitis also appears in line for eradication because of an effective vaccine (Heymann and Aylward, 2004Heymann D.L. Aylward R.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 1275-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Eradication of these viral diseases has pre-empted the need for antiviral drugs, and resistance has therefore not been an issue. Effective use of vaccines has, in fact, shifted infectious disease morbidity and mortality away from those diseases for which vaccines exist to those infectious diseases for which there are no preventive vaccines, and for which anti-infective drug resistance is now a major risk. The urgent need to combat drug resistance demands three major responses: conservation of existing anti-infective drugs through prudent use and investment in research and development both for new anti-infective drugs and for vaccines, which are the ultimate solution to infection and drug resistance."

Is it possible that these persistent bacterial infections provide a protective benefit to the host? Certain bacterial pathogens have evolved to survive in their human hosts for long periods without causing harm. Is it possible that these persistent bacterial infections provide a protective benefit to the host? Theodor Rosebury reminded us 35 years ago that all life, including microbes, is a single community and that it would be a good idea to stop thinking indiscriminately of our unicellular companions as repulsive, contemptible, or even ferocious (Rosebury, 1969Rosebury T. Life on Man. Berkeley Publishing Corporation, New York1969Google Scholar). Quite appropriately, human medicine (along with granting agencies) demands that we focus on disease and its cure or amelioration. Does this focus sometimes distract us from understanding the biology of the pathogen and the evolution of the host-parasite relationship? One continuing problem facing those of us who study microorganisms that cause human disease is defining exactly what is a pathogen (Falkow, 1997Falkow S. ASM News. 1997; 63: 359-365Google Scholar). Humans live with hundreds of commensal species, along with transient microbes that are “just passing through.” Commensals (literally meaning to eat from the same table) inhabit every mucosal nook and cranny, and most are present for our entire lives but do no harm. Meanwhile, pathogens are traditionally defined as organisms that cause disease. The problem is that the distinction between the commensal and the pathogen can be blurred at times because some commensals cause disease, albeit usually in immunocompromised hosts, whereas some pathogens can persist without causing disease symptoms. Additionally, some of the most well-known pathogens are also arguably members of the indigenous normal flora of our bodies and could be called “commensal pathogens.” For example, pneumococcus and meningococcus bacteria regularly inhabit the human nasopharynx and are mostly carried asymptomatically despite the fact that they can cause well-defined diseases. Immunization against these microbes not only protects against disease but also prevents (in an antigen-specific fashion) their ability to colonize the host (reviewed in Segal and Pollard, 2004Segal S. Pollard A.J. Br. Med. Bull. 2004; 72: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Might the “virulence” determinants that these organisms have in common—such as production of a capsule and an IgA protease—be seen instead as adaptive factors that allow these microbes to occupy a particular niche? Are these organisms simply normal flora that live in a perilous location where they consistently come into contact with elements of the immune system? This brings us back to the difficulty in defining what is a pathogen and what is a commensal. No single, simple definition will include age factors, accidental zoonotic pathogens, and other complicating factors. Yet I take the view that pathogens are best defined by their inherent ability to cross anatomical barriers, inhabit tissue sites, or breach host defenses that ordinarily limit the survival or replication of other microbes and commensals. Furthermore, I believe these invasive properties are essential for the survival of pathogens in nature, and these properties are often associated with clinical disease in some hosts and are frequently host specific. It is not crucial to agree with this definition, but it may put the point of view of this Essay into perspective. A persistent bacterial infection indicates a longstanding interaction between a microorganism and a host (reviewed in Monack et al., 2004aMonack D.M. Mueller A. Falkow S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 747-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). When caused by a pathogen, the initial interaction with the host is usually associated with some degree of tissue invasion and damage. Following this acute phase, those individuals in which a persistent infection develops show little outward signs of disease but, rather, typically act as a reservoir for infection of susceptible individuals through microbial shedding. Persistent infection may be revealed by chronic inflammation, intermittent acute episodes of illness, and sometimes terminal flagrant disease. The best known of the pathogens that cause persistent human infection include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Salmonella enterica serovar typhi (S. typhi), and Helicobacter pylori—a veritable “who's who” of human death and suffering. There are a number of experimental questions that face an investigator studying persistent infection. I will use data from our laboratory for H. pylori and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) in two models of persistent infection of the laboratory mouse to illustrate just a few of the extraordinary and perhaps unappreciated long-term consequences of an inconspicuous infection on the biology of the host immune system. Salmonella serovars are responsible for human diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to systemic infections. Salmonella gastroenteritis (food poisoning) in humans is an acute, self-limiting infection of the gut mucosa that rarely leads to persistent infection. In contrast, persistent Salmonella infection occurs following systemic infection in which the bacteria breach the mucosal barrier (Monack et al., 2004bMonack D.M. Bouley D.M. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The ability of Salmonella spp. to cause systemic infection is often host dependent. S. typhi causes a systemic infection, which results in typhoid fever exclusively in humans, whereas S. typhimurium causes systemic infection in mice and some birds but not usually in humans. During these systemic infections, Salmonella enter the Peyer's patches of the intestinal tract by invading specialized epithelial cells, called M cells. They subsequently target specific types of host cells present in the underlying tissue, such as dendritic cells or macrophages, which traffic through the lymphatic system and bloodstream disseminating the bacteria to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), spleen, bone marrow, liver, and gall bladder. In a significant proportion of infected individuals, bacteria can persist for life within macrophages in granulomas found in tissue sites, with periodic reseeding of the small intestine, which is associated with fecal shedding and subsequent infection of susceptible individuals in the population. In mice, a significant component of innate resistance or susceptibility to infection with S. typhimurium, as well as Mycobacterium and Leishmania, is controlled by the gene Nramp1 (Slc11a1), which encodes a proton/divalent-cation antiporter. Expression of Nramp1 is restricted to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and helps the host to control intracellular replication of Salmonella. Historically, Salmonella pathogenesis has been investigated in Nramp1Asp169 mutant mice, which are highly sensitive to Salmonella infection. Although acute S. typhimurium infections have been well characterized using this model, it is not suitable for studies of long-term carriage. We have studied persistent Salmonella infection using the 129sv mouse strain, which carries the wild-type Nramp1 allele (Monack et al., 2004bMonack D.M. Bouley D.M. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Oral S. typhimurium infection of 129sv mice results in systemic infection that, in most cases, does not lead to death of the host. Persistent infection in this model is characterized by sporadic excretion of bacteria in the stool and long-term carriage (>1 year) of S. typhimurium in low numbers within classical granulomatous lesions in the spleen; liver; gall bladder; and, most commonly, MLNs. The microbes persist in this setting despite a robust innate and adaptive immune response. The initial encounter of 129sv mice with the microbe is not innocuous. The spleen, liver, and MLNs become enormously enlarged because of inflammation and extramedullary hematopoiesis, but by 60 days postinfection (p.i.), there are only minor histological changes in host organs. The number of bacteria is on the order of 1,000-10,000 cfu per gram of tissue as compared with 105–107 cfu/g during the acute infection phase. Infected macrophages in the tissues harbor no more than three bacteria each, and fecal shedding of the microbe is sporadic; however, the balance between host and microbe is tenuous. Chronically infected mice (260 days p.i.) treated with an interferon γ (INFγ) neutralizing antibody promptly exhibit symptoms of acute systemic infection with evidence of high levels of bacterial replication in most tissues and high levels of fecal shedding. Thus, INFγ, which is known to affect the level of macrophage activation, plays an essential role in the control of persistent S. typhimurium infection in mice. These data also reveal that, despite a robust adaptive immune response, the host can neither clear the infection nor control acute exacerbations of disease if the host's defenses are compromised even for a relatively brief period of time. One of the most striking features of this persistent infection can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the transcriptional profile of peripheral blood taken from mice chronically infected with S. typhimurium for 10 months as compared to age-matched uninfected controls (L.J. Thompson, D. Monack, and S.F., unpublished results). By this time point, although there are low numbers of bacteria in some of the systemic organs, no bacteria can be detected in the blood, and there are no apparent differences in the complete blood count as compared with uninfected controls. Yet this transcriptional profile shows a significant peripheral-blood signature associated with persistent infection, including both up- and downregulated gene clusters. This signature most likely represents an indirect response of the peripheral white blood cells to the infection at tissue sites where the organism is being actively repressed long after any outward signs of disease have diminished. The genes involved include not only factors of the adaptive immune system but also some associated with the innate immune response. Hence, persistent infection may continue for many months, and possibly for a lifetime, constantly modulating the host immune system. Clearly, persistent infection is a dynamic state and not one of quiescent bacteria held in check by the force of the host immune system. H. pylori is an important example of a persistent bacterial infection (Blaser and Atherton, 2004Blaser M.J. Atherton J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, Monack et al., 2004aMonack D.M. Mueller A. Falkow S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 747-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Not only does this bacterium successfully establish itself in the hostile environment of the human stomach, but the infection regularly persists for the lifetime of the host despite an ongoing, vigorous innate and adaptive immune response. In most infected people, H. pylori infection causes a histologically apparent but asymptomatic superficial chronic gastritis. However, significant subsets of infected individuals develop duodenal and peptic ulcers, and 1% of those that are infected will develop adenocarcinoma or mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach. Most basic research in the Helicobacter field has focused on the study of bacterial virulence determinants and their interaction with gastric epithelial cells. For the purpose of this discussion, I will focus only on one aspect of the interaction between H. pylori and its host. In mouse models of H. pylori, the outcome is closely associated with the genetic background of the host. Balb/c mice infected for 18 months uniformly respond to Helicobacter in exactly the same way as in a small subset of humans (Mueller et al., 2003aMueller A. O'Rourke J. Grimm J. Guillemin K. Dixon M.F. Lee A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1292-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Direct antigenic stimulation results in the proliferation of lymphocytes and the formation of lymphoid follicles in the gastric mucosa, constituting the MALT. Gastric MALT lymphoma is believed to arise from neoplastic B cell clones in the marginal zone of the follicle that invade the adjacent epithelium, a process marked histologically by the appearance of lymphoepithelial lesions. In humans, eradication of the bacterium by antibiotic treatment leads to tumor regression in the majority of patients. Consequently, antimicrobial therapy has largely replaced gastric resection as the first line of treatment for MALT lymphoma. We duplicated these findings in the mouse model of infection and followed the subsequent events by immunohistopathology and transcriptional profiling (Mueller et al., 2005Mueller A. O'Rourke J. Chu P. Chu A. Dixon M.F. Bouley D.M. Lee A. Falkow S. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 797-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Tumors regressed in antibiotic-treated mice, and the gastric mucosa returned to a normal architecture; however, there were residual nests of quiescent immune cells in all treated animals. Although these animals had carried Helicobacter for 18 months before treatment and had a strong innate and adaptive immune response to the bacteria, it was possible to easily reinfect these animals. In the reinfected animals, the disease progressed to frank lymphoma in a T cell-dependent, antigen-driven manner much more rapidly. The findings have implications for human therapy but also emphasize that the study of persistent infection provides us with a way to experimentally determine strategies that some bacteria possess for modulating the immune response in order to survive. It is possible to successfully immunize animals to prevent infection by both Salmonella and H. pylori. In the case of Helicobacter, we found that clusters of T and B cells with intense adipokine staining that reside in the adipose tissue adjacent to the stomach were a hallmark of induced protective immunity (Mueller et al., 2003bMueller A. O'Rourke J. Chu P. Kim C.C. Sutton P. Lee A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12289-12294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The continued study of the distinction between priming the immune system to prevent infection and the inability of the immune system to clear the natural infection will prove to be instructive in understanding the biology of both the microbe and the host and will be effective in designing new preventative measures against disease. Traditionally, we have thought of diseases like typhoid, tuberculosis, and H. pylori-induced ulcers and gastric cancer as diseases to be feared; however, the asymptomatic rate of human infection for each of these organisms is 80% or greater. There is likely to have been a time in the not too distant past when almost all humans were infected by these microbes. Even now, in technologically less advanced countries, these infections are still so common that about 1% of all humans asymptomatically excrete the typhoid bacillus, and 80%–90% are asymptomatically infected with the tubercle bacillus and H. pylori. One of the consequences of modern medicine and public health in technologically advanced societies is that the carriage rate of H. pylori has fallen dramatically, and, along with it, so have the rate of ulcer disease and the incidence of gastric malignancy. However, it has been pointed out by Martin Blaser and others that, during the same period, the incidence of esophageal cancer has increased remarkably (reviewed in Blaser, 2006Blaser M.J. Pathogenicity and symbiosis: human gastric colonization by Helicobacter pylori as a model system of amphibiosis.in: Ending the War Metaphor: The Future Agenda for Unraveling the Host-Microbe Relationship. National Academy of Science Press, Washington, DC2006Google Scholar, Blaser and Atherton, 2004Blaser M.J. Atherton J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). They point to epidemiological evidence that suggests that the presence of H. pylori actually has a protective effect against the incidence of esophageal cancer or that, rather, the loss of H. pylori appears to be one of the factors clearly associated with the massive rise in esophageal diseases. Furthermore, there is a striking inverse relationship between the incidence of prototypical infectious diseases and the incidence of immune disorders (see, for example, Figure 1 in Bach, 2002Bach J.-F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). There is also striking experimental evidence from animal models of a causal inverse relationship between infections and allergic or autoimmune diseases. For example, it has been consistently observed that autoimmune diseases in susceptible animals develop earlier and at a higher rate among those bred in a specific-pathogen-free environment as compared to animals bred in a “conventional” environment. One can argue that organisms like H. pylori, the typhoid bacillus, and perhaps M. tuberculosis have been so common in human populations that they might be considered as part of the normal human flora along with the accepted commensals. If one accepts the idea that H. pylori and other human-adapted “pathogens” are part of our indigenous flora or at least have been our constant companions through human evolution, might they play, overall, a beneficial protective role? Moreover, as they disappear, can we suppose that they are also surrogates for other indigenous microbial species, known and unknown, which are being, and perhaps have been, wiped out by human “progress”? Could this loss be a factor in the appearance of human disease now or in the future? I thank Lucinda J. Thompson and Denise Monack for reading the manuscript and permitting me to present their data on the transcriptional profiling of the host response to persistent Salmonella infection; Anne Mueller for sharing her ideas about H. pylori-host interactions; and Martin Blaser for sharing his thoughtful perspectives on H. pylori's potential protective effects against esophageal cancer, obesity, and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2095045039,"Five years into the human postgenomic era, we are gaining considerable knowledge about host-pathogen interactions through host genomes. This “infectogenomics” approach should yield further insights into both diagnostic and therapeutic advances, as well as normal cellular function. Five years into the human postgenomic era, we are gaining considerable knowledge about host-pathogen interactions through host genomes. This “infectogenomics” approach should yield further insights into both diagnostic and therapeutic advances, as well as normal cellular function. As with most biological phenomena, disease is the outcome of both nature and nurture. In the case of infectious disease, however, the interaction of two natures, that is, two genomes (host and pathogen), is at play. Environmental and social factors, or nurture, may affect the risk of acquiring infection, and also the risk of becoming ill. How we behave and what environment we live in will determine the number of exposure events (Weiss and McMichael, 2004Weiss R.A. McMichael A.J. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S70-S76Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The dose of infection and the fitness of the host and pathogen will determine sickness (van Opijnen and Berkhout, 2005van Opijnen T. Berkhout B. Rev. Med. Virol. 2005; 15: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After all, unfit pathogens can make excellent live attenuated vaccines. The inherent virulence of the pathogen should always be considered in the setting of the host. This interplay is particularly evident in cross-species infections. Herpes B virus elicits little more than cold sores in its natural host, the macaque, whereas in humans it causes a life-threatening encephalitis. Similarly, Escherichia coli O157 rarely affects cattle adversely but gives humans severe diarrhea, and H5N1 avian influenza virus is more virulent in geese, chickens, and humans than in ducks. Many host-microbe combinations coevolve with an apparent drive toward decreased pathogenicity of the microbe in its host reservoir, a constraint that can be relieved upon transfer of the microbe to another species. In studying the severity of infectious diseases, it is not always clear how much variation to attribute to the virulence of the pathogen and how much to the susceptibility of the host. In some situations, however, the pathogen can be regarded as a constant, thereby revealing the contribution of the host. For instance, the SARS coronavirus that spread from human to human during the 2003 outbreak came from a point source and was essentially an invariant clone. Yet we can discern at least three human host phenotypes of infection, namely, death, recovery, and superspreaders. Moreover, being a superspreader was not highly correlated with severity of disease, and luckily for the human population, superspreaders represented a small proportion of those who became infected. We do not know to what extent human genetic variation determined death, recovery, and infectiousness to others, but it should be studied. Doubtless, correlations will be found in the immunogenetics of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, other factors that are difficult to reduce to one type of gene—possibly specific differences in the coordinated multicell, multipathway response to SARS coronavirus—may have been involved. Similarly, the contribution of pathogen variation to pathogenesis is complex. Recent clues suggest a functional consequence of RNA virus variation that results from error-prone viral RNA polymerases producing genetically distinct but related viral “quasispecies.” For poliovirus, the quasispecies itself, rather than the presence of individual adaptive mutations, resulted in increased pathogenesis, supporting the theory that viral colonization of an ecosystem (in this case the host) may be a result of the complex interplay between different members of the quasispecies (Vignuzzi et al., 2006Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Nature. 2006; 439: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that common genetic polymorphisms, such as those in the ABO blood groups and MHC antigens, are maintained in human populations on account of their value in the immune response to infectious diseases. However, clear examples of balanced polymorphisms are few, and we have to beware of altruistic interpretations. Perhaps the best evidence is where there is a tradeoff between resistance to infection and genetic disease. This is seen in the various hemoglobinopathies (α- and β-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia) where the resistance to infection with the malaria parasite of those who are heterozygous for the gene mutation counterbalances the lethal effects of recessive disease in homozygotes. The relatively high frequency of cystic fibrosis may also be explained if those heterozygous for mutations in the chloride channel (CTFR) survive severe enteric infections such as typhoid because of reduced dehydration; in this case, heterozgotes may be considered the functional equivalent of oral rehydration therapy. There are also examples of host genetic resistance to infections in which the homozygous state is not lethal. The delta 32 deletion in the gene encoding the CCR5 chemokine receptor is frequent in the Caucasian population. Homozygotes appear to be healthy and are resistant to infection by the majority of strains of HIV-1 that require this receptor to enter their target cells. Heterozygotes also benefit from relative resistance to infection and, when infected, progress to AIDS more slowly. But like cholera and CTFR, HIV is too recent an arrival in humans to account for the selection of delta 32 CCR5. Resistance to smallpox or the plague has been postulated as the original selective force, but compelling evidence has not been forthcoming. The occurrence of these classical Mendelian traits that have large discrete effects suggests that searching the human genome will reveal polymorphisms that affect susceptibility to specific infectious diseases. To date, however, scanning the genome for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other markers has not been particularly fruitful in revealing genetic loci associated with a trait for infectious diseases. This is due to the fact that much of the genetic variation underlying infectious disease susceptibility is complex, involving the combination of many loci, and is further confounded by SNP variations between different populations and ethnic groups. Such surveys, therefore, require careful design, and it may be that identifying loci in animal models is a more straightforward way of highlighting loci and genes in humans. Correspondingly, it has been more fruitful thus far to identify polymorphisms in candidate human genes for infectious disease. Both HIV infection and progression to AIDS are influenced by the host genotype, and in turn, the host imposes selection on the virus. Obvious candidate genes have been investigated in HIV pathogenesis. As expected, both class I and class II genes in the MHC region affect HIV susceptibility and disease progression (Carrington and O'Brien, 2003Carrington M. O'Brien S.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 2003; 54: 535-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), but it is the combination of “good” and “bad” alleles that determines the phenotype of the disease. There is even a suggestion that rare MHC alleles offer stronger cellular immune responses to HIV because the viral peptide sequences have mutated to evade the more common MHC genotypes (Scherer et al., 2004Scherer A. Frater J. Oxenius A. Agudelo J. Price D.A. Gunthard H.F. Barnardo M. Perrin L. Hirschel B. Phillips R.E. McLean A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12266-12270Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An excellent example of multigenic variation in AIDS is the complexity of host receptor-ligand interactions. Most of the transmissible strains of HIV-1 require the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a fusion receptor after the virus particles bind to the CD4 receptor on host T cells. There are widespread polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CCR5 gene that affect the density of receptor expression on the surface of CD4+ T lymphocytes. There is also polymorphism in the number of gene copies of its main ligand, the CCL3L1 form of the cytokine MIP-1α. Careful analysis of susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS in large human cohorts reveals that it is the combination of CCR5 and CCL3L1 polymorphisms that has the most telling effect on disease (Gonzalez et al., 2005Gonzalez E. Kulkarni H. Bolivar H. Mangano A. Sanchez R. Catano G. Nibbs R.J. Freedman B.I. Quinones M.P. Bamshad M.J. et al.Science. 2005; 307: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). High chemokine expression combined with low receptor expression delays the development of AIDS in the host. This makes sense from our understanding of HIV entry into cells because CCL3L1 competes with HIV for a limiting number of receptors. Intracellular host restriction factors, such as APOBECG3 and Trim5α, also affect HIV infection. Polymorphisms in these proteins have been analyzed principally by comparison of host species. The virus had to develop mutations in the proteins that interact with these host factors to adapt to its new human host. However, recent data indicate that polymorphisms within human populations may also play a role in susceptibility to HIV (An et al., 2004An P. Bleiber G. Duggal P. Nelson G. May M. Mangeat B. Alobwede I. Trono D. Vlahov D. Donfield S. et al.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11070-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, Sawyer et al., 2006Sawyer S.L. Wu L.I. Akey J.M. Emerman M. Malik H.S.

Fallin M.D. Mehta S. Schaid D. Vlahov D. O'Brien S.J. Smith M.W. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Regarding common infections that are seldom pathogenic, we can envisage an infectogenomics approach analagous to pharmacogenetics. The appearance of a disease or symptom following exposure to an infectious agent can be regarded as an unusual “side effect” just like an adverse reaction to a drug. With the wrong genotype, such adverse reactions can be severe indeed. For example, 85% of the global human population, or approximately 5 billion people, are persistently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Most of us become infected in infancy without diagnosed illness, although infection in adolescence causes infectious mononucleosis. But if an infant is homozyogous for the Duncan's syndrome allele, primary infection leads to uncontrollable, lethal mononucleosis. Curiously, this gene appears to affect the response to EBV exclusively; it is not related to a more general immune deficiency. Other infections may exhibit mild symptoms, except in rare cases of severity, such as those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human herpes virus type 6 (also see the Essay by S. Falkow, page 699 of this issue). The throat infection, Neisseria meningococcus, circulates among asymptomatic carriers but causes meningitis on rare occasions. Perhaps we should not only seek microbial markers of virulence but also spend more effort on identifying the human genetic factors that predispose to invasion by pathogens. Moreover, common infections with low virulence may represent the unknown environmental trigger for diseases that are not clearly infectious—such as, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia—when they infect a genotype predisposed to the disease. The host genotype ultimately manifests its function through differences in gene transcription or functional differences in proteins. Advances in analysis of gene expression profiling via microarrays, and also in proteomics, not only show how pathogens remodel the host's gene expression patterns (Jenner and Young, 2005Jenner R.G. Young R.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) but also provide a wealth of candidate genes for genetic susceptibility studies. Some of these changes are common to large groups of infection; for instance, many viruses stimulate interferon response pathways. Changes in gene expression profiles can also betray the type of pathogen present with the potential of identifying the pathogen through host gene expression (Huang et al., 2001Huang Q. Liu D. Majewski P. Schulte L.C. Korn J.M. Young R.A. Lander E.S. Hacohen N. Science. 2001; 294: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Thus, gene expression patterns in blood could serve as a window into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Whole blood and purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibit interpatient variation, reflected in the global gene expression patterns of the samples but nevertheless can be interpreted through knowledge of other clinical parameters such as differential blood counts, temperature, and gender. When these are accounted for, the remaining gene expression changes indicate both general infection and disease-specific responses (Griffiths et al., 2005Griffiths M.J. Shafi M.J. Popper S.J. Hemingway C.A. Kortok M.M. Wathen A. Rockett K.A. Mott R. Levin M. Newton C.R. et al.J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Whitney et al., 2003Whitney A.R.

Transcriptional profiles may also be expected to aid prognosis and responses to treatment as is now the case in oncology (Bild et al., 2006Bild A.H. Yao G. Chang J.T. Wang Q. Potti A. Chasse D. Joshi M.B. Harpole D. Lancaster J.M. Berchuck A. et al.Nature. 2006; 439: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). For example, some HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy do not respond with falling viral load even when the virus itself shows no markers of drug resistance, and it may be that host factors determine nonresponsiveness in these cases. Similarly, only a proportion of patients with hepatitis C infection respond to interferon treatment, and transcriptional profiling may indicate why this is so. This is an area where infectogenomics and pharmacogenomics merge. Transcriptional profiles specific for infected cells also provide insights into known pathways of gene regulation and reveal new ways of treating or managing infections (Kellam, 2006Kellam P. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, a study of gene expression among B cell lymphomas delineated a distinct interaction of Kaposi sarcoma associated virus (KSHV) from that of EBV. Because KSHV-infected lymphoma cells show upregulation of the vitamin D receptor pathway, known inhibitors of that pathway may be explored therapeutically (Jenner et al., 2003Jenner R.G. Maillard K. Cattini N. Weiss R.A. Boshoff C. Wooster R. Kellam P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10399-10404Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors were successfully tested for reduction of CMV titer after detection of upregulation of COX-2 expression in infected cells. In addition, the HIV-1 Nef protein increases cholesterol biosynthesis, suggesting that cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins may have an antiviral effect in vivo (del Real et al., 2004del Real G. Jimenez-Baranda S. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P. Gomez-Mouton C. Alegret M. Pena J.M. Rodriguez-Zapata M. Alvarez-Mon M. et al.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus new roles for known drugs are emerging from studies of infectogenomics. Such insights could provide an increased pharmaceutical inventory based on drugs that have already undergone extensive toxicity and efficacy screening as treatment for other diseases (Kellam, 2006Kellam P. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The functional genomics of the host is of crucial importance in analyzing host-pathogen interactions. Host genetic variation plays a key role in determining the outcome of many potentially pathogenic infections, and the prevalent pathogens have influenced the genetic make-up of human populations. Infectogenomics can be harnessed to identify infectious states, to understand the host response, to predict disease outcomes, to monitor responses to antimicrobial therapies, and to indicate promising new types of treatment. In addition, we should acknowledge that the disease state can inform our understanding of normality. Just as virology led us to oncogenes, tumor suppressor proteins, membrane trafficking pathways, and other aspects of molecular cell biology in the past, so can studies of the perturbation of the transcriptome by infection open new vistas onto “systems” biology today."

We have identified the amino acid residues Ala-22, Ile-33, and Phe-34 in the amino terminus and Arg-43 in the first transmembrane helix, which when mutated into cysteine, were modified by intracellular application of MTSET, resulting in channel inhibition. The inhibition of the R43C mutant by internal MTSET requires opening of the channel. In addition, binding of Cd2+ ions to R43C slows the channel inactivation. This indicates that the first transmembrane helix undergoes conformational changes during channel inactivation. The effect of Cd2+ on R43C can be obtained with Cd2+ applied at either the extracellular or the intracellular side, indicating that R43C is located in the channel pore.

Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The ASICs are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system and are possibly involved in nociception, learning, or mechanosensation (3Krishtal O. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). ENaC and ASICs are likely formed by four homologous subunits. The membrane topology of the channel subunits predicts an amino and a carboxyl terminus facing the inside of the cell, the presence of two transmembrane segments, and a large extracellular loop (4Canessa C.M.

Amino acid residues in the extracellular loop of ENaC preceding the second transmembrane domain (TM2) bind the pore blocker amiloride (8Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Based on previous studies on the interaction between permeant Na+ ions and pore blockers of different sizes, it has been proposed that the external pore vestibule of ENaC, where amiloride binds, narrows down to the selectivity filter allowing a Na+ or Li+ ion to selectively permeate the channel (10Palmer L.G. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 13: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar). This model is supported by the identification of residues at the external end of ENaC TM2 near the amiloride binding site, which are important for maintaining its high selectivity for Na+ (11Kellenberger S.

Beyond the external selectivity filter in TM2, the channel structures lining the ion permeation pathway that are accessible from the cytosol have not yet been identified. In this study, we have used the homomultimeric ASIC1a as a model to investigate the structure of the internal ASIC/ENaC pore. Recently, we have observed that multiple cysteine residues in the amino terminus of ENaC subunits are at least, in part, responsible for the sensitivity of ENaCs to inhibition by intracellular sulfhydryl-modifying agents (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests that the amino terminus participates in ENaC gating and/or constitutes the internal pore of the channel. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the amino terminus and the start of the first transmembrane segment in controlling the ion flux through ASIC1a. We have found that cysteine substitutions in the amino terminus and in TM1 are modified by intracellularly applied sulfhydryl reagents, thereby inhibiting ASIC1a currents. We provide evidence that the cytosolic part of the TM1 is located at the internal channel pore and undergoes conformational changes during channel gating. ASIC1a Expression—Complementary cDNA of the human ASIC1a (17Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Nevillegolden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) was subcloned in the pSDEasy cloning vector for in vitro transcription and expression in Xenopus oocytes. Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA encoding hASIC1a. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 24-36 h after oocyte injection with ASIC cRNA. Macroscopic ASIC currents (IASIC) were elicited every 30 s by rapid changes in extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.0 and were measured using either the two-electrode voltage clamp for whole-cell currents or the cut-open oocyte technique when intracellular perfusion was needed. The two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed as described previously (9Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The bathing solution contained (in mm) NaCl 120, MgCl2 2, HEPES·H+ 10 mm, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. Changes in extracellular pH were achieved using the same bathing solution with MES·H+ 10 mm buffered at pH 6.0. The cut-open configuration of the Xenopus oocyte allows the recording of macroscopic ASIC currents while continuously perfusing the inside (2 μl·min-1) and the outside (>8 μl·min-1) of the oocytes (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A microperfusion pipette, in which two thin capillaries (Microfil, World Precision instruments) had been inserted, was used for the intracellular perfusion and served as an intracellular electrode potential measurement. The intracellular solution contained (in mm) potassium gluconate 90, KCl 10, sodium gluconate 2, MgCl2 1, BAPTA 0.2, HEPES-N-methyl-d-glucamine 10, adjusted to pH 7.35. Methanethiosulfonates or Cd2+ (1 mm) were added to the solution. The holding potential was -100 mV. The extracellular solution corresponded to the bathing solution in the two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Introduction of cysteine residues in the ASIC1a sequence was performed as described previously for ENaC mutagenesis (9Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation in the ASIC1a cDNA was verified by sequencing. cRNA was synthesized in vitro for injection into the oocytes. Chemicals—The methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada) were MTSET, MTSEA, and MTS-PtrEA. Stock solutions with MTS reagents were prepared in Me2SO and diluted at least 100-fold, immediately before use, into the intracellular solution. Typical recordings of ASIC1a wild type (Fig. 1) in internally perfused oocytes (cut-open configuration) show that ASIC currents (IASIC) elicited by short external pH changes (2 s duration) from 7.4 to 6.0, were stable for several minutes. The perfusion of intracellular methanethio-sulfonates (MTSEA, MTSET, MTS-PTrEA at 1 mm) did not affect the magnitude of IASIC. Similar recordings were obtained in the presence of MTSET in the external medium (data not shown). The insensitivity of ASIC1a to inhibition by intracellular and extracellular MTSET reagents indicates that the cysteine residues Cys-49, Cys-59, and Cys-61 in the first transmembrane segment (TM1) of ASIC1a wt (see Fig. 2A) are not modified by MTSET or, if modified, do not inhibit ASIC currents. Data reported on an ortholog of ENaC, the peptide-gated Na+ channel (FaNaCh), using a systematic cysteine substitution in TM1 showed 50-60% inhibition of the FaNaCh current by external MTS reagents (18Poet M. Tauc M. Lingueglia E. Cance P. Poujeol P. Lazdunski M. Counillon L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5595-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the TM1 of FaNaCh is lining the external pore of the channel. We could not confirm these findings on ASIC1a.FIGURE 2Sensitivity of ASIC1a mutants to internal MTSET.

B, ASIC current (IASIC) recorded from A22C and R43C mutants before and after the internal perfusion of MTSET at 1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the solvent accessibility of the amino terminus of ASIC1a, cysteine residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis from position Ile-18 in the amino terminus to Trp-46 in TM1, and the mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B illustrates typical IASIC expressed by mutants of ASIC1a with cysteine substituted at positions A22C and R43C. For these mutants, IASIC decreased after the application of internal MTSET (1 mm), indicating that cysteine residues at position Ala-22 and Arg-43 are modified. R43C was similarly inhibited by the larger methanethiosulfonates MTS-PTrEA 1 mm (73.9 ± 4.4% inhibition of IASIC after 2 min), indicating that R43C is accessible to large molecules. Fig. 3 summarizes the results obtained from the systematic cysteine substitution and analysis of modification by intracellular MTSET of residues Ile-18 to Trp-46. Substitutions at positions His-28, Gly-29, and His-32 were not investigated, because the corresponding mutations in ENaC result in channel loss of function (19Grunder S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A few other cysteine substitutions, T26C, S35C, E37C, and W46C resulted in a complete loss of function. The substituted cysteine residues at positions Ala-22, Ile-33, Phe-34, or Arg-43 are modified by intracellular MTSET resulting in ASIC1a inhibition. The A22C, I33C, F34C, or R43C mutants were unresponsive to external MTSET at 2.5 mm (data not shown). The R38C mutant showed a weak but significant inhibition by internal MTSET. The cysteine residue at position Ala-22 in the ASIC1a sequence corresponds to the conserved cysteine residues αCys-88, βCys-30, γCys-33 in rat ENaC subunit sequences (see Fig. 2A) that have been shown to be involved in the block of ENaC by intracellular MTS reagents (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, ENaC inhibition by an internal MTS reagent can be reproduced in ASIC1a with the A22C substitution. Additional cysteine residues in ENaC corresponding to Ser-35 and Leu-30 in ASIC1a also participate in ENaC inhibition by MTS reagents. The ASIC S35C mutant was not functional, but the adjacent cysteine substitutions I33C and F34C resulted in IASIC inhibition by internal MTSET. By contrast to ENaC, exposure of L30C to MTSET did not result in current inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that cysteine residues flanking the HG motif in both ENaC and ASIC1a are accessible from the cytosol by MTS reagents and result in channel inhibition upon modification by sulfhydryl reagents. State-dependent Accessibility—We next determined whether the substituted cysteine residues at position Ala-22, Ile-33, or Arg-43 were preferentially modified by MTS reagents in the open or closed conformation of the channel. We have compared the time course of ASIC1a inhibition by MTSET during repeated pH pulses applied every 0.5 min or after maintaining the channel in the resting state for 2 min. It is clear from the recordings (Fig. 4A) and from the time course of IASIC inhibition (Fig. 4B) that maintaining ASIC1aR43C in the resting (closed) state in the presence of internal MTSET (1 mm) prevents ASIC block and delays the time course of channel inhibition (Fig. 4B). These data are consistent with a reduced accessibility of R43C to internal MTSET when the channel is closed and indicate that the TM1 undergoes conformational changes associated with channel gating. Comparison of the current inhibition of the A22C, I33C, and R43C ASIC1a mutants using the same protocol shows that keeping the channel in the resting state (Fig. 4C) did not affect the magnitude of inhibition of the A22C and I33C mutants. This indicates that the modifications of A22C and I33C by contrast to R43C are state-independent, suggesting that neither Ala-22 nor Ile-33 undergo conformational changes during channel gating that affect their accessibility. Effects of Internal Cd2+ Ions—Cadmium binds to sulfhydryl groups and is of a similar size as Na+ ions. Internal Cd2+ (1 mm) inhibits ASIC1a wt, and this inhibition is completely abolished by the C61S mutation in the TM1 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that C61 is accessible to intracellular Cd2+ ions. By contrast to MTS reagents, internal Cd2+ did not inhibit IASIC of R43C more than wt. The most striking effect of Cd2+ on R43C was a broadening of the IASIC transient caused by slowing of open channel inactivation. These data are summarized in Fig. 5, B and C. Cd2+ slightly decreases the IASIC of ASIC1a wt and of the C49A and C59V mutants. By contrast, the C61S substitution abolished ASIC1a inhibition by Cd2+ and even increased IASIC by 2-fold in the presence of Cd2+. Fig. 5C shows that internal Cd2+ increases the time constant for the inactivation (τ) of the R43C mutant by 4-6-fold compared with ASIC wt (Fig. 5C). We noticed that Cd2+ transiently increases by 50% IASIC of R43C probably due to the slower inactivation of the channel in the presence of Cd2+. Internal Cd2+ did affect neither the current magnitude nor the time course of current inactivation of the A22C and I33C mutants more than for wt ASIC1a (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate first that MTSET (but not Cd2+) inhibits the A22C, I33C, F34C, and R43C mutants, suggesting that the size of the sulfhydryl-modifying molecule is important for channel block. Second, the state-dependent block by MTSET and the effect of Cd2+ on the R43C mutant provides evidence that TM1 undergoes conformational changes during channel inactivation. Accessibility from the Extracellular Side—ASIC1a is permeable to divalent cations such as Ca2+ (20Bassler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is likely that, because of its smaller ionic radius, Cd2+ also permeates the channel. We hypothesized that, if the substituted cysteine R43C or Cys-61 is located along the ion permeation pathway, it should also bind Cd2+ from the extracellular side. We tested whether the application of extracellular Cd2+ reproduces the effects of internal Cd2+ on the R43C and C61S mutants. Extracellular Cd2+ (3 and 10 mm) decreases the IASIC current expressed by ASIC wt (71.9 ± 5.5% and 95.8 ± 1.1% inhibition, respectively (Fig. 6, A and C)). The IC50 for IASIC inhibition by external Cd2+ ions, as determined from concentration/inhibition curves, was similar for ASIC1a wt (0.37 ± 0.005 mm), for the R43C (0.46 ± 0.048 mm), and for the C49A/C59V/C61S triple mutant in the TM1 (0.42 ± 0.045 mm). Thus, both extracellular and intracellular Cd2+ inhibits ASIC1a. However, C61S mutation prevents the ASIC1a inhibition by internal Cd2+ but has no effect on ASIC1a inhibition by external Cd2+. This indicates that external Cd2+ either binds to Cys-61 without impairing the ion flux through the pore or cannot access the Cys-61 residue from the external side. This observation is consistent with the absence of ASIC1a inhibition by external MTS reagents and do not favor a location of Cys-61 residue in the TM1 along the ion permeation pathway. In contrast to ASIC1a wt, external Cd2+ reversibly slowed the current inactivation of the R43C mutant (Fig. 6, B, D, and E), resulting in a 3-fold increase in τ. Thus, intracellular and extracellular Cd2+ have similar effects on the time constant of IASIC inactivation of the R43C mutant, indicating that R43C binds Cd2+ applied from either side of the membrane. This provides strong evidence that Arg-43 is located in the ion permeation pathway. Together, our data show that TM1 not only moves during channel gating but that part of it also lines the internal pore. Our results have identified amino acid residues in the amino terminus and the TM1 of ASIC1a that, when substituted with cysteine, are modified by intracellular MTS reagents, resulting in channel inhibition. The amino-terminal sequence of ASIC1a comprising Phe-21 to Ile-33 shows a high degree of homology between the members of the ENaC/degenerin family with notably a completely conserved HG motif (see Fig. 2A). According to the current models of the membrane topology of ENaCs/degenerins, the amino terminus up to the first transmembrane segment TM1 of ASIC is facing the cytosolic side of the membrane. The functional importance of this amino-terminal domain has been first evidenced by a mutation in the HG motif of ENaC leading to a genetic form of a salt-loosing nephropathy (pseudohypoaldosteronism type-1) (21Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The ENaCs with mutations of the HG motif show altered gating properties characterized by abnormally long closures and short channel openings. More recently it has been shown that the high sensitivity of ENaC to intracellular sulfhydryl reagents and oxidizing agents can be attributed to conserved cysteine residues in the amino terminus of ENaC subunits (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutants A22C, I33C, and F34C in the amino terminus of ASIC1a reproduce the ENaC sensitivity to inhibition by internal MTS reagents, indicating that the functional domains in the amino terminus are conserved among ENaCs and ASICs. Our data do not allow us to conclude that the inhibition of the A22C, I33C, or F34C mutants by internal MTS reagents results from a block of the channel pore. The amino terminus of ENaC has been shown to play a role in channel gating (21Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C.

We have been unable to show that the permeant divalent cation Cd2+ binds to A22C or I33C when applied from either side of the membrane, as expected if A22C or I33C would be located along the ion permeation pathway. Thus, we are still lacking direct evidence that A22C and I33C are lining the internal pore of ASIC. Our results also show that A22C and I33C do not undergo conformational changes that modify their accessibility to intracellular MTS reagents. Thus, we have no good evidence that A22C and I33C are part of the gating machinery of the channel. It should be mentioned that mutations in the ASIC2 isoform at positions corresponding to Ala-20, Phe-21, and Thr-26 in the ASIC1a sequence (Fig. 2A) change the ion selectivity of the ASIC2, suggesting that this region of the amino terminus contributes to the channel pore structure (22Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Clearly, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of the A22C and I33C mutants by MTS reagents still remains to be elucidated to determine the contribution of these residues in the channel gating and/or in the permeation properties of the channel. It is surprising that the A22C or I33C ASIC1a mutants are insensitive to blocking by millimolar concentrations of intracellular Cd2+, whereas ENaC with cysteine residues at positions corresponding to Ala-22 and Ser-35 is highly sensitive to blocking by internal Cd2+ (see Fig. 2A) (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is possible that channel inhibition by internal Cd2+ requires the binding interaction of Cd2+ with several cysteine residues, such as Ala-22 and Ser-35 or other cysteines present in ENaC but absent in ASIC1a sequences. The location of R43C in the ion permeation pathway is supported by the fact that R43C is accessible to Cd2+ from both the extracellular and intracellular sides. Furthermore, the modification of R43C by internal MTS reagents indicates that this Arg residue lines the internal channel pore. Together with the state-dependent accessibility of R43C to MTS reagents, this suggests the presence of an internal gate that hinders the access of ions to the internal pore of the channel. Binding of Cd2+ to R43C may act as a “foot in the door” delaying channel inactivation. Regarding the Cys-49, Cys-59, and Cys-61 located in the TM1, we do not have evidence that these residues line the channel pore, even though Cys-61 seems to play a role in the ASIC1a inhibition and to be accessible by internal Cd2+. The Channel Pore—Fig. 7 represents a linear model of the transmembrane segments of ASIC and ENaC that summarizes the structures known to be involved in the ion permeation pathway. The external ion channel pore is made of a short putative α helix that contains a site (degenerin site) that, when modified by external MTS in the open conformation of the channel, freezes the channel in the open state (23Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further downstream, the binding site for the external pore blocker amiloride has been identified in ENaC (8Kellenberger S. Gautschi I.

The first residues in TM2 of ENaC (selectivity filter) are accessible to external Cd2+ and are important for maintaining the ion selectivity and the ionic conductance of the channel (11Kellenberger S.

There is little evidence supporting a contribution of the distal part of TM2 in the internal pore lining. We have generated and tested the substitution mutants V450C, L451C, L453C, F454C, Y458C, R467C, R468C, G469C, and K470C in the cytosolic end of TM2. Exposure to 1 mm internal MTSET did not result in current inhibition in any of these mutants, suggesting that TM2 does not participate in the internal mouth of the channel. Our data represent the first demonstration that TM1 is involved in the pore lining and participates in channel gating; this study identifies the amino terminus of the ENaCs/ASICs as an important functional domain accessible from the cytosol and as controlling the ion flux through the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2004914562,"Retroviruses and DNA viruses utilize cellular dNTPs as substrates for their DNA polymerases during viral replication in infected cells. However, because of S phase-dependent dNTP biosynthesis, the availability of cellular dNTPs significantly varies among cell types (e.g. dividing versus nondividing cells and normal versus tumor cells). Here we tested whether alterations in the dNTP utilization efficiency and dNTP binding affinity of viral DNA polymerases can switch viral infection specificity to cell types with different dNTP concentrations. We employed an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) mutant (Q151N), which is catalytically active only at high dNTP concentrations because of its reduced dNTP binding affinity. Indeed, the modified HIV-1 vector harboring the Q151N mutant RT preferentially transduced tumor cells containing higher cellular dNTP concentrations than primary cells (e.g. human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and human keratinocytes). Although the wild type HIV-1 vector transduced both HLFs and tumor cells, the Q151N vector failed to transduce HLFs and keratinocytes but efficiently transduced tumor cells. Pretreatment of HLFs with deoxynucleosides, which increase cellular dNTP pools, enabled the mutant vector to transduce HLFs, suggesting that the transduction failure of the RT mutant vector to primary cells is because of inefficient reverse transcription in low cellular dNTP environments. We also observed that the Q151N vector expressing herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase renders tumor cells sensitive to gancyclovir. This study validates a novel strategy in which modifications of viral DNA polymerases in various vector systems allow the delivery of target genes exclusively to tumor cells exploiting elevated cellular dNTP concentration as a tumor cell-specific host factor."
https://openalex.org/W2010445962,"In yeast, the Met4 transcription factor and its cofactors Cbf1, Met28, Met31, and Met32 control the expression of sulfur metabolism and oxidative stress response genes. Met4 activity is tuned to nutrient and oxidative stress conditions by the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase. The mechanism whereby SCFMet30-dependent ubiquitylation of Met4 controls Met4 activity remains contentious. Here, we have demonstrated that intracellular cysteine levels dictate the degradation of Met4 in vivo, as shown by the ability of cysteine, but not methionine or S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), to trigger Met4 degradation in an str4Δ strain, which lacks the ability to produce cysteine from methionine or AdoMet. Met4 degradation requires its nuclear localization and activity of the 26 S proteasome. Analysis of the regulated degradation of a fully functional Met4-Cbf1 chimera, in which Met4 is fused to the DNA binding domain of Cbf1, demonstrates that elimination of Met4 in vivo can be triggered independently of both its normal protein interactions. Strains that harbor the Met4-Cbf1 fusion as the only source of Cbf1 activity needed for proper kinetochore function exhibit high rates of methionine-dependent chromosomal instability. We suggest that SCFMet30 activity or Met4 utilization as a substrate may be directly regulated by intracellular cysteine concentrations.

We suggest that SCFMet30 activity or Met4 utilization as a substrate may be directly regulated by intracellular cysteine concentrations. The temporal and spatial control of transcription requires a battery of different factors, including transcription activators/repressors, co-activators/repressors, general transcription factors, chromatin-modifying and -remodeling enzymes, and the multisubunit enzyme RNA polymerase II. Diverse biochemical events dictate interaction of RNA polymerase II with gene regulatory sequences. Protein phosphorylation controls interactions between many factors (1Brivanlou A.H. Darnell J.E. Science. 2002; 295Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), while a complex code of histone acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation modifies chromatin accessibility (2Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Finally, the abundance and/or activity of many transcription-associated factors is dynamically controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (3Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 4Muratani M. Tansey W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins is achieved through a cascade of E1, 6The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; HA, hemagglutinin; AdoMet, adenosylmethionine. E2, and E3 enzymes, which activate and then serially transfer ubiquitin onto substrate lysine residues (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The best understood function of ubiquitylation is to target proteins for destruction by the 26 S proteasome, a large compartmentalized protease particle that recognizes the polyubiquitin tag (6Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). More recently, non-proteolytic functions have been ascribed to ubiquitin conjugation, including targeting to different subcellular compartments and allosteric control of enzymatic events (7Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). How ubiquitylation leads to different outcomes in different contexts is not fully understood. The pervasive role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the regulation of transcription has gradually emerged from numerous studies. RNA polymerase II is polyubiquitylated in response to DNA damage, whereas histone monoubiquitylation is associated with activation of transcription (8Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Pham A.D. Sauer F. Science. 2000; 289: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the proteasome itself regulates different steps in transcription and is recruited to active gene regions (10Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Finally, the regulated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of transcriptional activators allows the cells to dynamically control the expression of target genes (3Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, an intriguing correlation between activator potency and instability suggests that ubiquitylation of transcription factors may be directly linked to transcriptional activation (4Muratani M. Tansey W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 11Thomas D. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R341-R343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The most potent class of transcriptional activators, those containing transcription activation domains rich in acidic residues, are by far the most unstable; strikingly, such transcription activation domains can function as degrons that target heterologous proteins for degradation (12Tansey W.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Salghetti S.E. Caudy A.A. Chenoweth J.G. Tansey W.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Degradation of transcription factors may thus be coupled to assembly of active transcriptional complexes on promoter DNA (14Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Lipford J.R. Smith G.T. Chi Y. Deshaies R.J. Nature. 2005; 438: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to proteasomal-dependent degradation, non-proteolytic regulation of transcription factor activity by ubiquitylation has recently been described. The first and best documented example of this mechanism is the yeast transcriptional activator Met4, which governs the MET gene network responsible for the biosynthesis of the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine (16Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Met4 is the essential substrate of the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase, a multiprotein E3 complex that uses the F-box protein subunit Met30 to recruit Met4 for ubiquitylation by the core SCF complex, in conjunction with the E2 enzyme Cdc34 (17Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 18Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Met4 is recruited to promoter DNA by one of two distinct sets of cofactors that bind different elements in MET gene regulatory regions, either the Met28-Cbf1 complex or the complex Met31-Met32 (19Kuras L. Barbey R. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Blaiseau P.L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in facilitating activation of some MET genes, Cbf1 is a component of the core kinetochore complex that binds the CDEI of the yeast centromere (21Baker R.E. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2458-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Cai M. Davis R.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Upon environmental changes, Met4 can be either rapidly ubiquitylated and degraded (23Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or ubiquitylated and inactivated in the absence of degradation (24Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Cell. 2000; 102: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These alternative fates of ubiquitylated Met4 forms depend upon the growth conditions: in minimal media Met4 is ubiquitylated and degraded in response to methionine excess, whereas in rich media Met4 is oligo-ubiquitylated but remains stable (25Kuras L. Rouillon A. Lee T. Barbey R. Tyers M. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the latter growth condition, oligo-ubiquitylated Met4 is not recruited to MET gene promoters but is recruited to the SAM genes, which are required for production of S-adenosylmethionine, an unstable metabolite that is not present in rich medium. Thus, ubiquitylation appears to not only regulate Met4 by distinct mechanisms but also to control the differential recruitment of Met4 to distinct target promoters. Despite multiple lines of evidence that SCFMet30-dependent ubiquitylation of Met4 leads to Met4 degradation specifically in minimal media (23Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Kuras L. Rouillon A. Lee T. Barbey R. Tyers M. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the degradation of Met4 under minimal conditions has recently been disputed (26Flick K. Ouni I. Wohlschlegel J.A. Capati C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Kaiser P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To settle this discrepancy, we have investigated the determinants of Met4 degradation in yeast grown in minimal media in the presence of high extracellular methionine levels. We find that Met4 instability is ultimately dictated by intracellular cysteine levels and that degradation depends on both proper localization of Met4 in the nucleus and on an active proteasome. Through the use of chimeric Met4-Cbf1 fusion protein we have shown that destruction of ubiquitylated Met4 is independent of the means by which it is tethered to DNA. These results further confirm that the transcriptional activator Met4 is indeed regulated by degradation-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Yeast Culture—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains are isogenic with the wild-type strain W303 (provided by R. Rothstein). Standard yeast media and minimal B medium were prepared as described by Chérest and Surdin-Kerjan (27Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1992; 130: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Minimal B medium is a synthetic medium without sulfur sources (27Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1992; 130: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For methionine repression, cells were grown in B medium supplemented with 0.05 mm l-methionine to early log phase and transferred to a B medium without sulfur source for 1 h before a high concentration of l-methionine (1 mm) was added. For derepression, cells were first grown in B medium containing a repressive amount of l-methionine to early log phase and then transferred to B medium without sulfur amino acids. Transformation was by the lithium acetate method (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that had been digested by EcoRI and BamHI. The plasmid pGAL1-GFPMET4Δ2NLS was constructed by amplifying MET4 nucleotides 548-1200 from plasmid pMET4-1 (29Kuras L. Thomas D. Mol. Cell.

The EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then cloned into the corresponding sites of pGAL306GFP. The above plasmids were linearized by StuI to direct integration into the chromosomal URA3 locus in a met4::TRP1 strain (CC849-1A). The Met4-Cbf1 chimera comprises the entire Met4 protein with the exception of the basic leucine zipper domain fused to the basic helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain of Cbf1 (residues 210-351). Plasmids were constructed as follows: pGAL316MET4-CBF1, which allows the expression of the Met4-Cbf1 chimera from the GAL1 promoter, was created by inserting the ClaI-ClaI fragment of pMET4-4 (30Thomas D.

To direct the homologous replacement of the MET4 chromosomal locus, we cloned a HindIII-HindIII fragment that contains the MET4 terminator region of pMET4-4 into pProMET4-CBF1 that had been digested by HindIII and dephosphorylated. The ClaI-NotI fragment of the resulting plasmid pProMet4-Cbf1 was isolated, non-yeast nucleotides were removed by brief Bal31 digestion, and the resulting purified fragment was used to transform the CC849-8A strain. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linked chromatin preparation and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (25Kuras L. Rouillon A. Lee T. Barbey R. Tyers M. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), except that cells were fixed with 1.4% formaldehyde and disrupted using the Fastprep apparatus (Qbiogene) instead of vortexing. Rabbit polyclonal Met4 antiserum against full-length Met4 produced in insect cells was used for immunoprecipitation (25Kuras L. Rouillon A. Lee T. Barbey R. Tyers M. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated and total DNA samples were purified using the Quiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR performed with the Light Cycler System (Roche Applied Science). Input DNA was diluted to 1/5 and 1/25. Immunoprecipitated and total DNAs were subjected to 40 cycles of PCR using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I reaction mix (Roche Applied Science). The occupancy level at a given promoter was defined as the ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA over total DNA for each PCR product. The higher occupancy level measured was arbitrarily set to 100, and all other values were represented relative to this standard. Protein and RNA Analysis—Total proteins were extracted by a 20% cold trichloroacetic acid procedure (23Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) using a Fastprep apparatus (Qbiogen). Samples were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran; Schleicher & Schuell), and probed. Anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. Anti-Met4 polyclonal antibody was used at 1:2,000 and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Detection was by Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Equal loading was established by detection with a lysyl-tRNA synthetase antibody. Total cellular RNA was extracted from yeast by the hot phenol method, separated, and probed as described (23Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Microscopy and Cytometry—GFP-Met4 fusion protein fluorescence was monitored in living cells on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope using a Zeiss GFP filter. All the images were collected with a Roper Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera using identical settings and analyzed with the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Immediately before observation, cells were harvested by a brief centrifugation, washed, and suspended in Dabco (Sigma) buffer. Nuclei were stained using the dye HOECHST number 33342 (Sigma). Levels of the GFP-Met4 fusion protein were assessed by quantitative fluorescence of live cells using a BD Biosciences FacsScalibur flow cytometer. Metabolic Sulfur Analysis—Yeast cells were grown at a cell density of 107cells/ml in B medium containing 0.2 mm homocysteine as sulfur source. After filtration, cells were transferred to B medium containing 0.05 mm sulfate and 4 μCie/ml of radioactive sulfate. At the indicated time, a 5-ml aliquot of cells was harvested by a brief centrifugation, washed two times with 1 mm cold sulfate, boiled, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Plasmid Loss Assay—Plasmid loss assays were performed as described in Ref. 31Masison D.C. O'Connell K.F. Baker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Plasmid pRS313 carrying the selective marker URA3 and the CEN6 centromere was transformed into yeast. Transformants were grown in a synthetic medium without histidine and diluted in a medium containing histidine and either repressive or non-repressive concentration of l-methionine. This step corresponds to the beginning of the experiment (0). Cells were plated on a synthetic medium containing or not histidine and either a repressive or a non-repressive concentration of l-methionine at 0 and 8 (T1), 24 (T2), 32 (T3), 48 (T4) h. The number of cells harboring the plasmid at each time point was calculated by counting the total colonies formed in the presence or absence of histidine. Met4 Elimination Depends on the Trans-sulfuration Pathway—To elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the proteasome-dependent degradation of Met4, we first investigated the cellular signal that might trigger the elimination of Met4. High concentrations of the three predominant sulfur-containing compounds (1 mm l-methionine, 0.2 mm S-adénosylmethionine (AdoMet), and 1 mm l-cysteine; Fig. 1A) were equally capable of repressing MET gene expression in wild-type cells grown in minimal medium (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in str4Δ mutants that lack a functional cystathionine-β synthase and are thus unable to convert either methionine or AdoMet into cysteine, only high levels of cysteine were able to cause full MET gene repression (Fig. 1B). To determine whether cysteine caused Met4 elimination, we monitored the stability of a GFP-Met4 fusion protein expressed from the endogenous MET4 promoter in cells exposed to either methionine or cysteine. In wild-type cells, the GFP-Met4 fluorescence signal disappeared with similar kinetics in response to either amino acid, whereas in str4Δ cells GFP-Met4 disappeared only in response to cysteine (Fig. 1C). To corroborate these results, we determined the stability of an HA epitope-tagged version of Met4 expressed from the endogenous MET4 promoter. The changes in abundance of HA3Met4 in wild-type versus str4Δ cells exposed to either methionine or cysteine paralleled effects on MET gene expression and GFP-Met4 (Fig. 1D). The SCFMet30-dependent elimination of Met4 in response to methionine thus requires an increase in intracellular cysteine, which arises from the conversion of methionine into AdoMet and subsequent metabolism by the methyl cycle and the trans-sulfuration pathway (Fig. 1A). Glutathione, the most abundant cysteine-containing peptide in the cell, was not required for Met4 regulation because cysteine was able to promote rapid GFP-Met4 elimination in a gsh1Δ mutant that lacks γ-glutamylcysteine synthase and is thus unable to convert cysteine into glutathione (Fig. 1E). Met4 Degradation Requires Nuclear Localization—Met30 is localized within the nucleus, and its correct compartmentalization is required for its function (32Brunson L.E. Dixon C. Kozubowski L. Mathias N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6674-6682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of Met4 should thus be required for its degradation. To identify nuclear localization signals in Met4, we constructed several Met4 deletion derivatives and monitored the subcellular localization of each derivative fused to GFP. This analysis identified three sequences within Met4 that were important for its subcellular localization (Fig. 2, A and B, data not shown). Deletion of the Met4 carboxyl-terminal region (404-589; deletions Δ7 and Δ8) caused cytoplasmic localization, implying the existence of an NLS in this region. Unexpectedly, larger deletions that removed additional adjacent residues (189-589; deletions Δ9 and Δ10) caused relocalization to the nucleus, suggesting that the 309-404 region of Met4 contains residues that help restrict Met4 to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization of severely truncated derivative GFP-Met4Δ11 suggested that Met4 contains a second NLS in the 78-189 region, which is close to the Met4 activation domain. A final GFP-Met4 derivative that was devoid of both potential NLS sequences, Met4Δ2NLS, displayed mainly cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the sequence that helps restrict Met4 to the nucleus perfectly overlaps with the Met4 auxiliary domain, a sequence previously identified as being required for the full transcription activation potency of Met4 (29Kuras L. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether Met4 degradation was dependent on its nuclear localization, we investigated the stability of the GFP-Met4Δ7 derivative (deletion of residues 470-589), which leaves both the Met30-interacting region and the known ubiquitylation site (lysine 163) intact (26Flick K. Ouni I. Wohlschlegel J.A. Capati C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Kaiser P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The stability of GFP-Met4Δ7 and wild-type GFP-Met4 fusion proteins was analyzed in the presence and the absence of high methionine after repression of the GAL1 promoter from which each was expressed. Wild-type GFP-Met4 was rapidly depleted in the presence of methionine, whereas much of the GFP-Met4Δ7 derivative was still present 60 min after methionine addition (Fig. 2D). Close inspection revealed that GFP-Met4Δ7 fluorescence was restricted to the cytoplasm in cells exposed to high methionine while it was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the absence of methionine. This result suggested that only nuclear localized GFP-Met4Δ7 was actively degraded. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the Met4Δ7 protein was less destabilized upon methionine exposure than wild-type Met4 (data not shown). Met4 Degradation Is Dependent on Proteasome Activity—We next demonstrated that the loss of GFP-Met4 fluorescence signal in response to methionine indeed resulted from the proteasome-mediated degradation of the fusion protein and not, for instance, from nonspecific disruption of the GFP moiety. To this end, the stability of the wild-type GFP-Met4 expressed from the GAL1 promoter was analyzed in the presence of Mg132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal), a peptide aldehyde inhibitor of proteasome (33Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The concurrent addition of MG132 and methionine to minimal medium prevented the disappearance of GFP-Met4 that was observed when promoter shutoff was performed in the presence of methionine alone (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, both fluorescence microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry assays showed that the inhibition of fluorescence depletion was proportional to the concentration of added MG132 (Fig. 3, A and B). We further ascertained that the disappearance of GFP-Met4 fluorescence was a result of ubiquitin-mediated degradation by analysis of a GFP-Met4Δ12 fusion protein, which lacks residues 79-180, a region that spans the activation domain and includes lysine 163, the sole ubiquitylation site on Met4 (26Flick K. Ouni I. Wohlschlegel J.A. Capati C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Kaiser P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fluorescent signal emanating from GFP-Met4Δ12 was stable in the presence of methionine (Fig. 3C). An analogous Ha3Met4Δ12 derivative was also not sign"

Cytotoxicity seems to result from targeting the protein synthesis machinery after the enzyme enters the cells. Several known proteinaceous toxins of plant or bacterial origin inhibit protein synthesis by targeting rRNA of ribosomes (17Bowman C.M. Dahlberg J.E. Ikemura T. Konisky J. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

On the other hand, bacterial toxin colicin E5 specifically targets tRNAs (tRNAHis, tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, and tRNATyr; see Ref. 20Ogawa T. Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Uozumi T. Masaki H.

Angiogenin, a pancreatic RNase homologue, was found to degrade tRNA when injected into frog oocytes (22Saxena S.K. Rybak S.M. Dayey R.T. Youle R.J. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol.

Our present studies indicate that the cleavages by onconase in several tRNAs involve selective G–G sites in addition to U–G and C–G dinucleotide bonds. Interestingly, the cleavage sites involving G–G locate in the variable or the D-arm region of the tRNA. As a member of the RNase A superfamily of proteins, onconase thus exhibits cleavage specificity not known for this group of enzymes. The specific cleavages by onconase in tRNA may give further insights into its biological effects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Onconase was a gift from Richard Youle's laboratory at the NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD and Alfa Cell Corp., Bloomfield, NJ. RNase A, E. coli tRNALys, tRNAVal, yeast tRNAPhe, and E. coli tRNAfMet were obtained from Sigma; T4 RNA ligase was from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. The Ribomax™ large scale RNA production system SP6 was from Promega, Madison, WI, and the RNA decamer marker was from Ambion, Austin, TX. The nucleotide removal kit and gel extraction kit were from Qiagen, Valencia, CA. 32P-labeled cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate was prepared by Jonaki, Hyderabad, India.Preparation of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysates—Reticulocyte lysates were prepared as described in Ref. 27Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

New Zealand White male rabbits (2–3-months-old) were made anemic by subcutaneous injection of 1% acetyl phenyl hydrazine in water for four consecutive days. Five days after the last injection, blood was collected in precooled heparinized tubes. The blood was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was washed three times (at 500 × g for 5 min each time) with buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm glucose, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl). The supernatant and white buffy coat present over the cell pellet were carefully removed. The packed volume of the cell pellet (red blood cells) was noted, and an equal volume of ice-cold deionized water was added to lyse the red blood cells. The lysed red blood cells suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C until further use.Preparation of RNA—RNA was isolated from the rabbit reticulocyte lysates as follows. A known volume of the lysates was diluted 100 times in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgOAc, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol), solubilized with 1% sarkosyl, and extracted with water-saturated phenol and chloroform. RNA from the aqueous phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethyl alcohol, dried, and dissolved in RNase free water.For the preparation of 28 S or 18 S rRNA, total RNA isolated from 100 μl of reticulocyte lysates as described above was centrifuged in the cold at 100,000 × g for 4.5 h through a 4.4-ml 5–20% discontinuous sucrose gradient in 0.01 m NaOAc, pH 5.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.001 m EDTA. 200-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and checked for the respective RNA species by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing specific RNA species were pooled, and RNA was precipitated from the pooled fractions with isopropyl alcohol as above.Cloning of tRNAPhe.m and Transcription in Vitro—tRNAPhe.m corresponded to the sequence of yeast tRNAPhe in which residues U41 and A29 were replaced by A and U, respectively. This represents the compensatory mutation U41A,A29U, as shown in Fig. 7a. Both strands of DNA corresponding to the sequence of tRNAPhe.m, along with NcoI or SacI restriction enzyme sites at the ends, were synthesized by DNA/RNA synthesizer 394 (Applied Biosystems). The synthesized oligonucleotides were purified using OPC cartridges (Applied Biosystems). The complementary oligonucleotide pairs (10 μg of each) were first denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and allowed to anneal at room temperature for 1 h. The annealed product was cloned into pGEM T Easy vector (Promega) under Sp6 promoter using SacI and NcoI sites. The DNA sequence of the clone was verified using a 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). tRNAPhe.m was in vitro transcribed with Ribomax™ large scale RNA production system SP6, as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The in vitro synthesized transcript was purified by phenol extraction and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol.All natural and in vitro transcribed tRNAs were 3′ end-labeled with 32P-labeled cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate, using T4 RNA ligase as described in Ref. 28Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar. Labeled RNA was purified using nucleotide removal kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the purpose of RNase reactions, the specific activity of the labeled RNA was adjusted to 105 cpm/μg by adding the appropriate amount of unlabeled tRNA.RNase Reactions and Analysis—For studying the activity of RNase A and onconase, ∼130 ng/μl RNA was incubated with specified enzyme concentrations in 15 μl of assay buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 m NaCl) at 30 °C for 15 min. In the experiments with 3′ end-labeled tRNA, 160 ng/μl tRNA containing 105 cpm radioactivity was incubated with specified enzyme concentrations, and the reactions were carried out in 6 μl of assay buffer as above unless described otherwise (see Fig. 4b). The molar ratio of tRNA substrate (the substrate in most of the reactions) to onconase, ranging between 2 and 10, depends upon the concentration of the enzyme used. In the experiment with rRNA substrates, this ratio was more than 100. However, it should be noted that with macromolecular, long chain RNA substrates (including tRNAs), the number of cleavable phosphodiester bonds is much higher than the number of molecules per se, and this should be taken in account when considering enzyme substrate ratios. In experiments with purified rRNA or reticulocyte lysates, total RNA was phenol-extracted at the end of the reactions and analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels. In other reactions, RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions, using 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5 m urea. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the RNA bands (see Fig. 3). In the experiments with 3′ end-labeled tRNA, long sequencing gels were run, fixed with 10% acetic acid and 50% methyl alcohol, and dried, and RNAs were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film or Fuji phosphorimaging device. RNase T1-reacted tRNA and a ladder generated by alkaline hydrolysis of the same tRNA were used for assignment of sequence. RNase T1 cleaves 3′ to G. Therefore every labeled fragment generated in the reaction with T1 would extend from the labeled 3′ end to the nucleotide 3′ to every G in the sequence. Partial hydrolysis of the labeled RNA was carried out with 0.1 m NaOH containing 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min. This RNA was used in the sequencing gels to get the size ladder. Alternatively, in reaction with in vitro transcribed tRNAphe.m, RNA decamer markers (Ambion) labeled at their 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase were used to define molecular sizes.FIGURE 4Onconase cleavage site mapping in tRNAPhe. In a, 0.16 μg/μl3′ end-labeled tRNAPhe was reacted with specified concentrations of onconase or RNase T1 at 30 °C for 15 min, in a 6-μl reaction volume, and in b, the reaction was carried out as in panel a but only with the lowest concentration (0.5 μm) of onconase for specified time periods. Cleavages were analyzed by electrophoresis in sequencing gels, and autoradiography of the gels was carried out using a phosphorimaging device. In c, relative intensities of the cleavage products (species A–I) seen in the reaction incubated for 5 min (panel b) were recorded in the phosphorimaging device and plotted as the percentage of total intensity. RNase T1-treated tRNA and a sequence ladder generated by alkaline hydrolysis were used for assignment of sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Shogen K. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15142-15146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation offered for this specificity of onconase toward its substrate was based on the possible protection of rRNA by bound proteins. This was also supported with the reaction of onconase on rabbit reticulocyte lysates spiked with free E. coli RNA. In several experiments, we observed that the free RNA was degraded at much lower enzyme concentration than the concentration required for degrading rRNA of the ribosomes, the difference between the two concentrations being as much as 100-fold (not shown). Even RNase A would show some difference toward such substrate forms, but the behavior of onconase was very striking. Intrigued with this, we were interested to study whether the specificity was only due to apparent protection of the RNA by bound proteins or was driven by any sequence or structural feature of the substrate. We have tried to answer this question by comparing the action of RNase A and onconase on purified rRNAs and purified tRNAs with that on the RNA in reticulocyte lysates. We have also mapped the cleavage sites of onconase in different tRNAs (model substrates) labeled at their 3′ ends, using RNA sequencing approach.To test whether the rRNA resistance to onconase was resident in the RNA per se or was seen only in the ribosome form, we first compared the action of RNase A and onconase on 28 S or 18 S rRNA purified from reticulocyte lysates and on reticulocyte lysate directly. In the assays with purified 28 S and 18 S rRNA (Fig. 2, a and b, respectively), 10–20 pm RNaseA or 25 nm onconase was required for detectable degradation of the substrates, and both the enzymes degraded rRNA. The difference in the concentration of the two enzymes observed for minimum detectable degradation was consistent with the relative differences in their catalytic activity described earlier (about 1000-fold difference, see Ref. 23Boix E. Wu Y.N. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We then studied the action of onconase and RNase A, as a function of enzyme concentration, on the RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 2c). With RNase A, about 40 pm enzyme was adequate to cause detectable degradation, and rRNA was clearly the first target. Since the degradation products of rRNAs would overlap with tRNA, it was difficult to precisely state at what concentration the degradation of tRNA occurred. In the case of onconase, tRNA was found to be the preferred substrate and not rRNA; degradation of tRNA could be detected with 50 nm enzyme, and degradation of rRNA, if any at all, could be detected only at 4–8 μm onconase. Thus the difference in the enzyme concentration required for detectable degradation of each of the two substrates, tRNA and rRNA of the ribosomes, was about 100-fold. Together, these results support the earlier observation (see Ref. 1Saxena S.K. Sirdeshmukh R. Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15142-15146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that the difference in the action of two enzymes was seen only when the reaction occurred in cells or in reticulocyte lysates; onconase differed from RNase A in that it preferentially degraded tRNA. To understand the basis of this specificity of onconase further, we compared the action of onconase and RNase A on purified tRNAPhe. As seen in Fig. 3, 200–500 pm RNase A cleaved tRNAPhe, yielding a number of products of different sizes, whereas with increasing concentrations of onconase (0.25–6 μm), the reaction progressively resulted in degradation product(s), moving as one major band on electrophoresis (shown by the arrow in the figure). The major band corresponded to the size of about 35–40 nucleotides, suggesting that the major site(s) of cleavage were in the middle part of the molecule. Other cleavage products were relatively low in intensity. It may be observed that the lowest concentration of onconase required for detectable degradation of the free tRNA in this experiment was higher than that required for degrading tRNA in the reticulocyte lysate (compare Fig. 2c, 50 nm, with Fig. 3, 250–500 nm). This difference in the activity may be due to its higher stability in the presence of the proteins of the reticulocyte lysates or the higher activity of the enzyme toward tRNA complexed in the translational machinery in the lysates. Virtual resistance of protein bound ribosomal or polysomal RNA to onconase over a wide range of enzyme concentrations enough to degrade tRNA or a limited number of cleavages seen with the enzyme in tRNA substrate is interesting. Together, these observations suggest specific target sites for onconase and selectivity of cleavages by the enzyme in this substrate. To identify exact cleavage sites, we labeled tRNAs at their 3′ end with 32P-labeled cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate and determined the termini of the cleavage products by RNA sequencing approach. Cleavage site mapping in tRNAPhe is shown in Fig. 4. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, degradation was detectable at 0.5 μm concentration of the enzyme. Therefore even in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, we used enzyme concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 μm. Species B in Fig. 4a was a predominant cleavage product observed at this lowest onconase concentration, which remained so at higher enzyme concentrations. At increasing enzyme concentrations, additional cleavage products, species A, E, and I, were also seen. Species A, I, and E resulted from cleavages 3′ to pyrimidine as observed for onconase with synthetic substrates (23Boix E. Wu Y.N. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol.

Fig. 4b, represents reactions with tRNAPhe incubated with 0.5 μm onconase for specified periods up to 30 min. Virtually no change in the cleavage pattern was observed over increasing time periods. The relative intensities of the degradation products observed at the shortest incubation time (5 min) are shown in Fig. 4c. Species B accounted for more than 50% of all the degradation products. The intensity of any other single cleavage product was found to be ∼10% of the total or less. In the control reaction with RNase A (Fig. 5a) and tRNAPhe, the cleavages detected did not correspond to any of the major cleavages observed with onconase. Similarly, in another control reaction, denatured tRNAPhe was reacted with onconase, and the products were studied (Fig. 5b). Cleavages observed with undenatured tRNAphe (Fig. 4a) were detected even with the denatured substrate. However, no significant preference for the cleavage sites was exhibited by the enzyme.FIGURE 2Onconase preferentially degrades tRNA in reticulocyte lysates. Purified 28 S (a) or 18 S (b) rRNA (0.13 μg/μl) was reacted with specified concentrations of RNase A or onconase in 15 μl of the reaction buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In c, 4 μl of reticulocyte lysates equivalent to about 1.5 μg of total RNA (as determined in a pilot experiment), mixed with 0.5 μg of externally added tRNA, was reacted with specified concentrations of RNase A or onconase as above.

In Fig. 6b, the electrophoresis run was carried out in a 14% denaturing gel and for a longer time for better resolution of the degradation products. The intense cleavage products seem to have resulted from cleavages between dinucleotide linkages U44-G45 and G45-G46, respectively. Other cleavages involved dinucleotides U–G (species E) or C–G (species D, F). With tRNAfMet (Fig. 6c), we observed a highly predominant cleavage product (species B), which mapped again between two G residues (G19-G20). Two other minor species (C and D) corresponded to cleavages between U–C and C–G, respectively. The action of onconase on tRNAVal is shown in Fig. 6d. With this substrate, major species B corresponded to a cleavage between G19-G20. Species C and D were minor and resulted from cleavages at pyrimidine dinucleotides.

Recently, we demonstrated that glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein 1 (GMEB1) interacts with the prodomain of procaspase-2, thereby disrupting its autoactivation and the induction of apoptosis. Here we show that GMEB1 is also capable of binding to procaspase-8 and -9. GMEB1 attenuated the Fas-mediated activation of these caspases and the subsequent apoptosis. The knockdown of endogenous GMEB1 using RNA interference revealed that cells with decreased GMEB1 expression are more sensitive to stress and undergo accelerated apoptosis. Transgenic mice expressing a neurospecific GMEB1 had smaller cerebral infarcts and less brain swelling than wild-type mice in response to transient focal ischemia. These results suggest that GMEB1 is an endogenous regulator that selectively binds to initiator procaspases and inhibits caspase-induced apoptosis.

The initiator caspases, which include caspase-8 and -9, possess long prodomains that consist of interaction domains essential for their activation. In response to the binding of ligands to death receptors, such as Fas, the adaptor protein FADD 3The abbreviations used are: FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; GMEB1, glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein 1; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; DED, death effecter domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethylketone; MCA, middle cerebral artery; TTC, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. and procaspase-8 are recruited to the activated receptor and are incorporated into a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (1Kischkel F.C.

The interaction between FADD and procaspase-8 is mediated by the death effector domains (DED) of both proteins (2Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

A second molecule of procaspase-8 then binds to the complex, thus facilitating the autocatalytic activation of caspase-8. Procaspase-9 is activated by a variety of internal and external death stimuli that promote cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds the adaptor protein Apaf-1 in a dATP-dependent fashion. The binding of cytochrome c and dATP induces a conformational change in Apaf-1 that allows it to associate with procaspase-9 via their respective caspase recruitment domains (CARD) (5Zou H.

The oligomerization of these procaspases while associated with these specific adapter molecules leads to autoactivation of the caspases (7Thronberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activation of initiator caspases leads to proteolytic activation of downstream effector caspases, the subsequent caspase-dependent cleavage of many vital proteins, and ultimately to programmed cell death. Thus, the regulation of initiator caspases is critical in determining whether a cell lives or dies. Caspases are synthesized in the cell as inactive precursors (procaspases), and their activation is strictly controlled by a variety of regulatory proteins, including Bcl-2, heat-shock proteins (HSPs), and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins (8Tsujimoto Y.

In the present study, we tested whether GMEB1 also interacts with other procaspases. Our results show that GMEB1 interacts selectively with initiator caspases such as procaspase-8 and -9, and attenuates their activation in response to treatment with monoclonal antibody specific for Fas. These results suggest that GMEB1 functions as an endogenous regulator of caspase activation.

NaCl was added to the resulting supernatants to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the solution was stored at -80 °C. For the cell-free experiments, 293T cytosolic extracts were incubated with GST or GST fusion protein (5 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C and were activated by adding cytochrome c (10 μm) and dATP (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The NSE-GMEB1 transgene was constructed by cloning a cDNA fragment containing the full-length HA-tagged GMEB1 protein downstream of the rat neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter and upstream of an SV40 polyadenylation signal. Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of the NSE-GMEB1-HA DNA construct into the pronuclei of fertilized C57BL/6J mice (16Farlie P.G. Dringen R. Rees S.M. Knnourakis G. Bernard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4397-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsies was amplified by PCR using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGGCTAATGCAGAAGTGAG-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-CCATCGATTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACAT-3′. This reaction generated a 1750-bp PCR product. Ischemic Model—Adult male wild-type (C57BL/6J) and GMEB1-transgenic (line 36) mice weighing 20-30 g were housed under diurnal lighting conditions and were used for all experiments. Anesthesia was induced by inhalation of 2.0% isoflurane (Merck), and was maintained with 1% isoflurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2 using a general anesthesia machine (Soft Lander: Sin-ei Industry Co. Ltd., Saitama, Japan). The body temperature of the mice was maintained between 37.0 and 37.5 °C using a heating pad and heating lamp. A filament occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was performed as previously described (27Hara H. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 28Hara H. Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Ayata C. Fink K. Huang Z. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Briefly, the left MCA was occluded with an 8-0 nylon mono-filament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) coated with a mixture of silicone resin (Xantopren; Bayer Dental, Osaka, Japan). This coated filament was introduced into the internal carotid artery through the common carotid artery and was fed into the anterior cerebral artery via the internal carotid artery, resulting in occlusion of the MCA. At 90 min after ischemia, the animals were briefly re-anesthetized with isoflurane, and the filament was withdrawn through the common carotid artery. The removal of the filament resulted in the reperfusion of the MCA, posterior communicating artery, and common carotid artery. 2 μl of Z-VAD-FMK (40 ng) were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.: bregma: 0.9 mm lateral, 0.1 mm posterior, 3.1 mm deep), one 15 min before ischemia and the other immediately after reperfusion (28Hara H. Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Ayata C. Fink K. Huang Z. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Brain Infarction and Swelling—Twenty-four hours after occlusion, the forebrain was divided into five 2-μm coronal sections using a mouse brain matrix (RBM-2000C; Activational Systems, Warren, MI). The sections were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC: Sigma). The infarcted areas were imaged using a digital camera (COOLPIX4500; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and Image J (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download/), and the degree of injury was calculated as described previously (28Hara H. Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Ayata C. Fink K. Huang Z. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Brain swelling (%) was calculated according to the following formula: [(infarct volume + ipsilateral undamaged volume - contralateral volume)/contralateral volume] × 100 (27Hara H. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Physiological parameters were recorded as previously described (28Hara H. Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Ayata C. Fink K. Huang Z. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Briefly, a polyethylene catheter was inserted into the femoral artery, and arterial blood pressure, pO2, pCO2, pH, and plasma glucose were measured 15 min after the start of ischemia. In Vivo Caspase Activity—The activity of caspase-8 and -9 were measured in ischemic brains by a Caspase-Glo Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WL) that provided a proluminescent substrate containing a tetrapeptide sequence such as LETD (caspase-8) or LEHD (caspasse-9). Cytosolic fractions from brain tissue (10 mg, cortex) were prepared by Dounce homogenization in extraction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Pefablock, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (29Liu D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48434-48442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with the same buffer and an equal volume of reagents. The samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The luminescence of each sample was measured in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test, or the Mann-Whitney U test (using STATVIEW v. 5.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Selective Interaction between GMEB1 and Procaspase-8 or -9—To determine whether GMEB1 binds to caspases other than procaspase-2 (14Tsuruma K. Nakagawa T. Shirakura H. Hayashi N. Uehara T. Nomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. We found that procaspase-8 and -9 interacted with GMEB1 in yeast (Fig. 1A). We then analyzed the domains required for the interaction between procaspase-8 or -9 and GMEB1. Procaspase-8 contains two repeated DED domains in the N-terminal region. Both DED domains of procaspase-8 interacted with GMEB1, whereas neither the N-terminal DED domain alone nor the p20/p10 domain was sufficient for the interaction (Fig. 1B). Similar to procaspase-2 (14Tsuruma K. Nakagawa T. Shirakura H. Hayashi N. Uehara T. Nomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), procaspse-9 required the CARD domain to interact with GMEB1 (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal region of GMEB1 (amino acid sequence 375-563), which contains a putative α-helical coiled-coil structure, was necessary for both procaspase-8 and -9 to interact with GMEB1 (Fig. 1C). This same domain was previously shown to be required for GMEB1 interaction with procaspase-2 (14Tsuruma K. Nakagawa T. Shirakura H. Hayashi N. Uehara T. Nomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). GMEB1 Can Bind to Procaspase-8 and -9 in Mammalian Cells—To demonstrate an interaction of GMEB1 with procaspase-8 and -9 in vivo, wild-type or mutant (1-517) FLAG-tagged GMEB1 was transiently transfected together with procaspase-8 or -9 into human 293T cells. Both procaspase-8 and -9 were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with GMEB1 (Fig. 2A). To confirm these findings, we examined the binding ability of a mutant GMEB1 (1-517) that lacks the putative C-terminal binding motif. Neither caspase-8 nor caspase-9 interacted with the mutant. We then examined the endogenous interaction between GMEB1 and procaspase-8 and -9 using non-transfected 293T cells. Both procaspase-8 and -9 were detected following immunoprecipitation of 293T cell lysates with an anti-GMEB1 antibody (Fig. 2B). Caspase-7, an effector caspase, did not bind to GMEB1 (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that endogenous GMEB1 associates with initiator caspases such as procaspase-8 and -9 in quiescent cells. In addition, immunocytochemical analysis revealed that endogenous GMEB1, as well as caspase-8 and -9, localizes in both the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Cellular localization of GMEB1 and the procaspases. SH-SY5Y cells were fixed and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-GMEB1 pAb and anti-caspase-8 (A) or caspase-9 (B) mAb, respectively. The green signal (GMEB1) was obtained with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488-conjugated secondary Ab, and the red signals (caspases) were obtained with anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594-conjugated secondary Ab. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Attenuation of Fas-mediated Apoptosis by GMEB1—To test the effects of GMEB1 on apoptosis, we first investigated death receptor signal-dependent apoptosis using anti-Fas antibody treatment. In HeLa K cells, the stimulation of Fas triggered a striking change in nuclear morphology characterized by typical apoptotic features such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 4A). The overexpression of wild-type GMEB1, but not the C-terminal-deleted mutant of GMEB1-(1-517), reduced Fas-mediated apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Next, we addressed how GMEB1 regulates Fas-induced signaling. Treatment with Fas ligand or antibody stimulated Fas aggregation, conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain, and ultimately the complex DISC (30Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar, 31Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of GMEB1 on Fas antibody-induced DISC formation, HeLa K cells were treated with 50 ng/ml CH11 for a variable amount of time (Fig. 4C). Fas was immunoprecipitated with anti-mouse IgM antibody, and then the precipitates were examined by Western blot analysis with anti-FADD and anti-caspase-8 antibodies. FADD was weakly associated with Fas 5 min after treatment, peaked at 15 min, and gradually decreased thereafter. Caspase-8 was significantly appeared within the DISC 15 min after stimulation in mock-transfected cells. Although there was also an association between FADD and Fas in GMEB1-transfected cells, caspase-8 was not observed within the DISC in these cell types (Fig. 4C), suggesting that GMEB1 disrupts the interaction of FADD and caspasse-8, but not that of Fas and FADD. Therefore, it is likely GMEB1 inhibits caspase-8 activation and subsequent apoptosis in response to Fas antibody via prevention of DISC formation by binding to the DED domain in procaspase-8. GMEB1 Inhibits the Enzymatic Activity of Caspases in Vivo and in Vitro—To further determine whether the inhibitory mechanisms of GMEB1 depended on the inhibition of caspase activation, we measured the cleavage of the caspase peptide substrates IETD (for caspase-8), LEHD (for caspase-9), DEVD (for caspase-3 and -7), and VDVAD (for caspase-2). HeLa K cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody for 4 or 8 h, and caspase activation was measured in the cytosolic extracts. A significant level of Fas-mediated caspase activation was observed in mock-transfected HeLa K cells, whereas this activation was lower in GMEB1-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Because these results were performed with the lysates prepared from cells overexpressing GMEB1, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of GMEB1 using recombinant GMEB1 protein in a cell-free system. There have been reports that the addition of cytochrome c into lysates stimulated caspase activation through caspase-9 (9Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 32Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). In this study, the addition of cytochrome c to detergent extracts prepared from 293T cells caused a rapid increase in the peptide-specific protease activity in vitro. The recombinant GMEB1 protein dramatically reduced the cytochrome c-dependent protease activity of the LEHD-, DEVD-, and VDVAD-specific enzymes (Fig. 5B). Changes in Sensitivity to Hypoxia in GMEB Knockdown Cells—As GMEB1 has been implicated in the regulation of caspase activity and the subsequent apoptosis, we investigated the effect of reducing the level of endogenous GMEB1 in cells by using siRNA. The knockdown of GMEB1 accelerated the appearance of apoptotic cells in response to not only hypoxic stress but also TNF-α (Fig. 6). Mice That Express Human GMEB1 Specifically in Neurons—To limit the expression of GMEB1 to neuronal cells in vivo, human HA-tagged GMEB1 cDNA was ligated to the NSE promoter. Total RNA and cell lysates were prepared from the brains of transgenic offspring and were analyzed for the expression of GMEB1 protein by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Six mouse lines expressed high levels of human GMEB1 mRNA (data not shown). Among these six lines, the level of GMEB1 expression in the brain was highest in line 36 (Fig. 7), and these mice were used for subsequent experiments. Attenuation of Brain Infarction and Swelling in GMEB1-expressing Transgenic Mice—To test the function of GMEB1 in neuronal cells, we performed MCA occlusion in 9 transgenic and 11 wild-type mice. The mice were scored for neurological damage at 30 min and 24 h after occlusion. There were no significant differences in the neurological scores between the wild-type and GMEB1-transgenic (TG) mice. However, neurological damage was somewhat prolonged in wild-type mice as compared with the TG mice, which showed signs of improvement by 24 h after the occlusion (Table 1). At 24 h, the mice had developed infarcts affecting the cortex and striatum. The area and volume of the infarcts were smaller in GMEB1-TG mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 8, A-E). Brain swelling at 24 h after the occlusion was 45.2 ± 4.0% in wild-type mice and 26.1 ± 5.2% in GMEB1-TG mice (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the other physiological parameters measured (body temperature, arterial blood pressure, pO2, pCO2, pH, and plasma glucose) between the wild-type and GMEB1-TG mice. To test whether the in vivo protective effect of GMEB1 could be explained by the inhibition of caspase activation, we investigated the effect of Z-VAD-FMK, a general caspase inhibitor, on infarct and swelling formation, and the activity of both caspase-8 and -9 in wild-type and GMEB1-TG mice. As shown in Fig. 8, F and G, the inhibitor significantly decreased both infarct and swelling formation in wild-type, but had little to no effect on GMEB1-TG mice. Ischemia led to increased activity of both caspase-8 and -9 in the ipsilateral hemisphere, but not in the contralateral hemisphere. The activation of these caspases was significantly lower in GMEB1-TG mice (Fig. 8H).TABLE 1Neurological scores in wild-type mice and GMEB 1 transgenic mice 30 min and 24 h after MCA occlusionTreatment (time after reperfusion)nNeurological scoreaNeurological grading: 0, no neurological deficits; 1, failure to extend the right forepaw; 2, circling to the contralateral side; 3, loss of walking or righting reflex.Mean ± S.E.0123Wild-type mice (30 min)904501.6 ± 0.18GMEB 1 transgenic mice (30 min)1104701.6 ± 0.15Wild-type mice (24 h)902342.2 ± 0.28GMEB 1 transgenic mice (24 h)1114421.6 ± 0.28a Neurological grading: 0, no neurological deficits; 1, failure to extend the right forepaw; 2, circling to the contralateral side; 3, loss of walking or righting reflex. Open table in a new tab The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether GMEB1 functions as an anti-apoptotic protein. In a previous study, we reported that GMEB1 could bind to procaspase-2 and inhibit caspase-2-dependent apoptosis (14Tsuruma K. Nakagawa T. Shirakura H. Hayashi N. Uehara T. Nomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that GMEB1 also interacts with procaspase-8 and -9, suggesting that GMEB1 interacts with pro-form initiator caspases such as procaspase-2, -8, and -9. The complete DED domain of procaspase-8 and the CARD domain of procaspase-9 were required for the interaction with GMEB1 (Fig. 1). The C-terminal region of GMEB1, which contains a putative α-helical coiled-coil domain (amino acid sequence 375-563), was required for GMEB1 to bind to procaspase-8 and -9 (Fig. 1C). This is the same region previously shown to be required for binding to procaspase-2. The GMEB1 protein lacks DED, CARD, and BIR domains, but has the putative α-helical coiled-coil domain in its C-terminal, which is critical for its interaction with procaspases. Acidic amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of GMEB1 may be important for its binding to procaspases, similar to the requirement for acidic amino acids in the CARD domains of procaspase-2 and the adaptor protein RAIDD for their interaction with each other (34Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that GMEB1 interacts with both procaspase-8 and -9, but not procaspase-7 (an effector caspase), in resting mammalian cells (Fig. 2). Based on these findings, we conclude that endogenous GMEB1 can bind to initiator procaspases in quiescent cells. GMEB1 expression attenuated apoptosis in response to the Fas ligand in HeLa K cells. Fas-stimulated caspase activity was also significantly abrogated by GMEB1 expression (Fig. 5A). Moreover, we demonstrated that GMEB1 abrogates the appearance of caspase-8 within DISC that forms in response to anti-Fas mAb in HeLa K cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that GMEB1 overexpression prevents the activation of certain initiator caspases by hindering complete DISC formation in response to Fas-mediated signals by interacting with their prodomains. In addition, consistent with this conclusion, in vitro cytochrome c-induced caspase activity in a cell-free system was significantly reduced in the presence of recombinant GMEB1 (Fig. 5B). Thus, GMEB1 seems to bind to the prodomains of initiator caspases in vivo and in vitro, thereby inhibiting the activation of these caspases and the downstream effector caspases. However, we did not propose direct evidence of how GMEB1 disrupts the caspase activation by addition to cytochrome c. In this regards, caspase-9 activated by cytochrome c may stimulate downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -7, and -2. Unfortunately, we could not determine the effect of GMEB1 on apoptosome formation including procaspase-9, Apaf-1, and dATP. It is of interest to elucidate whether GMEB1 suppresses apoptosome formation induced by apoptotic stimuli or cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We previously found that the level of endogenous GMEB1 decreased during hypoxia-induced apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner (14Tsuruma K. Nakagawa T. Shirakura H. Hayashi N. Uehara T. Nomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that GMEB1 itself is not a substrate for caspases. The lack of cleavage sites for caspases in the GMEB1 structure also suggests that other proteinases are responsible for the decrease in GMEB1 during apoptosis. The knockdown of endogenous GMEB1 protein using siRNA rendered the cells more sensitive to hypoxic stress and TNF-α treatment (Fig. 6), indicating that a lack of interaction between GMEB1 and procaspases accelerates procaspase oligomerization and subsequent autoactivation. To confirm the function of GMEB1 in vivo, we created a transgenic mouse that constitutively expresses human GMEB1 in neurons. The GMEB1-TG mice suffered less neuronal tissue injury than the wild-type mice, further suggesting that GMEB1 functions as an endogenous regulator of caspase activation (Figs. 7 and 8). Many reports have shown that neuronal cell death is characterized by apoptosis or necrosis (35Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar, 36Lipton P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1431-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). In this study, we detected a significant increase in caspase-8 and -9 activation in response to focal ischemia in vivo. However, the activities toward caspases were partially attenuated in GMEB1-TG mice. Furthermore, treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not completely block infarction and swelling formation by focal cerebral ischemia. These findings suggest that there might be two pathways leading to neuronal cell death: one that is caspase-dependent and GMEB1-sensitive, and another that is caspase-independent and therefore GMEB1-insensitive. In this regard, a caspase-dependent pathway may trigger apoptosis-like cell death whereas a caspase-independent pathway might lead to necrosis-like death. However, the amino acid sequence 412-563 in GMEB1 is sufficient for the expression of intrinsic transactivation activity (37Chen J. Kaul S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22053-22062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the C terminus 373-563 containing the transactivation domain is critical for interactions with procaspase, suggesting that this C terminus may function as both a transcriptional factor and a procaspase inhibitor through binding. In addition, HSP27 also interacts with GMEB1 via the transactivation domain (38Theriault J.R. Charette S.J. Lambert H. Landry J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding region of GMEB1 and GMEB2, glucocorticoid receptor, or cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is different from that in procaspase or HSP27. We have shown here that the deletion mutant of GMEB1 lacking the putative binding site to procaspases does not suppress Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it is likely that the C-terminal region of GMEB1 may function as both transactivation domain and a procaspase- or HSP27-binding domain. Because GMEB1 interacts with the molecular chaperone HSP27 in cytosol, and GMEB in cytosol solution prepared from hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) and PC12 cells bind GME in a gel-shift assay (39Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we concluded that at least some GMEB1 exists in the cytosolic fraction, giving it the ability to associate with procaspase and HSP27 and to participate in apoptosis. However, we do not exclude the possibility that GMEB1 overexpression may modulate caspase function via newly expressed proteins that are sensitive to transcriptional activity and thereby contribute to the inhibition of caspase activation. Although cytosolic GMEB1 may be involved in the attenuation of caspase activation via direct binding, how GMEB1 might block caspase activation via expressing new genes remains unknown. In summary, GMEB1 appears to be a novel regulator of initiator procaspase activation. This intrinsic protein interacts with several types of initiator caspases and thereby is capable of inhibiting the death signal triggered by apoptosis-inducing stimuli. GMEB1 is also expressed in cell lines derived from immunocytomas, which are associated with the Fas/Fas ligand system. Thus, this molecule may also be crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system. Because of its novel ability to inhibit the activation of initiator caspases, GMEB1 may also participate in various regulatory processes in concert with other regulating molecules such as FLIP (40Irmler M.

All sulfation reactions in all organisms require activated sulfate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), as a universal donor. In animals, PAPS is synthesized from ATP and inorganic sulfate by the bifunctional enzyme, PAPS synthase. In mammals, genetic defects in PAPS synthase 2, one of two PAPS synthase isozymes, cause dwarfism disorder, but little is known about the consequences of the complete loss of PAPS synthesis. To define the developmental role of sulfation, we cloned a Caenorhabditis elegans PAPS synthase-homologous gene, pps-1, and depleted expression of its product by isolating the deletion mutant and by RNA-mediated interference. PPS-1 protein exhibits specific activity to form PAPS in vitro, and disruption of the pps-1 gene by RNAi causes pleiotropic developmental defects in muscle patterning and epithelial cell shape changes with a decrease in glycosaminoglycan sulfation. Additionally, the pps-1 null mutant exhibits larval lethality. These data suggest that sulfation is essential for normal growth and integrity of epidermis in C. elegans.

Body and tissue morphologies are generated by orchestrated events of cell movements and cell shape changes at an appropriate time and place. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is an ideal model organism for the study of morphogenesis, embryos undergo a 4-fold increase in length and a 3-fold decrease in circumference without cell division after the cell proliferation phase (1Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The elongation process requires proper patterning and shape change of the epidermis (hypoderms) and body wall muscle cells adjacent to the hypodermis in C. elegans (2Simske J.S. Hardin J.

In the patterning and shape change of the hypodermis and the body wall muscle, both the basement membrane, which is positioned between them, and dynamic cytoskeletal changes play an important role (2Simske J.S.

On the other hand, the extracellular cuticle that surrounds the hypodermis contributes to the maintenance of the final shape of the worms after the elongation (1Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Sulfation, a common chemical modification of biomolecules, is critical for many biological processes. For example, sulfation of lipooligo-saccharide signals determines the symbiosis between the bacteria Rhizobium meliloti and alfalfa (4Roche P. Debelle F. Maillet F. Lerouge P. Faucher C. Truchet G. Denarie J. Prome J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1131-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, tyrosine sulfation of chemokine receptor CCR5 facilitates HIV entry (5Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H.

Proper sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; HS, heparan sulfate; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; DIC, differential interference contrast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; HS, heparan sulfate; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; DIC, differential interference contrast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. is required for interactions with several extracellular signaling molecules; therefore, disrupting the genes that encode enzymes mediating sulfation reactions causes dorso/ventral or segment polarity defects in Drosophila (7Sen J.

Furthermore, sulfation of several carbohydrates also plays important roles in nervous system development, particularly in axon guidance (12Lee J.S. Chien C.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All sulfation reactions in all organisms require 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as a donor. The formation of PAPS involves two catalytic reactions (13Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 681-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first reaction is carried out by ATP-sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.4), resulting in the formation of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS). The second reaction is carried out by APS kinase (EC 2.7.1.25), resulting in the formation of PAPS. Synthesized PAPS is translocated into the Golgi apparatus by the PAPS transporter (14Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); then several sulfotransferases transfer sulfate onto proteins and carbohydrates from PAPS. In animals, ATP-sulfurylase and APS kinase activity are performed by the bifunctional enzyme, PAPS synthase (16Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 703-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Venkatachalam K.V. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although in plants and in simple organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and yeast, the two enzymes are present on separate peptides. In higher organisms, including humans, mice, guinea pigs, and chickens, PAPS synthase exists as two isozymes, PAPSS1 and PAPSS2. However, there is only a single PAPS synthase in lower animals. Mutations in the PAPSS2 gene cause developmental dwarfism disorders: autosomal recessive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia in humans and brachymorphism in mice (18ul Haque M.F. King L.M. Krakow D. Cantor R.M. Rusiniak M.E. Swank R.T. Superti-Furga A. Haque S. Abbas H. Ahmad W. Ahmad M. Cohn D.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Kurima K. Warman M.L.

The disorder in brachymorphic (bm) mice is due to a glycine 79 to arginine (G79R) mutation in the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2, which fails to synthesize PAPS (19Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S.

A decrease in the formation of PAPS in cartilage in bm mice induces undersulfation of chondroitin sulfate, a major component of extracellular matrix in cartilage; chondroitin sulfate interacts with many extracellular matrix molecules, such as type II collagen. Subsequently, bm mice exhibit abnormalities in limb and axial skeletal length (21Orkin R.W. Pratt R.M. Martin G.R. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Orkin R.W.

Mutation in PAPSS2 does not cause lethality in mice, although PAPSS2 is inactive for PAPS synthesis in bm mice; in addition, expression of PAPSS1 is more ubiquitous than that of PAPPS2 (25Girard J.P. Baekkevold E.S. Amalric F. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Xu Z.H. Otterness D.M. Freimuth R.R. Carlini E.J. Wood T.C. Mitchell S. Moon E. Kim U.J. Xu J.P.

J. 2002; 365: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These facts indicate that PAPSS1 is the major PAPS synthase in mice; however, to date there have been no reports of genetic deficiencies in the PAPSS1 gene or in PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 knock-out mice. Also unknown are the exact cell types and molecular mechanisms of deficiencies resulted from PAPS synthase disruption. Gene knock-out studies of PAPS synthases will provide valuable information about the physiological roles of sulfation. However, as observed in bm and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, inactivation of PAPS synthesis would mainly cause defects in cartilage-containing chondroitin sulfate, one of the most abundant sulfated molecules, making it difficult to elucidate the physiological roles of other sulfated molecules in vertebrates (18ul Haque M.F. King L.M. Krakow D. Cantor R.M. Rusiniak M.E. Swank R.T. Superti-Furga A. Haque S. Abbas H. Ahmad W. Ahmad M. Cohn D.H. Nat.

A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Importantly, although chondroitin proteoglycans are the primary extracellular matrix components in C. elegans, as in higher organisms (28Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. Nomura K. Nature. 2003; 423: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), sulfated forms of chondroitin GAGs have not been detected by biochemical analysis (29Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as in vertebrates, heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are present in C. elegans, although they are not the major proteoglycans in the nematode (29Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The C. elegans genome contains a set of sulfotransferases (hst-1, hst-2, hst-3, and hst-6) involved in sulfation of HS in contrast to that of chondroitin sulfate. Although several reports have suggested that sulfation of HS plays a role in cell migration and axon guidance in C. elegans (31Bulow H.E. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 32Kinnunen T. Huang Z. Townsend J. Gatdula M.M. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Turnbull J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), little is known about how PAPS synthesis affects developmental processes. In this study, we show that a single C. elegans ortholog of the PAPS synthase gene pps-1 is present in the nematode genome and is expressed in the epidermis and several gland cells but not in neurons and muscles. Disruption of the pps-1 gene caused pleiotropic developmental defects and abnormality in patterning of muscles and shape change of epidermis. Our results showed for the first time that PAPS synthase is indispensable for normal growth and development and is involved in pattern formation and cell shape change of epidermis in C. elegans. Strains—Most of the nematode and Escherichia coli strains used were from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center. The deletion mutant strain tm1109 was isolated from pools of worms mutagenized by the UV/TMP method (33Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR screening and genotyping of the deletion allele were as follows: T14G10#F1 (5′-CCGCCTACCACTTCTTAGTA-3′), T14G10#R1 (5′-CCGTGCCAATCCTCGCATCT-3′), T14G10#F2 (5′-TGCCCACGTATCATATGCTG-3′), and T14G10#R2 (5′-AGCAGGATCACGTCCCACTA-3′). RNAi by Feeding—The protocol for RNAi by feeding was based on described methods (34Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0002)PubMed Google Scholar, 35Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone for T14G10.1 (pps-1) was amplified by PCR from total cDNA of N2 worms. Primers for the T14G10.1 cDNA were 5′-TGCTCACTCCACGGGATGAA-3′ and 5′-AGTTTGAGTTTTGTAGTGATTTGTAG-3′. A fragment of cDNA was cloned into the L4440 (pPD129.36) vector, and the cloned plasmids were transformed into E. coli HT115 (DE3). A single colony of HT115 (DE3) containing the plasmid was grown in LB culture medium for 8 h and seeded onto NGM agar plates (80 μl/plate), which were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Following the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (100 μl/plate), the cells were cultivated for 4 h to induce the expression of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). HT115 harboring the plasmid pPD129.36 without any insert was used as control. For the assay of PAPS synthase activity, mixed stage hermaphrodites were used, and for phenotypic characterization and the assay of lethality, L4 or L3 hermaphrodites were transferred on the plates, and dsRNA was introduced into the nematode by feeding. cDNA Cloning of C. elegans PAPS Synthase—The cDNA encoding the full open reading frame of C. elegans PAPS synthase (accession number NM_069456) was amplified by PCR from C. elegans cDNAs, which were prepared from large scale mixed stage culture of N2 worms (36Stiernagle T. C. elegans: A Practical Approach.in: Hope I.A. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 51-68Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-tttgtcgacATGCTCACTCCACGGGAT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-tttaagcttAGTTTGAGTTTTGTAGTG-3′ (reverse primer). The sequences shown by lowercase letters indicate appropriate restriction sites. The amplified cDNAs were digested with SalI and HindIII and cloned into pBluescript II SK(+). The plasmids were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The cDNA with the precise sequence was recloned into pQE-9-EK, which was prepared from pQE-9 (Qiagen) by insertion of an enterokinase cleavage site (DDDDK) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and two oligonucleotides, 5′-CCATCACCATCACGATGACGATGACAAAGGATCCGTCGACC-3′ and its complement. The resulting pQE-9-EK-PAPS was transformed using the E. coli M15 strain (Qiagen). LB medium (80 ml) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 0.8 ml of overnight culture of the transformants and then shaken at 30 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.0. After the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, the bacteria were cultured at 20 °C for 16 h and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was suspended in 10 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) (buffer A) and sonicated. A milliliter of 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added, and the mixture was kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (0.7 × 1.3 cm; equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). After washing with buffer A, the recombinant protein was eluted with 0.25 m imidazole, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.3 m NaCl (pH 8.0). Finally, 1.7 mg of the protein was obtained. Protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assay of PAPS Synthase Activity—Free [35S]sulfate was prepared from 2.5 MBq of adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (PAPS, 71.2 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by mild acid hydrolysis (0.5 ml of 0.02 n HCl, 100 °C, 15 min), followed by paper electrophoresis (pyridine/acetic acid/water = 3:1:387, pH 5.4). Adenosine 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (APS) was prepared from 2.5 MBq of [35S]PAPS using 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase beads (derived from bovine intestinal mucosa; 1280 units/g acrylic beads; Sigma) in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by paper electrophoresis. APS kinase activity was assayed according to the methods of Geller et al. (37Geller D.H. Henry J.G. Belch J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7374-7382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of the solution containing 16 kBq of [35S]APS, 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 40 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm disodium ATP (Grade II; Sigma) was mixed with 10 μl of enzyme suspension (lyophilized powders were suspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of ice-cold ethanol, and the mixture was immediately applied to paper electrophoresis with the same conditions as described above. The paper was scanned using a radiochromatogram scanner RITA Star (Straubenhardt, Germany). [35S]PAPS fractions were cut off and counted for the radioactivity. To determine APS kinase activities, mix staged pps-1 RNAi-untreated and -treated nematodes were harvested by washing and sucrose flotation as described (38Johnstone I.L. C. elegans: A Practical Approach.in: Hope I.A. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 201-225Google Scholar). Three hundred L4-staged tm1109 heterozygous and wild-type nematodes were placed on NGM agar plates with a lawn of OP50 E. coli cells by picking. They were cultured at 20 °C for 24 h and then harvested by washes. Because of the small amount, we omitted the sucrose flotation step that could cause loss of collected nematodes. Total PAPS synthase activity was assayed with the same conditions for APS kinase described above, except that 8.0 kBq of [35S]sulfate was used as a substrate instead of [35S]APS. Analysis of GAGs—GAGs were prepared from dried homogenates of wild-type or RNAi-treated nematode (dry weight 55 or 119 mg, respectively). GAG chains were released from the proteoglycan core proteins by the sodium borohydride treatment. It should be noted that the amount of HS in C. elegans was so small (28Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. Nomura K. Nature. 2003; 423: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) that 100 μg of shark cartilage chondroitin 6-O-sulfate (Seikagaku Corp.), which contained a negligible proportion of nonsulfated disaccharides, was added as a carrier after the borohydride treatment but before the purification steps. The unsaturated disaccharides were produced by digestion with chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparitinases I and II, and then the digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (28Mizuguchi S.

Phenotypic Analysis—We determined the extent of lethality of the pps-1 mutant by picking late L4 heterozygous strains to separate plates, allowing them to lay eggs for 24 h, and transferring them to a new plate daily for the next 3 days. Eggs unhatched after 20, 24, and 40 h were scored as embryonic lethal at 25, 20, and 15 °C, respectively. Larvae that failed to develop into L4 or adult stage after 40, 46, and 96 h were scored as larval arrest/lethal at 25, 20, and 15 °C, respectively. To determine the embryonic phenotype of pps-1 RNAi, embryos were dissected from the adult animals that had had dsRNA introduced for the indicated time. The embryos were cultured for an additional 18 h in M9, and various phenotypes were scored. To determine the larval phenotype of pps-1 RNAi-treated animals, embryos were dissected from the adult animals that were fed with pps-1 dsRNA for 40 h. The dissected embryos were cultured for an additional 18 h in M9 and placed onto the dsRNA-expressing bacteria, and developmental stages were scored after 40 h. Phalloidin staining was performed as described previously (39Costa M. Draper B.W. Priess J.R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reporter Constructs and Transgenic Lines—The pps-1p::egfp and myo-3p::egfp translational reporter constructs were generated by PCR amplification of a 3249-bp upstream sequence of the pps-1 ATG using the primers 5′-TTTTTATCCCATTTGCCATT-3′ and 5′-CATGGTTATATAGGTAGTCCCACG-3′ and a 2453-bp upstream sequence of the myo-3 ATG using the primers 5′-GGCTGCAACAAAGATCAGGT-3′ and 5′-CATTTCTAGATGGATCTAGTG-3′, respectively; ligation into the XcmI-digested vector pFX_EGFPT (40Izumikawa T. Kitagawa H. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.H. Nomura K. Tamura J. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

The translational pps-1(FL)::egfp reporter construct was generated by PCR amplification of a 5495-bp genomic fragment, including the 3 kb of the potential promoter region. The fragment was amplified by PCR from C. elegans genomic DNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-TTTTTATCCCATTTGCCATT-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-GTTTGAGTTTTGTAGTGATTTGTAGTAG-3′) located just before the stop codon and ligated into the vector pFX_EGFPT as described above. The translational dpy-7p::dsred reporter was generated by PCR amplification of 428 bp upstream of the dpy-7 ATG using the primers 5′-TCGAAAGTCTCTCCGGTAGC-3′ and 5′-CATTTATCTGGAACAAAATGTAAG-3′, followed by ligation into XcmI-digested vector pFX_DsRedXT (40Izumikawa T. Kitagawa H. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.H. Nomura K. Tamura J. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53755-53761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using the TA-cloning strategy to fuse the coding sequence region of DsRed. PCR was carried out with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Germ line transformation was done as described by Mello et al. (41Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). The transgenic line was generated by injecting the experimental DNA at a concentration of 10-100 μg/ml into the distal gonads. Transgenic lines containing reporter constructs were isolated. Live transgenic worms were anesthetized with a 10 mm sodium azide solution, placed on an 8-well printed microscope slide glass (Matsunami Glass), and examined using four-dimensional microscopy (a DMRXA full automatic microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent optics; Leica) as described (28Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. Nomura K. Nature. 2003; 423: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The images were processed using MetaMorph software (version 6.1r5; Universal Imaging). Identification and PAPS Synthase Activity of C. elegans PPS-1—A data base search of the complete C. elegans genome sequence revealed the presence of only one PAPS synthase homolog pps-1 (T14G10.1) on chromosome IV. The predicted pps-1 gene product consists of 652 amino acid residues and shows 57% identity both with the human PAPSS1 and PAPSS2a at the amino acid level. PPS-1 has a putative nuclear localization signal sequence at the N terminus. The APS kinase domain (Pfam: PF01583) and ATP sulfurylase domain (Pfam: PF01747) occupy one-third of the N terminus and two-thirds of the C terminus of the sequence, respectively. The APS kinase domain contains a nucleotide-binding P-loop motif (GXXGXGK(S/T)) that is a critical site in APS kinase activity of mammalian PAPS synthases. On the other hand, the ATP sulfurylase domain has another type of nucleotide binding motif, HXGH, required for ATP sulfurylase activity of mammalian PAPS synthases (Fig. 1A) To assess biochemically whether the protein encoded in the PAPS synthase gene could synthesize PAPS from free sulfate and ATP, we isolated the cDNA and expressed the protein in E. coli M15 cells. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified recombinant protein showed one band with a molecular mass of 73 kDa (Fig. 1B). Using [35S]sulfate and [35S]APS, we assayed total PAPS synthase and APS kinase activities, respectively. [35S] PAPS was produced in both assays (Fig. 1, C and D). Specific activities of the protein for total PAPS synthase and APS kinase were 0.80 nmol/min/mg protein and 63 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. It should be noted that in the total PAPS synthase assay, an intermediate product, [35S]APS, was scarcely detected, suggesting that APS produced from sulfate and ATP was quickly converted to PAPS. pps-1 Reporter Constructs Are Widely Expressed in Epidermal Cells and Gland Cells, but Not in Muscle Cells and Neurons, and Are Predominantly Localized to the Nucleus—To determine the expression pattern of pps-1, two different types of pps-1 genomic fragments were cloned into a reporter gene vector. Because the PCR product that contained the 3-kb sequence from the predicted ATG was sufficient to rescue the lethality of the pps-1 mutant (see below; Table 1), the same 3-kb region was cloned into the reporter vector as the promoter-reporter construct pps-1p::EGFP. On the other hand, the 5-kb sequence upstream from the predicted stop codon that contains both the promoter and open reading frame sequence was cloned into the reporter vector as a translational fusion construct, pps-1(FL)::EGFP (Fig. 1E). The pps-1p::EGFP reporter is widely but tissue-specifically expressed in somatic cells. pps-1p::EGFP is strongly expressed in seam cells (Fig. 2, A, H, and H′), gland cells (Fig. 2B), and neuronal support cells (amphid sheath cells; Fig. 2, C-C″) throughout development. Relatively weak expression was also detected in the hypodermis (Fig. 2D) and the phasmid support cells during larval development. Additionally, weak expression was observed in the intestine at the adult stage (Fig. 2, E and E′). Unexpectedly, no signal was found in the neurons and muscles.TABLE 1The pps-1 null phenotype is a lar"
https://openalex.org/W2054276883,"Abstract The lipid A and core regions of the lipopolysaccharide in Rhizobium leguminosarum, a nitrogen-fixing plant endosymbiont, are strikingly different from those of Escherichia coli. In R. leguminosarum lipopolysaccharide, the inner core is modified with three galacturonic acid (GalA) moieties, two on the distal 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) unit and one on the mannose residue. Here we describe the expression cloning of three novel GalA transferases from a 22-kb R. leguminosarum genomic DNA insert-containing cosmid (pSGAT). Two of these enzymes modify the substrate, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IV2 and its 1-dephosphorylated derivative on the distal Kdo residue, as indicated by mild acid hydrolysis. The third enzyme modifies the mannose unit of the substrate mannosyl-Kdo2-1-dephospho-[4′-32P]lipid IV2. Sequencing of a 7-kb subclone derived from pSGAT revealed three putative membrane-bound glycosyltransferases, now designated RgtA, RgtB, and RgtC. Transfer by tri-parental mating of these genes into Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, a strain that lacks these particular GalA residues, results in the heterologous expression of the GalA transferase activities seen in membranes of cells expressing pSGAT. Reconstitution experiments with the individual genes demonstrated that the activity of RgtA precedes and is necessary for the subsequent activity of RgtB, which is followed by the activity of RgtC. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and gas-liquid chromatography of the product generated in vitro by RgtA confirmed the presence of a GalA moiety. No in vitro activity was detected when RgtA was expressed in Escherichia coli unless Rhizobiaceae membranes were also included."
https://openalex.org/W1994945217,"We investigated the dynamics of DNA binding of replication initiation proteins during formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) on plasmids in Xenopus egg extracts. The pre-RC was efficiently formed on plasmids at 23 °C, with one or a few origin recognition complex (ORC) molecules and ∼10–20 mini-chromosome maintenance 2 (MCM2) molecules loaded onto each plasmid. Although geminin inhibited MCM loading, MCM interacted weakly but stoichiometrically with the plasmid in an ORC-dependent manner, even in the presence of geminin (with ∼10 MCM2 molecules per plasmid). Interestingly, DNA binding of ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 was significantly stabilized in the presence of geminin, under which conditions ∼10–20 molecules each of ORC and CDC6 were bound. Moreover, a similarly stable ORC-CDC6-CDT1 complex rapidly formed on DNA at lower temperature (0 °C) without geminin, with ∼10–20 molecules each of ORC and CDC6 bound to the plasmid, but almost no binding of MCM. However, upon shifting the temperature to 23 °C, most ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 molecules were displaced from the DNA, leaving about one ORC molecule on the plasmid, whereas ∼10 MCM2 molecules were loaded onto each plasmid. Furthermore, it was possible to load MCM onto DNA when the isolated ORC-CDC6-CDT1-DNA complex was mixed with purified MCM proteins. These results suggest that an ORC-CDC6-CDT1 complex pre-formed on DNA is directly involved in MCM loading and imply that each DNA-bound ORC molecule loads only one or a few MCM2–7 complexes during metazoan pre-RC formation.

DNA replication in eukaryotes is initiated through the coordinated actions of replication initiation proteins. Previous studies have identified the proteins that are involved in the initiation step and an outline of the mechanism of DNA replication initiation in eukaryotic cells has been described (1Bell S.P.

In brief, the origin recognition complex (ORC), 2The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance; pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; LSS, low speed supernatant. 2The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance; pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; LSS, low speed supernatant. which consists of six subunits (ORC1–6), binds to DNA and then, in cooperation with CDC6 and CDT1, loads the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) 2–7 protein complex onto DNA to form a specific protein-DNA complex; the so-called pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). The pre-RC is formed in a cell cycle-regulated manner that involves geminin, a cell cycle-regulated protein that acts as an inhibitor of MCM loading (2Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Subsequent activation of the pre-RC is required for unwinding of the DNA around the origin and the start of DNA synthesis (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

ORC and most other initiation proteins are well conserved in various eukaryotic species (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC binds specifically to the autonomously replicating sequence, a DNA sequence functioning as a replicator in DNA replication (12Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe ORC contains AT-hook motifs within the ORC4 subunit and thus binds preferentially to A/T-rich sequences that are common in S. pombe origins (13Chuang R.Y. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, ORC in metazoans such as humans, Drosophila, and Xenopus does not exhibit sequence specificity in its DNA binding (14Vashee S. Cvetic C. Lu W. Simancek P. Kelly T.J. Walter J.C.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These differences in sequence specificity of ORC-DNA binding partly reflect the different organization of replication origins in the genomes of these species. ORC1, -4, and -5, CDC6, and MCM2–7 are all members of the AAA+ ATPase family (20Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been proposed that ORC2 and -3 also belong to this family (22Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that ATP binding and hydrolysis by the ORC subunits and CDC6 are necessary for pre-RC formation (23Klemm R.D. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. cerevisiae ORC and CDC6 cooperatively bind to autonomously replicating sequence in an ATP-dependent manner, and it has been suggested that the ORC interaction with both CDC6 and autonomously replicating sequence activates ORC, leading to pre-RC formation (22Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of pre-RC formation remains obscure. During and after pre-RC activation, the MCM2–7 complex is thought to function as a DNA helicase at the origin and also at the replication fork during elongation (30Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

Based on the crystal structure of an archaeal MCM homohexamer and electron microscopic analyses of the S. pombe MCM2–7 complex and the human MCM4-6-7 sub-complex, MCM2–7 and the MCM4-6-7 sub-complex are thought to form a ring-shape structure (37Fletcher R.J.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although mammalian MCM4-6-7 sub-complexes exhibit helicase activity (31Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 40You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the nature of the active form of the MCM complex during DNA replication remains unclear. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses of S. cerevisiae MCM have revealed specific association of MCM with both the origin and replication forks (32Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In contrast, MCM proteins appear to be widespread over chromatin before the onset of DNA replication in mammalian cells or Xenopus reconstituted nuclei (41Madine M.A. Khoo C.Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1270-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J.

Furthermore, MCM proteins are not colocalized with sites of DNA replication in nuclei of mammalian cells or in reconstituted nuclei in Xenopus egg extracts (42Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M. J.

Moreover, it has been shown that the MCM2–7 complex loaded onto chromatin is 20–40 times more abundant than ORC bound to chromatin before the onset of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts (45Mahbubani H.M. Chong J.P. Chevalier S. Thommes P. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 46Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A. Walter J.C.

Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These contradictory observations for metazoan MCM proteins, referred to as the “MCM paradox,” suggest that the MCM2–7 helicase is more than a simple DNA helicase (44Laskey R.A. Madine M.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Analysis of the in vitro assembly of S. cerevisiae pre-RC has suggested that ORC may load at least two MCM2–7 complexes at the origin (24Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 967-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). During pre-RC formation in Xenopus egg extracts, it has also been suggested that multiple copies of the MCM2–7 complex can be repeatedly loaded onto DNA once ORC is bound to the DNA (46Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A. Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33049-33057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how, in the presence of assembled nucleosomes, such multiple MCM2–7 complexes can be loaded and slide along DNA such that they are widely distributed over the chromatin. To obtain insights into the mechanism of metazoan pre-RC formation, in this study we analyzed de novo pre-RC formation on naked circular plasmids in Xenopus egg extracts, using an assay that we have recently developed. 3A. Zembutsu and S. Waga, manuscript in preparation. 3A. Zembutsu and S. Waga, manuscript in preparation. We found that the ORC-CDC6-CDT1-DNA complex is significantly stabilized if the subsequent MCM loading step is inhibited by either the addition of geminin or incubation at decreased temperature. Under these MCM-inhibitory conditions, multiple copies of ORC and CDC6 were bound to each plasmid, but upon MCM loading the ORC-CDC6-CDT1-DNA complex dissociated, leaving multiple copies of MCM complexes and only one or a few ORC molecules on each plasmid. The estimated numbers of these proteins suggest that only one or a few molecules of MCM2–7 complexes are loaded per ORC-DNA binding event, and this provides the basis for discussion of a possible mechanism for loading of multiple MCM complexes in metazoans. Plasmids—pG5λ6.6 (11 kb) is a plasmid based on the pGEM-7Zf(+) plasmid (Promega). It contains five Gal4 binding sites, an adenovirus major late promoter, and a 6.6-kb λ DNA/HindIII fragment. pKS-EX (5 kb) is a pBluescript KS-based plasmid that contains a 2.2-kb Epstein-Barr virus ori P sequence (a gift from Dr. Masaki Shirakata, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). pBlueλ2.0 (5 kb) was constructed by inserting a 2.0-kb HindIII fragment of phage λ DNA into the HindIII site in pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). pKSλ7.2 (10 kb) was constructed by inserting a 7.2-kb BamHI fragment of λ DNA into the BamHI site in pBluescript KS(–). pEXλ6.6 (12 kb) was constructed by inserting a 6.6-kb HindIII fragment of λ DNA into the HindIII site in pKS-EX. These plasmids were purified using a Genopure Plasmid kit (Roche Applied Science) and used for preparation of the plasmid beads, as described below. Biotinylation of Plasmids and Binding to Superparamagnetic Beads—Circular plasmid DNA was biotinylated by photocoupling with Photoprobe (S-S) Biotin (Vector Laboratories), which has a cleavable disulfide bond in the linker arm. The photocoupling reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μg (200 μl in sterile water) of plasmid was mixed with 0.5 μg (0.5 μl) of photoreactive biotin, and the mixture was irradiated on ice for 10 min at a distance of 5 cm with a 365 nm UV lamp (8 watts). The mixture was then mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) and subjected to 2-butanol extraction to remove free photoreactive biotin. The biotinylated plasmids were precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA (∼0.25 mg/ml DNA), and stored at –20 °C. These plasmids (10 μg) were used for binding to 400 μg of streptavidin-Dynabeads M-280 (Dynal Biotech), with the binding reaction carried out with a Dynabeads kilobaseBINDER kit (Dynal Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding reaction (in a siliconized 1.5-ml tube) was performed overnight at 24 °C with constant gentle agitation. After binding, the beads were washed three times with 2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in the same washing buffer (10 mg/ml beads), and stored at 4 °C. Typically, ∼60 ng of circular plasmid was coupled to 10 μg of beads. Egg Extracts and Recombinant Protein—Xenopus eggs were obtained from a chorionic gonadotropin-injected female frog. The eggs were dejellied in 2% (w/v) cysteine and then rinsed three times in MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) (48Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Dejellied eggs were activated by incubating in 0.5 μg/ml calcium ionophore A23187 (in MMR) for ∼5 min at room temperature, and then rinsed five times in ice-cold XB (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), and 50 mm sucrose) (48Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Activated eggs were transferred in SW55 tubes (Beckman) that had previously contained 1 ml each of ice-cold XB supplemented with 100 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin, and then packed by centrifuging at 170 × g for 1 min. After excess buffer was removed, cycloheximide was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and eggs were crushed by centrifuging at 13,500 × g in an SW55Ti rotor (Beckman) for 15 min at 4 °C (crushing spin). The cytoplasmic fraction was collected and supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml cycloheximide, and then cleared by re-centrifuging as above. The cleared cytoplasmic fraction (referred to as the low speed supernatant: LSS) was supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of cytochalasin B, aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin and used immediately for experiments. The PEG-M fraction containing MCM2–7 was prepared by differential polyethylene glycol precipitation of LSS, as described previously (49Chong J.P. Thommes P. Rowles A. Mahbubani H.M. Blow J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 50Gillespie P.J. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of ORC in the egg extracts was achieved by treating the extracts twice (30 min each) with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to anti-ORC1 and anti-ORC2 antibodies. Polyhistidine-tagged, N-terminal-truncated Xenopus geminin (4McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) was bacterially expressed and purified using nickel-charged Chelating Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). N-terminal-polyhistidine-tagged Xenopus MCM2 was purified as described elsewhere (51Furukohri A. Sato N. Masai H. Arai K. Sugino A. Waga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of Xenopus MCM2–7 proteins from the egg extracts was carried out using anti-MCM2 antibodies, essentially as described previously (52Oehlmann M. Score A.J. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 53Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In brief, anti-MCM2 antibodies coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with the egg extracts (LSS) for 1 h at 4 °C.The beads were washed four times with LFB1 buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% sucrose) (49Chong J.P. Thommes P. Rowles A. Mahbubani H.M. Blow J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) containing 50 mm KCl but without dithiothreitol, and then MCM proteins were eluted from the beads with LFB1 containing 600 mm KCl (without dithiothreitol) at 4 °C and dialyzed against LFB3 (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) (49Chong J.P. Thommes P. Rowles A. Mahbubani H.M. Blow J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm KCl. Western blotting showed that the eluate contained all six subunits of MCM2–7 but a relatively low amount of MCM2 was recovered (data not shown).

In particular, protein-bound plasmid beads such as those formed after incubation with egg extracts should not be mixed or withdrawn using a micropipette tip. Typically, 40 μg of plasmid beads (equivalent to ∼240 ng of plasmid in 4 μl) were withdrawn from the stock using a wide-bore tip and directly mixed with 100 μl of ice-cold XB supplemented with 0.002% Nonidet P-40 in a standard 1.5-ml tube. After brief gentle agitation, the beads were separated using a magnet. The beads were then mixed with 25 μl of egg extracts supplemented with 0.002% Nonidet P-40 (54Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and an ATP-regenerating system (20 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP, and 6.3 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The reaction mixture was immediately agitated to disperse the beads uniformly by gently tapping a tube (avoid foaming) and incubated for the indicated times at 23 °C with occasional gentle agitation. After incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted with 150 μl of ice-cold XB supplemented with 0.002% Nonidet P-40 and gently mixed by tapping a tube. The beads were immediately separated on ice using a magnet and as much solution as possible was then removed. The beads were washed three times with 100 μl each of ice-cold XB with 0.002% Nonidet P-40. For Western blot analysis of proteins, the beads were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and treated at 100 °C for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Detection for Western blotting was done with a Chemi-Lumi One detection kit (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). For quantifying the amounts of ORC1, ORC2, CDC6, and MCM2, each recombinant protein was expressed and purified using bacterial expression vectors for ORC1 (55Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and ORC2 (this study) and recombinant baculoviruses for CDC6 (56Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and MCM2 (51Furukohri A. Sato N. Masai H. Arai K. Sugino A. Waga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and each recombinant protein was then used as a standard in quantitative Western blot analyses of the proteins bound to plasmid beads. The analysis of the proteins bound on sperm chromatin was performed with 2000 demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei per microliter of egg extracts as described previously (51Furukohri A. Sato N. Masai H. Arai K. Sugino A. Waga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have recently developed conditions for analyses of both pre-RC formation and DNA replication on circular plasmids in Xenopus egg extracts. In brief, a biotinylated circular plasmid is coupled to streptavidin-paramagnetic beads and used as a template for DNA replication in the egg extracts. We have confirmed that the pre-RC is formed on the circular plasmid in an ORC- and ATP-dependent manner and that DNA synthesis occurs in a pre-RC-dependent manner following nuclear formation.3 To gain further insights into the mechanism of metazoan pre-RC formation, we analyzed pre-RC formation in Xenopus egg extracts using this newly developed approach. Egg extracts were first mixed with increasing amounts of geminin and tested for pre-RC formation on various kinds of plasmids. On 11-kb plasmid (pG5λ6.6)-coupled beads, loading of MCM3 and MCM6 was inhibited by geminin at 0.5 μg/ml or greater (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6); these geminin inhibitory concentrations are in agreement with previous results on a sperm chromatin template (4McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of ORC1, ORC2, CDC6, and CDT1 to the plasmid beads was significantly increased at the same geminin concentrations, compared with that in the absence of geminin or at geminin concentrations below 0.3 μg/ml, at which MCM is loaded onto DNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–6). None of the proteins bound to beads without coupled plasmids (see Fig. 2C). It should be noted that DNA binding of ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 increased relatively sharply, not gradually, as the geminin concentration increased (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2MCM binds to plasmid beads even at higher geminin concentrations, but the binding is unstable and distinct from that in the pre-RC. A, pBluescript-coupled beads were incubated in LSS supplemented with increasing amounts of geminin, and the beads were then washed with the buffer supplemented with (lanes 7–12) or without 0.25% Triton (lanes 1–6). B, after incubation in LSS supplemented with or without 2 μg/ml geminin as in A, the beads were washed at 0 °C (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or at room temperature (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), using the buffer supplemented with (lanes 5–8) or without Triton (lanes 1–4). C, pBluescript-coupled beads (lanes 3–8) or beads alone (lanes 1 and 2) were incubated in the ORC-depleted (lanes 3 and 4) or mock-depleted LSS (lanes 1, 2, and 5–8) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml geminin, and the beads were then washed with the buffer supplemented with or without Triton at 0 °C as indicated. After washing, the proteins bound to the beads were detected by Western blotting with the antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With the pKS-EX (5 kb), pBlueλ2.0 (5 kb), and pBluescript (3 kb) plasmids, we unexpectedly found that MCM3 and MCM6 bound to the plasmids even in the presence of geminin concentrations of >0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 1, lanes 7–24). The amount of MCM bound to these plasmid beads did not significantly change in the absence and presence of geminin. In contrast, DNA binding of ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 was increased at higher geminin concentrations for all three plasmids (Fig. 1A), as illustrated for the pG5λ6.6 plasmid (see lanes 3–6). Because MCM binding to plasmid at higher geminin concentrations was also observed with other 10-kb and 12-kb plasmids (Fig. 1B), the plasmid size itself does not seem to be important. We are currently investigating why the 11-kb plasmid pG5λ6.6 behaves differently from the other plasmids with respect to MCM binding in the presence of geminin. MCM binding to plasmids at higher geminin concentrations (0.8 μg/ml or higher in Fig. 2A) was specifically disrupted by washing the beads with 0.25% Triton after incubation in egg extracts (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12), but MCM loaded at lower geminin concentrations (0.4 μg/ml or lower in Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9) was resistant to Triton treatment. MCM binding at higher geminin concentrations was also disrupted by washing with standard buffer (without Triton) at room temperature, instead of using ice-chilled buffer (Fig. 2B, lane 4), whereas MCM proteins in the pre-RC remained bound to the plasmid beads after washing at room temperature (lane 3). In contrast to the MCM proteins, neither Triton treatment nor washing at room temperature disrupted the increased binding of ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 at higher"
https://openalex.org/W2162230222,"Abstract The lipid A and inner core regions of Rhizobium leguminosarum lipopolysaccharide contain four galacturonic acid (GalA) residues. Two are attached to the outer unit of the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) disaccharide, one to the mannose residue, and one to the 4′-position of lipid A. The enzymes RgtA and RgtB, described in the accompanying article, catalyze GalA transfer to the Kdo residue, whereas RgtC is responsible for modification of the core mannose unit. Heterologous expression of RgtA in Sinorhizhobium meliloti 1021, a strain that normally lacks GalA modifications on its Kdo disaccharide, resulted in detectable GalA transferase activity in isolated membrane preparations, suggesting that the appropriate GalA donor substrate is available in S. meliloti membranes. In contrast, heterologous expression of RgtA in Escherichia coli yielded inactive membranes. However, RgtA activity was detectable in the E. coli system when total lipids from R. leguminosarum 3841 or S. meliloti 1021 were added. We have now purified and characterized dodecaprenyl (C60) phosphate-GalA as a minor novel lipid of R. leguminosarum 3841 and S. meliloti. This substance is stable to mild base hydrolysis and was purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Its structure was established by a combination of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and gas-liquid chromatography. Purified dodecaprenyl phosphate-GalA supports the efficient transfer of GalA to Kdo2-1-dephospho-lipid IVA by membranes of E. coli cells expressing RgtA, RgtB, and RgtC. The identification of a polyisoprene phosphate-GalA donor substrate suggests that the active site of RgtA faces the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. This work represents the first definitive characterization of a lipid-linked GalA derivative with the proposed structure dodecaprenyl phosphate-β-d-GalA."
https://openalex.org/W1963988769,"After agonist-induced internalization, the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) does not recycle to the plasma membrane. The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins initiate vesicular intracellular traffic by promoting the recruitment of adaptor proteins; thus, we sought to determine whether ARF6 could promote V2 R recycling. Neither the agonist-induced internalization nor the recycling of the V2 Rwas regulated by ARF6, but a constitutively active mutant of ARF6 reduced cell-surface V2Rs 10-fold in the absence of agonist treatment. Visualization of the ARF6 mutant-expressing cells revealed a vacuolar-staining pattern of the V2R instead of the normal plasmamembrane expression. Analysis of V2R maturation revealed that reduced cell-surface expression was due to the diminished ability of the newly synthesized receptor to migrate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi network. The same mechanism affected processing of the V1aR and acetylcholine M2 receptors. Therefore, ARF6 controls the exit of the V2 and other receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum in addition to its established role in the trafficking of plasma-membrane-derived vesicles.

The vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) 2The abbreviations used are: V2R, vasopressin V2 receptor; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; ARNO, ARF nucleotide binding site opener; AVP, arginine vasopressin; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LAMP1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; Tfn, transferrin; TfnR Tfn receptor; β-gal, β-galactosidase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily of receptors that are characterized by seven membrane-spanning domains (1Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W. Nature. 1992; 357: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). GPCR plasma membrane levels are maintained at a steady state by a combination of new receptor synthesis, proteolytic receptor degradation, physical sequestration from the plasma membrane, and recycling back to the plasma membrane (2Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Receptor removal from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment is typically induced by the application of agonist. V2Rs have been shown to internalize in clathrin-coated pits via a process that requires both arrestin and dynamin (3Bowen-Pidgeon D. Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Strikingly, upon agonist removal, the V2R does not recycle back to the plasma membrane even 6 h after agonist removal (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Regardless of the V2R expression levels in stable or transient lines or the cell line in which the receptor is expressed, the V2R still does not recycle. The receptor remains localized in an intracellular compartment, tentatively identified as the perinuclear recycling compartment, as determined by co-localization with established intracellular markers (5Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications also affect the expression and distribution of V2Rs. The palmitoylation of cysteines 341 and 342 in the carboxyl terminus of the V2R, although not essential for plasma membrane delivery, results in increased receptor abundance at the plasma membrane (6Sadeghi H. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the V2R, exclusively by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, resulted in receptor sequestration from the plasma membrane and trapping inside the cell (7Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After removal of the agonist, persistent phosphorylation accounted for the failure of the V2Rs to recycle to the plasma membrane (8Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Elimination of the phosphate acceptor sites resident in the V2R carboxyl terminus imparted recycling properties to these mutant receptor species (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Visualization of the phosphorylation-deficient V2Rs revealed their sorting to the same perinuclear compartment as the wild type receptor, but unlike the wild type V2R, their lower level of phosphorylation allowed them to recycle (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of proteins mediates various intracellular trafficking processes that involve membrane-bound organelles (9Nie Z. Hirsch D.S. Randazzo P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ARFs are small GTPases of ∼20 kDa in size that act as molecular switches. In the GDP-bound “off” state, ARFs are inactive, whereas when bound to GTP they are in the “on” state. Active, GTP-bound ARFs associate with membranes where they have effects on local lipid generation and actin rearrangement (10Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In general, ARFs exert their effects on cellular trafficking by recruiting coat proteins to membranes, activating lipid-modifying enzymes and modulating the actin cytoskeletal arrangement (11Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Of the six members in the ARF family, ARF1 has been the most extensively characterized to date. Whereas ARF1 is localized to the Golgi network, ARF6 was described to exclusively affect trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes (12Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Eng-Ooi C. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Specifically, ARF6 was shown to control a clathrin-independent recycling pathway that was dependent on the full ARF6 activation/inactivation cycle as well as phospholipid hydrolysis (13Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a GTPase-activating protein for ARF6, which catalyzed the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP thereby inactivating ARF6, reduced β2-adrenergic receptor internalization (15Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of ARF6 in the internalization of a GPCR. Point mutations of ARF6 have been generated to elucidate the localization and function of ARF6 in vivo. Using ARF1 as a model, substitution of glutamine with leucine at position 67 (Q67L ARF6) resulted in an ARF6 isoform that could not hydrolyze GTP and was, thus, constitutively active (16D'souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substitution of threonine with asparagine at position 27 resulted in an ARF6 that could not exchange GDP for GTP and was, thus, inactive. Even though much of the T27N ARF6 protein aggregates intracellularly, a sufficient level of T27N ARF6 localizes to the plasma membrane where it acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of ARF6 function by sequestering nucleotide exchange factors that activate ARF6 (17Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These tools have been used to examine the ARF6 dependence of cell-surface protein trafficking. It has been shown that Q67L ARF6 enhanced the rate and extent of recycling of the transferrin (Tfn) receptor as well as diminishing TfnR endocytosis (16D'souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). TfnRs have been used as models for vesicular and GPCR trafficking, and so it was interesting to determine whether ARF6 would play an analogous role in the trafficking of the V2R given the failure of this particular GPCR to recycle. In the absence of agonist application, Q67L ARF6 reduced cell-surface V2R number by more than 10-fold, although neither the agonist-induced internalization nor the recycling of the V2R was altered by the ARF6 constructs. This is contrary to what happens with the TfnR, whereby TfnR levels at the plasma membrane were enhanced 2-fold (16D'souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), but similar to the effect of Q67L ARF6 on acetylcholine M2 receptor expression (18Delaney K.A. Murph M.M. Brown L.M. Radhakrishna H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33439-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, while attempting to delineate the route(s) of V2R trafficking affected by ARF6, we found a role for ARF6 in GPCR maturation.

Balla (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293-T cells were transiently transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA using the CALPHOS™ mammalian transfection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h the cells were plated onto 24-well plates or 100-mm dishes and analyzed 24 h later. Immunoblot Analysis of V2R and ARF6 Expression—HEK 293-T cells were lysed by incubation in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris.HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing the Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). Lysis was achieved by drawing the cells through needles of decreasing gauge (20-25 gauge) fitted to a 1-ml syringe. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. After protein concentration determination, the supernatant was incubated with 2× sample buffer for 20 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The V2R was detected using a peptide-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (antibody 3) of the human V2R (7Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ARF6 was detected using an ARF6-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl region of ARF6 (19Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Trans-Blot semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose was blocked for 30 min in blotto (20 mm Tris.HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% powdered milk, 0.1% Tween 20) followed by incubation with primary antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed 3 times for 10 min in blotto and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 more 10-min washes in blotto, the proteins were visualized by ECL. Measurement of Receptor Binding—Transfected cells were plated onto 24-well plates that had been previously coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/well). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 20 nm [3H]AVP in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm CaCl2,and 2 mm MgCl2. After a 2-h incubation in the cold room, the binding mixture was removed by aspiration, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was added to extract radioactivity. After 30 min at 37 °C, the fluid from each well was transferred to a scintillation vial containing 3.5 ml of scintillation fluid. Nonspecific binding was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled AVP. Each experimental point was assayed in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 3-5 experiments. Flow Cytometry—V2R-expressing HEK 293-T cells stained with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-HA antibody (1:100) were examined on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) in the presence of propidium iodide to exclude cells that had lost their membrane integrity. Cells were excited at 488 nm, and the Alexa 488 and propidium iodide fluorescence were detected at 530 and >650 nm, respectively. Ten thousand viable cells were examined per sample and analyzed using CellQuest software. An analysis gate was set on the control cells to determine the number of cells that exhibited a decrease in V2R expression. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Transfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips, and if necessary, the requisite intracellular markers were added 24 h later. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C followed by 2 washes with 37 °C PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h followed by 3 washes for 10 min with PBS. The cells were then permeabilized with a solution of PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 0.2% gelatin. After incubation of the cells with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS. The cells were then incubated with the secondary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature followed by three 10-min washes with PBS. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in VectorShield™ mounting medium. Cells were then visualized at 22 °C using a Zeiss LSM 510UV confocal laser-scanning microscope using an oil 100× objective, numerical aperture of 1 (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The 488- and 543-nm line from the included argon ion laser were the excitation sources, and a 505-550-nm band-pass filter or 560-nm long-pass filter, respectively, were used for the emission. The software used for acquisition was Zeiss LSM510 Version 3.2 for Windows 2000, and for analysis, LSM Image Examiner (licensed) Version 3.2 for Windows 2000. Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Methionine/Cysteine and Immunoprecipitation of GPCRs—Proteins were labeled in 100-mm dishes using a modification of the method published by Keefer and Limbird (20Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. 48 h after transfection the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 100 μCi of 35S-Express protein-labeling mix was then added to each plate for 30 min at 37 °C (pulse). The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 37 °C PBS and returned to the incubator for the stated intervals (chase). The cells were rinsed and harvested in PBS, and the cell pellet from each plate was homogenized in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris.HCl pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS containing the Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture) by drawing the cells through needles of decreasing gauge (20-25 gauge) fitted to a 1-ml syringe. Cell extracts were clarified by mixing with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of pre-washed protein A-Sepharose. Pre-washed protein A-Sepharose was prepared by incubating the resin with 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in RIPA buffer for 1 h followed by 2 washes with RIPA buffer alone. The clarified extracts were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (21Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were then separated by incubating the mixture with pre-washed protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged, incubated 4 times for 4 min at room temperature with RIPA buffer, and recovered each time by centrifugation. Proteins were eluted with 80 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by exposing the dried gels to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax film at -70 °C. Densitometric analysis of the labeled bands was carried out using a ChemiDoc XRS gel-imaging system (Bio-Rad). Constitutively Active ARF6 Inhibits Cell-surface V2R Expression—We have previously shown that the mature wild-type V2R migrates as a diffuse band of 45-55 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels (21Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). This migratory pattern arises from both N- and O-linked glycosylation, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (22Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A V2R mutant in which asparagine at position 22 was changed to glutamine (N22Q V2R) lacks N-linked glycosylation and migrates as a focused band of 40 kDa. As previously reported, this receptor form is unaltered in its ligand binding affinity, second-messenger generation, and trafficking patterns (21Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the N22Q V2R was used as the wild-type V2R for this study to obtain sharper, better-resolved bands during protein electrophoresis. Published reports describing a role for ARF6 in the recycling of internalized endosomes to the plasma membrane led us to examine whether this small GTPase could promote the recycling of the V2R. For this purpose, cDNAs encoding wild-type, constitutively active (Q67L), or dominant-negative (T27N) forms of ARF6 were co-transfected with V2Rs in HEK 293-T cells. In the absence of any agonist treatment, coexpression of the V2R with Q67L ARF6 reduced the cell-surface levels of receptor by greater than 90% (Fig. 1A, left y axis), as detected by radioligand binding. After a 20-min incubation with a saturating concentration of agonist (100 nm AVP), neither the extent of endocytosis nor lack of recycling of the V2R was affected by expression of either T27N or Q67L ARF6 (data not shown). More modest reductions in V2R surface expression were observed when the V2R was co-expressed with either wild-type or T27N ARF6 (Fig. 1A). In the absence of any agonist treatment, co-expression of the V2R with either the wild-type or T27N (GDP-bound and, thus, inactive) ARF6 reduced surface receptors in whole cells by 42 ± 2 and 22 ± 8%, respectively. Both levels were significantly different (n = 3, p < 0.01, one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett's post-test) from control (that is, those transfected with the V2R and β-galactosidase (β-gal). This Q67L-mediated effect was not restricted to the Gs-coupled V2R, as the recycling-competent Gq-coupled V1aR was subject to similar regulation (Fig. 1A, left y axis). A similar ARF6 effect on the acetylcholine M2 muscarinic receptor cell-surface expression has been reported (18Delaney K.A. Murph M.M. Brown L.M. Radhakrishna H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33439-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Support for these results was obtained using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting analysis (Fig. 1A, right y axis). Here too, the proportion of viable cells showing fluorescence emanating from Alexa 488-labeled V2Rs was indistinguishable between the wild-type and T27N-transfected HEK 293-T cells. However, a clear difference was observed in the fluorescence intensity of the Q67L-expressing cells, which showed 33% of the intensity of control cells (Fig. 1A, right y axis). To examine whether ARF6 modified V2R synthesis, HEK 293-T cells transfected with the V2R plus the ARF6 constructs were lysed by hypotonic buffer, as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the aqueous extract obtained from this process was immunoblotted for the presence of the V2R (Fig. 1B) or ARF6 (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of the ARF6 constructs resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in ARF6 expression over control, untransfected cells. For the V2R, the mature 40-kDa form (arrow) and the 33-kDa precursor form (arrowhead) were detected in the cells co-transfected with the ARF6 constructs. As can be seen, there was a decrease in mature V2R expression in the presence of Q67L ARF6. The mature V2R form is the one responsible for [3H]AVP binding, and so reduced expression would have accounted for diminished ligand binding. Thus, the immunoblotting data were consistent with those obtained via radioligand binding and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting analysis. In the presence of Q67L ARF6, it was clear that there was a prevalence of the precursor form of the V2R and concomitant depletion of the mature form. This was in contrast to the other lanes whereby there were approximately equal levels of V2R expression in either form. Therefore, it appeared that the constitutively active Q67L ARF6 reduced the amount of mature V2R. These results were contrary to what happened with the prototypical model of recycling membrane proteins, the TfnR. The net effect observed was an increase of TfnR present at the plasma membrane unlike what we have observed (16D'souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Thus, we attempted to delineate the route(s) for this trafficking phenomenon. Intracellular Localization of the V2R in the Presence of Q67L ARF6—To determine whether the overexpressed V2Rs and ARFs interacted in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoprecipitation of the V2R gave the previously observed pattern of V2R expression whereby the Q67L ARF6 drastically inhibited V2R expression. When parallel samples were immunoblotted for the presence ARF6 (Fig. 2B), only the Q67L ARF6 mutant was found to be associated with the V2R. The association was stable for the duration of the immunoprecipitation as it was unnecessary to add cross-linkers to recover ARF6 Q67L from the V2R precipitate. As expected, visualization of the V2R when co-transfected with either wild-type or T27N ARF6 showed a predominantly plasma-membrane distribution (Fig. 3, A and G, respectively), as there was very little co-localization of cell-surface V2R and overexpressed wild-type or T27N ARF6 (Fig. 3, B and F, respectively). Endogenous ARF6 as well as overexpressed wild-type and Q67L ARF6 have been reported to have both an intracellular and plasma membrane distribution (12Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Eng-Ooi C. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the presence of the Q67L ARF6 (Fig. 3E), the V2R was observed in “vacuolar” structures (Fig. 3D) that were distributed in distinct cytoplasmic areas. These vacuolar bodies also contained the overexpressed Q67L ARF6, as evidenced by the yellow regions on the merged image (Fig. 3F). This vacuolar pattern induced by Q67L ARF6 has been observed as early as 18 h after transfection in Cos and HeLa cells (14Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and persisted for at least 48 h after transfection in HEK 293-T cells. By virtue of residing in the same compartment, this result lent support to the co-immunoprecipitation studies that had indicated an interaction between the V2R and Q67L ARF6.FIGURE 3Localization of overexpressed V2Rs and ARF6 constructs. Transfected HEK 293-T cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed and stained for overexpressed V2Rs and ARF6. V2Rs (A, D, and G) were visualized using an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-HA antibody (1:100). Overexpressed wild-type (WT) (B), Q67L (E), and T27N ARF6 (H) were visualized using a polyclonal antibody raised against ARF6 (1:500) and an Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100). The corresponding overlays (C, F, and I) are shown on the right-hand side. Scale bar,10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the nature of these vacuoles, co-localization studies using established intracellular markers were carried out. Intracellular Tfn accumulation (Fig. 4, B and E) was used to identify early and recycling endosomes (23Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Tfn uptake was efficient in untransfected cells as well as in those only expressing the V2R and β-gal (Fig. 4C). Cells coexpressing the V2R and Q67L ARF6 did not show any Tfn endocytosis (Fig. 4F). Neighboring untransfected cells internalized the Tfn, indicating that the Q67L ARF6 construct functioned as previously reported (16D'souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Other intracellular markers were used to identify localization of the V2R (Fig. 5, A, D, G, and J); that is, early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP1) to identify endosomes and lysosomes, respectively (23Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). To test if origin of the vacuoles was the plasma membrane, the localization of PLCδ1-PH-GFP fusion protein in HEK cells was examined. When expressed alone, the PLCδ1-PH-GFP protein was not only restricted to the plasma membrane as it has been shown in other cell lines but was also found in intracellular membranes (supplemental Images 1 and 2). In addition, V2R-containing “vacuoles” did not co-localize with either endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) (Fig. 5, B and E) or LAMP1 (Fig. 5, H and K), ruling out their identity as early/recycling endosomes or late endosomes/lysosomes. The lack of co-localization with recycling endosomes indicated that the V2R did not reside in a compartment from where it could be recycled to the cell surface.FIGURE 5Visualization of Q67L ARF6 vacuoles and intracellular organelle markers. HEK 293-T cells co-expressing either the V2R and β-gal or the V2R and Q67L ARF6 were fixed and stained for endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) (B and E at 1:100 dilution) or LAMP1 (H and K at 1:100 dilution). Alexa 568 anti-rabbit polyclonal (1:100) was used as the secondary antibody. The V2Rs (A, D, G, and J) were visualized using an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-HA antibody (1:100).

The Gates Foundation is funding high-risk research into new ways to improve health in developing countries, but ensuring that the fruits of these studies reach the people who need them most may be the biggest challenge of all. Several years ago, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates asked a simple question: Were enough of the world's brightest minds in science and technology directed at solving the daunting health problems of developing nations? Finding that the answer was no, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation set out to engage the scientific research community with a new funding initiative called the Grand Challenges in Global Health. In 2003, an illustrious international scientific advisory board identified a set of crucial scientific problems that must be solved in order to make real progress in preventing and treating diseases that kill millions of people every year in the developing world. These 14 Grand Challenges include developing vaccines that do not require refrigeration, designing antigens to provoke protective immunity, finding ways to control insect vectors of disease, inventing therapies to cure latent infections, and creating new health-assessment tools for regions lacking reliable recordkeeping or sophisticated laboratories. Last summer, after a long, rigorous, and highly competitive selection process, the Grand Challenges program awarded $436.6 million to 43 innovative research projects, to be carried out by investigators in 33 countries. The endeavor “is a great opportunity to allow people to think a little bit out of the box about some problems that are incredibly hard,” says Carol Dahl, director of global health technologies at the Gates Foundation in Seattle. The initiative is financed with a total of $450 million from the Foundation, $27.1 million from the Wellcome Trust, and $4.5 million from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The Grand Challenges effort is one of the most ambitious projects launched by the Gates Foundation to date. Since its inception in 1998, the charity has pledged more than $6 billion to improving global health. This new source of funding has dramatically pumped life—and optimism—into the long-parched landscape of research and development into diseases that primarily afflict the developing world, such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis as well as neglected tropical illnesses such as hookworm, schistosomiasis, and Chagas disease. Sponsoring research as well as disease prevention and treatment efforts, the Foundation has dedicated $1.1 billion to fighting AIDS/HIV, $640 million to combating malaria, and $900 million to tuberculosis. It has poured another $1.5 billion into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), a Geneva-based coalition that has delivered traditional and new vaccines to roughly 130 million youngsters—saving an estimated 1.7 million lives in more than 70 countries. Catalyzed by the Gates' largess, other nonprofit organizations and government agencies have joined the cause. Bill Gates has “made global health sexy,” says tropical diseases researcher Peter Hotez of George Washington University in Washington, DC, who is working on a vaccine to combat hookworm. The Grand Challenges program epitomizes the Gates Foundation's support of high-risk and large-scale research proposals that are unlikely to receive traditional kinds of funding. For example, molecular biologist Anthony James at the University of California, Irvine and his collaborators (from eight other universities and one biotechnology firm) are engineering transgenic mosquitoes with a $19.7 million grant, one of several funded approaches to Grand Challenge #7, which aims to prevent insect vectors from transmitting infectious diseases. The mosquito species they are studying is Aedes aegypti. This insect transmits a potentially fatal tropical pathogen called dengue virus that infects 50 to 100 million people each year worldwide and has caused serious epidemics in South-East Asia, islands of the Western Pacific, and South America. James, arbovirologist Kenneth Olson of Colorado State University, and their colleagues are engineering Aedes to express a synthetic gene construct that results in destruction of the dengue virus genome. Although still far off, the ultimate goal is to release the transgenic insects into the wild, enabling the gene to move through the native mosquito population and thus helping to break the disease transmission cycle. The core of the synthetic construct encodes a double-stranded RNA—designed by Olson's lab—formed by the sense and antisense sequences of a segment from the RNA genome of dengue virus serotype 2. When the double-stranded RNA is expressed in cells of the mosquito midgut, an innate immune response called RNA interference (RNAi) is activated that chops up the RNA genome of dengue virus ingested in an infected blood meal. In lab studies, the strategy appears to work, James says. Transgenic mosquitoes challenged with a dengue virus-infected blood meal exhibit only very low titers of the pathogen. The major hurdle now is finding a way to drive the synthetic gene through a wild-type mosquito population. The consortium is testing several methods. James' group is hitching the anti-dengue virus construct to a DNA element called a transposon that can move through the mosquito genome, potentially replicating itself many times with each reproductive cycle. To express the transposable elements in the mosquito germline (so that all generations of progeny carry the accompanying anti-dengue construct), and to prevent this genetic weapon from spreading into nontarget organisms, the scientists have linked a transposon called Mos1 to a species-specific mosquito promoter of nanos, a developmentally regulated insect gene. The transposition is activated in the mosquito embryo during early development, but only at one pole—where future egg and sperm will form. Putting it all together, the researchers are now transforming mosquitoes with the entire transposon-plus-anti-dengue construct and analyzing whether the “gene drive” is effective. Within 5 years, the research consortium hopes to take several varieties of their transgenic, dengue virus-fighting mosquitoes into greenhouse field studies in a tropical country where dengue fever is endemic. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not fund such ambitious bench-to-field projects, James says. Only Gates is “willing to take the gamble.” For the first time, a lack of resources isn't a barrier, he says. Another Grand Challenges goal is to surmount the major difficulty of delivering viable vaccines to people in the developing world where a break in the “cold chain” of refrigerators and cold boxes may lead to inactivation of vaccines. Abraham L. Sonenshein, a molecular geneticist at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, has come up with one possible solution. He is using a $5 million award to engineer a vaccine that is packaged in heat-resistant bacterial spores. Impervious to heat, cold, radiation, antibiotics, and low pH, “bacterial spores are just about the most resistant biological entities that we know, ” he says. Sonenshein and his collaborators are splicing vaccine antigens for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus into the genome of Bacillus subtilis so that the innocuous soil bacterium displays those proteins on its surface in its replicative phase or its spore phase, or both. The genetically engineered spores could be freeze-dried and stored in aluminum packets for years at any temperature. When needed, the spore vaccine could be mixed with water and given to people as a drink. In theory, following ingestion, some spores would adhere to the intestinal tract and would germinate, releasing bacteria capable of replication. The primary hurdle, says Sonenshein, will be to ensure that enough antigen is presented to intestinal cells to trigger a sufficiently strong immune response that creates protective immunity. Sonenshein and his colleagues are also working on a spore vaccine for rotavirus, a diarrheal infection that kills roughly 500,000 children worldwide each year. They hope to take their experimental vaccines into human clinical trials within 5 years. Meanwhile, another Grand Challenges team is using a $19 million grant to characterize the molecular basis of innate immunity against malaria, which kills more than 1 million people annually, most of them children in Africa. Young children who survive multiple infections of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum seem to acquire natural resistance to severe forms of the disease. A group led by Army physician Patrick Duffy, a researcher at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, will screen blood samples from 14,000 babies, young children, and adults in Tanzania to determine whether specific phenotypes of the P. falciparum parasite are responsible for severe childhood malaria. Using mass spectrometry and microarray analysis, the investigators will search for any unique parasite proteins that provoke an antibody response and then will examine whether individuals producing those antibodies are less susceptible to severe illness or death. “Once you know what protective immunity is, it provides a very economical pathway to determining what are the proteins that should be put into a vaccine,” says Duffy. To maximize the odds of achieving their research goals, principal investigators of Grand Challenges projects are required to stipulate milestones and timelines for their work. For-profit grantees are used to such planning exercises, but the academics found it “a little bit more challenging,” says Daniel Carucci, director of the Grand Challenges in Global Health at the Foundation of the NIH (FNIH). (The FNIH, an independent public charity that administers private grants to support NIH programs or other complementary research, is managing 21 Grand Challenges awards.) The grantees also must be prepared to ensure that any medicines or other health tools created with Grand Challenges money will be available at affordable prices to developing nations. The program “is definitely not about generating new knowledge in and of itself—it's about solving problems,” says Carucci. In a “global access strategy,” principal investigators are required to outline intellectual property ownership issues, licensing strategies, and potential commercial partners. Scientists can patent their work, but if they fail to make their inventions accessible to poor countries, their award contracts include fallback provisions, such as requiring the grantee to give the FNIH a license to fulfill the charitable mission, says Carucci. Some public health experts have criticized the Grand Challenges initiative for investing too heavily in speculative high-tech ideas. They say the funds could be used to help save more lives today by distributing existing medicines or helping to build clean water and sanitation systems or combating malnutrition. But others say that current treatments aren't enough, pointing to malaria's resurgence in recent decades because resistance to insecticides has developed in the mosquito vector that transmits the malaria parasite. “You need to use existing control tools that you have at hand, and be able to fold in the new ones over time,” says Hotez at George Washington University. Although some Gates grants do support health systems and infrastructure, the charity's general view is that governments bear primary responsibility for improvements in those areas. But Regina Rabinovich, the Gates Foundation's director of infectious diseases, acknowledges that the world's overall funding pie needs to grow to cover both basic health needs and future interventions. “It doesn't help to develop new drugs, vaccines or diagnostics if you can't use them,” Rabinovich says. In fact, assessments of the Gates-funded immunization campaign, GAVI, have underscored to global health experts the importance of investing in the health systems of developing countries. The vaccine alliance's experience holds significant implications for other global health initiatives, including the Grand Challenges program. This is due to the fact that new vaccines or medical treatments might eventually be distributed to developing countries through the GAVI system or through similar public-private partnerships. Launched in 2000 with $750 million of Gates seed money, GAVI rapidly provided 5-year grants to the neediest countries to purchase (through UNICEF) and deliver new and underused childhood vaccines. The innovative public-private partnership includes UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine makers, and governments of many industrialized nations that also contributed millions to the mission. With GAVI funds, countries have vaccinated 90 million children against hepatitis B; 14 million against Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), a major cause of meningitis and pneumonia; and 14 million against yellow fever. And basic vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus have reached 13 million extra youngsters. Thanks to GAVI and the Gates Foundation, “it's really a huge breakthrough that we are working toward a vision of the kids in poor countries having access to the same vaccines that my kids get,” says Ruth Levine, a health financing expert at the Center for Global Development (CGD) in Washington, DC. Despite these successes, analyses show the alliance has encountered some major difficulties on the ground. One study (funded by Save the Children UK) found that immunization efforts in developing countries were hindered by a shortage of some vaccines and by deep-seated weaknesses in health care infrastructure. These deficiencies included shortages of staff workers and transport vehicles, unreliable health information systems, and breakdowns in the vaccine cold chain. In his book Crusade to Immunize the World's Children, William Muraskin, a social historian at Queens College of the City University of New York, says the coalition imposed a vaccine-focused agenda on the health ministries of poor nations that didn't pay sufficient attention to their most urgent disease-fighting priorities. And although the alliance predicted that by the end of 5 years vaccine prices would drop and countries would be able to take over the costs of the hepatitis B and Hib vaccines—which in some cases doubled or tripled national immunization expenses—neither happened, says CGD's Levine. Given the situation, Muraskin questions how GAVI will succeed in its plans to introduce even pricier vaccines against rotavirus and pneumonia, or future vaccines against malaria, HIV, and TB. Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, WHO's director of immunization, vaccines, and biologicals and a former health official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, says that GAVI “has been successful on several fronts, and like any other thing, it also has some areas that need improvements.” He agrees that the coalition went in with “a bit too much of a top-down approach,” but it recently set up sound processes for receiving more input from the health ministries of developing countries. “GAVI is certainly taking the lessons forward,” Okwo-Bele says. For instance, GAVI is providing a second phase of financing to countries over a longer, 10 year term, with recipients paying a gradually increasing share of vaccine costs. It is also offering more funding to shore up basic health services at the district level, says GAVI executive secretary Julian Lob-Levyt. The Gates Foundation has demonstrated its continuing support with another $750 million award, and even more importantly, six nations have agreed to set up a financing mechanism that will raise $4 billion over a decade. As for sustainability, deciding to deny the world's poorest people the benefits of health because their nations will never have enough money to pay for new medicines is “not acceptable,” says Lob-Levyt. “We have to be much more ambitious.” Other Gates grantees are watching GAVI closely. At the Malaria Vaccine Initiative in Seattle, director Melinda Moree and associates have begun laying the groundwork to avoid similar problems when they bring a malaria vaccine to market, hopefully within the next decade. What worries Moree most isn't failure to create an effective treatment—it's inventing one that nobody could afford or get access to. “That would be the worst outcome,” she says. As the Gates Foundation's Rabinovich puts it, success is not defined as licensing a new drug; it is measured by actual impact on people's health. Ultimately, one of the biggest challenges is guaranteeing that any medical solutions designed for poor countries—whether through the Grand Challenges program or any other global health initiative—reach those who need them most."
