https://openalex.org/W1991609657,"Group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) of several different serological types were grown in fluorescein-labeled homologous type or group-specific globulins, thereby labeling the antigen-containing cell walls. Specific precipitation or inhibition of the labeled antibody, followed by continued incubation and examination at intervals by ultraviolet, phase, and dark-field microscopy, showed that new cell wall was then nonfluorescent. These nonfluorescent portions were differentiated by a reverse technique of culture in unlabeled globulin, followed by antibody precipitation, further growth, and fluorescent-antibody staining. This technique of differential labeling of cell wall has permitted following, for the first time in a living system, the fate of cell wall formed at different times. The results suggest that cell wall synthesis in actively growing cultures usually occurs simultaneously at at least two sites per coccus, each site representing stages in successive divisions, and that cell wall growth in Streptococcus pyogenes is not by diffuse intercalation with old wall, but is initiated at and extends both peripherally and centripetally from the coccal equator."

This finding has bearing on the biochemical mechanisms of drug-induced hemolytic anemia."

Heads which had regenerated in ribonuclease displayed a retention level equal to that of head and tail sections which had regenerated in pond water. However, tails regenerated in ribonuclease performed randomly although they could be retrained to criterion."

The plasma calcium fell 0.40 to 0.65 mg/100 ml within 20 minutes and then rose in the characteristic response to the parathyroid hormone. The hypocalcemic response was similar to that ascribed to the recently reported hormone calcitonin, and the data suggest that the extract may contain both."

https://openalex.org/W2046993119,"Since the responses to ""neurosympathomimetic amines"" are reduced in the reserpinized animal and restored by norepinephrine administration, it was postulated that norepinephrine might also affect the development of their tachyphylaxis. We found that norepinephrine infusion restored, at least partially, certain tachyphylactic responses to amphetamine or ephedrine and fully prevented the development of tachyphylaxis to tyramine."

https://openalex.org/W1974518231,"Chicks were imprinted with a bluish object, then tested with different spectral values ranging to yellow-green. A systematic decrement in following was related to the stimulus series, although there was considerable generalization to all test values, which increased during testing. These data lead us to question the ""irreversibility"" of imprinting."

https://openalex.org/W2083063553,"THE embryological appearance and derivation of the argentaffin cells (enterochromaffin) of the gastrointestinal epithelium in human beings remains somewhat obscure. Masson1, in 1928, stated that on the basis of his embryological work, the argentaffin cells appeared in the intestinal epithelium “about the fourth month of fœtal life in man” and arose directly from the entoderm. According to Masson these observations were confirmed by Parat, although no reference was cited."

Thus, LAF1 mice receiving two injections of urethane plus 500 rad of x-radiation prior to grafting retained C3H mouse skin grafts for periods up to 60 days, with a mean graft survival time of 40 days, as compared with 18 days for mice exposed to 500 rad only."
https://openalex.org/W2023658080,"Investigation showed that in a two-choice correction procedure the probability of an errorless response in those rats which have consistently made errors is not constant, as required by the all-or-none model, but increases with trials. Even an all-or-none model which provides for accidental error and accidental success is inadequate."

https://openalex.org/W2061908221,MANY workers have shown similarities between blood group substances and a variety of bacterial and non-bacterial antigens. Illchmann-Christ and Nagel1 found that anti-A antibody was removed from B and O sera by Staphylococci and reasoned that Staphylococci possessed an A-like receptor. This suggests that persons of blood group A may have an increased susceptibility to staphylococcal infection due to an inability to elaborate an antibody which may cross-react with their own red blood cells.

When the galactan was used in place of the standard particulate antigen in the complement-fixation test for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia2 with known positive sera, fixation of complement was usually weak or absent. As unheated normal bovine serum has been shown to potentiate complement-fixation with heated bovine3,4 and swine5 antisera, its effect on complement-fixation by the galactan–bovine antibody system was tested."

https://openalex.org/W2043816393,"EVIDENCE obtained in this laboratory1,2 suggested that the phosphorylation of creatine by a phosphoryl donor, catalysed by a soluble enzyme system from rat muscle, might not require adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Morrison and Doherty3 reach the opposite conclusion. Results obtained independently in this laboratory, by procedures already described1,2, lead us to agree with their conclusion."
