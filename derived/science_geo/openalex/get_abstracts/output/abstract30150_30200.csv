https://openalex.org/W1505517942,"This report describes the structural characterization of the recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 produced by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Enzymatic cleavage of rgp120 and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography were used to confirm the primary structure of the protein, to assign intrachain disulfide bonds, and to characterize potential sites for N-glycosylation. All of the tryptic peptides identified were consistent with the primary structure predicted from the cDNA sequence. Tryptic mapping studies combined with treatment of isolated peptides with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or with peptide:N-glycosidase F followed by endoproteinase Asp-N permitted the assignment of all nine intrachain disulfide bonds of rgp120. The 24 potential sites for N-glycosylation were characterized by determining the susceptibilities of the attached carbohydrate structures to peptide:N-glycosidase F and to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Tryptic mapping of enzymatically deglycosylated rgp120 was used in conjunction with Edman degradation and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of individually treated peptides to determine which of these sites are glycosylated and what types of structures are present. The results indicate that all 24 sites of gp120 are utilized, including 13 that contain complex-type oligosaccharides as the predominant structures, and 11 that contain primarily high mannose-type and/or hybrid-type oligosaccharide structures."
https://openalex.org/W1490400638,"The first fully repressible gene in fission yeast is described. In minimal medium it is highly transcribed producing a mRNA which is 50-100 times more abundant than the cyc1 mRNA. By contrast, in minimal medium supplemented with thiamine at a concentration of 0.5 microM or greater the transcript is undetectable. The gene has been called nmt1 (for no message in thiamine). The 5' and 3' ends of the transcript have been mapped and indicate an unspliced mRNA of 1.3 kilobases with no evidence of heterogeneity at either end. The single major open reading frame encodes a protein of 39 kDa. The gene product is most likely involved in thiamine biosynthesis and consistent with this is the observation that the nmt1::ura4 disruption strain is a thiamine auxotroph. The kinetics of transcriptional repression and induction have been studied. Addition of thiamine to log phase cells growing minimal medium results in complete disappearance of the nmt1 message within 3 h. Removal of thiamine from the medium produces the first detectable message after 10 h and maximal steady-state levels after 16 h. Nuclear run on experiments demonstrate that control is exerted at the level of transcription initiation. The nmt1 promotor has been subcloned, and thiamine-mediated transcriptional control has been transferred to the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1840979539,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) from rat liver membranes binds apoprotein E (apoE)-enriched rabbit beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) in a ligand blotting assay on nitrocellulose membranes. Binding was markedly activated when the beta-VLDL was preincubated with recombinant human apoE-3, native human apoE-3 or E-4, or native rabbit apoE. Human apoE-2, which binds poorly (1-2% of apo E-3 binding) to low density lipoprotein receptors, was approximately 40% as effective as apoE-3 or apoE-4 in binding to LRP. Stimulation of apoE-dependent binding to LRP was blocked by the inclusion of a mixture of human apoC proteins, but not apoA-I or A-II, in the preincubation reaction. High concentrations of apoE did not overcome the apoC inhibition. The effects of apoE and apoC on the ligand blotting assay were paralleled by similar effects in the ability of beta-VLDL to stimulate cholesteryl ester synthesis in mutant human fibroblasts that lack low density lipoprotein receptors. These properties of LRP are consistent with the known effects of apoE and apoC on uptake of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein remnants in the liver and raise the possibility that LRP functions as a receptor for apoE-enriched forms of these lipoproteins in intact animals."

https://openalex.org/W1567170846,"Recently, we identified a novel calcium-independent, plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity in canine myocardial cytosol which represents the major measurable phospholipase A2 activity in myocardial homogenates (Wolf, R. A., and Gross, R. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7295-7303). We now report the 154,000-fold purification of this phospholipase A2 to homogeneity through utilization of sequential anion exchange, chromatofocusing, affinity, Mono Q, and hydroxylapatite chromatographies. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 40 kDa, possessed a specific activity of 227 mumol/mg min, had a pH optimum of 6.4, and catalyzed the regiospecific cleavage of the sn-2 fatty acid from diradyl glycerophospholipids. The purified polypeptide was remarkable for its ability to selectively hydrolyze plasmenylcholine in homogeneous vesicles (subclass rank order: plasmenylcholine greater than alkyl-ether choline glycerophospholipid greater than phosphatidylcholine) as well as in mixed bilayers comprised of equimolar plasmenylcholine/phosphatidylcholine. Purified myocardial phospholipase A2 also possessed selectivity for hydrolysis of phospholipids containing arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position in comparison to oleic or palmitic acid. Taken together, these results constitute the first purification of a calcium-independent phospholipase with absolute regiospecificity for cleavage of the sn-2 acyl linkage in diradyl glycerophospholipids and demonstrate that myocardial phospholipase A2 has kinetic characteristics which are anticipated to result in the selective hydrolysis of sarcolemmal phospholipids during myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1568477959,"Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells analyzed immediately after isolation did not express detectable mRNA for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). In the strict absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), incubation in glass or plastic resulted in expression of IL-1 beta mRNA without detectable IL-1 beta synthesis, even when cells were incubated for 20 h. The accumulation of IL-1 beta mRNA was most likely due to adherence since rotating the containers reduced the amount of mRNA. However, the cells were primed by 3 h adherence since subsequent stimulation with LPS resulted in more IL-1 beta (214%) 4 h after stimulation compared to freshly obtained, LPS-stimulated cells. Ratios of IL-1 beta mRNA induced by LPS versus adherence were 7.8, 36, and 20 at 4, 12, and 24 h, respectively; the corresponding ratios for IL-1 beta protein were 18, 160, and 180. Comparing Staphylococcus epidermidis versus LPS, the ratios of IL-1 beta mRNA were 3.2, 0.5, and 1.2 at 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively, however, the corresponding ratios for IL-1 beta protein were 65, 22, and 10. The differences in transcription versus translation in these studies are unlikely due to changes in stability of mRNA since the half-life of adherence-induced IL-1 beta mRNA was 2.5 versus 4 h for LPS-induced mRNA. There was also no evidence of superinduction of mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with LPS, whereas, tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA was elevated in the presence of cycloheximide. Using different methods of cell surface stimulation, our results demonstrate that synthesis of IL-1 beta is regulated by at least two separate mechanisms, one at the level of transcriptional activation and the other one involving translational efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1516205253,"A newly identified gene, MK, is transiently expressed in the early stages of embryonal carcinoma cell differentiation and in the mid-gestation period of mouse embryogenesis (Kadomatsu, K., Tomomura, M., and Muramatsu, T. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 151, 1312-1318). Analysis of various MK cDNA clones revealed differences in the 5'-region. So far three classes of cDNA clones (MK1, MK2, and MK3) have been identified; they were different in the 5'-untranslated region but shared the rest of the sequence. Ribonuclease protection, RNA blotting, and primer extension revealed that MK2-type RNA was the major MK RNA in retinoic acid-treated embryonal carcinoma cells. In addition, the number of A residues in an oligo(A) stretch in the 5'-side of the common sequence differed from 9 to 29. The number was 9 in the most frequent cases, when the putative MK polypeptide had a molecular weight of about 15,500 and had a signal peptide-like sequence. Hybrid selected MK RNA yielded the predicted polypeptide upon in vitro translation. When pancreatic microsomal membranes were included in the translation system, the translation product of MK RNA was processed and entered into the lumen of the membranes. These results suggest that the product of the MK gene is an extracellular polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1550188105,"Untransformed cytosol receptors for progesterone (PR), androgen (AR), estrogen (ER), and glucocorticosteroid (GR) in rabbit tissues contain a 59-kDa protein (p59) (Tai, P.K.K., Maeda, Y., Nakao, K., Wakim, N.G., Duhring, J.L., and Faber, L.E. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5269-5275) and a 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90). In the present study, receptors from calf uterus (PR, AR, ER, and GR) and from human breast cancer MCF7 cells (PR and GR) were also shown to be comprised of hsp90 and p59. These heterooligomer receptor complexes were stabilized both by transition metal oxyanions (molybdate and tungstate) and chemical cross-linking with dimethylpimelimidate. In 0.4 M KCl, tungstate-stabilized (but not molybdate-stabilized) PR, AR, ER, and GR retained hsp90, but lost p59. Dimethylpimelimidate cross-linking prevented p59 dissociation from hsp90-receptor complexes. Stabilization with tungstate and/or cross-linking permitted immunoaffinity purification of untransformed rabbit as well as calf PR and ER on EC1-Affi-Gel 10 column (an anti-p59 immunoadsorbant). Combined immunoaffinity purification and cross-linking experiments indicated that p59 is bound to hsp90 in the cytosol. We propose that in the nontransformed steroid receptor, p59 interacts with hsp90 rather than with the hormone binding subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1505571690,"Type I collagen, a heterotrimeric protein composed of two alpha 1 chains and one alpha 2 chain, is a major specialized biosynthetic product of fibroblastic cells. We performed a functional dissection of a mouse alpha 1 (I) collagen promoter segment (between -222 and -80) that displays strong activity in vitro and in DNA transfection experiments. Four binding sites for factors present in nuclear extracts of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were identified in this promoter segment. One factor, which has the same binding characteristics as CBF, a heterodimeric CCAAT binding factor that also binds and activates the coordinately expressed alpha 2(I) collagen promoter, interacts with the proximal of two CCAAT motifs. A second factor, designated IF1, binds to two more upstream, adjacent sites (-190 to -170 and -160 to -130). A third factor, designated IF2, makes contact with several G residues in the distal unit of a 12-base pair exact G-rich repeat that brackets the proximal CCAAT motif. Binding studies with mutant oligonucleotides and experiments with purified CBF indicate that the binding of IF2 is inhibited by CBF. IF2 is a metalloprotein that requires zinc cations for efficient binding to its recognition site. DNA transfection experiments using point mutations or small substitution mutations that abolish binding of the transacting factors to their cognate elements were performed. A mutation in the proximal IF1 binding site increases promoter activity 4-fold, a mutation in the IF2 binding site increases this activity 10-fold and a mutation in the CBF binding site decreases this activity 4-5-fold. This suggests that IF1 and IF2 act as transcriptional inhibitors whereas CBF acts as an activator of the alpha 1(I) collagen promoter. We propose that mutually competitive binding of IF2 and CBF could play a role in the control of the alpha 1(I) collagen promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1584186345,"Cyclosporin A and its homologues are synthesized by a single multifunctional enzyme from their precursor amino acids. Cyclosporin synthetase is a polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of approximately 800 kDa. In 3% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gels it shows a single band of approximately 650 kDa, which appears to not be glycosylated. The enzyme could be purified to near-homogeneity in five steps. A 72-fold purification was obtained. All constitutive amino acids of cyclosporins are activated as thioesters via aminoadenylation by the same enzyme. Then N-methylation of the thioester-bound amino acids which are present in methylated form in the cyclosporin molecule takes place, whereby S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the methyl group donor. Methyltransferase activity is an integral entity of the enzyme; this could be shown by a photoaffinity labeling method. 4'-Phosphopantetheine is a prosthetic group of cyclosporin synthetase similar to other peptide and depsipeptide synthetases. Cyclosporin synthetase shows cross-reactions with monoclonal antibodies directed against enniatin synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1576455628,"Vitellogenin (Vg), the hemolymph precursor to the major yolk protein in mosquitoes, is synthesized in the fat body of blood-fed females. Mosquito Vg consists of two subunits with Mr = 200,000 and 66,000. Here, we demonstrate that both the Vg subunits are first synthesized as a single precursor. The identity of this Vg precursor was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies. In cell-free translation of fat body poly (A)+ RNA, the Vg precursor had Mr = 224,000 which increased to 240,000 in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. A precursor with Mr = 250,000 was immunoprecipitated in microsomal fractions isolated from rat bodies. With in vitro pulse labeling, the 250-kDa precursor could be detected in homogenates of fat bodies from blood-fed mosquitoes only during the first few hours accumulation of the Vg precursor was achieved by an in vitro stimulation of Vg synthesis in previtellogenic fat bodies cultured with an insect hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone. The 250-kDa precursor was glycosylated and to a much lesser degree phosphorylated. Treatment of fat bodies with tunicamycin yielded the precursor with Mr = 226,000 which was neither glycosylated nor phosphorylated. The reduction in molecular mass of the 250-kDa Vg precursor and of both mature Vg subunits combined was similar after digestion with endoglycosidase H, indicating that glycosylation is completed prior to cleavage of the Vg precursor. In vitro pulse-chase experiments revealed rapid proteolytic cleavage of the 250-kDa precursor to two polypeptides with Mr = 190,000 and 62,000 which transformed into mature Vg subunits of 200- and 66-kDa as the last step prior to Vg secretion. This last step in Vg processing was inhibited by an ionophore, monensin, and therefore occurred in the Golgi complex. Sulfation as an additional, previously unknown, modification of mosquito Vg was revealed by the incorporation of sodium [35S]sulfate into both Vg subunits. Since sulfation of Vg was predominantly blocked by monensin, the final maturation of Vg subunits in the Golgi complex is, at least in part, due to this modification."
https://openalex.org/W1882114898,"A proteinaceous factor that represses plasma juvenile hormone esterase activity in parasitized insect larvae has been isolated and partially characterized from last instar larvae of the armyworm Pseudaletia separata parasitized with the wasp Apantales kariyai. Purification procedures consisted of extraction with 25% ethanol, gel filtration and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Plasma juvenile hormone esterase activity in Day 3 last instar larvae was repressed by 50% when larvae were injected on Days 1 and 2 with 6.5 pmol of the purified peptide, which has a molecular weight of about 4,500 Da. The application of the factor also causes more than a 2-day delay in the onset of pupation. The sequence of 23 amino acid residues at the amino terminus of the factor was determined as follows: H-Glu-Asn-Phe-Ser-Gly-Gly-Xaa-Val-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Met- Arg-Thr-Pro-Asp-Gly-Arg-Xaa-Lys-Pro-Thr-Phe-Tyr-Gln-."
https://openalex.org/W1585603261,"A baculovirus expression system was used to overproduce the human estrogen receptor in insect cells. The estrogen receptor made in this system is full-length, binds estrogen specifically, and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody to the human estrogen receptor. The recombinant estrogen receptor binds the estrogen response element (ERE) in both the absence and presence of estrogen if the binding is carried out in the absence of Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+, the estrogen receptor binds the ERE in a hormone-dependent fashion. This effect is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal anti-estrogen, is able to stimulate ERE binding to the same extent and under the same conditions as estradiol. Estradiol stimulates formation of an estrogen receptor-ERE complex with an increased mobility in native gels as compared with the complex formed without hormone or with tamoxifen. These results demonstrate that specific DNA binding of the estrogen receptor is not absolutely dependent on the presence of hormone and that estradiol but not tamoxifen is able to induce a change in the estrogen receptor. This differential effect of estradiol and tamoxifen may be important in understanding the role of the receptor to activate target genes differentially."
https://openalex.org/W1583712563,"Transfection of a human pSV2 (copper-zinc) superoxide dismutase expression vector into murine fibroblasts resulted in stable clones producing increased amounts of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. A marked increase in endogenous glutathione peroxidase activity (up to 285%) and a smaller increase in glutathione transferase activity (up to 16%) also occurred. Manganese superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in all clones, whereas catalase and NADPH reductase activities were not affected. Alterations in glutathione peroxidase and manganese superoxide dismutase activities correlated with increases in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity. Whereas all clones were resistant to paraquat, a direct correlation between copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity and resistance to paraquat did not exist. In agreement with previous reports clones expressing the highest copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity did not display the highest resistance to paraquat. However, there was a direct correlation between the increase in glutathione peroxidase activity and paraquat resistance (p less than 0.002)."

https://openalex.org/W1508750197,"In order to specifically evaluate the role of Factor Va in the prothrombinase complex, studies of the activation of prothrombin, Fragment 1.2-prethrombin-2, and active-site-blocked meizothrombin were carried out, both in the absence of phospholipid and at concentrations of substrates and Factor Va sufficient to approach saturation in all components. Km values were independent of Factor Va concentrations, whereas kcat (apparent) values approached saturation with respect to Factor Va concentrations. The three respective substrates exhibited the following parameters of kinetics (Km, microM; kcat, s-1 at saturating [Factor Va]): prothrombin (9.0 +/- 0.4; 31 +/- 1); Fragment 1.2-prethrombin-2 (5.4 +/- 0.4; 13 +/- 2); and meizothrombin (3.6 +/- 0.3; 51 +/- 5). Models of kinetics were constructed to interpret the results, and two of these were formally consistent with experimental results. Both models indicated that the variation of kcat(app) with concentrations of Factor Va reflects the formation of a Factor Va-Factor Xa binary complex. Analysis of kinetics indicated Kd values for this interaction of 1.3 +/- 0.1, 3.0 +/- 0.5, and 1.0 +/- 0.1 microM for the three respective substrates. The models differed in the interpretation of Km. One indicated that Km reflects a binary interaction between Factor Xa and prothrombin, whereas the other indicated a binary interaction between Factor Va and prothrombin. Both indicated that two of the three possible binary interactions between the three components would be reflected in Km and kcat values but not the third. To distinguish these models, the binary interactions were studied by extrinsic fluorescence (Va.Xa), light-scattering (Factor Va.prothrombin), and competition kinetics (Xa.II). The first two interactions were detected and were characterized by Kd values of 2.7 +/- 0.1 microM (Va.Xa) and 8.8 +/- 0.8 microM (Factor Va.prothrombin). No active-site-dependent interaction between prothrombin and Factor Xa could be detected in the absence of Factor Va. The results of these studies suggest that Factor Va interacts with both Factor Xa and prothrombin and effectively presents one to the other in the formation of a ternary enzyme-substrate-cofactor complex. In addition, a comparison of the parameters of kinetics of conversion of prothrombin and its intermediates indicates that meizothrombin is the major intermediate of prothrombin activation in the absence, as well as in the presence of phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1526407418,"Continuous exposure of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to an atmosphere of 98% O2, 2% CO2 (normobaric hyperoxia) leads within a period of several days to cytostasis and clonogenic cell death. Here we report respiratory failure as an important early symptom of oxygen intoxication in CHO cells, resulting in a more than 80% inhibition of oxygen consumption within 3 days of hyperoxic exposure. This inhibition appeared to be correlated with selective inactivation of three mitochondrial key enzymes, NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The latter enzyme controls the influx of glutamate into the Krebs cycle and is particularly critical for oxidative ATP generation in most cultured cells, which depends on exogenous glutamine rather than glucose as a carbon source. As expected, the inactivation of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was correlated with a fall in cellular glutamine utilization, which became apparent from the first day of hyperoxic exposure. Thereafter, glucose utilization and lactate excretion started to increase, up to 3-fold, indicating a cellular response to respiratory failure aimed at increased ATP generation from glycolysis. However, in spite of this response, the cellular ATP level progressively decreased, up to 2.5-fold. Thus, killing of CHO cells by normobaric hyperoxia seems to be due to a severe disturbance of mitochondrial metabolism eventually leading to a depletion of cellular ATP pools."
https://openalex.org/W1558610458,"In the rat pancreatoma cell line, AR4-2J, three inositol tetrakisphosphate isomers were identified, (1,3,4,6), (1,3,4,5), (3,4,5,6), which were increased during activation of phospholipase C by bombesin. Two other isomers were identified, (1,4,5,6) and a fifth isomer which was either (1,2,3,4) or (1,2,3,6), which have not previously been detected in any cell type. To study the metabolic interrelationships between these compounds and inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate in the intact cell, their turnover was assessed under different protocols of [3H]myo-inositol labeling; the inositol phosphates were labeled to near steady state or under conditions where either rapidly or slowly turning over inositol polyphosphates were preferentially labeled. The relative specific radioactivities of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate were very similar in bombesin-stimulated cells, consistent with the pathway for the conversion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to the other three inositol polyphosphates. Compared with these inositol phosphates, the turnover of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate was slow. An accumulation of radioactivity into inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate was observed only under labeling conditions where its relative specific radioactivity was substantially below that of inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. This indicated that the precursor for de novo synthesis of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate was inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. Bombesin stimulated the net breakdown of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and increased the level of inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate; the relative specific radioactivities of these two compounds were similar under all conditions. These data led to the novel proposal that inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate is the product of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate breakdown. This reaction was apparently stimulated by a regulated change in the enzyme(s) which interconvert inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1657908892,"Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. In order to characterize mutations, RNA was isolated from cultured fibroblasts from 13 unrelated patients with neonatal citrullinemia. Ten mutations were identified by sequencing of amplified cDNA. Seven single base missense mutations were identified: Gly14----Ser, Ser180----Asn, Arg157----His, Arg304----Trp, Gly324----Ser, Arg363----Trp, and Gly390----Arg. Six of these missense mutations involved conversion of a CpG dinucleotide in the sense strand to TpG or CpA, and six of the seven mutations alter a restriction enzyme site in the cDNA. Two mutations were observed in which the sequences encoded by a single exon (exon 7 or 13) were absent from the cDNA. One mutation is a G----C substitution in the last position of intron 15 resulting in splicing to a cryptic splice site within exon 16. There is extreme heterogeneity of mutations causing citrulinemia. This heterogeneity may prove typical for less common autosomal recessive human genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1560510639,"We describe a procedure for assessing the functional activity in vivo of a glucocorticoid receptor derivative, T7X556, a mammalian transcriptional regulator that has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The protein was assessed with DOTMA (N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium chloride) liposomes, which are internalized by cultured mammalian cells. T7X556 protein delivered in this manner localized rapidly to the nucleus and selectively enhanced expression from glucocorticoid response element-linked promoters, properties that are characteristic of this receptor derivative when it is synthesized endogenously in mammalian cells. Thus, in vivo activities of T7X556 were not disrupted by expression in bacteria or by biochemical purification. In general, liposome-mediated delivery may permit functional analyses of proteins that have been expressed in heterologous cells and manipulated in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1552743703,"Fourteen 14-mer peptides corresponding to a consensus sequence of metal-binding loops from proteins of the calmodulin family were synthesized. The effect of varying both the position in the binding loop, and the type of aromatic side chains as energy donors for enhancement of terbium luminescence, was studied. It was concluded that tryptophan in loop position 7 gave optimal luminescence enhancement, and that the additional inclusion of a tyrosine in the loop at positions 2 or 4 could further boost emission from the bound terbium. In all further cases energy transfer from aromatic residues at positions other than 7 was markedly less efficient. These results suggest that the peptides assume a configuration which allows a hexadentate ligand structure around the bound terbium ion. This is consistent with a Dexter-type electron exchange model of energy transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1643181266,"We have characterized the time-resolved labeling of a site on the Torpedo californica electrocyte acetylcholine receptor (ACHR) by the photoreactive noncompetitive inhibitor derivative quinacrine azide (QA). The dependence of [3H]QA labeling on acetylcholine (ACH) concentration and on time is consistent with the preferential labeling by [3H]QA of ACHR in the open state. The ACH-dependent [3H]QA labeling, which was associated predominantly with the alpha-subunit, was blocked by other noncompetitive inhibitors including quinacrine, chlorpromazine, proadifen, histrionicotoxin, and bupivacaine. alpha-Subunit from ACHR labeled with [3H]QA 20 ms after the addition of ACH was cleaved with CNBr, and the fragments were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. A peptide containing a major site of specific labeling was purified on two different reverse-phase columns. By N-terminal sequencing, amino acid composition, binding to mercurial-agarose, and apparent molecular weight, this [3H]QA-labeled peptide was identified as alpha-208-243, a CNBr fragment containing the putative membrane-spanning helix M1."
https://openalex.org/W63640904,"Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit on serine/threonine residues by protein kinase C reduces both receptor kinase activity and insulin action in cultured cells. Whether this mechanism regulates insulin action in intact animals was investigated in rats rendered insulin-resistant by 3 days of starvation. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the partially purified hepatic insulin receptor beta-subunit was decreased by 45% in starved animals compared to fed controls. This autophosphorylation defect was entirely reversed by removal of pre-existing phosphate from the receptor with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that increased basal phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues may cause the decreased receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Tryptic removal of a C-terminal region of the receptor beta-subunit containing the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites similarly normalized receptor autophosphorylation. To investigate which kinase(s) may be responsible for such increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation in vivo, protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in liver were studied. A 2-fold increase in protein kinase C activity was found in both cytosol and membrane extracts from starved rats as compared to controls, while protein kinase A activity was diminished in the cytosol of starved rats. A parallel increase in protein kinase C was demonstrated by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody which recognizes several protein kinase C isoforms. These findings suggest that in starved, insulin-resistant animals, an increase in hepatic protein kinase C activity is associated with increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation which in turn decreases autophosphorylation and function of the insulin receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1554931552,"Corticosterone was administered to normal and bilaterally adrenalectomized rats (250-300 g), and hormonal regulation of brain calbindin-D28k (CaBP28k) levels was investigated by radioimmunoassay for CaBP28k protein and by slot and Northern blot analyses for CaBP28k mRNA. The specificity of the changes observed in CaBP28k mRNA levels was tested by reprobing blots with calmodulin and B-actin cDNAs. Rats were either adrenalectomized, adrenalectomized treated with corticosterone, intact, or intact treated with corticosterone. Chronic corticosterone administration (subcutaneous injection for 7 days, 10 mg/day) to normal intact rats significantly increased levels of CaBP28k immunoreactivity (43%) and mRNA (125%) in the hippocampus. Adrenalectomy (animals were killed 7 days after adrenalectomy) produced a significant decrease in hippocampal CaBP28k immunoreactivity (85%) and mRNA (80%) compared with intact controls. Immunocytochemical analysis of tissue sections inducated a marked depletion of CaBP28k immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 2 weeks after adrenalectomy. When adrenalectomized rats were treated with corticosterone (10 mg/day for 7 days), CaBP28k protein and mRNA levels in hippocampus were restored to levels observed in intact controls. No changes in CaBP28k protein and mRNA in kidney, cerebellum, striatum, or cerebral cortex were noted in adrenalectomized rats or in intact rats treated with corticosterone when compared with controls, indicating the specificity of the effect on CaBP28k for the hippocampus. These studies present the first evidence of a regulator of CaBP28k gene expression in the brain."

Experiments performed with mouse L1210 leukemia growing in culture show that each antagonist has different sites of inhibition in nucleotide biosynthesis. Acivicin is a potent inhibitor of CTP and GMP synthetases and partially inhibits N-formylglycineamidine ribotide (FGAM) synthetase of purine biosynthesis. DON inhibits FGAM synthetase, CTP synthetase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Azaserine inhibits FGAM synthetase and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Large accumulations of FGAR and its di- and triphosphate derivatives were observed for all three antagonists which could interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, providing another mechanism of cytotoxicity. Acivicin, azaserine, and DON are not potent inhibitors of carbamyl phosphate synthetase II (glutamine-hydrolyzing) and amidophosphoribosyltransferase in leukemia cells growing in culture although there are reports of such inhibitions in vitro. Blockade of de novo purine biosynthesis by these three antagonists results in a complementary stimulation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W109650587,"Factor IX Alabama is a factor IX variant in which a glycine has been substituted for Asp47 in the first epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. The structural defect in factor IX Alabama results in a molecule with 10% of normal coagulant activity. The interactions of immunoaffinity-purified factor IX Alabama with its activator, cofactors, and substrate have been investigated to determine the functional defect in the variant. Factor IX Alabama is activated by factor XIa/calcium at near normal rates. Calcium fluorescence-quenching experiments indicate that high affinity calcium binding in the first EGF domain is not altered in factor IX Alabama. The active site of factor IXa Alabama is fully competent to activate factor X in the absence of calcium when using polylysine as a surface to catalyze the reaction. Factor IXa Alabama has only 64% of normal factor IXa activity in the presence of 300 microM CaCl2 in the polylysine-catalyzed system although apparent high affinity calcium binding constants are similar. Factor IXa Alabama has 52-60% of normal activity in a calcium/phospholipid vesicle system. The addition of factor VIIIa to the phospholipid vesicle system decreases the relative rate of factor IXa Alabama to 18-19% of normal. Three-dimensional computer-aided models of the first EGF domain of normal factor IX and factor IX Alabama indicate no major structural alterations resulting from the glycine substitution for Asp47. The model of the first EGF domain of normal factor IX predicts a calcium-binding site involving Asp47, Asp49, Asp64, and Asp65. Our binding data, however, indicate that Asp47 is not necessary to form the high affinity binding site. We conclude that Asp47 in normal factor IX coordinates to the bound calcium, inducing a conformational change in the molecule essential for proper interaction with factor X and factor VIIIa."

Flunarizine-treated rats lost 71 percent fewer neurons than the untreated control rats at the end of 1 week. In cell culture, flunarizine at 30 to 40 microM also prevented neuronal death in nerve growth factor-dependent embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons after the abrupt withdrawal of neurotrophic support. The drug may cause this effect by acting at an intracellular site, one distinct from its blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1515335513,"The conformations adopted by five oligopurine.oligopyrimidine (pur.pyr) inserts of various lengths and sequence repeats in recombinant plasmids were evaluated as a function of pH and negative super-helicaldensity. Patterns of chemical reactivity (OsO4 and diethylpyrocarbonate) indicate that long (greater than 36 base pairs) pur.pyr segments can adopt intramolecular triplexes and that increasing the length of the pur.pyr tract reduces the dependence on low pH for structure formation, such that (GA)37 adopts an intramolecular triplex under moderate levels of negative superhelical stress (-sigma = 0.049) at neutral pH. This demonstrates that long pur.pyr segments, which are abundant in eukaryotic genomes, have the potential to adopt triplexes in vivo. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the plasmids combined with chemical probing indicates that for longer sequences, multiple conformers of the intramolecular triplex exist at low pH. These conformers result from nucleation at various positions on the polypurine stretch, giving rise to different extents of relaxation at the same linking number. In addition, the metal ions Co2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ have profound effects on the pattern of chemical reactivity displayed by long pur.pyr segments at both neutral and low pH, indicating that quite different structures may form in the presence of divalent metal ions. Thus, the types and extent of unusual structures adopted by long pur.pyr segments are complex and heterogeneous, and are dependent on pH, supercoiling, and the presence of divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1556887581,We report that alpha and beta type rat thyroid hormone receptors bind specifically and with high affinity to the 10-base pair sequence immediately 3' of the rat growth hormone TATA box (positions -25 to -16) in a region of the rat growth hormone promoter which can be negatively hormone responsive (nTRE). The receptors have approximately 7-fold lower affinity in vitro for the nTRE than for the thyroid hormone-responsive enhancer of the rat growth hormone gene (TRE). Proteins extracted with high salt concentration from rat pituitary cell nuclei enhance binding of the receptors to both the TRE and nTRE. A modification of the avidin-biotin complex DNA binding assay which enhances the sensitivity of the assay approximately 100-fold was used in these studies. The immediate proximity of a receptor binding site to the rat growth hormone TATA box suggests that direct interaction between receptor and TFIID (the TATA binding protein) mediates nTRE activity.
https://openalex.org/W1587413649,"Liver microsomal, flavin-containing monooxygenases catalyze NADPH- and oxygen-dependent oxidation of a wide variety of antipsychotic and narcotic drugs. Two forms of these enzymes have been isolated and partially characterized (Ozols, J. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 163, 49-55). The amino acid sequence of form 1 is presented here. Sequence determination has been achieved by automated Edman degradation of peptides generated by chemical and enzymatic cleavages. The NH2 terminus of form 1 oxygenase is blocked. Partial acid hydrolysis of the blocked peptides removed acetyl groups and permitted their analysis by Edman degradation. Form 1 monooxygenase contains 536 residues. A peptide of 32 residues at the COOH terminus of the protein could not be sequenced in a gas-phase or pulsed liquid-phase sequenator, due to its extreme hydrophobicity. Covalent coupling of this peptide to an aryl amine membrane by means of carbodiimide, followed by automated solid-phase sequencing, established the order of 30 amino acid residues. The hydrophobic segment at the COOH terminus presumably functions to anchor the monooxygenase to the microsomal membrane. The amino acid sequence of form 1 monooxygenase, despite overlapping substrate specificity, is not related to the cytochrome P-450 superfamily. Comparison of the sequence of form 1 oxygenase with other known sequences, except for some short segments similar to those in the bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenases, did not reveal significant sequence similarities that would suggest a structural or evolutionary relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1500049606,"DNase I footprint analysis of the core adenovirus 2 (Ad2) major late promoter (MLP) has revealed distinct patterns of protection corresponding to the assembly of transcription components during transcriptional initiation (VanDyke, M. W., Sawadogo, M., and Roeder, R. G. (1989) Mol. Cell Biol. 7, 3371-3379). By using partially purified transcription factors, DNase I protection over the TATA box element and the CAP sequence was attributed to the binding of a single factor, TFIID. We have determined, however, that protection of the CAP region results from the binding of a novel factor, designated CAP-site binding factor (CBF), which is chromatographically and functionally distinct from TFIID. DNase I footprint analysis and gel electrophoresis mobility shift competition assays confirm that distinct polypeptides bind to the Ad2 MLP upstream promoter sequence, TATA box, and CAP sequences. When the CAP sequence is mutated, transcriptional activity of the Ad2 MLP is reduced both in vitro and in vivo. The decrease in transcriptional activity correlates with decreased CBF binding activity. Nuclear extracts depleted of CBF also exhibit reduced Ad2 MLP transcriptional activity. The addition of DNA affinity purified CBF, free of TFIID or major late transcription factor, restores the activity to control levels."
https://openalex.org/W1499967969,"Insect plasma lipid transfer particle (LTP) catalyzes vectorial net transfer of diacylglycerol (DAG) from Manduca sexta larval high density lipophorin (HDLp-L) to human low density lipoprotein (LDL) producing an LDL of lower density and lipophorin subspecies of higher density. At equilibrium, a stable DAG-depleted very high density lipophorin species (density = 1.25 g/ml) is formed. Electrophoretic analysis of the substrate and product lipoproteins showed that apoprotein exchange or transfer between human LDL and lipophorin did not occur during the lipid transfer reaction. Facilitated net transfer of cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and phospholipid occurred to a much lower extent than DAG net transfer, indicating that under these conditions, LDL serves as a sink for lipophorin-associated DAG. This reaction, therefore, provides a method whereby the mass of lipid associated with human LDL can be modified in vitro without alteration of its apoprotein component. The DAG content of LDL increased in a linear manner with respect to LTP concentration and time during the initial phase of the reaction, demonstrating the utility of this system as a quantitative assay method for LTP-mediated net DAG transfer. When [3H]DAG-labeled LDL was prepared and employed in transfer experiments with unlabeled lipophorin, labeled DAG was recovered in the HDLp-L fraction. The amount of labeled DAG recovered in the HDLp-L fraction was dependent on the ratio of LDL to HDLp-L in the reaction. Thus, in this system, LTP-mediated DAG redistribution is bidirectional, suggesting that the final equilibrium distribution of lipid may be dictated by the properties of potential donor/acceptor lipoproteins rather than by an inherent particle substrate specificity of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W7251361,"The reductive metabolism of BrCCl3 by ferrous myoglobin leads to the alteration of the prosthetic heme to form products that can be dissociated from the protein and to those that are irreversibly bound to the protein. The major dissociable or soluble heme metabolites have recently been characterized. In this study, the irreversibly bound heme product was characterized by Edman degradation, amino acid analysis, and electronic absorption and mass spectrometry of peptides derived from the altered protein. It was found that the prosthetic heme was modified by a CCl2 moiety derived from BrCCl3 and was covalently bound to histidine residue 93, the normal proximal ligand to the heme-iron. The data are consistent with a mechanism by which the trichloromethyl radical reacts with the heme to form an intermediate that either can alkylate the proximal histidine residue or form soluble metabolites. The covalent bonding of the heme prosthetic moiety to the apoprotein likely leads to a change in the tertiary structure of the protein that may be responsible for its altered catalytic activity as well as its enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis. Similar processes may account, at least in part, for the covalent alteration of the heme prosthetic group of other hemoproteins caused by xenobiotics and endogenous substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1607436771,"Previous kinetic studies (Tolkovsky, A.M., Braun, S., and Levitzki, A. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 79, 213-222) and biochemical studies (Arad, H., Rosenbusch, J., and Levitzki, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6579-6583) from our laboratory suggest that Gs or alpha s remain associated with the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase (C) throughout the activation cycle of adenylyl cyclase by hormone receptors. In this study we have purified GppNHp-activated bovine brain adenylyl cyclase over 3000-fold under mild solution conditions. We demonstrate that although the enzyme is permanently activated it retains the beta subunit when bound to a forskolin-agarose affinity column as long as it is not exposed to high salt concentrations. The stoichiometry of alpha s to beta to C is close to unity, suggesting that beta gamma subunits do not dissociate from Gs upon its activation. The complex gamma beta alpha s (GppNHp). C dissociates partially when migrating on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography molecular-seiving column. This partial dissociation probably results from the relatively diluted state of the enzyme at a high degree of purity. Prolonged ultracentrifugation of the complex also causes partial dissociation of the beta gamma subunits from alpha s (GppNHp). C. The apparent contradiction between the results reported here and the observation that beta gamma subunits inhibit cyclase activity when added to platelet membranes (Katada, T., Bokoch, G. M., Northrup, J. K., Ui, M., and Gilman, A. G. (1984a) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3568-3577) is discussed. We suggest an alternative model to account for this inhibitory effect of added beta gamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1481890023,"We report in this paper that human growth hormone (hGH) stimulates the growth of human cultured IM-9 lymphocytes in a low concentration (3%) of serum. The hormone-stimulated growth was inhibited with the phorbol diesters phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutylate (PDBu). The binding experiments of 125I-hGH to the phorbol diester-treated cells and to their detergent-solubilized receptors revealed that the phorbol diesters caused internalization of the hGH receptors from the cell surfaces but did not significantly affect their affinity (Ka = 8.5 x 10(9) M-1). About half of the receptors (1.4 x 10(3)/cell) were internalized in 30 min at 37 degrees C, and the half-effective doses of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and PDBu were 5 and 35 nM, respectively. When culture was continued after washing with the culture medium, the phorbol diester-treated cells recovered their hGH-responsive growth, and the number of the surface hGH receptors was restored. The down-regulation of the hormone receptor was also induced with another phorbol diester, phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, but not with the phorbol or phorbol monoesters phorbol 12-myristate and phorbol 13-acetate. The synthetic activators of protein kinase C 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol and N-(6-phenyl-hexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide had an effect similar to that of the phorbol diesters. Staurosporine and sphingosine, inhibitors of protein kinase C, inhibited the phorbol diester-caused down-regulation with a half-inhibitory dose (IC50) of 8 nM and 130 microM, respectively. This suggests that protein kinase C was involved in the reaction. When 32Pi-loaded IM-9 cells were stimulated with PDBu at 37 degrees C, the phosphorylation of Mr 55,000, 88,000, and 114,000 proteins increased rapidly. The PDBu-stimulated phosphorylation of 55,000 protein was also inhibited by staurosporine at 10 nM, which was a comparable concentration to inhibit the phorbol diester-induced down-regulation of hGH receptors. Furthermore, among these proteins, the 55,000 protein was specifically coisolated with the hGH receptors by three different experiments: 1) immunoprecipitation by anti-hGH antibody; 2) immunoisolation using protein A-cellulose columns; and 3) affinity purification by hGH-fixed agarose gel. These results suggest that phorbol diesters reduce the hGH-stimulated growth of cultured IM-9 lymphocytes by the down-regulation of hGH receptors and that the receptor-associated 55,000 protein may be involved in this regulation through phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1571266982,"We have previously demonstrated that the properties of mitochondrial glycerophosphate acyltransferase are in keeping with the asymmetric distribution of fatty acids found in naturally occurring cell glycerophospholipids. We are now examining if mitochondria can export lysophosphatidic acid and if it is converted to other phospholipids by the microsomes. Rat liver mitochondria were incubated for 3 min with [2-3H]-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, palmityl-CoA, and N-ethylmaleimide in the acyltransferase assay medium. In the absence of bovine serum albumin in the medium, greater than 80% of the phospholipids sedimented with the mitochondria. In the presence of the albumin, the lysophosphatidic acid was present entirely in the supernatant fluid. The very little phosphatidic acid that was formed sedimented with the mitochondria. Addition of microsomes to the supernatant fluid followed by a further incubation of 5 min converted 61% of the lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid which sedimented with the microsomes. When mitochondria and microsomes were incubated together in the assay medium containing albumin and N-ethylmaleimide, the product contained more phosphatidic and less lysophosphatidic acid. When the subcellular components were reisolated by differential centrifugation, 70% of the phosphatidic acid sedimented with the microsomes and the lysophosphatidic acid stayed in the postmicrosomal supernatant. Thus, under appropriate conditions mitochondrially produced lysophosphatidic acid can leave the organelles and this phospholipid can be converted to phosphatidic acid by the microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1538957135,"Lysosomal transport of monoiodotyrosine was characterized in countertransport experiments using rat FRTL-5 thyroid cell lysosomes. Monoiodotyrosine carrier activity was temperature-dependent (Ea = 11.65 kcal/mol) and had a pH optimum of 7.5. Carrier activity was minimally inhibited by KCl and NaCl, but unaffected by the presence of other ions or ATP. Monoiodotyrosine transport was unaffected by the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, nigericin, or ammonium chloride, indicating that a proton or K+ gradient is not necessary for monoiodotyrosine transport across the lysosomal membrane. Monoiodotyrosine countertransport showed a 6-fold increase in lysosomes from FRTL-5 cells grown in medium containing thyrotropin by comparison to cells grown without this hormone. Thyrotropin responsiveness raised the possibility that monoiodotyrosine was transported by system h, the only known lysosomal carrier whose activity is enhanced by thyrotropin. Consistent with this, monoiodotyrosine-loaded lysosomes exhibited countertransport of [3H]tyrosine, [3H]phenylalanine, and [3H]leucine, three system h ligands, but not [3H]cystine, a nonsystem h ligand. Unlabeled tyrosine, phenylalanine, and leucine, but not cystine or proline, inhibited [125I]monoiodotyrosine countertransport, and leucine inhibition of [3H]tyrosine countertransport and [125I]monoiodotyrosine countertransport yielded virtually identical KI values, 3.5 and 3.2 microM, respectively. Competition studies with monoiodotyrosine analogues showed that system h recognizes a broad range of ligands with an alpha-amino acid configuration at one end and a hydrophobic region at the other. Ring-substituted halogens, regardless of mass or ring position, but not amino, nitro, hydroxy, or methoxy groups, enhanced carrier recognition of system h analogues. It appears that a single system effects the transport of iodinated (e.g. monoiodotyrosine) and noniodinated (e.g. tyrosine) thyroglobulin catabolites into the cytosol for salvage and reutilization by FRTL-5 thyroid cells."

S., and Brown, D. D. (1984) Cell 37, 903-913; Wolffe, A. P. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 527-537). To explore possible mechanisms of this specific action of H1 we analyzed the in vitro transcription of H1.DNA complexes. We found that the selective inhibitory effect of H1 in this system depends entirely on the flanking sequences of 5 S RNA genes and not on the coding sequence itself. At an H1:DNA ratio above approximately 0.4, H1 strongly inhibited the transcription of the gene surrounded by the A + T-rich flanks characteristic of oocyte 5 S RNA genes, whereas it did not prevent transcription of the genes surrounded by G + C-rich somatic-type flanks. This was reflected by strongly preferential binding of H1 to isolated 5 S RNA genes contained within A + T-rich flanks. We also showed that superphosphorylation of H1 with growth-associated (mitotic) H1 kinase invariably decreased H1's ability to inhibit transcription in an in vitro system."

Like NeuAc2en, its aryl azide derivative is a strong competitive inhibitor of sialidase (Ki approximately 15 microM). The absorbance spectrum of ASA-NeuAc2en shows a characteristic aryl azide peak, which disappears upon photolysis with UV light. When its radioiodinated counterpart 5-N-acetyl-9-(4-iodoazidosalicoylamido)-2-deoxy-2,3-didehydrone uraminic acid ([125I]IASA-NeuAc2en) was photolyzed in the presence of C. perfringens sialidase a 72-kDa protein was labeled. Labeling occurred specifically in the active site since it was inhibited in the presence of NeuAc2en. Chemical cleavage of the photoaffinity-labeled 72-kDa protein demonstrates that specifically labeled peptides involved in the formation of the active site can easily be determined. ASA-NeuAc2en is a valuable new tool for the identification and structural/functional analysis of sialidases and other proteins, recognizing this sialic acid derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1602817079,"Abstract The class II histocompatibilty molecule I-Ak was photoaffinity labeled by NH2- and COOH-terminal photoreactive conjugates of an immunogenic hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) peptide. The labeled alpha and beta chains were digested with protease from Staphylococcus aureus strain V-8 (protease V-8) and/or trypsin, and the proteolytic fragments were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (peptide mapping). Reproducible peptide maps containing a major labeled component were obtained from the three conjugates reported here whose photoreactive group was attached via short spacers of limited flexibility. The COOH-terminal conjugate N-acetyl HEL-(49-61)-iodo-4-azidosalicyloyl thioester (compound 1) labeled hydrophilic tryptic digest fragments on both chains of I-Ak. The labeled digest fragments were homogeneous in reverse-phase and anion-exchange HPLC, indicating that the photoaffinity labeling was site-specific. Conversely, the NH2-terminal conjugate iodo-4-azidosalicyloyl HEL-(46-61) (compound 2: IASA-(46-61)) labeled exceptionally hydrophobic sequences on both chains of I-Ak. The labeling was also site-specific because reverse-phase HPLC of primary digests with protease V-8 and secondary digests with trypsin showed single major labeled components. The labeling of I-Ak by IASA-(46-61) was fully inhibitible by HEL-(46-61). In contrast, IASA attached to the smallest immunogenic peptide 52-61 (compound 3) labeled a distinctly different hydrophilic tryptic fragment. The site of the I-Ak molecule that was photoaffinity labeled by IASA-(46-61) (compound 2) was determined. IASA-(46-61) labeled selectively at Pro-118 of a primary alpha chain fragment most likely encompassing residues 115-134. It labeled Thr-121 of a primary beta chain fragment most likely encompassing residues 109-138. We also obtained evidence that IASA-(46-61) occupied the antigen-specific site; the conjugate stimulated a T-cell hybridoma that recognizes the sequence 52-61 and also competed for the binding of this smaller peptide to I-Ak. Thus, peptides that bind to the allele-specific binding site and are long enough to extend beyond it can interact with a hydrophobic area of class II molecules. This area is formed by sequences of the first halves of the second domain of both alpha and beta chains."
https://openalex.org/W1661430040,"We previously reported a double-stranded endonuclease from HeLa cells, endonuclease R (endo R), which specifically cleaves duplex DNA at sites rich in G.C base pairs. In this report we describe the purification of endo R to near homogeneity by conventional and affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the active form of endo R is approximately 115-125 kDa. SDS-gel electrophoresis reveals a major protein species of 100 kDa. The enzyme requires Mg2+ as a cofactor and is equally active on closed circular and linear duplex DNA substrates that contain G-rich sequences. A 50% reduction in cleavage activity is observed with Ca2+ ions and no double-stranded cleavage occurs with Zn2+. Use of Mn2+ causes an altered specificity at low concentrations of enzyme or divalent metal ion and nonspecific degradation of the substrate at higher concentrations. Endo R is strongly inhibited by sodium or potassium chloride and exhibits a wide pH optimum of 6.0-9.0. The pI of the enzyme is between 6.5 and 7.0. A 2-fold stimulation is observed with the addition of dGTP or dATP but specific cleavage is inhibited by ATP at an equivalent concentration. Cleavage activity is competitively inhibited 10-fold more efficiently by single-stranded poly(dG)12 than by other DNA competitors. The ends of endo R cleavage products contain 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl groups, and a significant portion of these products were substrates for T4 DNA ligase.

The best substrates for double-stranded cleavage were homopolymeric stretches of poly(dG).poly(dC). Plasmids which contain other G-rich sequences were also cleaved but at a reduced frequency. These included the telomeric sequences, d(G4T2) and d(G2-6A), which were cleaved at approximately one-third the frequency of d(G)n.d(C)n. The alternating copolymer d(GA) and the terminal sequences of adeno-associated virus d(G1-3T/A) were also cut. Poly(dA).poly(dT) and the alternating copolymer d(GC)n were not detectably cleaved. Although endo R has a nicking activity which converts supercoiled plasmids to nicked circular DNA, the nicking activity is random with respect to plasmid sequences. Specific cleavage of G-rich sequences appears to occur by a concerted double-stranded mechanism. The cleavage pattern within the G-rich runs suggests that cleavage can occur anywhere within the G-rich region. Product ligation experiments indicate that a limited number of cleavage events (1-2) occur/molecule. Inasmuch as the best substrates for endo R are d(G)n.d(C)n and telomeric sequences, we suggest that endo R may directly recognize and cleave DNA that contains G.G base pairing."

The specific insertion of an anthraniloyl group at the active center of subunit II free or bound to subunit I, after its conversion into chymotrypsin II, allowed us to determine the value of the dissociation constant between subunit I and anthraniloyl-chymotrypsin II (Kd = 0.7 +/- 0.1 x 10(-7) M) and between subunit III and the binary complex subunit I-anthraniloyl-chymotrypsin II (Kd = 1.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) M). Moreover, the influence of the association on the flexibility of the active center of chymotrypsin II was deduced from fluorescence polarization measurements and rotational correlation time determination of anthraniloyl-chymotrypsin II free or bound to subunit I. The anthraniloyl group has no motion independently of the whole chymotrypsin II molecule and the binding of subunit I to anthraniloyl-chymotrypsin II results in an increase of the rigidity of the active site in the latter protein."
