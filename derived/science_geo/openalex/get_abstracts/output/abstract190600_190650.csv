The absorbed serum agglutinates A1 and A1B cells, but not A2 or A2B cells. A-specific hæmagglutinins have been demonstrated in saline extracts of the seeds of Dolichos biflorus by Bird2, and it has been suggested3 that because extracts of Dolichos biflorus seemed predominantly A1-specific, they may be used to differentiate the sub-groups A1 and A2) A1B and A2B. The seed extracts have the advantage of being cheaper and more easy to prepare than human sera."

https://openalex.org/W2001273313,"IN living systems a transfer of amino groups occurs between certain amino-acids and keto-acids. This important reversible process, known as ‘transamination’1, effects a link between carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and the responsible enzymes, the transaminases, are activated by pyridoxal2 or pyridoxamine phosphates3. The proposed mechanisms of the reaction involve participation of a Schiff base between amino- and keto-acids4 or between amino-acids and pyridoxal phosphate5. Prototropic rearrangement followed by hydrolysis gives, respectively, the keto- and amino-acids or the keto-acid and pyridoxamine phosphate, the latter then undergoing a reverse reaction with a different keto-acid. A reversible, non-enzymic reaction between pyridoxal and amino-acids to give pyridoxamine and keto-acids, discovered by Snell6, was shown recently to be catalysed by trace metals (copper, iron, aluminium)7. Interest in this chemical process lies mainly in its possible connexion with the biological one ; therefore an explanation of the part played by metals in such reactions is clearly desirable."

https://openalex.org/W1999763908,"IN consequence of the results obtained with decamethonium in the cat1,2 and in human beings3, we felt justified in putting forward the thesis that decamethonium produced a neuromuscular block in mammals only through a persisting depolarization of the motor end-plate. But work undertaken with other mammalian species (monkeys, dogs, hares) during the past few months reveals that decamethonium can produce in these three a neuromuscular block which differs in many ways from the block produced by pure depolarization. Thus in these species the tetanus is poorly sustained, and antagonizes the block, which is also antagonized by anticholinesterases. The white muscles show an acute decreasing sensitivity to decamethonium, a second injection of a dose which at first produced almost complete paralysis failing to produce any effect. If one records simultaneously from a red muscle and a white one4, a transition from a depolarizing type of block to a block by competitive inhibition is seen."

https://openalex.org/W1972205339,"IN further attempts to find a solvent for melanin which would be of use in histological work, the following substances have been found to dissolve, in the cold, the pigments extracted from the ink sac of Sepia officinalis and melanoma tissue, and those prepared from adrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa): ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether. The monoethyl ether had the greatest solvent power. These melanins have also been found to be soluble, in the cold, in mixtures of ethyl lactate and benzyl alcohol, the best proportions being 6 of the former to 4 of the latter (by volume). In all these solvents the solubilities of sepia, melanoma and adrenaline melanins were, so far as could be determined from what must be regarded as impure specimens, of the same order, but the melanin from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine was much less soluble than the others. However, these solvents failed to dissolve the melanin in sections of melanoma tissue, even with the aid of heat. The method used for extracting the sepia and melanoma melanins was: (1) solution in 10 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide, (2) filtration and precipitation of the melanin by dilute hydrochloric acid, (3) removal of extraneous fatty substances by extraction with ethyl alcohol, chloroform and benzene, (4) repetition of (1) and (2). This extraction procedure was also applied to melanins from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and adrenaline, but in spite of this uniformity of treatment the former product was still the least soluble of the four types of pigment."

The habit has now been observed in juveniles and adults of both sexes of the common shrew, Sorex araneus Linn."

https://openalex.org/W2062939242,"Stodola and Lockwood1, and Kluyver, De Ley and Rijven2, demonstrated that several species of Pseudomonas are able to oxidize maltose and lactose to the corresponding malto- and lacto-bionic acid, by oxidation of the reducing group of the disaccharide, without breaking the oxygen bridge. Some strains of Pseudomonas consume the calcium salt of these acids slowly2. Pseudomonas is a common surface inhabitant of several natural waters, so it is likely that under these natural conditions these cells may convert maltose from polysaccharides (formation of lactose is improbable) into the corresponding acid. It seemed to be of interest to ascertain what kind of microorganisms are endowed with the ability to consume maltobionate, with the view of getting an idea of the importance of this decomposition process in Nature. Lactobionate was included in view of a future study of the enzymatic mechanism of its breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2092721788,"IN quantitative one-dimensional paper chromatography of amino-acids, the position of the various bands is generally determined either by running reference strips on the edges of the paper or by spraying lightly with weak ninhydrin solution. Neither method is entirely satisfactory. Reference strips are not always a reliable guide to cutting, particularly if the bands are close together, since the fronts may not be straight; the use of ninhydrin must give rise to some loss, which will fall most heavily on the acids present in least amount."

https://openalex.org/W2055505598,"MELNICK et al.1 and Evans2 found that the rate of enzymatic liberation of amino-acids from soybean proteins preheated at different temperatures provides an explanation for their different growth-promoting properties for the growing chick. We have used this principle to investigate the differences between the biological value of various types of protein feeding-stuffs for animals. In the course of this work we observed a property in which plant and animal proteins differ: pancreatic digests of plant protein feeds, but not of animal protein feeds, yielded considerable precipitates on addition of trichloracetic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2009072161,"A METHOD for measuring thicknesses of particles in the sub-sieve range has been devised. Measurements are made using the Vickers projection microscope. The apparatus required is an attachment to the sub-stage condenser which replaces its front lens; it consists mainly of a quartz spherical lens, which is allowed to make contact with a microscope slide carrying a dispersion of fine particles mounted dry on its uppermost surface—which is most distant from the objective lens–as shown in the diagram."

My own paper was specifically limited to the problem of educating the young, totally deaf—whether born deaf, or those who become totally deaf before learning to speak."
