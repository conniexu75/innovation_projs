https://openalex.org/W2026959390,"The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. In G1 phase, the absence of a sister chromatid means that repair of DSBs occurs through non-homologous end-joining or microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). These pathways often involve loss of DNA sequences at the break site and are therefore error-prone. In late S and G2 phases, even though DNA end-joining pathways remain functional, there is an increase in repair of DSBs by homologous recombination, which is mostly error-free. Consequently, the relative contribution of these different pathways to DSB repair in the cell cycle has a large influence on the maintenance of genetic integrity. It has remained unknown how DSBs are directed for repair by different, potentially competing, repair pathways. Here we identify a role for CtIP (also known as RBBP8) in this process in the avian B-cell line DT40. We establish that CtIP is required not only for repair of DSBs by homologous recombination in S/G2 phase but also for MMEJ in G1. The function of CtIP in homologous recombination, but not MMEJ, is dependent on the phosphorylation of serine residue 327 and recruitment of BRCA1. Cells expressing CtIP protein that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 327 are specifically defective in homologous recombination and have a decreased level of single-stranded DNA after DNA damage, whereas MMEJ remains unaffected. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation of serine 327 of CtIP as cells enter S phase and the recruitment of BRCA1 functions as a molecular switch to shift the balance of DSB repair from error-prone DNA end-joining to error-free homologous recombination."

We investigated the expression and function of the sweet taste receptor in MIN6 cells and mouse islets. Methodology/Principal Findings The expression of the sweet taste receptor was determined by RT–PCR and immunohistochemistry. Changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) and cAMP ([cAMP]c) were monitored in MIN6 cells using fura-2 and Epac1-camps. Activation of protein kinase C was monitored by measuring translocation of MARCKS-GFP. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. mRNA for T1R2, T1R3, and gustducin was expressed in MIN6 cells. In these cells, artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, succharin, and acesulfame-K increased insulin secretion and augmented secretion induced by glucose. Sucralose increased biphasic increase in [Ca2+]c. The second sustained phase was blocked by removal of extracellular calcium and addition of nifedipine. An inhibitor of inositol(1, 4, 5)-trisphophate receptor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, blocked both phases of [Ca2+]c response. The effect of sucralose on [Ca2+]c was inhibited by gurmarin, an inhibitor of the sweet taste receptor, but not affected by a Gq inhibitor. Sucralose also induced sustained elevation of [cAMP]c, which was only partially inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium and nifedipine. Finally, mouse islets expressed T1R2 and T1R3, and artificial sweeteners stimulated insulin secretion. Conclusions Sweet taste receptor is expressed in β-cells, and activation of this receptor induces insulin secretion by Ca2+ and cAMP-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2162038983,"Humans and chimpanzees are unusual among primates in that they frequently perform group hunts of mammalian prey and share meat with conspecifics. Especially interesting are cases in which males give meat to unrelated females. The meat-for-sex hypothesis aims at explaining these cases by proposing that males and females exchange meat for sex, which would result in males increasing their mating success and females increasing their caloric intake without suffering the energetic costs and potential risk of injury related to hunting. Although chimpanzees have been shown to share meat extensively with females, there has not been much direct evidence in this species to support the meat-for-sex hypothesis. Here we show that female wild chimpanzees copulate more frequently with those males who, over a period of 22 months, share meat with them. We excluded other alternative hypotheses to exchanging meat for sex, by statistically controlling for rank of the male, age, rank and gregariousness of the female, association patterns of each male-female dyad and meat begging frequency of each female. Although males were more likely to share meat with estrous than anestrous females given their proportional representation in hunting parties, the relationship between mating success and sharing meat remained significant after excluding from the analysis sharing episodes with estrous females. These results strongly suggest that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex, and do so on a long-term basis. Similar studies on humans will determine if the direct nutritional benefits that women receive from hunters in foraging societies could also be driving the relationship between reproductive success and good hunting skills."
https://openalex.org/W2058617712,"The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 has the smallest genome and cell size of all known photosynthetic organisms. Like all phototrophs at temperate latitudes, it experiences predictable daily variation in available light energy which leads to temporal regulation and partitioning of key cellular processes. To better understand the tempo and choreography of this minimal phototroph, we studied the entire transcriptome of the cell over a simulated daily light-dark cycle, and placed it in the context of diagnostic physiological and cell cycle parameters. All cells in the culture progressed through their cell cycles in synchrony, thus ensuring that our measurements reflected the behavior of individual cells. Ninety percent of the annotated genes were expressed, and 80% had cyclic expression over the diel cycle. For most genes, expression peaked near sunrise or sunset, although more subtle phasing of gene expression was also evident. Periodicities of the transcripts of genes involved in physiological processes such as in cell cycle progression, photosynthesis, and phosphorus metabolism tracked the timing of these activities relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, the transitions between photosynthesis during the day and catabolic consumption of energy reserves at night- metabolic processes that share some of the same enzymes--appear to be tightly choreographed at the level of RNA expression. In-depth investigation of these patterns identified potential regulatory proteins involved in balancing these opposing pathways. Finally, while this analysis has not helped resolve how a cell with so little regulatory capacity, and a 'deficient' circadian mechanism, aligns its cell cycle and metabolism so tightly to a light-dark cycle, it does provide us with a valuable framework upon which to build when the Prochlorococcus proteome and metabolome become available."
https://openalex.org/W1975522291,"During development, growth factors and hormones cooperate to establish the unique sizes, shapes and material properties of individual bones. Among these, TGF-β has been shown to developmentally regulate bone mass and bone matrix properties. However, the mechanisms that control postnatal skeletal integrity in a dynamic biological and mechanical environment are distinct from those that regulate bone development. In addition, despite advances in understanding the roles of TGF-β signaling in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the net effects of altered postnatal TGF-β signaling on bone remain unclear. To examine the role of TGF-β in the maintenance of the postnatal skeleton, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) kinase on bone mass, architecture and material properties. Inhibition of TβRI function increased bone mass and multiple aspects of bone quality, including trabecular bone architecture and macro-mechanical behavior of vertebral bone. TβRI inhibitors achieved these effects by increasing osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, while reducing osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Furthermore, they induced the expression of Runx2 and EphB4, which promote osteoblast differentiation, and ephrinB2, which antagonizes osteoclast differentiation. Through these anabolic and anti-catabolic effects, TβRI inhibitors coordinate changes in multiple bone parameters, including bone mass, architecture, matrix mineral concentration and material properties, that collectively increase bone fracture resistance. Therefore, TβRI inhibitors may be effective in treating conditions of skeletal fragility."
https://openalex.org/W2128157469,"Preventing and delaying the emergence of drug resistance is an essential goal of antimalarial drug development. Monotherapy and highly mutable drug targets have each facilitated resistance, and both are undesirable in effective long-term strategies against multi-drug-resistant malaria. Haem remains an immutable and vulnerable target, because it is not parasite-encoded and its detoxification during haemoglobin degradation, critical to parasite survival, can be subverted by drug-haem interaction as in the case of quinolines and many other drugs. Here we describe a new antimalarial chemotype that combines the haem-targeting character of acridones, together with a chemosensitizing component that counteracts resistance to quinoline antimalarial drugs. Beyond the essential intrinsic characteristics common to deserving candidate antimalarials (high potency in vitro against pan-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, efficacy and safety in vivo after oral administration, inexpensive synthesis and favourable physicochemical properties), our initial lead, T3.5 (3-chloro-6-(2-diethylamino-ethoxy)-10-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-acridone), demonstrates unique synergistic properties. In addition to 'verapamil-like' chemosensitization to chloroquine and amodiaquine against quinoline-resistant parasites, T3.5 also results in an apparently mechanistically distinct synergism with quinine and with piperaquine. This synergy, evident in both quinoline-sensitive and quinoline-resistant parasites, has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, this innovative acridone design merges intrinsic potency and resistance-counteracting functions in one molecule, and represents a new strategy to expand, enhance and sustain effective antimalarial drug combinations."
https://openalex.org/W1998329763,"Over the past 100 years, changes in the food supply in Western nations have resulted in alterations in dietary fatty acid consumption, leading to a dramatic increase in the ratio of omega-6 (ω6) to ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in circulation and in tissues. Increased ω6/ω3 ratios are hypothesized to increase inflammatory mediator production, leading to higher incidence of inflammatory diseases, and may impact inflammatory gene expression. To determine the effect of reducing the ω6/ω3 ratio on expression of inflammatory pathway genes in mononuclear cells, healthy humans were placed on a controlled diet for 1 week, then given fish oil and borage oil for an additional 4 weeks. Serum and neutrophil fatty acid composition and ex vivo leukotriene B4 production from stimulated neutrophils were measured at the start and end of the supplementation period and after a 2-week washout. RNA was isolated from mononuclear cells and expression of PI3K, Akt, NFκB, and inflammatory cytokines was measured by real-time PCR. A marked increase was seen in serum and neutrophil levels of long-chain ω3 PUFA concomitant with a reduction in the ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio (40%). The ex vivo capacity of stimulated neutrophils to produce leukotriene B4 was decreased by 31%. Expression of PI3Kα and PI3Kγ and the quantity of PI3Kα protein in mononuclear cells was reduced after supplementation, as was the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines. These data reveal that PUFA may exert their clinical effects via their capacity to regulate the expression of signal transduction genes and genes for proinflammatory cytokines.

These data reveal that PUFA may exert their clinical effects via their capacity to regulate the expression of signal transduction genes and genes for proinflammatory cytokines. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the fatty acid composition of complex lipids (such as triglycerides) in Western diets has changed dramatically, largely due to a marked increase in the consumption of omega-6 (ω6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 2The abbreviations used are:PUFApolyunsaturated fatty acidPBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellFAMEfatty acid methyl esterLTleukotrieneEPAeicosapentaenoic acidDPAdocosapentaenoic acidILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorAAarachidonic acidDGLAdihomo-γ-linolenic acidPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. and a concomitant decrease in the consumption of omega-3 (ω3) PUFA (1.Kris-Etherton P.M.

Nutr. 2002; 21: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The increased ingestion of ω6 PUFA is due in large part to growth in the production and consumption of vegetable oils, beef, pork, and poultry and has been exacerbated by changes in livestock husbandry and feeding practices (3.Cordain L. Watkins B.A. Florant G.L. Kelher M. Rogers L. Li Y. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 56: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This together with a reduced consumption of wild, fatty fish containing high concentrations of ω3 PUFA has resulted in lower ω3 intake and in ω6/ω3 ratios in the United States diet of greater than 10:1. Anthropological evidence suggests that our hunter-gatherer ancestors maintained a ratio closer to 2:1 for ∼100,000 generations (3.Cordain L. Watkins B.A. Florant G.L. Kelher M. Rogers L. Li Y. Eur.

This dietary change is postulated to enhance circulating and cellular pro-inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids and cytokines) and reduce anti-inflammatory mediators, resulting in an overall increase in systemic inflammation and a higher incidence of allergic and inflammatory disease including asthma, allergies, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. polyunsaturated fatty acid peripheral blood mononuclear cell fatty acid methyl ester leukotriene eicosapentaenoic acid docosapentaenoic acid interleukin tumor necrosis factor arachidonic acid dihomo-γ-linolenic acid phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, despite 50 years of research supporting the efficacy of long chain PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 20:6, ω3) in treating inflammatory diseases, a great deal remains unknown regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for their potent biological effects. The most studied mechanisms center around the observation that shifts in dietary consumption of ω6 and ω3 PUFA lead to alterations in the quantities of ω6 and ω3-derived eicosanoids produced in animals and humans, thereby disturbing the balance of lipid-based pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators produced at sites of inflammation. For example, the 4-series leukotrienes (LT) (e.g. LTB4) produced by the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) on the ω6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4) are highly inflammatory, while the 5-series LT (e.g. LTB5) produced from the ω3 PUFA EPA are 10–100-fold less active (5.Miller A.M. van Bekkum D.W.

Alternatively, the presence of high concentrations of ω3 PUFA, or shifts in ω6/ω3 ratios may modulate the expression of genes known to be critical to inflammatory processes. Curtis et al.

Similarly, mice fed fish oil have decreased mRNA levels for numerous inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in kidney, spleen, and peritoneal macrophages (8.Calder P.C. Lipids. 2001; 36: 1007-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 9.Calder P.C. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2002; 61: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In vitro studies from our laboratory suggest that AA alters cell cycle progression and apoptosis via its capacity to regulate several members of the AP1 family of transcription factors (10.Monjazeb A.M. High K.P. Connoy A. Hart L.S. Koumenis C. Chilton F.H. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, the majority of studies examining PUFA and gene expression have been carried out in isolated cell systems and a few animal studies. This raises the question of whether the observed alterations in gene expression apply to humans. The current study has utilized a dietary intervention strategy in which healthy humans were fed controlled diets including dietary supplements containing specific dosages of short chain (18 carbon) PUFA and long chain (>20 carbon) PUFA in a manner, which is consistent with our understanding of early human diets. These experiments suggest that altering circulating levels of ω6 and ω3 PUFA likely influences inflammatory responses in part by the capacity of these fatty acids or their metabolites to regulate the expression of early signal transduction genes and to block the expression of pivotal cytokines and chemokines at a transcriptional level. Triheptadecanoin internal standard was purchased from Nu-Check Prep (Elsyian, MN). Isolymph was purchased from Gallard-Schlesinger (Plainview, NY). Ionophore A23187 was purchased from Calbiochem. TRIzol reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. All reverse transcription reagents and Sybr Green PCR Master Mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All forward and reverse primer pairs were purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). Protran nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell (Keene, NH). Anti-β-actin and anti-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and anti-PI3K p110α antibody was purchased from US Biological (Swampscott, MA). All other chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Healthy human volunteers (n = 27) were screened for exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study in groups of three to five. The volunteers were provided with a background diet for 5 weeks. After 1 week on the diet they were given dietary supplements containing fish oil (775 mg EPA/day) and borage oil (831 mg GLA/day) for 4 weeks. The study period was followed by a two-week washout period during which the volunteers resumed their normal diets. Fasting blood draws were performed once per week, and urine samples were collected. Approximately 30 ml of whole blood was mixed with 6 ml of Isolymph and allowed to settle at room temperature for 1 h. The plasma layer was spun, and the cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to separate red blood cells, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMCs were removed, washed several times in cold PBS to remove all traces of Isolymph, then counted and resuspended in PBS. Contaminating red blood cells were removed from the neutrophil pellet via hypotonic lysis with 0.2% NaCl, and neutrophils were resuspended in Hank's buffer plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. 1-ml aliquots of neutrophils were preincubated in a 37 °C water bath, then stimulated for 5 min with 2 μm or 5 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2.5 mm in DMSO). The stimulation was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice cold Hank's buffer followed by centrifugation at 200 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The neutrophil pellet was used for fatty acid analysis, and the supernatant was combined with 250 ng of PGB2 internal standard, acidified with two drops of 9% formic acid and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried under N2 and resuspended in methanol/water (0.45:0.55) for HPLC analysis. Leukotrienes were separated on an Agilent Zorbax ODS analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a Hewlett Packard Series 1050 instrument equipped with a Hewlett Packard 1040M diode array detector and an Agilent 1200 series autosampler. The solvent system was as described previously (11.Chilton F.H. Patel M. Fonteh A.N. Hubbard W.C. Triggiani M. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Data were processed using a Hewlett Packard Compac computer and Agilent Chemstation software. Quantification of the leukotrienes was by reference to the internal standard. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared following a modification of the protocol by Metcalfe et al. (12.Metcalfe L.D. Schmitz A.A. Pelka J.R. Anal. Chem. 1966; 38: 514-515Crossref Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Serum samples (100 μl) were added to tubes containing 25 μg of triheptadecanoin (C17:0) as internal standard, and saponified with EtOH and 50% KOH at 60 °C for 30 min. Neutral lipids were then extracted and discarded. The samples were acidified, and the fatty acids were extracted into hexane. Samples were brought to dryness under nitrogen, incubated for 5 min at 100 °C with 0.5 n NaOH in methanol and FAME were prepared by incubation with 12% boron trifluoride for an additional 5 min at 100 °C. The FAME were extracted into hexane, blown to dryness under nitrogen, and resuspended in a small volume of isooctane for the GC analysis. The FAME were separated using a CP Select CB for FAME capillary GC column (100 m × 0.25 mm ID, film thickness 0.25 μm) and a HP 5890 temperature-programmed GC with H2 as the carrier gas and helium as the make-up gas. The fatty acid distribution was determined via reference to the internal standard. RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's directions. The RNA concentrations were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 2.5 units/μl MuLV reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, and 2.5 μm random hexamers in PCR Buffer II. The reaction mixture was heated to 42 °C for 15 min, then 99 °C for 5 min, then held at 5 °C for at least 5 min. Real-time quantitative PCR of the cDNA template was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 SDS (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reaction contained 150 ng of cDNA, 10 μm forward and reverse primers, and 12.5 μl of 2× RT2 Real-Time Sybr Green PCR Master Mix in a total volume of 25 μl. The PCR cycling conditions were: hold for 10 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Results were calculated as expression of the target gene relative to expression of the reference gene (GAPDH). PBMCs were pelleted and lysed by addition of 1 ml of TRIzol reagent per 106 cells. Protein was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of protein was electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibodies that recognize Akt, PI3K, and β-actin, followed by infrared fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for detection and quantification using the Odyssey Infared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). All data were analyzed using two-tailed paired Student's t-tests to compare the week 1 value to the week 5 value, or the week 5 value to the week 7 value, with a significance level of 0.05. Healthy human volunteers were placed on a background control diet for 5 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period. This diet contained 27% fat, 18% protein, and 55% carbohydrate and maintained dietary AA, EPA, and DHA levels below 100 mg/day. After 1 week on the diet, study participants were placed on two supplements: borage oil (containing the short [18 carbon], ω6 fatty acid, γ-linolenic acid [GLA], and other 18 carbon ω6 fatty acids) and fish oil (containing the long [≥20 carbon] chain ω3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA). Serum was collected and circulating fatty acids were measured at week 1 and after 4 weeks (week 5) of supplementation with fish oil and borage oil. Fig. 1 shows the change in the levels of key serum fatty acids from week 1 to week 5 and following the 2-week washout (week 7). Fig. 1A shows the biochemical pathway responsible for the conversion of short chain ω6 and ω3 PUFA to long chain PUFA. There was a significant increase in GLA and its elongation metabolite dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3, ω6) after supplementation; both decreased significantly during the washout (Fig. 1B). Similarly, EPA and its elongation metabolites DPA (22:5, ω3) and DHA increased significantly after dietary supplementation with borage and fish oil. All three ω3 PUFA decreased to essentially starting values during the washout. Fig. 1C shows a small but statistically significant increase in AA, possibly due to a portion of GLA in the borage oil supplement being converted to AA via elongation and desaturation by the Δ5 desaturase; however, AA levels also returned to baseline following the washout. The ratios of all ω6 to ω3 PUFA, long chain ω6 to ω3 PUFA, and AA to EPA are shown in Fig. 1D. From week 1 to week 5, the overall ω6 to ω3 PUFA ratio decreased by 40%, from a ratio of ∼15:1 typical of a Western diet to less than 9:1, followed by a return to the starting level after the washout. The ratio of long-chain ω6 to long-chain ω3 PUFA decreased by 39%, while the ratio of AA to EPA decreased by 75%, and both increased from week 5 to week 7. Similar to serum, the fatty acid composition of circulating neutrophils reflected the changes in the diet (Fig. 2). Both EPA and its elongation metabolite DPA increased significantly from week 1 to week 5, followed by a decrease to near baseline values 2 weeks after completing the supplementation (washout). Additionally, there was a statistically significant increase in DGLA, the elongation product of GLA from the borage oil, from week 1 to week 5. Levels of DGLA were returning to baseline values 2 weeks after completion of the supplementation. There was no difference (from baseline) in AA levels within neutrophil glycerolipids after the supplementation. Previous experiments from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the ex vivo capacity of neutrophils to produce leukotrienes is a reliable pharmacodynamic marker to gauge the effect of specific diets on systemic eicosanoid production (11.Chilton F.H. Patel M. Fonteh A.N. Hubbard W.C. Triggiani M. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13.Barham J.B. Edens M.B. Fonteh A.N. Johnson M.M. Easter L.

Nutr. 1997; 127: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood and stimulated before supplementation (week 1), after supplementation (week 5), and again after a 2-week washout period (week 7). LTB4, 20-hydroxy and 20-carboxyl LTB4, as well as the two non-enzymatic isomers of LTB4 were measured by reverse phase HPLC from 11 of the initial study subjects (Fig. 3). LTB4 production decreased by 31% after 4 weeks of supplementation with fish oil and borage oil, and ten out of eleven subjects (the responders) responded to the diet with an average decrease of 55%. Two weeks after returning to individual diets, leukotriene levels returned to baseline values, on average. These data indicate that altering the ω6 and ω3 PUFA intake in healthy subjects with fish oil and borage oil supplementation markedly alters the composition of supplementation fatty acids in neutrophil glycerolipids and inhibits the capacity of neutrophils to produce leukotrienes, a putative marker of inflammation. The next series of experiments were designed to determine whether leukotrienes may be inhibited at least in part by the effects of dietary fatty acids on the expression of enzymes that participate in leukotriene generation. Studies to date indicate that it is difficult to monitor global gene expression in terminal-differentiated, circulating neutrophils; therefore, to test this hypothesis, mRNA was isolated from a second type of circulating inflammatory cell, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. White blood cell differentials measured for each subject showed only a small, though significant, increase in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils after supplementation (Table 1). Initial experiments utilizing an inflammation-specific microarray demonstrated that supplementation caused no effect on message levels of enzymes that participate in leukotriene generation, including cytosolic group IV PLA2, 5-lipoygenase (5-LO), LTA4 hydrolase (also known as LTB4 synthase), and LTC4 synthase (data not shown).TABLE 1White blood cell differentialWeek 1Week 5Week 7Lymphocytes (per mm3)2.06 ± 0.082.21 ± 0.01a< 0.05 Week 1 vs. Week 5.2.19 ± 0.12Monocytes (per mm3)0.54 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.030.53 ± 0.04Eosinophils (per mm3)0.18 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.030.2 ± 0.03Basophils (per mm3)0.04 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.01Neutrophils (×108/dL serum)3.69 ± 0.394.43 ± 0.49a< 0.05 Week 1 vs. Week 5.4.39 ± 0.38ap < 0.05 Week 1 vs. Week 5. Open table in a new tab Numerous studies have implicated the PI 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway as having an important role in initiating early eicosanoid generation in response to several immunologic stimuli. Accordingly, the mRNA expression of the proximal signaling genes PI3Kα, Akt, and NFκB was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows that supplementation induced a large decrease in the expression of PI3Kα, which was maintained after the washout. Immunoblot analysis of protein from mononuclear cells supported the PCR results, with PI3Kα abundantly present at week 1 and present at much lower amounts at week 5 and week 7 (Fig. 4B). Downstream of PI3Kα, the expression of Akt (Fig. 4C) and NFκB (Fig. 4D) in circulating mononuclear cells was not significantly altered during supplementation, although expression of both increased upon washout. Akt protein remained constant at all time points (data not shown). The aforementioned experiments raised the question of whether the effects of supplementation observed with PI3Kα were observed with other PI3K isoforms. To address this, PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ were measured by real-time PCR. PI3Kγ mRNA was significantly decreased following supplementation while PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ remained unchanged following supplementation and washout (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Gene expression in mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood before supplementation (week 1), after supplementation (week 5), and after a 2-week washout (week 7). Gene expression was measured by real-time PCR for PI3Kβ (A), PI3Kδ (B), and PI3Kγ (C). Black bars represent mean expression. n = 6 for A and B, n = 12 for C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PI3K not only plays an important role in eicosanoid formation, but also in cell growth, survival, and inflammation by utilizing downstream effectors including Akt and NFκB, which in turn influence the production of a variety of signaling molecules such as cytokines. To better understand the potential overall effect of these dietary PUFA, the expression of eight cytokines known to play an important role in the inflammatory response was measured by real-time PCR. The expression of six cytokines involved in the immune response is shown in Fig. 6. A significant decrease in expression was observed for IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-23. Additionally, IL-5 and IL-17 showed strong trends toward decreased expression after supplementation. Changes were not seen for TNFα (p = 0.11) and IL-6 (p = 0.27) (data not shown). Only IL-1β showed a significant continued decrease from week 5 to week 7, while expression of the other cytokines showed trends toward increasing back to the baseline week 1 values during the washout. These washout results were not statistically significant, possibly due to the shorter duration of the washout period (2 weeks) compared with the treatment period (4 weeks), or due to metabolic differences between mononuclear cells and neutrophils. Research over the past 50 years has shown that ω3 PUFA have potent therapeutic effects in a wide variety of inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular disease (15.Christensen J.H. Gustenhoff P.

Huang S.Y. Chiu C.C. Shen W.W. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2003; 13: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It is not clear at this time whether it is the ratio of total ω6 to ω3 PUFAs, the ratio of long chain ω6 to ω3 PUFAs, or merely the presence of high concentrations of ω3 PUFAs (long or short chain) that is most important in determining the clinical effectiveness of these dietary oils. It is also uncertain how the PUFA and their metabolites exert their effects to alter the course of inflammation in such diseases. The aim of this study was to provide both long-chain ω3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) in fish oil and a short-chain ω6 fatty acid (GLA) in borage oil to identify the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which these fatty acids exert their effects. Two recent studies suggest that EPA/GLA combinations are especially effective in critical care patients suffering from sepsis (19.Pontes-Arruda A. Aragão A.M. Albuquerque J.D. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 34: 2325-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 20.Singer P. Theilla M. Fisher H. Gibstein L. Grozovski E. Cohen J. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 34: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Specifically, addition of relatively high concentrations of these oils decreased the amount of time patients were on the ventilator, decreased the number of days patients were in the ICU, and increased overall survival. An important aspect of the current study was that all participants were fed a controlled diet. This diet was provided at a caloric content necessary to maintain the body weight of each study subject while keeping the fat content equal for all individuals. A previous study from our laboratory which measured changes in serum fatty acid content with age determined that a controlled diet which normalizes background ingestion of fatty acids is necessary to observe consistent changes in circulating fatty acids in relatively small numbers of people (21.High K.P. Sinclair J. Easter L.H. Case D. Chilton F.H. J. Nutr. Health Aging. 2003; 7: 378-384PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies as well as others have demonstrated that ex vivo leukotriene production by neutrophils can serve as an important pharmacodynamic marker to determine the effects of leukotriene blockers in humans (11.Chilton F.H. Patel M. Fonteh A.N. Hubbard W.C. Triggiani M. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13.Barham J.B. Edens M.B. Fonteh A.N. Johnson M.M. Easter L.

Nutr. 1997; 127: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consequently leukotriene production was measured in eleven initial subjects, and we found that the fish oil/borage oil combination was sufficient to decrease leukotriene production. Moreover, this effect was reversed after the 2-week washout period (Fig. 3), similar to the reversal of ω3 and ω6 PUFA levels in serum and PMN (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). We next examined the influence of the supplements on the expression of enzymes directly responsible for leukotriene generation in circulating mononuclear cells, including group IV cPLA2, 5-LO, LTA4 hydrolase, and LTC4 synthase utilizing a combination of microarray technology and real-time PCR. These studies revealed no changes in the expression of any of the examined enzymes associated with leukotriene generation. This result suggests that the observed leukotriene inhibition was a consequence of the well-described effects of this type of supplementation on AA substrate availability and/or the production of alternative fatty acid substrates such as those from DGLA or EPA and not due to expression of key enzymes of leukotriene synthesis, consistent with the 2-week metabolic washout. Next, we evaluated whether the in vivo changes in eicosanoids could be explained by supplement-induced alterations of key signaling enzymes or transcription factors in the signal transduction pathways that lead to their biosynthesis. Surprisingly, altering PUFA ratios caused a dramatic decrease in PI3K expression and, in particular, the expression of PI3Kα and PI3Kγ. In contrast, there was no change in expression of the other PI3K isoforms, PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ, nor were there changes in message levels of the downstream effectors, Akt and NFκB. Although there was an increase in the number of lymphocytes from week 1 to week 5, this change was very small (<8%), suggesting that the changes we saw in gene expression were not due to a change in the composition of the white blood cells. PI3K is the initial step in a wide array of signaling pathways, controlling cellular processes from apoptosis to cell growth and differentiation, glucose transport to cell migration, and from eicosanoid and cytokine production to the leukocyte oxidative burst. Four distinct PI3K isoforms appear to be responsible for these activities. PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ are thought to play important roles in the inflammatory response (22.Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C.

The specific functions of PI3Kα and PI3Kβ are just beginning to be understood, with studies to date showing they are involved in control of glucose uptake and metabolism in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (25.Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar). Only a few studies have examined the regulation of PI3K expression. PUFA such as AA have been demonstrated to affect PI3K activity and phosphorylation. Addition of AA to PC-3 prostate cancer cells has been shown to induce at least ten NFκB-regulated genes, including IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Also, PI3K and Akt, both upstream regulators of the NFκB pathway, have been shown to be activated after AA addition (26.Hughes-Fulford M. Li C.F. Boonyaratanakornkit J. Sayyah S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first paper to demonstrate that altering either concentrations or ratios of circulating ω6 and ω3 PUFA directly affects the expression of specific PI3K isoforms. To better understand the effect of this combination of long-chain ω3 PUFA and short-chain ω6 PUFA on the immune response, message levels of several T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cytokines were measured from circulating mononuclear cells before and after supplementation. This area of immune regulation was examined because several studies have highlighted the connection between T cell phenotypes and PI3K expression/activation. Class IA PI3K has been shown to control the balance of the Th response by inducing the Th2 response (i.e. humoral immunity) and/or repressing the Th1 response (27.Fukao T. Tanabe M. Terauchi Y. Ota T. Matsuda S. Asano T. Kadowaki T. Takeuchi T. Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 28.Fukao T. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Terauchi Y. Ota T. Takayama T. Asano T. Takeuchi T. Kadowaki T. Hata Ji J. Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The Th1 response is thought to be supressed because PI3K inhibits IL-12 production from dendritic cells. Agonists that induce the production of IL-12 (e.g. TLR ligands such as LPS) typically activate PI3K, creating a negative feedback loop to encourage the Th2 antibody-mediated response (29.Guha M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32124-32132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 30.Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16445-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, PI3K negatively regulates TLR signaling at the first encounter with a pathogen, thereby turning off the Th1 response that is initiated by TLRs upon endotoxin binding (31.Moser M. Murphy K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 32.Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). The current study revealed that dietary supplementation had no effect on the Th1 cytokine IL-12 (Fig. 6A) but reduced the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-10 (Fig. 6B). It has been shown that allergy is characterized by an imbalance toward the Th2 response (33.Bach J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar); therefore, the current results suggest that altering cytokine profiles is a potential mechanism by which this fish oil/borage oil combination may influence allergic responses. The Th17 axis was also examined in this study. The current literature suggests Th17 immunity plays an important role in autoimmune diseases including irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis and blocking this cytokine network protects against autoimmune disease. Fig. 6, D and E show that supplementation blocks the expression of IL-1β and IL-23, both cytokines shown to enhance Th17 differentiation. Additionally, supplementation inhibits IL-17, a product of Th17 cells (Fig. 6F). These data suggest that in healthy populations, supplementation alters the profile of cytokines known to participate in inflammatory and autoimmune responses. In combination, changes in signaling molecule expression and cytokine production may provide prolonged changes in inflammatory responses relative to the rapidly re-equilibrating levels of PUFA and their metabolites. This suggests that effects of dietary PUFA differentially impact inflammatory leukocyte functions, as LTB4 production in neutrophils was more rapidly reversed than kinase levels and cytokine production from mononuclear cells during the washout. It has been hypothesized that the marked shift in ω6/ω3 fatty acids in the Western diet over the past three generations may be responsible, in part, for the increase in the risk and incidence of numerous inflammatory diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, diabetes, and inflammatory joint diseases. Further it has been suggested that returning PUFA concentrations and ratios in human diets to those that were found during early human development or those found in less developed populations would have anti-inflammatory effects and reduce the incidence of inflammatory diseases in the population. Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the apparent relationship between altered PUFA ratios and increased inflammation. This report demonstrates, for the first time in humans, that the expression of an early step (PI3K) in signal transduction, as well as several important downstream effectors, are significantly reduced by altering ingestion of PUFA to shift circulating ω6 to ω3 ratios. Whether this effect is due to higher overall levels of long chain ω3 PUFA or short chain ω6 PUFA or the ratio of ω6 to ω3 PUFA is beyond the scope of this in vivo study and is presently being examined in our laboratory. However, these data provide evidence that large changes in gene expression are likely an important mechanism by which PUFA exert their potent effects in clinical conditions. We thank B.

https://openalex.org/W1994324680,"HM1.24/Bst2/CD317 is a protein highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells and has unique topology with two membrane anchor domains, an NH2-terminal transmembrane domain and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol attached to the COOH terminus. We show here that human HM1.24 is localized not only on the cell surface but also in the trans-Golgi network and/or recycling endosomes, where it resides in detergent-resistant microdomains, lipid rafts. In contrast to other glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, HM1.24 was internalized from lipid rafts on the cell surface by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, a non-canonical tyrosine-based motif, which contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-6 and Tyr-8, present in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail, was essential for endocytosis through interaction with an Δa-adaptin, but not μ2-subunit, of the AP-2 complex. Indeed, an appendage domain of α-adaptin was identified as a protein interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of HM1.24. Furthermore, overexpression of the appendage domain of α-adaptin in cells depleted of α-adaptin could rescue the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of HM1.24 but not of the transferrin receptor. Taken together, our findings suggest that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of human HM1.24 from the cell surface lipid rafts is mediated by direct interaction with α-adaptin.

Taken together, our findings suggest that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of human HM1.24 from the cell surface lipid rafts is mediated by direct interaction with α-adaptin. HM1.24 was originally identified as a plasma cell-specific antigen by a mouse monoclonal antibody generated for the development of a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma cells (1.Ozaki S. Kosaka M. Wakatsuki S. Abe M. Koishihara Y. Matsumoto T. Blood. 1997; 90: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequences deduced from cDNA cloning (2.Ohtomo T. Sugamata Y. Ozaki Y. Ono K. Yoshimura Y. Kawai S. Koishihara Y. Ozaki S. Kosaka M. Hirano T. Tsuchiya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it was found that HM1.24 is identical to BST2, which was identified as a bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (3.Ishikawa J. Kaisho T. Tomizawa H. Lee B.O. Kobune Y. Inazaka J. Oritani K. Itoh M. Ochi T. Ishihara K. Genomics. 1995; 26: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that HM1.24 serves as a target molecule for myeloma immunotherapy, because it is expressed preferentially on terminally differentiated normal and neoplastic B cells (4.Goto T. Kennel S.J. Abe M. Takishita M. Kosaka M. Solomon A. Saito S. Blood. 1994; 84: 1922-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, mouse or humanized monoclonal antibody against HM1.24 induces potent antitumor cell activity by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vivo or in vitro (1.Ozaki S. Kosaka M. Wakatsuki S. Abe M. Koishihara Y. Matsumoto T. Blood. 1997; 90: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, HM1.24 was designated CD317 and found to be highly expressed in all B cell stages of differentiation, on bone marrow CD34+ cells, and also on T cells (6.Vidal-Laliena M. Romero X. March S. Requena V. Petriz J. Engel P. Cell. Immunol. 2005; 236: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to myeloma cells, overexpression of HM1.24 has also been described in a wide variety of invasive solid tumor cell lines (7.Walter-Yohrling J. Cao X. Callahan M. Weber W. Morgenbesser S. Madden S.L. Wang C. Teicher B.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8939-8947PubMed Google Scholar), in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (8.Grützmann R. Boriss H. Ammerpohl O. Lüttges J. Kalthoff H.

Although the mechanism by which HM1.24 is overexpressed remains to be elucidated, in the promoter region of the HM1.24 gene (BST2), a tandem repeat of three cis elements for a transcription factor, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, which mediates interleukin-6 response gene expression, is contained upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Human HM1.24 has 180 amino acids and was originally postulated as a type II transmembrane protein, which is composed of a 21-amino acid NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain and a large extracellular domain containing two possible N-glycosylation sites, giving a molecular mass of 29–33 kDa. By immunoscreening of a rat liver cDNA expression library, Kupzig et al. (13.Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) have identified the rat homolog of human HM1.24. Rat HM1.24 is anchored in lipid rafts at the cell surface via a putative COOH-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI), but the transmembrane domain near the NH2 terminus lies outside the lipid rafts (13.Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), thereby possessing unique topology. Rat HM1.24 localizes to, and continuously cycles between, the cell surface and the TGN. On the other hand, human HM1.24 shares only ∼34 and 36% identity with rat and hamster homologues, respectively (13.Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 14.Li X. Kaloyanova D. van Eijk M. Eerland R. van der Goot G. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Lottspeich F. Starkuviene V. Wieland F.T. Helms J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hamster HM1.24, identified as a Golgi-resident GPI-anchored protein, has been reported to be involved in maintenance of the Golgi structure (14.Li X. Kaloyanova D. van Eijk M. Eerland R. van der Goot G. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Lottspeich F. Starkuviene V. Wieland F.T. Helms J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Golgi localization of Golgi-resident GPI-anchored protein requires a tandem repeat of the EQ sequence, which is not contained in other homologs; therefore, divergence of the HM1.24 sequence among species may cause differences in its cellular function and/or biological property. While this report was in preparation, Rollason et al. (15.Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Schu P. Banting G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) reported that rat HM1.24 is internalized from the cell surface in a clathrin-dependent manner. Internalization of rat HM1.24 is dependent upon a dual tyrosine motif in its NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which is recognized by the μ2-subunit of AP-2 complex. Moreover, after endocytosis rat HM1.24 delivered to an early endosome is subsequently transported to the TGN through recognition of the cytoplasmic domain by the μ1-subunit of AP-1 complex, suggesting the involvement of the sequential action of AP-2 and AP-1 complexes in internalization and delivery back to the TGN of rat HM1.24. Despite the critical requirement of the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail lying outside lipid rafts for trafficking of rat HM1.24, lipid raft association is required for efficient internalization of rat HM1.24. Consistent with rat HM1.24 (15.Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Schu P. Banting G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we also show that human HM1.24 localizes to the cell surface and internal compartments, presumably the TGN and/or recycling endosomes, and is internalized from lipid rafts on the cell surface in a clathrin-dependent manner with a non-canonical dual Tyr motif. Notably, we have identified the appendage domain of α-adaptin as an interacting partner for the cytoplasmic tail of HM1.24. Furthermore, the appendage domain of α-adaptin specifically recognized the dual tyrosine motif and was necessary and sufficient for the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of HM1.24 from lipid rafts. Culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from GIBCO Invitrogen.

For immunofluorescence experiments, the cells were plated onto 13-mm coverslips the day before transfection. After 36 h, the cells were used for immunocytochemical experiments. Humanized monoclonal antibodies against HM1.24 carrying the Fc region derived from human IgG1κ were described previously (16.Ono K. Ohtomo T. Yoshida K. Yoshimura Y. Kawai S. Koishihara Y. Ozaki S.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HM1.24 were raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the extracellular domain corresponding to amino acid residues 49–162. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to human LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to γ-adaptin, α-adaptin, β2-adaptin, μ2-subunit (AP50), EEA1, GM130, flotillin, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to caveolin-1 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD59 and FLAG-M2 and -M5 were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to TfnR were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to rat cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (MPR300) were described previously (17.Hirosako K. Imasato H. Hirota Y. Kuronita T.

Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (18.Hirota Y. Kuronita T. Fujita H. Tanaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on coverslips were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS for 15 min. Cells were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution, as described previously (19.Kuronita T. Eskelinen E.L. Fujita H. Saftig P. Himeno M. Tanaka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4117-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 30 min with Alexa488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies. Coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol onto glass slides, and the cells were analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss LMS 510 META equipped with an argon/HeNe laser and a Zeiss 100×/1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens. Photographic images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Cells cultured on 35-mm dishes were washed with PBS, scraped, and homogenized in PBS/1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitor mixture. 100 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher and Schüll), which was subsequently blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100 (TBS-T), 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human HM1.24, followed by washing with TBS-T. Subsequently, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody was performed for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with TBS-T. Blots were finally analyzed using the ECL Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa, ARH77, and U937 cells were suspended in 1% Triton X-100 containing TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were then mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in TKM buffer. The mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and sequentially overlaid with 35 and 5% sucrose in TKM buffer. The discontinuous sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 20 h in an SW65 rotor (Hitachi Co.), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube. HeLa cells were incubated with the antibody to HM1.24 (2 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. For Tfn internalization, cells cultured on coverslips were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then with Alexa488- or Cy3-labeled Tfn (25 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. After internalization, HM1.24 antibody and Alexa488- or Cy3-labeled Tfn present on the cell surface were removed by 3 × 10 min in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. HeLa cells were incubated with the antibody to HM1.24 (2 μg/ml) and Alexa488-Tfn (50 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C for 5 min. HM1.24 antibody and Alexa488-Tfn present on the cell surface were removed by acid wash, and cells were left in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Pharmacological treatment was performed as described previously by Di Guglielmo et al. (20.Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) except that nystatin and MβCD were used at 25 μm and 10 mm, respectively. The complete open reading frame of human HM1.24 was PCR-amplified from the HeLa cell cDNA library using specific primers and was cloned into the BamHI/KpnI restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) by adding appropriate restriction sites to PCR primers. Point mutations of the HM1.24 tail were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's manual. For the construct of HN1.24dNT, the NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence of rat LGP107 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–23 and the extracellular domain of HM1.24 corresponding to amino acid residues 49–180 were jointed by splicing with the overlap extension method as described previously (21.Kuronita T. Hatano T. Furuyama A. Hirota Y. Masuyama N. Saftig P. Himeno M. Fujita H. Tanaka Y. Traffic. 2005; 6: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HM1.24dCT was obtained by deleting amino acids 163–180 of full-length HM1.24. All constructs were ligated within BamHI and XbaI sites in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The cDNA of human Eps15 obtained from Open Biosystem was used as a template to generate the cDNA fragment encoding domain DIII corresponding to amino acid residues 529–897. DIII domain, obtained by PCR amplification, was cloned into the BamHI/SalI restriction sites of pEGFP-C1. DNA encoding full-length Dyn2 was amplified by PCR from the human brain cDNA library and cloned into the BglII/KpnI of pEGFP-N1. Dyn2-K44A was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The AP-2 α-adaptin appendage domain corresponding to amino acid residues 700–939 (α700–939) or 793–939 (α793–939) was amplified by PCR using full-length human AP-2 α-adaptin (Open Biosystem) as a template. FLAG-tagged α700–939 or α793–939 was cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The DNA sequence of the constructs was always confirmed by dideoxy chain reaction termination sequencing, using the DNA Sequencing kit (BigDyeTM Termination Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction, ABI PRISM) and ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (ABI PRISM). Transfections were carried out with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, the cells were used for immunocytochemical or biochemical experiments. The MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid 3 (Clontech) was used. The cytoplasmic tail of HM1.24 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–21 was cloned into pGBKT7, and the plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 followed by screening a pACT2 HeLa cell cDNA library (Clontech). For interaction of the cytoplasmic tail HM1.24 with μ1A-subunit, μ2-subunit, or α-adaptin appendage domain, DNA fragments corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of HM1.24 were cloned into pGBKT7, cotransfected with pGADT7-μ1A-subunit, pGADT7-μ2-subunit, or pGADT7-α-adaptin appendage domain into yeast strain AH109. Constructs encoding full-length μ1A- and μ2-subunits (a kind gift from Dr. J. S. Bonifacino, National Institutes of Health) or fragments of α-adaptin were generated by PCR using plasmid DNA as a template. Transformation of yeast AH109 cells with the indicated constructs was performed by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMARKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech). The transformed yeast cells were isolated by growth on defined medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Protein-protein interaction was monitored by growing on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, or leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine at 30 °C for 3–4 days.

HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments were performed 48–72 h after siRNA transfection. We first examined the expression and localization of HM1.24 in several human cell lines using a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for human HM1.24 (1.Ozaki S. Kosaka M. Wakatsuki S. Abe M. Koishihara Y. Matsumoto T. Blood. 1997; 90: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of HM1.24 was found in human myeloma cells, ARH77 and U937, HeLa, and A431 cells, but not in HEK293, U251, and human skin fibroblast cell lines, in both immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses, indicating the cell-type specific expression of HM1.24. As previously described (2.Ohtomo T. Sugamata Y. Ozaki Y. Ono K. Yoshimura Y. Kawai S. Koishihara Y. Ozaki S. Kosaka M. Hirano T. Tsuchiya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), two broad bands with molecular masses ranging from 29 to 33 and 50 to 66 kDa, which correspond to the monomer and dimer, respectively, were detected. In these cells, HM1.24 was distributed both on the cell surface and around the perinuclear region in immunofluorescence analyses, consistent with the results reported previously (13.Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To examine the perinuclear localization of HM1.24, we carried out double staining experiments using several organelle-specific antibodies. To this end, we used HeLa cells, which have a larger cytoplasm than the other cell lines used here, making it easier to distinguish the perinuclear localization of HM1.24. The perinuclear localization of HM1.24 partially co-localized with a cis-Golgi marker GM130, the TGN marker GGA3, and a recycling endosome marker TfnR (Fig. 2). Little HM1.24 was, however, seen in vesicular compartments positive for a late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP-2 or an early endosome marker EEA1, indicating that HM1.24 is localized to the TGN and/or recycling endosomes, as well as the cell surface. Such a dual localization of HM1.24 also partially overlapped with caveolin-1 (Fig. 2), which is localized to the cell surface and TGN and/or endosomes as well as caveosomes (25.Pelkmans L. Helenius A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 associates with lipid rafts that have been referred to as a specific membrane microdomain enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (26.van Deurs B. Roepstorff K. Hommelgaard A.M. Sandvig K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 92-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Proteins associated with lipid rafts have the characteristic of resistance to solubilization by nonionic detergent, such as Triton X-100 (27.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). In fact, <10% of total HM1.24 was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100. Effective solubilization of HM1.24 was achieved with 1% SDS (Fig. 3A). To further assess whether HM1.24 resides in lipid rafts, HeLa, ARH77, or U937 cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C and subjected to discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3B, HM1.24 was predominantly detected in low density fractions, where both caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, lipid raft markers (28.Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 29.Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), were also recovered. Because the expression of caveolin-1 was very low in ARH77 cells and undetectable in U937 cells (Fig. 1C), flotillin-1 was used as a lipid raft marker in these cells. Regardless of the result that ∼30% of total HM1.24 was expressed on the cell surface when assayed by the biotinylation of cell surface proteins (data not shown), >95% of HM1.24 was recovered from lipid raft fractions. It is suggested, therefore, that HM1.24 localized to not only the cell surface but also to the TGN resides in lipid rafts. The results of Fig. 3C further show that the GPI-anchor domain of HM1.24 is necessary for its localization to lipid rafts. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment of cells increased the amount of HM1.24 in Triton X-100 extracts, whereas a non-GPI protein, caveolin-1, was resistant to Triton X-100, even after PI-PLC treatment. Despite the lipid raft localization, the distribution of HM1.24 partially overlapped TfnR. To address whether this reflects the endocytic pathway of HM1.24, cells preincubated with HM1.24 antibody and Cy3-Tfn or Rh-EGF at 4 °C were further chased for 10 or 30 min at 37 °C, and distribution of the internalized antibody was compared with that of internalized Cy3-Tfn or Rh-EGF using confocal laser microscopy. To visualize the antibody internalized at 37 °C, the surface-bound HM1.24 antibody was stripped by an acid wash, which was sufficient to remove >90% of surface-bound HM1.24 antibody (data not shown). Despite some punctuate staining of HM1.24 antibody on the cell surface co-localized with Cy3-Tfn and Rh-EGF, after 10 and 30 min of internalization, most of the HM1.24 antibody was seen in numerous small vesicles around the perinuclear region, where it co-localized extensively with Cy3-Tfn internalized simultaneously (Fig. 4A). Such co-localization between the HM1.24 antibody and Alexa488-Tfn has already been seen in numerous small vesicles at 5 min after internalization (see Fig. 4B). On the other hand, some internalized HM1.24 antibodies co-localized with Rh-EGF after 10 min of internalization, whereas they were delivered to distinct vesicular compartments after 30 min of internalization (Fig. 4A), suggesting that, after internalization, HM1.24 is mainly transported to recycling endosomes and/or the TGN without being significantly delivered to late endosomes/lysosomes, to which endocytosed EGF is destined to be degraded. To exclude the possibility that the internalization of HM1.24 was merely triggered by binding with antibodies, we performed a cell surface biotinylation assay. HeLa cells, which were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h and chased for 1 h, the time necessary for the maximum appearance of newly synthesized HM1.24 on the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), were biotinylated with cleavable, membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS- SS biotin and further incubated at 37 °C for varying times to allow internalization. After chasing for the indicated times, biotins remaining on the cell surface were cleaved by membrane-impermeable sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate to detect only internalized molecules. Because the precursor of HM1.24, which is an endoglycosidase H-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum form, was not biotinylated (supplemental Fig. S1A), it is suggested that only extracellular portion of HM1.24 was labeled with"
https://openalex.org/W2144459165,"Background Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with an increased future risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Hypoxia in utero is a common clinical cause of fetal growth restriction. We have previously shown that chronic hypoxia alters cardiovascular development in chick embryos. The aim of this study was to further characterize cardiac disease in hypoxic chick embryos. Methods Chick embryos were exposed to hypoxia and cardiac structure was examined by histological methods one day prior to hatching (E20) and at adulthood. Cardiac function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography and ex vivo by contractility measurements in isolated heart muscle bundles and isolated cardiomyocytes. Chick embryos were exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its scavenger soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sFlt-1) to investigate the potential role of this hypoxia-regulated cytokine. Principal Findings Growth restricted hypoxic chick embryos showed cardiomyopathy as evidenced by left ventricular (LV) dilatation, reduced ventricular wall mass and increased apoptosis. Hypoxic hearts displayed pump dysfunction with decreased LV ejection fractions, accompanied by signs of diastolic dysfunction. Cardiomyopathy caused by hypoxia persisted into adulthood. Hypoxic embryonic hearts showed increases in VEGF expression. Systemic administration of rhVEGF165 to normoxic chick embryos resulted in LV dilatation and a dose-dependent loss of LV wall mass. Lowering VEGF levels in hypoxic embryonic chick hearts by systemic administration of sFlt-1 yielded an almost complete normalization of the phenotype. Conclusions/Significance Our data show that hypoxia causes a decreased cardiac performance and cardiomyopathy in chick embryos, involving a significant VEGF-mediated component. This cardiomyopathy persists into adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2113283898,"The majority of new drug approvals for cancer are based on existing therapeutic targets. One approach to the identification of novel targets is to perform high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) cellular viability screens. We describe a novel approach combining RNAi screening in multiple cell lines with gene expression and genomic profiling to identify novel cancer targets. We performed parallel RNAi screens in multiple cancer cell lines to identify genes that are essential for viability in some cell lines but not others, suggesting that these genes constitute key drivers of cellular survival in specific cancer cells. This approach was verified by the identification of PIK3CA, silencing of which was selectively lethal to the MCF7 cell line, which harbours an activating oncogenic PIK3CA mutation. We combined our functional RNAi approach with gene expression and genomic analysis, allowing the identification of several novel kinases, including WEE1, that are essential for viability only in cell lines that have an elevated level of expression of this kinase. Furthermore, we identified a subset of breast tumours that highly express WEE1 suggesting that WEE1 could be a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer. In conclusion, this strategy represents a novel and effective strategy for the identification of functionally important therapeutic targets in cancer."

With the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo, current models suggest that lipids modulate the natural equilibrium between resting and desensitized conformations. We show that the lipid-inactivated nAChR is not desensitized, instead it adopts a novel conformation where the allosteric coupling between its neurotransmitter-binding sites and transmembrane pore is lost. The uncoupling is accompanied by an unmasking of previously buried residues, suggesting weakened association between structurally intact agonist-binding and transmembrane domains.

These data combined with the extensive literature on Cys-loop receptor-lipid interactions suggest that the M4 transmembrane helix plays a key role as a lipid-sensor, translating bilayer properties into altered nAChR function. Neurotransmission at chemical synapses is fundamental to the propagation of electrical signals within the nervous system. Central to this process is the ability of Cys-loop receptors to convert a chemical input into an electrical output by conducting ions across the synaptic membrane in response to neurotransmitter binding (1Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, this not only requires the ability to bind agonist and conduct ions, but also the ability to effectively translate agonist binding into ion channel opening/gating. The agonist-binding sites, which are located on the extra-membranous surface of the receptor, are thus allosterically coupled to the distant transmembrane ion pore (Fig. 1). Factors that affect the ability of Cys-loop receptors to bind agonist, conduct ions, and/or couple agonist binding to ion channel gating have the potential to modulate the synaptic response, and thus influence the transmission of electrical signals. One factor that is known to affect the activity of several Cys-loop receptors is the lipid composition of the membrane in which they are embedded (2Barrantes F.J. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Initial studies showed that to preserve a fully functional nAChR, the receptor must be purified in the presence of exogenous lipid and then reconstituted into a membrane with a particular lipid composition (5Fong T.M.

The consensus is that both cholesterol (Chol) and anionic lipids (such as phosphatidic acid; PA) are required in a reconstituted phosphatidylcholine (PC) membrane to provide an optimal environment. Chol and PA both increase the proportion of nAChRs stabilized in an agonist-activatable conformation (10Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As the chemical labeling pattern of the non-activatable PC-nAChR is similar to that of the desensitized nAChR, it has been suggested that lipids modulate the natural equilibrium between resting and desensitized receptors (8daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Hamouda A.K. Sanghvi M. Sauls D. Machu T.K.

The lack of detailed characterization of the inactive PC-nAChR conformation has prevented the development of descriptive models of nAChR-lipid interactions. It is this lack of definitive insight into the lipid-dependent nAChR conformations that is addressed here. As a first step toward understanding how lipids influence function, we characterize here the activatable and non-activatable conformations of the Torpedo nAChR stabilized in PC/PA/Chol (PC/PA/Chol-nAChR) and PC (PC-nAChR) membranes. We show that lipid-dependent inactivation is not related to agonist-induced desensitization. Instead, PC-nAChR adopts a novel conformation in which allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding sites and transmembrane pore is lost (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, uncoupling leads to a substantial increase in solvent accessibility, with minimal effects on nAChR secondary structure and thermal stability. Together, our data show that the lipid environment surrounding the nAChR transmembrane domain influences communication between the intact agonist-binding and transmembrane pore domains. In the context of recent structural and mutagenesis data, our findings suggest that the lipid-exposed transmembrane M4 helix acts as a lipid-sensor modulating interactions at a coupling interface between the two domains. The existence of this novel uncoupled conformation could explain how membrane-soluble allosteric modulators (including lipids) influence Cys-loop receptor function. Native nAChR-enriched Torpedo membranes (i.e. native-nAChR) and affinity purified and reconstituted membranes of defined lipid composition were prepared as described previously (8daCosta C.J.

The fluorescence of ethidium bromide emission was measured at 590 nm with 500 nm excitation. [3H]Acetylcholine equilibrium binding was determined using an ultrafiltration assay described elsewhere (15Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The same ultrafiltration protocol was used for measuring the total number of accessible [125I]α-bungarotoxin sites. See supplemental Experimental Procedures for a detailed description of all protocols. Affinity purified nAChR, reconstituted into proteoliposomes with different lipid compositions (supplemental Fig. S1), exhibits varying abilities to respond to agonist. Infrared difference spectroscopy (Fig. 2) is an effective tool for probing conformational change in these membrane environments because the technique provides a comprehensive map of the vibrational, and thus structural changes induced in the entire nAChR upon agonist binding (14Ryan S.E. Hill D.G. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10420-10426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Carbamylcholine (Carb) difference spectra recorded from native-nAChR, PC/PA/Chol-nAChR, and PC-nAChR all exhibit a number of positive vibrational bands due to nAChR-bound Carb (asterisk in Fig. 2A). The difference spectra also include vibrations near 1620 and 1514 cm−1, which reflect quaternary amine-aromatic interactions, and near 1690 cm−1, which reflects an interaction between the Carb ester carbonyl and an unidentified binding site residue (14Ryan S.E. Hill D.G. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10420-10426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of these (and other) vibrations indicates that Carb binds to the nAChR with a similar overall pattern of recognition in all three membrane environments. Membrane lipid composition has no effect on agonist-binding site integrity. Carb difference spectra recorded from native-nAChR and PC/PA/Chol-nAChR also exhibit relatively intense positive amide vibrations near 1655 and 1547 cm−1 (shaded regions in Fig. 2A), which reflect Carb-induced structural changes in the polypeptide backbone. Because the positive intensity at these frequencies is lost when Carb difference spectra are recorded in the presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine (i.e. the nAChR is desensitized prior to Carb binding; Fig. 2B), we conclude that these positive vibrations result from the Carb-induced resting-to-desensitized conformational transition (10Baenziger J.E.

Positive intensity is also absent at these frequencies (i.e. 1655 and 1547 cm−1) in difference spectra recorded from PC-nAChR, whether or not dibucaine is present. The difference spectra show that whereas native-nAChR and PC/PA/Chol-nAChR both undergo a Carb-induced resting-to-desensitized conformational transition, PC-nAChR does not. Why is PC-nAChR unresponsive to agonist? PC-nAChR may be unresponsive because it is already stabilized in the desensitized state (8daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Hamouda A.K. Sanghvi M. Sauls D. Machu T.K. Blanton M.P.

To test whether PC-nAChR is desensitized, we first examined the fluorescence of ethidium binding to the nAChR in each of the three membrane environments (Figs. 2, C, and D, and supplemental S2). Ethidium binds with high affinity to a hydrophobic site within the ion channel pore of the desensitized (Kd = ∼0.3 μm), but not the resting (Kd = ∼1 mm) nAChR (18Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative to ethidium in aqueous solution, the bound ethidium exhibits a greater fluorescence emission intensity, and its emission maximum shifts from 605 (aqueous solution) to 590 nm (nAChR-bound). Addition of either native- or PC/PA/Chol-nAChR to an aqueous solution of ethidium leads to an apparent increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2C), but this increase is not dibucaine displaceable and can be attributed to the scattering of incident light by the membrane vesicles (supplemental Fig. S2). The low ethidium fluorescence observed in the absence of agonist shows that the ion pore in both membrane environments is stabilized in a conformation with low affinity for ethidium, an affinity suggestive of the resting state. The addition of 500 μm Carb, however, leads to a substantial increase in dibucaine-displaceable ethidium fluorescence, accompanied by a shift in the emission maximum to 590 nm (Figs. 2C and supplemental S2). Both the increase in fluorescence and the shift in emission maximum indicate that Carb binding to the nAChR in native and PC/PA/Chol membranes shifts the nAChR pore into a conformation with a high affinity for ethidium. In both membranes, Carb binding stabilizes the nAChR in a desensitized conformation. If the non-activatable PC-nAChR is desensitized, as has been suggested previously, then ethidium should bind with high affinity to PC-nAChR regardless of whether or not Carb is bound. Surprisingly there are essentially no changes in either the intensity or maximum of ethidium emission upon the addition of PC-nAChR to aqueous ethidium (Figs. 2C and supplemental S2C). This shows that ethidium does not bind with high affinity to the PC-nAChR pore in the absence of Carb, and that the channel does not adopt a high affinity ethidium-binding conformation. The ion channel in PC membranes is not stabilized in the desensitized state. Furthermore, the addition of 500 μm Carb does not lead to a change in the emission properties of ethidium. Given that this concentration of Carb is 10-fold greater than that used in the infrared difference experiments (i.e. 50 μm), which showed essentially equivalent levels of Carb binding in all three membranes, it can be concluded that Carb binds to PC-nAChR, but is unable to convert the nAChR pore into the desensitized conformation. We next probed the conformation of the PC-nAChR agonist-binding sites by comparing [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) binding to native-nAChR, PC/PA/Chol-nAChR, and PC-nAChR (Figs. 3A and supplemental S3). Equilibrium [3H]ACh binding curves for the native- and PC/PA/Chol-nAChR both show a saturable increase in specific binding in the 0–2.0 μm [3H]ACh range (Fig. 3A). The equilibrium dissociation constants (Keq) for [3H]ACh binding to native-nAChR (∼30 nm) and PC/PA/Chol-nAChR (∼65 nm; Table 1), are between those expected for resting (Kd = 800 nm) and desensitized (Kd = 2 nm) nAChRs (15Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In native membranes, the nAChR exists in both resting and desensitized conformations. Roughly 80% of the nAChRs in native membranes adopt the resting state (19Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The measured equilibrium binding constant for native membranes is closer to that of the desensitized state because the resting-to-desensitized equilibrium shifts toward the desensitized conformation with increasing [3H]ACh (15Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 2-fold higher equilibrium dissociation constant for PC/PA/Chol-nAChR may reflect a higher proportion of receptors in the resting (i.e. low affinity) conformation prior to [3H]ACh binding.TABLE 1Apparent [3H]acetylcholine equilibrium dissociation constants (Keq) for the nAChR in different membrane environmentsMembrane[3H]AChmean Keq (95% c.i.)nan, number of pooled data points in saturation binding experiments.Native30.14 nm54(25.83 to 34.45 nm)PC/PA/Chol64.51 nm54(56.72 to 72.31 nm)PC∼3.0 to 10 μmbEstimate based on manual fitting of the data and Scatchard-Rosenthal analysis (see supplemental Experimental Procedures).54a n, number of pooled data points in saturation binding experiments.b Estimate based on manual fitting of the data and Scatchard-Rosenthal analysis (see supplemental Experimental Procedures). Open table in a new tab If the agonist-binding sites of PC-nAChR adopt a desensitized conformation, high affinity, saturable binding, with a measured Keq characteristic of the desensitized conformation should be observed (i.e. Kd ≈ 2 nm). Instead only minimal [3H]ACh binding to PC-nAChR was detected over the same 0–2.0 μm [3H]ACh range (Fig. 3A). As a similar number of accessible agonist sites were used for all binding experiments (see supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S1), the reduced binding of [3H]ACh to PC-nAChR can be attributed to lower occupancy, rather than saturation of a lower number of accessible sites. An estimate of the [3H]ACh equilibrium dissociation constant, based on the total number of accessible sites, is in the 3–10 μm range (Table 1), which is much lower than the expected affinity for the desensitized state. The lower binding affinity of PC-nAChR for [3H]ACh shows that the agonist-binding sites do not adopt a desensitized conformation, even after prolonged exposure (>1 h) to [3H]ACh. The PC-nAChR agonist-binding sites are stabilized predominantly in a low affinity conformation, reminiscent of the resting state. If both the agonist-binding sites and transmembrane pore of PC-nAChR adopt low affinity ligand-binding conformations suggestive of the resting state, why does Carb binding fail to stabilize PC-nAChR in a desensitized conformation? The ethidium binding experiments show that Carb binding to the agonist sites does not alter the conformation (and thus ethidium affinity) of the transmembrane pore. This implies that the transmembrane pore is allosterically uncoupled from the agonist-binding sites. If this is the case, then the reverse should also be true, the binding of allosteric modulators to the pore should not influence the binding properties of the agonist sites. To test this hypothesis, we probed whether a pore-binding allosteric modulator could influence the affinity of PC-nAChR for [3H]ACh (Fig. 3B). At constant, subsaturating concentrations of [3H]ACh, occupancy of the agonist-binding sites can be modulated by shifts in [3H]ACh affinity. We measured the ability of tenocylclidine (TCP), a pore-binding allosteric modulator of the nAChR (20Katz E.J. Cortes V.I. Eldefrawi M.E. Eldefrawi A.T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 146: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Pagán O.R. Eteroviæ V.A. Garcia M. Vergne D. Basilio C.M. Rodríguez A.D. Hann R.M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7358-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), to increase the affinity of the nAChR for [3H]ACh. In both PC/PA/Chol-nAChR and native-nAChR, increasing concentrations of TCP up to ∼10 μm increase the fraction of [3H]ACh bound at equilibrium, showing that TCP converts the nAChR into a conformation with high affinity for [3H]ACh. The binding of TCP to the transmembrane pore converts the agonist-binding sites into a desensitized conformation (Fig. 3B). TCP concentrations above ∼10 μm decrease the amount of [3H]ACh bound, likely due to competitive displacement of [3H]ACh from the agonist-binding sites, as is commonly observed with other “pore-binding” allosteric modulators (18Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Krodel E.K. Beckman R.A. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 294-312PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, concentrations of TCP up to 1 mm do not increase [3H]ACh binding to PC-nAChR, indicating that TCP does not allosterically modulate the affinity of nAChR for agonist. This is consistent with the finding that another non-competitive inhibitor, tetracaine, also has no effect on the conformation of PC-nAChR (13Baenziger J.E. Ryan S.E. Goodreid M.M. Vuong N.Q. Sturgeon R.M. daCosta C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data confirm that the agonist-binding sites and transmembrane pore in PC-nAChR are allosterically uncoupled. Inactivation of the nAChR in PC membranes can thus be attributed to an uncoupling of the agonist-binding sites from the transmembrane pore, as opposed to stabilization of the desensitized state. We next examined the structural and biophysical properties of this uncoupled conformation in our highly purified proteoliposome preparations. The structure of both PC-nAChR and PC/PA/Chol-nAChR was assessed by recording infrared spectra in deuterated solvent. The amide I/I′ band is sensitive to hydrogen bonding and thus protein secondary structure. The amide I/I′ bands of PC/PA/Chol-nAChR versus PC-nAChR are similar, but do exhibit subtle differences in band shape that become evident upon spectral deconvolution (supplemental Fig. S4A). These spectral nuances, however, result from different downshifts in the frequencies of amide I component bands, as a consequence of different levels of peptide 1H/2H exchange (see below and supplemental Fig. S4B). This is confirmed by the fact that the amide I/I′ band shapes are virtually indistinguishable when compared at equivalent levels of peptide 1H/2H exchange (24Méthot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Carb has no effect on nAChR secondary structure in either membrane environment. The uncoupled conformation of PC-nAChR thus has a similar secondary structure to that of both the resting (−Carb) and desensitized (+Carb) conformations of PC/PA/Chol-nAChR. Uncoupling must result from rearrangements in nAChR tertiary or quaternary structure. The thermal stability of the uncoupled PC-nAChR is also similar to that of both the resting (−Carb) and the desensitized (+Carb) PC/PA/Chol-nAChRs (Figs. 4A and supplemental S6). In the absence of agonist, PC-nAChR undergoes a cooperative thermal denaturation with a 50% denaturation temperature (Td) of 52.35 ± 0.13 °C (supplemental Table S2). PC/PA/Chol-nAChR undergoes a slightly more cooperative thermal denaturation, at a slightly higher temperature (56.43 ± 0.84 °C). The addition of Carb leads to an increase in thermal stability of the nAChR in both membranes, but in PC this shift is smaller (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S2). The reduced stabilizing effect of Carb on PC-nAChR implies that the physical interactions between the nAChR and agonist are weaker, consistent with the lower [3H]ACh binding affinity. Although the secondary structure and thermal stability of the nAChR are relatively unaffected by uncoupling, PC-nAChR undergoes greater peptide 1H/2H exchange than PC/PA/Chol-nAChR (supplemental Fig. S4B). We examined the differences in peptide 1H/2H exchange further by recording infrared spectra as a function of time after exposure to 2H2O (Figs. 4B and supplemental S5). The uncoupled PC-nAChR exhibits greater peptide 1H/2H exchange than the PC/PA/Chol-nAChR at all time points throughout the entire 12-h period, including within seconds of exposure to 2H2O. The addition of Carb had no effect on nAChR peptide 1H/2H exchange in either membrane. Each hydrogen exchange curve was accurately fit with a three-phase exponential decay function. The fits show that the differences in hydrogen exchange between the uncoupled PC-nAChR and both the resting and desensitized PC/PA/Chol-nAChR conformations result from an increase in the proportion (∼20%) of peptide hydrogens that exist in the rapidly exchanging pool (supplemental Table S3). The large increase in the number of rapidly exchanging peptide hydrogens comes at the expense of peptide hydrogens that were previously resistant to exchange. This suggests that uncoupling is accompanied by a large increase in the solvent accessibility of previously buried residues. The effects of agonists and allosteric modulators on the nAChR are usually interpreted in terms of a simplified conformational scheme involving three main inter-convertible conformations: the resting, open, and desensitized states (Fig. 1D, Scheme 2) (25Bertrand D. Gopalakrishnan M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist, an equilibrium exists primarily between the resting and desensitized conformations, with the equilibrium in native membranes strongly favoring the resting state (19Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that many allosteric modulators, including lipids, influence nAChR function by modulating this natural equilibrium (10Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Baenziger J.E. Ryan S.E. Goodreid M.M. Vuong N.Q. Sturgeon R.M. daCosta C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The data presented here, however, show unequivocally that the lipid-dependent non-activatable nAChR adopts a novel conformation that is neither resting, nor desensitized. Lipid action at the nAChR therefore does not result from a modulation of the resting-to-desensitized equilibrium, instead another non-activatable conformation is involved. The identification of this novel conformation has repercussions for nAChR-lipid interactions, but may also have broader implications for our general understanding of nAChR function. We previously hypothesized that lipids play a role in coupling agonist binding to channel gating (26daCosta C.J. A Structural Role for Lipids in Coupling Ligand Binding to Channel Gating in a Neurotransmitter Receptor. University of Ottawa, Ottawa2006Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, the functional hallmark of the lipid-dependent non-activatable nAChR is a loss of allosteric coupling between the agonist binding and ion channel functions of the receptor. Specifically, agonist binding does not induce the expected conformational change of the transmembrane pore. Reciprocally, TCP, a non-competitive inhibitor that binds to the nAChR pore, fails to trigger a conformational change in the extracellular agonist-binding domain. Effectively, the nAChR is no longer an agonist-activated ion channel because its agonist-binding site is functionally uncoupled from its transmembrane pore. For this reason we refer to this conformation as the lipid-dependent “uncoupled state.” The existence of this uncoupled conformation leads to two important, but related questions. First, how does membrane lipid composition influence coupling between the agonist-binding sites and the transmembrane pore? Second, does uncoupling play a role in nAChR (or Cys-loop receptor) function in vivo? With regards to the first question, our biochemical and biophysical data can now be interpreted in terms of the nAChR structural model. This model shows that the agonist-binding and ion channel functions reside in two distinct structural domains, demarked by an abrupt change in secondary structure (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5A) (27Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). The two domains meet at an interface located ∼10 Å above the bilayer surface. This interface consists of several loops from the agonist-binding (β1-β2, β6-β7 or Cys-loop, and β8-β9) and transmembrane pore (M2-M3L) domains, as well as the covalent link between them (β10-M1). Complex interactions between these interfacial loops are critical for effective communication between the two domains (1Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Lipid-dependent uncoupling must result from structural rearrangements that ultimately disrupt these inter-domain interactions. Weakened associations between the two domains with increased exposure of previously buried interfacial residues could account for the increased solvent accessibility observed with the uncoupled state. How could lipids alter inter-domain interactions that occur ∼10 Å above the bilayer surface? One possibility is that lipids disrupt these inter-domain interactions by altering the packing of transmembrane helices. Transmembrane helix packing could ultimately dictate the conformation of the M2-M3 and β10-M1 linkers, thereby influencing crucial interactions at the interface between the transmembrane pore and agonist-binding domains (28Brannigan G. Hénin J. Law R. Eckenhoff R. Klein M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14418-14423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Lipid-dependent uncoupling could also stem from more localized structural rearrangements at the lipid-nAChR interface. The five M4 helices (one from each subunit) are the most lipid-exposed transmembrane segments (Fig. 1C) (29Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of lipid-facing M4 residues leads to altered nAChR gating kinetics, suggesting that M4 plays a role in coupling agonist binding to channel gating (30Li L. Lee Y.H. Pappone P. Palma A. McNamee M.G. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 61-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Lee Y.H. Li L. Lasalde J. Rojas L. McNamee M. Ortiz-Miranda S.I. Pappone P. Biophys.

According to the current nAChR structural model, the C-terminal end of M4 extends beyond those of the other transmembrane helices and is located in close proximity to several highly conserved residues within the Cys-loop (Fig. 5, B and C). This is significant given that previous experiments have shown that the extended length of M4 is an absolute requirement for nAChR function (36Tobimatsu T. Fujita Y. Fukuda K. Tanaka K. Mori Y. Konno T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a C-terminal residue in the human α4-subunit, which is known to be critical for mediating steroid-induced potentiation (37Paradiso K. Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6561-6568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), conspicuously aligns with Gln-435 in M4 of the Torpedo α-subunit, a residue that is poised to interact with the highly conserved αPhe-137 within the Cys-loop (Fig. 5C). Clearly, the C-terminal end of M4 is an important, but unappreciated part of the interface between the agonist-binding and transmembrane domains. By interacting directly with both membrane lipids and residues in the Cys-loop, M4 is perfectly situated to relay bilayer properties to this coupling interface. We propose that lipid-dependent bilayer properties are important for positioning the C-terminal end of M4 so that it effectively contacts the Cys-loop. M4/Cys-loop interactions in turn affect the ability of the Cys-loop to communicate with the remainder of the transmembrane domain, particularly the all important M2-M3 linker (Fig. 5D). M4 essentially acts as a lipid-sensor relaying bilayer properties to the coupling interface. By binding to discrete transmembrane sites, lipids (and other allosteric modulators, including steroids) may stabilize the nAChR transmembrane domain in conformations that permit effective communication with the agonist-binding domain, perhaps by facilitating interactions between the C-terminal end of M4 and the Cys-loop. Indeed, the identification of a steroid-binding site between M4 and M1-M3 in the mouse GABAA receptor, as well as a similar modulatory site in the rat α7 nAChR, appear to support this (38Hosie A.M. Wilkins M.E. da Silva H.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 2006; 444: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 39Young G.T. Zwart R. Walker A.S. Sher E. Millar N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14686-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Simulations have also hinted that a similar site might exist for cholesterol in the Torpedo nAChR (28Brannigan G. Hénin J. Law R. Eckenhoff R. Klein M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14418-14423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a physical (rather than a chemical) property of the bilayer may dictate the favorability of helix-helix versus helix-lipid interactions. Tryptophan substitutions in M4, which in model peptides stabilize transmembrane helix associations (40Ridder A. Skupjen P. Unterreitmeier S. Langosch D. J. Mol.

Presumably the M4 tryptophan substitutions drive increased association between M4 and M1-M3, which in turn facilitate interactions between the C-terminal extension of M4 and the Cys-loop. Undeniably M4-lipid interactions play a key role in Cys-loop receptor function in native (or native-like) membrane environments. M4-lipid interactions even affect the open probability of human nAChRs (35Shen X.M. Deymeer F. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). So whereas, M4-mediated uncoupling explains our in vitro data, the existence of this uncoupled conformation may have broader implications for Cys-loop receptor function in vivo. Lipids (and potentially other allosteric modulators) could influence the pool of agonist-activatable receptors by modulating an equilibrium between functional coupled and non-functional uncoupled states (Fig. 1D, Scheme 1). From a pharmacological perspective, it is clear that membrane lipid composition can modulate the efficacy of nAChR agonists. Although we have concentrated on highly simplified and therefore non-physiological membranes, what we observe likely represents extremes at opposite ends of a spectrum. Subtle alterations in lipid composition may fine-tune the synaptic response in vivo. Indeed, the fact that endogenous lipids modulate agonist responses in other Cys-loop receptors directly supports this (37Paradiso K. Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6561-6568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hosie A.M. Wilkins M.E. da Silva H.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 2006; 444: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Even subtle changes in the proportion of coupled receptors could lead to appreciable changes in macroscopic agonist responses, thereby having significant effects on pathology. Interestingly, structures of nAChR prokaryotic homologues show that their M4/C-terminal tails are too short to reach the β6-β7/“Cys-loop” (41Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2008; 452: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 42Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 43Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M.

Although the lipid sensitivity of these bacterial channels is presently unknown, their shortened M4 segments preclude a role for the C-terminal end of M4 at the coupling interface between their extra-membranous and transmembrane domains. It is thus tempting to speculate that the emergence of lipid sensitivity in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily coincided with the increasing demands of an evolving nervous system. We thank Drs. Z.

The biological effects of FTY720 are believed to occur after its metabolism to FTY720 phosphate. However, very little is known about whether FTY720 can interact with and modulate the activity of other enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism. We examined the ability of FTY720 to modulate de novo ceramide synthesis. In mammals, ceramide is synthesized by a family of six ceramide synthases, each of which utilizes a restricted subset of acyl-CoAs. We show that FTY720 inhibits ceramide synthase activity in vitro by noncompetitive inhibition toward acyl-CoA and uncompetitive inhibition toward sphinganine; surprisingly, the efficacy of inhibition depends on the acyl-CoA chain length. In cultured cells, FTY720 has a more complex effect, with ceramide synthesis inhibited at high (500 nm to 5 μm) but not low (<200 nm) sphinganine concentrations, consistent with FTY720 acting as an uncompetitive inhibitor toward sphinganine. Finally, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated, unexpectedly, elevated levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and hexosylceramides after incubation with FTY720. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which FTY720 might mediate some of its biological effects, which may be of mechanistic significance for understanding its mode of action.

Because FTY720 is an analog of sphingosine, one of the two substrates of ceramide synthase (CerS) (see Fig. 1), we now examine whether FTY720 can modulate CerS activity. CerS utilizes fatty acyl-CoAs to N-acylate sphingoid long chain bases. Six CerS exist in mammals, each of which uses a restricted subset of acyl-CoAs (18Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J.

We demonstrate that FTY720 inhibits CerS activity and that the extent of inhibition varies according to the acyl chain length of the acyl-CoA substrate. Surprisingly, FTY720 inhibits CerS activity toward acyl-CoA via noncompetitive inhibition and toward sphinganine via uncompetitive inhibition. Finally, the mode of interaction of FTY720 with CerS in cultured cells depends on the amount of available sphinganine. Together, we show that FTY720 modulates ceramide synthesis, which may be of relevance for understanding its biological effects in vivo and its role in immunomodulation. d-Erythro-[4,5-3H]Sphinganine (80 Ci/mmol), FTY720, (R)-FTY720-P and (R)-FTY-phosphonate were synthesized as described (24Hirschberg K.

Fatty acyl-CoAs, ceramides, dimethylsphingosine, lysophosphatidic acid, and the internal standards for liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sphinganine was from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Silica gel 60 TLC plates were from Merck. Defatted bovine serum albumin (BSA), suramin, S1P, and a protease inhibitor mixture were from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen or Sigma-Aldrich. All of the solvents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Biolab (Jerusalem, Israel). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, RBL-2H3 mast cells, and hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HEPG2) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK cells were transfected with human CerS genes (26Lahiri S. Lee H. Mesicek J. Fuks Z. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kolesnick R.N. Futerman A.H.

The cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin (0.25%, w/v) followed by centrifugation (4 min, 150 × gav). The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing a protease inhibitor mixture.

Briefly, cell homogenates were incubated with [4,5-3H]sphinganine/sphinganine/20 μm defatted BSA and fatty acyl-CoA for 20 min at 37 °C.

The amount of homogenate used for each CerS was taken so that the reaction rate was linear with respect to the amount of protein (26Lahiri S. Lee H. Mesicek J. Fuks Z. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

The reactions were terminated using chloroform/methanol (1/2; v/v), and the lipids were extracted (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/2 m ammonium hydroxide (40/10/1; v/v/v) as developing solvent. [3H]Lipids were identified using authentic standards, visualized using a phosphorimaging screen (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), and recovered from the TLC plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials containing 1 ml of methanol and 5 ml of Optima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Downers Groove, IL). Radioactivity was determined using a Packard 2100 beta radiospectrometer equipped with the Transformed Spectral Index of the External Standard/Automatic Efficiency Control program for quench correction. HEK and RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with 25 μm FTY720 for 1.5 h followed by incubation with [4,5-3H]sphinganine or [4,5-3H]sphinganine/sphinganine during the last 30 min of the incubation period; when transfected HEK cells were used, they were incubated with FTY720 and sphinganine 24 h after transfection. The cells were removed from the culture dishes by scraping into methanol, and the lipids were extracted (28Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 496-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The lipids were separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol (50:3.5; v/v) as developing solvent, identified, and quantified as above. SL analyses by ESI-MS/MS were conducted using a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and an ABI 4000 quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer as described (18Venkataraman K.

HEK cells were harvested by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lyophilized. The samples were spiked with a SL internal standard mixture (Avanti Polar Lipids), then extracted, and analyzed by liquid chromatography ESI-MS/MS. To determine whether FTY720 inhibits CerS activity in vitro, homogenates from HEK cells overexpressing CerS2 were incubated with increasing concentrations of FTY720. Significant inhibition of CerS2 activity was observed (see Fig. 2A). In contrast, another sphingosine analog, dimethylsphingosine (Fig. 1), had no effect on CerS2 (Fig. 2A) or CerS4 and 5 activity (not shown). The lack of effect of dimethylsphingosine also acts as an important control, demonstrating that the inhibition of CerS2 by FTY720 does not occur via a nonspecific mechanism. For instance, it is conceivable that FTY720 could displace sphinganine from the complex it forms with BSA (which acts as a lipid carrier in the reaction mixture; see Refs 24Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 26Lahiri S. Lee H. Mesicek J. Fuks Z. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kolesnick R.N. Futerman A.H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), thus rendering sphinganine inaccessible for the reaction. Based on these results, we conclude that FTY720 specifically inhibits CerS2. We have recently shown that CerS2 contains an S1PR-like motif via which S1P inhibits CerS2 activity (22Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5677-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To determine whether FTY720-P, an analog of S1P (Fig. 1A), can also inhibit CerS2 via this motif, homogenates from CerS2-overexpressing cells were incubated with FTY720-P. No inhibition was observed, whereas S1P significantly inhibited CerS2 (Fig. 2B), as reported previously (22Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5677-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This result also demonstrates that FTY720 itself (Fig. 2A) and not FTY720-P, is responsible for CerS2 inhibition. Similarly, FTY720-P had no effect on CerS5 activity (data not shown). Likewise, lysophosphatidic acid did not inhibit CerS2 (Fig. 2B), confirming the specificity of the CerS2 S1P receptor-like motif for S1P. We next examined the level of inhibition of FTY720 using different acyl-CoAs for ceramide synthesis (Fig. 3). In three different cell lines, namely HEK, RBL-2H3 mast cells, and hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HEPG2) cells, the EC50 of inhibition was lowest using C18-CoA, which gave an EC50 value of between 35 and 47 μm (Fig. 3). In contrast, the EC50 values using either C16-CoA or C24-CoA were considerably higher (Fig. 3). The dependence on acyl-CoA chain length was further examined by comparing the EC50 value using HEK cells overexpressing either CerS5 or CerS1, which use C16- and C18-CoA, respectively (18Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). FTY720 inhibited CerS1 activity to a greater extent than CerS5 (Fig. 4A). Finally, we analyzed the activity of CerS4 in HEK cells using C18- or C20-CoA; CerS4 can utilize either of these acyl-CoAs for ceramide synthesis (19Riebeling C. Allegood J.C. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There was a significant difference in the EC50, with values of 32 and 65 μm for C18- and C20-CoA, respectively (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that the efficacy of inhibition of CerS by FTY720 depends on the acyl-CoA chain length. This result is unexpected because FTY720 is a sphingosine analog (Fig. 1A), and therefore we assumed that the chain length of the acyl-CoA would not be relevant for CerS inhibition by FTY720.FIGURE 4Dependence on a cyl-CoA chain length of inhibition of CerS activity by FTY720. A, CerS activity was assayed in homogenates (100 μg of protein) of HEK cells using 0.25 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine/15 μm sphinganine, 20 μm defatted BSA and 50 μm of either C18- (for CerS1) or C16-acyl-CoA (for CerS5). B, CerS4 activity was assayed in homogenates (100 μg of protein) from CerS4-overexpressing cells using 0.25 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine, 15 μm sphinganine, 20 μm defatted BSA, and 50 μm of either C18- or C20-acyl-CoA. The specific activity of CerS4 in the absence of FTY720 toward C18-CoA was 444 pmol of ceramide formed per min per mg of protein and 389 pmol of ceramide formed per min per mg of protein toward C20-CoA in a typical experiment.

HEK cells overexpressing CerS4 or CerS5 were incubated with 1-[14C]stearoyl-CoA or 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA, respectively. Although [14C]stearoyl-sphinganine (C18-ceramide) and [14C]palmitoyl-sphinganine (C16-ceramide) were both synthesized and their formation significantly inhibited in the presence of FTY720, no additional radioactive bands could be detected by TLC after incubation with FTY720 (data not shown). We next examined the inhibition kinetics of FTY720 in homogenates from HEK cells overexpressing CerS4. Because FTY720 is a structural analog of the sphingoid long chain base (Fig. 1A), we assumed that FTY720 would act as a competitive inhibitor toward sphinganine. Surprisingly, however, FTY720 was an uncompetitive inhibitor toward sphinganine (Fig. 5A). In contrast, FTY720 acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor toward C18-CoA (Fig. 5B). The inhibition of FTY720 toward C18-CoA was allosteric (Fig. 5B) under the normal reaction conditions used to assay CerS (i.e. using defatted BSA as lipid carrier, see above). However, when the assay was performed in the absence of defatted BSA, classical noncompetitive inhibition was obtained using the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 5B, inset). These data indicate that FTY720 has a complex mode of inhibition on CerS in vitro, acting as an uncompetitive inhibitor toward sphinganine and a noncompetitive inhibitor toward acyl-CoA. To determine whether FTY720 also inhibits ceramide synthesis in cultured cells, mock-transfected HEK cells were incubated with 25 μm FTY720 and then metabolically labeled with 1 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine/2 μm sphinganine. Significant inhibition of ceramide synthesis was observed under these conditions (Fig. 6A). Similarly, ceramide synthesis was inhibited by FTY720 in CerS1- and CerS4-overexpressing HEK cells (Fig. 6A). FTY720 also inhibited ceramide synthesis in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that the inhibition of ceramide synthesis by FTY720 also occurs in cells of immune origin. The amount of [4,5-3H]sphinganine/sphinganine used in these metabolic labeling experiments (∼12 nmol/mg protein) was significantly higher than endogenous sphinganine levels in HEK cells (∼6 pmol/mg protein) (19Riebeling C. Allegood J.C. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Because FTY720 has a complex mode of inhibition of CerS activity (see above), we examined the concentration dependence of the effect of FTY720 versus sphinganine concentration. At high sphinganine concentrations, i.e. 500 nm to 5 μm, FTY720 (25 μm) significantly inhibited ceramide synthesis (Fig. 6B; cf. Fig. 6A). However, at lower sphinganine concentrations (<200 nm), no inhibition of ceramide synthesis was observed. Indeed, although not statistically significant, a tendency toward an increase in ceramide synthesis was detected at the lowest (<1 nm) sphinganine concentrations. 3At the lowest [4,5-3H]sphinganine concentrations, the amount of [3H]ceramide formed (5,000 dpm) is extremely low, even though the specific activity of [4,5-3H]sphinganine is high (80 Ci/mmol). Thus, these experiments are difficult to perform to a high degree of experimental accuracy. Thus, the modulation of ceramide synthesis by FTY720 in cultured cells depends on the ratio of the concentrations of sphinganine to FTY720. This unexpected result was supported by data obtained using ESI-MS/MS to determine total ceramide, sphingomyelin, and hexosylceramide levels in HEK cells and the fatty acid composition of these SLs (Fig. 7). Upon incubation of HEK cells with FTY720 for 90 min (the same time of incubation as used for the metabolic labeling experiments) (Fig. 6A), an increase in ceramide levels was observed, with no change in endogenous sphinganine levels (Fig. 7); similar increases were observed for hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin. Moreover, levels of C18-C22-ceramide were significantly increased, as were levels of C18-C22-hexosylceramide and C18-C22-sphingomyelin. This result is consistent with a complex mode of interaction of FTY720 with CerS, perhaps involving an allosteric element that is not preserved in vitro, whereby ceramide synthesis is stimulated in cells despite its inhibition by FTY720 in vitro. Finally, to determine that the changes in ceramide synthesis in cultured cells were not due to the conversion of FTY720 to FTY720-P (9Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which could bind to an S1PR at the cell surface and thus influence ceramide synthesis, we examined the effect of FTY720 in the presence of suramin, an inhibitor of G-protein-coupled receptors (31Alderton F. Sambi B. Tate R. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No changes were observed in ceramide synthesis after incubation with FTY720 in the absence or presence of suramin (Fig. 8A). We next incubated cells with (R)-FTY-phosphonate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of FTY-P (Fig. 1), at concentrations (1 μm) that would saturate binding to an S1PR. There was no difference in the extent of inhibition of ceramide synthesis by FTY720 in the absence or presence of (R)-FTY-phosphonate (Fig. 8B). Thus, we can exclude the possibility that the modulation of ceramide synthesis by FTY720 is related to its metabolism to FTY720-P and binding to S1PRs. In the current study we demonstrate that FTY720 can interfere with SL metabolism via modulation of ceramide synthesis. Previously, FTY720 was thought to largely mediate its biological effects after its conversion to FTY720-P and subsequent binding to S1PRs. We now propose an additional mode of action, namely via modulation of ceramide synthesis. The mechanism by which FTY720 modulates ceramide synthesis is surprisingly complicated. FTY720 inhibits CerS activity in vitro but under certain conditions activates ceramide synthesis in cultured cells. The reasons for these differences are not known, but FTY720 is not the first compound that inhibits CerS activity in vitro and has an opposite effect in cells. For instance, in cells overexpressing CerS, fumonisin B1, a well characterized CerS inhibitor in vitro (32Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), has little or no inhibitory effect and in some cases results in elevated ceramide levels (18Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The acyl chain length profile of the ceramides whose synthesis is elevated in cultured cells by fumonisin B1 is the same as the profile of the ceramides whose synthesis is inhibited in vitro (18Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), demonstrating a direct connection between the apparently disparate effects of fumonisin B1. In contrast to the dual effects of fumonisin B1, which was only observed in cells overexpressing CerS, FTY720 elevates ceramide levels in untransfected cells (Fig. 7). Recently, another sphingosine analog, spisulosine (33Sánchez A.M. Malagarie-Cazenave S. Olea N. Vara D. Cuevas C. Díaz-Laviada I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 584: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was shown to induce de novo ceramide synthesis in prostate tumor cell lines (33Sánchez A.M. Malagarie-Cazenave S. Olea N. Vara D. Cuevas C. Díaz-Laviada I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 584: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas it inhibits CerS activity in vitro. 4The EC50 of spisulosine toward CerS4 in vitro was ∼25 μm (data not shown). A clue concerning the differences observed between the in vitro analysis and experiments in cultured cells might be found in the mode of inhibition of CerS activity by FTY720. Because FTY720 is a sphingosine analog, we predicted that FTY720 would act as a competitive inhibitor toward sphinganine, having little if any effect toward acyl-CoA. This prediction proved to be wrong, because we found that FTY720 was an uncompetitive inhibitor toward sphinganine and a noncompetitive inhibitor toward acyl-CoA (Fig. 5). Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to enzymes only after formation of the E-S complex (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). This type of inhibition is most commonly encountered in multi-substrate reactions where the inhibitor is competitive with respect to one substrate but uncompetitive with respect to another. CerS are bi-substrate enzymes, requiring the binding of both sphinganine and acyl-CoA for N-acylation of the former. Nothing is known about the active site of any CerS or about the order of binding of the substrates in the reaction pathway. Our data imply that sphinganine first binds to CerS to form an E-S (CerS-sphinganine) complex, and only after formation of this complex can FTY720 bind (Fig. 9). Alternatively, there may be two sphinganine-binding sites that act allosterically with respect to one another, or CerS themselves may form dimers that interact allosterically. The possibility of allosteric interactions is also supported by the noncompetitive mode of inhibition of acyl-CoA binding by FTY720. Noncompetitive inhibitors bind at an allosteric site on the enzyme and leave the active site unblocked (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). Thus, the binding sites of FTY720 and acyl-CoA appear to be distinct, but the interaction between sphinganine binding and FTY720 binding nevertheless impacts the rate of the reaction with respect to acyl-CoA. Finally, the experiment showing that FTY720 inhibits ceramide synthesis at high sphinganine concentrations in vivo, but not at low concentrations (Fig. 6), supports a complex, possibly allosteric mode of interaction between sphinganine and FTY720 and is consistent with uncompetitive inhibitors being most effective at high substrate concentrations (35Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London1995Google Scholar); this explanation might also be relevant for the mode of interaction between sphinganine and other sphinganine analogs, such as spisulosine and fumonisin B1. The range of concentrations (low micromolar) needed to inhibit CerS activity by FTY720 is considerably higher than that needed to bind and activate (mid nanomolar) S1P receptors after phosphorylation of FTY720 to FTY720-P. However, this cannot exclude the possibility that some of the biological effects of FTY720 may be mediated by FTY720 itself, prior to its metabolism to FTY720-P, or after its dephosphorylation by either lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 or lipid phosphate phosphatase 1α (Fig. 1B). A number of studies have examined the biological effects of FTY720 using micromolar concentrations (4Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T.

Whether FTY720 ever reaches the concentrations used in the current study (and in the study of Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T.

In at least one study, FTY720 was shown to accumulate at levels of ∼1 μm in various rat and dog tissues soon after its injection (43Meno-Tetang G.M. Li H. Mis S. Pyszczynski N. Heining P. Lowe P. Jusko W.J. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, because FTY720 is hydrophobic, its concentration within intracellular membranes might be much higher. The precise concentrations to which CerS enzymes may be exposed after FTY720 treatment is therefore not known, and the clinical relevance of our data to understanding the mode of FTY720 action would be strengthened by determination of the local membrane concentration of FTY720 in, for instance, the endoplasmic reticulum, where the CerS enzymes are located. While this manuscript was under review, a study was published by Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5467-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) demonstrating inhibition of CerS activity by FTY720. In contrast to our study, Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5467-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported competitive inhibition of CerS with respect to sphinganine and did not include any information on the mode of inhibition toward acyl-CoA, because the competitive mode of inhibition toward sphinganine would imply direct competition between sphinganine and FTY720, alleviating the need to examine inhibition toward acyl-CoA. In contrast, our study suggests a much more complex mode of inhibition, as discussed above. The conclusion by Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5467-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is based on CerS assays that do not appear to have been performed under optimal conditions. For example, concentrations of acyl-CoA were only 5 μm, which is significantly below the amount required to elicit a maximal rate of the reaction (24Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Likewise, a sphinganine concentration of 100 nm was used, which is significantly lower than the Km of the reaction (which is in the range of 2–5 μm) (26Lahiri S. Lee H. Mesicek J. Fuks Z. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kolesnick R.N. Futerman A.H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of FTY720 reported by Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5467-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) might be related to the 100-fold molar excess of inhibitor (i.e. 10 μm FTY720) versus substrate (100 nm sphinganine), which could lead to displacement of sphinganine from the BSA complex, a possibility that we excluded in our study (Fig. 2), and thus lead to apparent competitive inhibition. Clearly, conclusions concerning modes of kinetic inhibition cannot be accurately derived from reactions performed under suboptimal assay conditions. Thus, the data in our study suggest a completely different mode of action of FTY720, as illustrated in Fig. 9. One other major difference between the two studies is our analyses of the dependence of the inhibition by FTY720 on acyl-CoA chain length. Whereas Berdyshev et al. (42Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Skobeleva A. Bittman R. Lu X. Dudek S.M. Mirzapoiazova T. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5467-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) did not observe any significant dependence on acyl-CoA chain length, perhaps due to some of the kinetic considerations discussed above, we observed that FTY720 inhibits ceramide synthesis using C18-CoA to a greater extent than other acyl-CoAs. This may be of relevance for understanding the mode of action of FTY720 as a modulator of ceramide synthesis in tissues that express different CerS enzymes and thus contain ceramides with different acyl chain lengths. Finally, our study examined the effect of FTY720 on CerS activity in three different cell lines, including RBL-2H3 mast cells, lending mechanistic significance to our study with relation to the possible effect of FTY720 in immunomodulation. In summary, we have shown a multifaceted mode of interaction between FTY720 and CerS. This may be of importance for understanding the mode of action of FTY720, particularly because FTY720 is currently under investigation in a number of clinical trials, which apparently all assume that conversion to FTY720-P is necessary for its clinical efficacy. Our current study suggests a new mechanistic interpretation for some of the observed effects of FTY720, namely via modulation of ceramide synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1987817795,"Reward intake optimization requires a balance between exploiting known sources of rewards and exploring for new sources. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated basal ganglia circuits are likely candidates as neural structures responsible for such balance, while the hippocampus may be responsible for spatial/contextual information. Although studies have assessed interactions between hippocampus and PFC, and between hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens (NA), it is not known whether 3-way interactions among these structures vary under different behavioral conditions. Here, we investigated these interactions with multichannel recordings while rats explored an operant chamber and while they performed a learned lever-pressing task for reward in the same chamber shortly afterward. Neural firing and local field potentials in the NA core synchronized with hippocampal activity during spatial exploration, but during lever pressing they instead synchronized more strongly with the PFC. The latter is likely due to transient drive of NA neurons by bursting prefrontal activation, as in vivo intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats revealed that NA up states can transiently synchronize with spontaneous PFC activity and PFC stimulation with a bursting pattern reliably evoked up states in NA neurons. Thus, the ability to switch synchronization in a task-dependent manner indicates that the NA core can dynamically select its inputs to suit environmental demands, thereby contributing to decision-making, a function that was thought to primarily depend on the PFC."
https://openalex.org/W2145077506,"Under chronic stress, carotenoid-based colouration has often been shown to fade. However, the ecological and physiological mechanisms that govern colouration still remain largely unknown. Colour changes may be directly induced by the stressor (for example through reduced carotenoid intake) or due to the activation of the physiological stress response (PSR, e.g. due to increased blood corticosterone concentrations). Here, we tested whether blood corticosterone concentration affected carotenoid-based colouration, and whether a trade-off between colouration and PSR existed. Using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we correlatively and experimentally showed that elevated blood corticosterone levels are associated with increased redness of the lizard's belly. In this study, the effects of corticosterone did not depend on carotenoid ingestion, indicating the absence of a trade-off between colouration and PSR for carotenoids. While carotenoid ingestion increased blood carotenoid concentration, colouration was not modified. This suggests that carotenoid-based colouration of common lizards is not severely limited by dietary carotenoid intake. Together with earlier studies, these findings suggest that the common lizard's carotenoid-based colouration may be a composite trait, consisting of fixed (e.g. genetic) and environmentally elements, the latter reflecting the lizard's PSR."
https://openalex.org/W1989872428,"alpha- and -defensin-, magainin-, and cathelicidin-type antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can kill the pathogenic protozoan Leishmania. Comparative studies of a panel of AMPs have defined two distinct groups: those that induce nonapoptotic (Class I) and apoptotic (Class II) parasite killing based on their differential ability to induce phosphatidyl serine exposure, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ATP production, induction of caspase-3/7 and -12 activity, and DNA degradation. Class II AMPs cause rapid influx of the vital stain SYTOX and an increase in intracellular Ca2+, whereas Class I AMPs cause a slow accumulation of SYTOX and do not affect intracellular Ca2+ levels. Inhibitors of cysteine or caspase proteases diminished fast influx of SYTOX through the surface membrane and DNA degradation but do not ablate the annexin V staining or the induction of apoptosis by Class II AMPs. This suggests that the changes in surface permeability in AMP-mediated apoptosis are related to the downstream events of intracellular cysteine/caspase activation or the loss of ATP. The activation of caspase-12-like activity was Ca(2+)-dependent, and inhibitors of voltage-gated and nonspecific Ca2+ channels diminished this activity. Flufenamic acid, a nonspecific Ca2+ inhibitor, completely ablated AMP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, indicating the importance of dysregulation of Ca2+ in antimicrobial peptide-induced apoptosis."

In the present study, we examined the combined effect of multiple alleles of pro inflammatory cytokine genes for determining the risk of nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (CCL2, TGFB1, IL8, CCR5, and MMP9) were genotyped in two independently ascertained type 2 diabetic cohorts with (DN) and without nephropathy (DM); consisting of patients from North India (n = 495) and South India (n = 188). Genotyping was carried out using PCR, allele specific oligonucleotide-PCR (ASO-PCR), PCR-RFLP and TaqMan allelic discrimination assays and the gene-gene interaction among genetic variants were determined by multi dimensional reduction (MDR) software. Serum high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) levels were measured by ELISA. The hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in DN as compared to the DM group (p<0.05). The CCL2, IL8, CCR5 and MMP9 polymorphisms were found to be associated with the risk of diabetic nephropathy. Frequency of CCL2 II, IL8 -251AA, CCR5 59029AA and MMP9 279Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly higher in DN than in DM group (p<0.05) and associated with an increased risk of nephropathy in both North and South Indian cohorts. CCR5 DD and IL8 -251AA genotypes were more prevalent in North Indian DN group only. The co-occurrence of risk associated genotypes (II, -2518GG (CCL2), DD (CCR5) and 279Gln/Gln (MMP9) conferred a tenfold increased risk of nephropathy among type 2 diabetics (p<0.0002).The present study highlights that common variants of inflammatory cytokine genes exert a modest effect on risk of DN and a combination of risk alleles confer a substantial increased risk of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes among Asian Indians."
https://openalex.org/W2022088323,"Stathmin is an important regulator of microtubule polymerization and dynamics. When unphosphorylated it destabilizes microtubules in two ways, by reducing the microtubule polymer mass through sequestration of soluble tubulin into an assembly-incompetent T2S complex (two α:β tubulin dimers per molecule of stathmin), and by increasing the switching frequency (catastrophe frequency) from growth to shortening at plus and minus ends by binding directly to the microtubules. Phosphorylation of stathmin on one or more of its four serine residues (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63) reduces its microtubule-destabilizing activity. However, the effects of phosphorylation of the individual serine residues of stathmin on microtubule dynamic instability have not been investigated systematically. Here we analyzed the effects of stathmin singly phosphorylated at Ser16 or Ser63, and doubly phosphorylated at Ser25 and Ser38, on its ability to modulate microtubule dynamic instability at steady-state in vitro. Phosphorylation at either Ser16 or Ser63 strongly reduced or abolished the ability of stathmin to bind to and sequester soluble tubulin and its ability to act as a catastrophe factor by directly binding to the microtubules. In contrast, double phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 did not affect the binding of stathmin to tubulin or microtubules or its catastrophe-promoting activity. Our results indicate that the effects of stathmin on dynamic instability are strongly but differently attenuated by phosphorylation at Ser16 and Ser63 and support the hypothesis that selective targeting by Ser16-specific or Ser63-specific kinases provides complimentary mechanisms for regulating microtubule function.

Here we analyzed the effects of stathmin singly phosphorylated at Ser16 or Ser63, and doubly phosphorylated at Ser25 and Ser38, on its ability to modulate microtubule dynamic instability at steady-state in vitro. Phosphorylation at either Ser16 or Ser63 strongly reduced or abolished the ability of stathmin to bind to and sequester soluble tubulin and its ability to act as a catastrophe factor by directly binding to the microtubules. In contrast, double phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 did not affect the binding of stathmin to tubulin or microtubules or its catastrophe-promoting activity. Our results indicate that the effects of stathmin on dynamic instability are strongly but differently attenuated by phosphorylation at Ser16 and Ser63 and support the hypothesis that selective targeting by Ser16-specific or Ser63-specific kinases provides complimentary mechanisms for regulating microtubule function. Stathmin is an 18-kDa ubiquitously expressed microtubule-destabilizing phosphoprotein whose activity is modulated by phosphorylation of its four serine residues, Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63 (1.Schubart U.K. Xu J.

In addition to reducing the amount of assembled polymer, tubulin sequestration by stathmin has been shown to increase the switching frequency at microtubule plus ends from growth to shortening (called the catastrophe frequency) as the microtubules relax to a new steady state (17.Curmi P.A.

The direct binding of stathmin to microtubules increases the catastrophe frequency at both ends of the microtubules and considerably more strongly at minus ends than at plus ends (27.Manna T.

Consistent with its strong catastrophe-promoting activity at minus ends, stathmin increases the treadmilling rate of steady-state microtubules in vitro (27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2071-2078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results have led to the suggestion that stathmin might be an important cellular regulator of minus-end microtubule dynamics (27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of Ser16 or Ser63 appears to be more critical than phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 for the ability of stathmin to bind to soluble tubulin and to inhibit microtubule assembly in vitro (3.Larsson N.

Inhibition of stathmin phosphorylation induces defects in spindle assembly and organization (3.Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) suggesting that not only soluble tubulin-microtubule levels are regulated by phosphorylation of stathmin, but the dynamics of microtubules could also be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.It is not known how phosphorylation at any of the four serine residues of stathmin affects its ability to regulate microtubule dynamics and, specifically, its ability to increase the catastrophe frequency at plus and minus ends due to its direct interaction with microtubules. Thus, we determined the effects of stathmin individually phosphorylated at either Ser16 or Ser63 and doubly phosphorylated at both Ser25 and Ser38 on dynamic instability at plus and minus ends in vitro at microtubule polymer steady state and physiological pH (pH 7.2). We find that phosphorylation of Ser16 strongly reduces the direct catastrophe-promoting activity of stathmin at plus ends and abolishes it at minus ends, whereas phosphorylation of Ser63 abolishes the activity at both ends. The effects of phosphorylation of individual serines correlated well with stathmin's reduced abilities to form stable T2S complexes, to inhibit microtubule polymerization, and to bind to microtubules. In contrast, double phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 did not alter the ability of stathmin to modulate dynamic instability at the microtubule ends, its ability to form a stable T2S complex, or its ability to bind to microtubules. The data further support the hypotheses that phosphorylation of stathmin on either Ser16 or Ser63 plays a critical role in regulating microtubule polymerization and dynamics in cells.DISCUSSIONIn cells, the growth and shortening dynamics of individual microtubules, not just the quantity of microtubule polymer present, is critical for microtubule function, as for example, during mitosis when rapid dynamics are essential for the precise, rapid, and time-sensitive assembly and function of the mitotic spindle (45.Wilson L. Panda D. Jordan M.A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar, 47.Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Stathmin, one of the best known regulators of microtubule dynamics, destabilizes microtubules, functioning as a catastrophe promoting factor (increasing the frequency of switching from growth to shortening at microtubule ends). It acts in two ways, indirectly by sequestering tubulin into an assembly incompetent soluble T2S complex, and directly by binding to the microtubules (17.Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Sequestration of tubulin into T2S complexes destabilizes microtubules by reducing the quantity of assembly-competent tubulin and by increasing indirectly the catastrophe frequency as the microtubules depolymerize to a new steady state. The main goal of the present work was to determine how phosphorylation of each of stathmin's four phosphorylatable serine residues, Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63, affect the ability of stathmin to regulate dynamic instability through a direct action on the microtubules. We analyzed the effects of stathmin on dynamic instability after the microtubules attained steady state; a condition at which a stable steady-state equilibrium between polymerized microtubules and soluble tubulin is maintained. At such an equilibrium condition, modulation of microtubule dynamic instability will be due to a direct action of either stathmin or of the T2S complex on the microtubules, and not to reduction of the level of assembly-competent tubulin (27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2071-2078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29.Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Ser16 and Ser63 are phosphorylated by different kinase systems than are Ser25 and Ser38 indicating that phosphorylation of stathmin at these two residues may have different effects on microtubule dynamics (3.Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16078-16083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of stathmin individually at either Ser16 or at Ser63 strongly reduced the binding of stathmin to tubulin and microtubules, and formation of stable T2S complexes (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 5). Consistent with the loss of tubulin and microtubule-binding ability, phosphorylation of either of these residues strongly reduced the ability of stathmin to increase the catastrophe frequency at plus and minus ends (TABLE 1, TABLE 2 and FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). In contrast, double phosphorylation of stathmin at Ser25 and Ser38, the two other remaining phosphorylatable serines, had no effect on the binding of stathmin to tubulin, formation of T2S complexes, or on the ability of stathmin to bind directly to microtubules and act as a catastrophe factor (Table 3 and Fig. 4).How Might Phosphorylation of Stathmin at Ser16 or Ser63 Abolish the Catastrophe-promoting Activity of Stathmin?The inability of p16 stathmin to increase the steady-state catastrophe frequency at either microtubule end together with the lack of detectable binding to the microtubules indicates that phosphorylation of Ser16 impairs the interaction of stathmin with tubulin in microtubules. As described in detail in Fig. 5A of Honnappa et al. (25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16078-16083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7), Ser16 of stathmin is located within the tight turn between two β strands that make a β-hairpin structure, the only structural part of the N terminus of stathmin, which is involved in the interaction with Asn356 α1 tubulin of the T2S complex. α-Tubulin is exposed at the minus ends of microtubules, and if stathmin binds tubulin at minus ends in a manner similar to the way it binds to tubulin in the T2S complex, it is reasonable to conclude that Ser16 of stathmin plays a critical role in regulating the catastrophe frequency at these ends (Fig. 1 and Table 1). It is possible that phosphorylation of Ser16 disfavors either the formation of the tight hairpin “cap” structure (21.Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or inhibits interaction of that structural region with the α1 tubulin at minus ends. Unlike unphosphorylated Ser16, whose side chain points toward the α1-tubulin surface in the T2S complex (25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16078-16083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Ser16 is expected to cause a steric problem and thus, the interaction of the β-hairpin at stathmin's N terminus with the exposed α-tubulin subunit at the minus end would be disrupted.Stathmin binds to the walls of microtubules along their entire lengths (Fig. 6) (27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2071-2078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is not known whether its binding along the lengths of the microtubules increases the catastrophe-promoting activity at the ends. It is possible that binding to tubulin in the walls might produce strain within the microtubule lattice causing an increased catastrophe frequency at the ends. Phosphorylation of Ser16, however, reduced the binding of stathmin along the length of microtubules to an undetectable level by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6), suggesting that the phosphoryl group at this position specifically hinders the binding of stathmin to tubulin along the entire microtubule surface including at or near the ends. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser16 strongly reduced but did not completely abolish stathmin's steady-state plus end catastrophe frequency (Table 1 and Fig. 2). It is possible that p16 stathmin interacts with tubulin at plus ends with a very low affinity and thus is undetectable by immunofluorescence microscopy. The ability of p16 stathmin to weakly sequester free tubulin dimers supports this possibility (Fig. 1B). The N terminus of stathmin has been implicated as being involved in stimulating the catastrophe frequency at plus ends (29.Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), although the mechanism for how it could do so is still unclear. A reasonable way stathmin might increase the catastrophe frequency at plus ends is that its N terminus may somehow nestle between the two tubulin dimers (between the α1 subunit of outer exposed tubulin dimer and the β2 subunit of the adjacent tubulin dimer) along individual protofilaments to attain more structural stability or a more energetically favorable conformation, thus breaking the tubulin-tubulin dimer contacts at the ends. Because Ser16 phosphorylation interferes with tubulin binding (24.Steinmetz M.O. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16078-16083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the alternation may reduce its ability to nestle between the adjacent tubulin dimers thus reducing its catastrophe-promoting activity.The complete loss of the tubulin binding and sequestering activity of stathmin (Fig. 1) and its steady-state catastrophe-promoting activity at both microtubule ends, together with the loss of its ability to bind to microtubules when Ser63 is phosphorylated (Fig. 6), indicates that phosphorylation of Ser63 completely abolishes the functional interactions of stathmin both with soluble tubulin and with tubulin in microtubules. These results are consistent with studies indicating that phosphorylation of Ser63 significantly changes the secondary structure of stathmin, reducing the overall structural organization of its helical backbone and thus hindering alignment of the neighboring amino acid residues that maintain the tight interaction of stathmin with α1 tubulin in the T2S complex (Fig. 7) (21.Steinmetz M.O.

It also binds to the microtubules (Fig. 6). These data indicate that Ser25 and Ser38 by themselves are minimally involved in the interaction of stathmin with soluble tubulin or with tubulin in microtubules. Analysis of the structure of the T2S complex indicates that Ser25 and Ser38 are located at a poorly ordered loop region of the complex and are not in contact with tubulin (Fig. 7) (19.Ravelli R.B.

Phosphorylation of Ser25 or Ser38 also does not significantly alter the secondary structure of stathmin as determined by CD spectroscopy (25.Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16078-16083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how phosphorylation of Ser25 or Ser38 might be involved in controlling cell cycle progression through an action on microtubules without affecting the microtubule destabilizing activity of stathmin? Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 appears to be a prerequisite for phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser63 during mitosis (3.Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14.Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and one possibility in the case of mitosis is that phosphorylation of these residues may facilitate the activity of kinases that phosphorylate Ser16 and Ser63.Implications for Regulation of Minus End Dynamics by StathminStathmin increases the catastrophe frequency considerably more strongly at minus ends than at plus ends (27.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2071-2078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Minus ends do not grow in cells, but rather, they either remain stable or they depolymerize (50.Rodionov V. Nadezhdina E. Borisy G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2035925505,"The Aurora and Polo-like kinases are central components of mitotic signaling pathways, and recent evidence suggests that substantial cross-talk exists between Aurora A and Plk1. In addition to their validation as novel anticancer agents, small molecule kinase inhibitors are increasingly important tools to help dissect clinically relevant protein phosphorylation networks. However, one major problem associated with kinase inhibitors is their promiscuity toward ""off-target"" members of the kinome, which makes interpretation of data obtained from complex cellular systems challenging. Additionally, the emergence of inhibitor resistance in patients makes it clear that an understanding of resistance mechanisms is essential to inform drug design. In this study, we exploited structural knowledge of the binding modes of VX-680, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, and BI 2536, a Polo-like kinase inhibitor, to design and evaluate drug-resistant kinase mutants. Using inducible stable human cell lines, we authenticated mitotic targets for both compounds and demonstrated that Aurora A mutants exhibit differential cellular sensitivity toward the inhibitors VX-680 and MLN8054. In addition, we validated Aurora B as an important anti-proliferative target for VX-680 in model human cancer cells. Finally, this chemical genetic approach allowed us to prove that Aurora A activation loop phosphorylation is controlled by a Plk1-mediated pathway in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053735968,"Although prior studies have demonstrated a smoking-induced field of molecular injury throughout the lung and airway, the impact of smoking on the airway epithelial proteome and its relationship to smoking-related changes in the airway transcriptome are unclear.Airway epithelial cells were obtained from never (n = 5) and current (n = 5) smokers by brushing the mainstem bronchus. Proteins were separated by one dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-PAGE). After in-gel digestion, tryptic peptides were processed via liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and proteins identified. RNA from the same samples was hybridized to HG-U133A microarrays. Protein detection was compared to RNA expression in the current study and a previously published airway dataset. The functional properties of many of the 197 proteins detected in a majority of never smokers were similar to those observed in the never smoker airway transcriptome. LC-MS/MS identified 23 proteins that differed between never and current smokers. Western blotting confirmed the smoking-related changes of PLUNC, P4HB1, and uteroglobin protein levels. Many of the proteins differentially detected between never and current smokers were also altered at the level of gene expression in this cohort and the prior airway transcriptome study. There was a strong association between protein detection and expression of its corresponding transcript within the same sample, with 86% of the proteins detected by LC-MS/MS having a detectable corresponding probeset by microarray in the same sample. Forty-one proteins identified by LC-MS/MS lacked detectable expression of a corresponding transcript and were detected in <or=5% of airway samples from a previously published dataset.1D-PAGE coupled with LC-MS/MS effectively profiled the airway epithelium proteome and identified proteins expressed at different levels as a result of cigarette smoke exposure. While there was a strong correlation between protein and transcript detection within the same sample, we also identified proteins whose corresponding transcripts were not detected by microarray. This noninvasive approach to proteomic profiling of airway epithelium may provide additional insights into the field of injury induced by tobacco exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2107790295,"Background Although CD4 T cells are crucial for defense against M.tb, it is still not clear whether the optimal response against M.tb in fact involves both CD4 and CD8 T cells. To test this, we used a new vaccine strategy that generated a strong balanced T cell response consisting of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Methods and Findings To compare CD4 and CD8 responses against Ag85B-TB10.4 (H4), H4 was delivered as a subunit vaccine in cationic liposomes (CAF01), expressed in Ad5 (Ad-H4) or as a heterologous prime boost vaccination. H4/CAF01 induced primarily CD4 T cells and Ad-H4 gave predominantly a CD8 T cell response. In contrast, the heterologous prime boost combination resulted in augmentation of both the CD4 and CD8 response. The majority (>40%) of the CD4 T cells induced by the heterologous prime boost protocol were polyfunctional, and expressed IFN-γ+, IL-2+, and TNF-α+, whereas most of the CD8 T cells expressed IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ and possessed strong cytotoxic potential. The heterologous prime boost protocol also gave an increase in protective efficacy against M.tb challenge compared to H4/CAF01 and Ad-H4. Both the H4 specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were recruited to the site of infection, at the onset of infection. However, compared to CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells showed more extensive recruitment and were the main T cell subset proliferating at the site of infection. Conclusions/Significance Heterologous prime boost based on H4, produced an additive effect on the priming of CD4 and CD8 cells and in terms of the protective capacity of the vaccine, and therefore represent an interesting new vaccine strategy against M.tb. However, CD4 and CD8 T cells respond very differently to live M.tb challenge, in a manner which supports the consensus that CD4 T cells do play the major role during the early stages of an M.tb infection."
https://openalex.org/W1980537036,"Choline oxidation to betaine takes place in the mitochondria; however, a protein regulating mitochondrial choline transport was never identified. The purpose of this study was to analyze subcellular localization of the solute carrier 44A1 (SLC44A1), a plasma membrane choline transporter sensitive to inhibition by hemicholinium-3. We generated N- and C-terminal-SLC44A1-specific antibodies and analyzed localization of endogenous and overexpressed SLC44A1 in C2C12 mouse muscle cells, MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and mouse tissues using confocal microscopy, differential centrifugation, and Western blotting. We further performed choline uptake competition studies on isolated mitochondria using the specific inhibitor hemicholinium-3 and SLC44A1 antibodies, and analyzed mitochondria of FL83B hepatocytes after the targeted knock-down of SLC44A1 using siRNA technology. In addition, we analyzed SLC44A1 expression during choline deficiency. Localization studies revealed plasma membrane, cytosolic, microsomal, and mitochondrial localization of endogenous and His-tagged SLC44A1. Uptake studies in isolated mitochondria show an accumulation of (3)H-choline, which is strongly inhibited by hemicholinium-3 (60%), by an excess of unlabeled choline (97%), and by both SLC44A1 antibodies. SLC44A1 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated during choline deficiency. These data clearly establish SLC44A1 as an important mediator of choline transport across both the plasma membrane and the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2111778134,"To investigate neurobiological correlates of trait anxiety, CD1 mice were selectively bred for extremes in anxiety-related behavior, with high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mice additionally differing in behavioral tests reflecting depression-like behavior.In this study, microarray analysis, in situ hybridization, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of the vasopressin gene (Avp) in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of adult LAB mice compared to HAB, NAB (normal anxiety-related behavior) and HABxLAB F1 intercross controls, without detecting differences in receptor expression or density. By sequencing the regions 2.5 kbp up- and downstream of the Avp gene locus, we could identify several polymorphic loci, differing between the HAB and LAB lines. In the gene promoter, a deletion of twelve bp Delta(-2180-2191) is particularly likely to contribute to the reduced Avp expression detected in LAB animals under basal conditions. Indeed, allele-specific transcription analysis of F1 animals revealed a hypomorphic LAB-specific Avp allele with a reduced transcription rate by 75% compared to the HAB-specific allele, thus explaining line-specific Avp expression profiles and phenotypic features. Accordingly, intra-PVN Avp mRNA levels were found to correlate with anxiety-related and depression-like behaviors. In addition to this correlative evidence, a significant, though moderate, genotype/phenotype association was demonstrated in 258 male mice of a freely-segregating F2 panel, suggesting a causal contribution of the Avp promoter deletion to anxiety-related behavior.Thus, the identification of polymorphisms in the Avp gene promoter explains gene expression differences in association with the observed phenotype, thus further strengthening the concept of the critical involvement of centrally released AVP in trait anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2138318533,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), through its activation of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, is a vital regulator of stimulatory and inhibitory processes that keep angiogenesis – new capillary growth from existing microvasculature – at a dynamic balance in normal physiology. Soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR1) – a naturally-occurring truncated version of VEGFR1 lacking the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains – has been postulated to exert inhibitory effects on angiogenic signaling via two mechanisms: direct sequestration of angiogenic ligands such as VEGF; or dominant-negative heterodimerization with surface VEGFRs. In pre-clinical studies, sVEGFR1 gene and protein therapy have demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis; while in clinical studies, sVEGFR1 has shown utility as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in a widening array of angiogenesis–dependent diseases. Here we developed a novel computational multi-tissue model for recapitulating the dynamic systemic distributions of VEGF and sVEGFR1. Model features included: physiologically-based multi-scale compartmentalization of the human body; inter-compartmental macromolecular biotransport processes (vascular permeability, lymphatic drainage); and molecularly-detailed binding interactions between the ligand isoforms VEGF121 and VEGF165, signaling receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, non-signaling co-receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), as well as sVEGFR1. The model was parameterized to represent a healthy human subject, whereupon we investigated the effects of sVEGFR1 on the distribution and activation of VEGF ligands and receptors. We assessed the healthy baseline stability of circulating VEGF and sVEGFR1 levels in plasma, as well as their reliability in indicating tissue-level angiogenic signaling potential. Unexpectedly, simulated results showed that sVEGFR1 – acting as a diffusible VEGF sink alone, i.e., without sVEGFR1-VEGFR heterodimerization – did not significantly lower interstitial VEGF, nor inhibit signaling potential in tissues. Additionally, the sensitivity of plasma VEGF and sVEGFR1 to physiological fluctuations in transport rates may partially account for the heterogeneity in clinical measurements of these circulating angiogenic markers, potentially hindering their diagnostic reliability for diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1981456230,"Intracellular signaling systems of G protein-coupled receptors are well established, but their role in paracrine regulation of adjacent cells is generally considered as a tissue-specific mechanism. We have shown previously that AT1 receptor (AT1R) stimulation leads to diacylglycerol lipase-mediated transactivation of co-expressed CB1Rs in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the present study we detected a paracrine effect of the endocannabinoid release from Chinese hamster ovary, COS7, and HEK293 cells during the stimulation of AT1 angiotensin receptors by determining CB1 cannabinoid receptor activity with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based sensors of G protein activation expressed in separate cells. The angiotensin II-induced, paracrine activation of CB1 receptors was visualized by detecting translocation of green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin2. Mass spectrometry analyses have demonstrated angiotensin II-induced stimulation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol production, whereas no increase of anandamide levels was observed. Stimulation of Gq/11-coupled M1, M3, M5 muscarinic, V1 vasopressin, α1a adrenergic, B2 bradykinin receptors, but not Gi/o-coupled M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors, also led to paracrine transactivation of CB1 receptors.

Activation of Gq/11 protein-coupled receptors causes phospholipase C activation, which produces inositol-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, leading to Ca2+-signal generation and protein kinase C activation. However, the concerted response of tissues to chemical mediators frequently also involves the activation of cells adjacent to the target cells, due to the release of paracrine mediators. A well known example is NO, which can be released from activated endothelial cells to cause relaxation of adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells. Lipid mediators can also act as intercellular messengers. For example, endocannabinoids released from postsynaptic neurons after depolarization act as retrograde transmitters by binding to and stimulating presynaptic cannabinoid receptors, which leads to inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid release (an event termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, DSI) (5Howlett A.C.

In contrast, in peripheral tissues baseline levels of endocannabinoid production usually manifest as “endocannabinoid tone,” with poorly understood localization of the various components of the endocannabinoid system. 2-AG levels in brain homogenates and in many peripheral tissues are near its Kd for the CB1R (19Sugiura T.

There is mounting evidence that endocannabinoids play important roles in peripheral cardiovascular, inflammatory, intestinal, and metabolic regulation (21Kogan N.M. Mechoulam R. Dialogues Clin.

Acta. 1975; 415: 81-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), and DAGL is expressed ubiquitously (27Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I.

In accordance with this hypothesis, we have recently shown that angiotensin II- (Ang II)-mediated activation of the Gq/11-coupled AT1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R) leads to DAGL-dependent activation of CB1Rs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (28Turu G.

Here our aim has been to examine the possibility that 2-AG serves as a common paracrine signal generated via activation of Gq/11 protein-coupled, Ca2+-mobilizing receptors. Accordingly, we co-expressed CB1Rs and BRET-based sensors of G protein activation in CHO cells, and used these cells to detect endocannabinoid release from adjacent cells that express AT1R or other Ca2+-mobilizing GPCRs. We have further shown that activation of AT1R by Ang II increases 2-AG levels in CHO cells. These findings suggest that 2-AG is commonly released following activation of Ca2+-mobilizing GPCRs and serves as a paracrine signal to activate CB1R in neighboring cells.

EYFP-β1 was generated by subcloning human β1 subunit into the mammalian expression vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). αo-Rluc was constructed by replacing the CFP coding region in αo-CFP with Renilla luciferase. Rat HA-AT1R receptor and AT1-EYFP were constructed as described earlier (32Turu G. Szidonya L. Gáborik Z. Buday L. Spät A. Clark A.J. Hunyady L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AT1R-Cerulean was constructed by replacing the cDNA of EYFP with Cerulean coding region (provided by Dr. R. Tsien). CHO cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's suggestions using 2 or 16–24 μg of DNA and 2 or 16 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 6-well plates or 100-mm tissue culture plates, respectively. CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. COS-7 kidney fibroblast cells and HEK293 human embryonic fibroblast cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose, glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin. Mutations in the rat CB1R (D214A and R215A) were performed with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's suggestions and verified using automated sequencing. CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with labeled CB1R and AT1R and GFP-labeled β-arrestin2, as described above, 48 h prior to measurement. In transactivation experiments, the cells were detached with Versene 1 day after transfection; the indicated cells were mixed and placed back to coverslips. Cerulean, EGFP, and RFP were excited with the 458 and 488 nm lines of the argon laser and the 543 nm line of the helium/neon laser, respectively; their emitted fluorescence was detected in multitrack mode with 480–520 nm, 500–530 nm band pass and 560 nm long pass filters, respectively. Because GFP caused a weak cross-talk in this setup in the 480–520 nm band pass channel used for Cerulean, the full images showing Cerulean were corrected for the cross-talk of the GFP signals. Energy transfer between G protein subunits was measured using αo G protein subunit fused with Renilla luciferase (αo-Rluc) and β1 subunit labeled with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP-β1). Medium was changed to fetal bovine serum-supplemented Ham's F-12 6 h following transfection and incubated overnight. Before the experiments the cells were detached with Versene and centrifuged. Cells were suspended in a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing (in mm): 120 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.7 MgSO4, 10 glucose, 10 sodium Hepes, pH 7.4 (containing 1 g/liter albumin in paracrine transactivation studies) and transferred to white 96-well plates. The cell density was between 100,000 and 200,000 cells/well. Coelenterazine h was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a Mithras LB 940 Multilabel Reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). BRET ratio was defined as (emission at 530 nm)/(emission at 485), and the normalized BRET ratio was calculated as the BRET ratio for the co-expressed EYFP-tagged and Rluc-tagged molecules minus the BRET ratio for the co-expressed non-tagged and Rluc-tagged molecules. Data for G protein activity are shown as the percent changes in normalized BRET ratios compared with the mean of the four control BRET ratio points before the first stimulation (BRET ratio, percent of control). CHO cells transfected with AT1R were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium in 10-cm tissue culture plates as described above. Aliquots of 4 × 106 cells in 10-cm tissue culture plates containing 3.5 ml of modified Krebs-Ringer buffer were incubated with vehicle or 100 nm angiotensin II for the indicated times, following which the cells plus medium were extracted in 2 volumes of ice-cold chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 7 ng of 4H2-anandamide as internal standard. The chloroform phase was separated and re-extracted twice and finally dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried residue was reconstructed in 100 μl of chloroform, deproteinated with 2 ml of ice-cold acetone, centrifuged, and the clear supernatant was evaporated to dryness. Samples were resuspended in 50 μl of methanol for analysis of endocannabinoid content by liquid chromatography/in line mass spectrometry, as described (33Wang L. Liu J. Harvey-White J. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one- or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance combined with Holm-Sidak test using the software SigmaStat for Windows 3.5 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). The value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. We have previously shown that CB1R can be transactivated with Ang II in cells co-expressing CB1R and AT1R (28Turu G. Simon A. Gyombolai P. Szidonya L. Bagdy G. Lenkei Z. Hunyady L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7753-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that, if the transactivation of CB1R was caused by a released endocannabinoid, it would also occur if AT1R and CB1R were expressed in separate, adjacent cells. To examine this possibility, we monitored the activation of CB1Rs expressed in CHO cells to detect Ang II-induced endocannabinoid release by other cells mixed to the cells expressing CB1R. CB1R activity was quantified by detecting bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between Go protein subunits (Renilla luciferase-tagged αo and EYFP-tagged β1, αo-Rluc, and EYFP-β1, respectively) as described previously (28Turu G. Simon A. Gyombolai P. Szidonya L. Bagdy G. Lenkei Z. Hunyady L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7753-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this experimental setting, activation of CB1R leads to a decrease of the BRET signal resulting from the dissociation of activated Go protein subunits, whereas inactivation by an antagonist increases the BRET signal, because it leads to the association of G protein subunits (28Turu G. Simon A. Gyombolai P. Szidonya L. Bagdy G. Lenkei Z. Hunyady L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7753-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected either with expression plasmids of AT1R, or were co-transfected with plasmids of CB1R and tagged G protein subunits. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were mixed and CB1R activity was measured by detecting BRET interaction between G protein subunits, as a way to monitor endocannabinoid release. Stimulation of the cells with Ang II led to a decrease in BRET signal indicating activation of CB1R (Fig. 1A, filled circles). Administration of the CB1R inverse agonist AM251 caused an increase in the BRET signal, reflecting the inhibition of the basal activity of the receptor. AM251 also blocked the Ang II-induced transactivation (Fig. 1A, open circles). A slight baseline shift of the BRET signal occurred during treatment, which might have been caused by the small increase in volume; and the kinetics of the response was too fast to analyze its initial phase with manual stimulation. Therefore, an automated injector was used in separate experiments to analyze the initial phase of the Ang II-induced response in higher time-resolution (Fig. 1, B and C). The initial baseline shift occurred promptly both in control and stimulated cells. In Ang II-stimulated cells (filled circles) after a lag time of ∼15–20 s the BRET signal decreased rapidly (Fig. 1B), which was not observed in cells treated with medium (control cells, open squares). AM251 fully prevented the effect of Ang II stimulation on the BRET signal (Fig. 1C). When AT1R-transfected cells were mixed with cells expressing the Go sensor, but no CB1R, Go protein activation did not occur, which provides additional evidence that it was mediated through CB1R (Fig. 1D). Similarly, when cells expressing CB1R, but not AT1R, were stimulated with Ang II, the BRET signal remained unaffected (Fig. 1E). In other experiments, the original 1:1 ratio of AT1R or CB1R-expressing cells was increased to 5:1 or decreased to 0.1:1, keeping the number of CB1R-expressing cells constant at 100,000 cells/well, which resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease, respectively, in Go protein activation, approaching a plateau between 1:1 and 5:1 cell ratios (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that Go protein activation in CB1R-expressing cells was mediated by Ang II-induced endocannabinoid release from CHO cells expressing AT1R. Transactivation of CB1R was also inhibited by pretreatment of the cells expressing AT1R with the DAGL inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin (1 μm) (Fig. 2A, open triangles), suggesting that DAGL plays a role in the process. Statistical analysis of the data is shown in Fig. 2B. Transactivation of CHO cells expressing CB1Rs was also detected when these cells were mixed with equal number of HEK293 or COS7 cells expressing AT1Rs, and stimulated with Ang II. These data demonstrate that the AT1R-mediated paracrine transactivation of CB1Rs is not restricted to CHO cells and may be a common mechanism in different cell types (Fig. 3). Slightly increased transactivation of CB1Rs was observed, when these AT1R-expressing cells were added in a 5-fold excess, suggesting that the response was almost maximal under these conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). To provide additional evidence that Ang II-induced activation of AT1R leads to the formation and release of endocannabinoids, β-arrestin translocation to transactivated CB1Rs was measured in CHO cells. β-Arrestin coupling to GPCRs has often been used as an indicator of receptor activation (31Barak L.S.

When RFP-tagged CB1R (CB1R-RFP) was co-expressed with GFP-tagged β-arrestin2 (β-arr2GFP), CB1R-RFP localized both to the cell membrane and to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the previously reported constitutive internalization of this receptor, which may be caused by constitutive receptor activity, endocannabinoid formation, or other mechanisms (28Turu G.

Following stimulation with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2, β-arr2-GFP translocated to the activated CB1Rs at the cell surface, and was detected in punctate structures at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). The conserved DRY motif in the second intracellular loop of GPCRs has been previously implicated in β-arrestin binding of some GPCRs (36Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

The enhanced β-arrestin binding of these receptors may be caused by their reduced G protein coupling (41Gáborik Z. Jagadeesh G. Zhang M. Spät A. Catt K.J. Hunyady L.

We have generated mutations in the conserved DRY motif within the second intracellular loop of CB1R (D214A and R215A) (CB1R[DRY/AAY]). To study the interaction of the mutant CB1R with β-arrestin, RFP-tagged CB1R(DRY/AAY) (CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP) was co-expressed with β-arr2-GFP in CHO cells. In non-stimulated cells, β-arr2-GFP was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm, but basal activity of this mutant CB1R caused its appearance in punctate structures at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B, left). Stimulation with WIN55,212-2 caused robust translocation of β-arr2-GFP to the plasma membrane, with only very faint fluorescence remaining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B, middle). These data demonstrate that co-expression of CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP with β-arr2-GFP is a sensitive tool for visualization of both basal and agonist-induced CB1R activity. To test if endocannabinoid release could be detected by β-arr2-GFP translocation to CB1R, CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP and β-arr2-GFP were co-expressed in CHO cells, and a separate pool of cells were transfected independently with AT1R-Cerulean. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were mixed and placed on coverslips, and another day later they were visualized using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, after Ang II-induced stimulation of the mixed CHO cell population expressing CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP and β-arr2-GFP or AT1R-Cerulean, translocation of β-arr2-GFP to the plasma membrane was observed in cells expressing CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP. This response was observed in 67 ± 7% of cells (n = 3, 86 cells total) with neighboring AT1R-Cerulean-expressing cells; whereas in parallel experiments, when cells expressing CB1R(DRY/AAY)-RFP and β-arr2-GFP were stimulated with Ang II in the absence of AT1R-expressing cells, no translocation of β-arr2-GFP was detected (Fig. 4C). These data provide additional evidence that a paracrine endocannabinoid mediator is released as a result of AT1R activation. To verify whether the Ang II-induced decrease in BRET signal detected by confocal microscopy was, in fact, due to endocannabinoid release, we measured 2-AG and anandamide levels in control and Ang II-stimulated AT1R-expressing cells"
https://openalex.org/W2081703573,"The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 degrade host hemoglobin to provide free amino acids for parasite protein synthesis. Hemoglobin hydrolysis has been described as an ordered process initiated by aspartic proteases, but cysteine protease inhibitors completely block the process, suggesting that cysteine proteases can also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis. To characterize the specific roles of falcipains, we used three approaches. First, using random P1 – P4 amino acid substrate libraries, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated strong preference for cleavage sites with Leu at the P2 position. Second, with overlapping peptides spanning α and β globin and proteolysis-dependent 18O labeling, hydrolysis was seen at many cleavage sites. Third, with intact hemoglobin, numerous cleavage products were identified. Our results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by malaria parasites is not a highly ordered process, but rather proceeds with rapid cleavage by falcipains at multiple sites. However, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 show strong specificity for P2 Leu in small peptide substrates, in agreement with the specificity in optimized small molecule inhibitors that was identified previously. These results are consistent with a principal role of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by P. falciparum and with the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors with optimized specificity as antimalarial agents."
https://openalex.org/W1998233759,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells to initiate immune response against pathogens, but mechanisms controlling the maturation of DCs are unclear. Here we report that, in the absence of recombination signal binding protein-Jkappa (RBP-J, the transcription factor mediating Notch signaling), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte-derived DCs are arrested at a developmental stage with few dendrites, low major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) expression, and reduced motility and antigen presentation ability. RBP-J null DCs had lower expression of CXCR4. Transduction with a CXCR4-expressing lentivirus rescued developmental arrest of RBP-J-deficient DCs. Activation of Notch signaling in DCs up-regulated CXCR4 expression and increased the outgrowth of dendrites and the expression of MHC II. These effects were abrogated by a CXCR4 inhibitor. Therefore, Notch signaling is essential for DCs to transit from a dendrite(low)MHC II(low) immature state into a dendrite(high)MHC II(high) mature state, during the lipopolysaccharide-induced DC maturation, most likely through the up-regulation of CXCR4."
https://openalex.org/W1981367181,"Phenotypic heterogeneity in a clonal cell population is a well-observed but poorly understood phenomenon. Here, a single-cell approach is employed to investigate non-mutative causes of phenotypic heterogeneity during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into fat cells. Using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy and flow cytometry, adipogenic gene expression, insulin signaling, and glucose import are visualized simultaneously with lipid droplet accumulation in single cells. Expression of adipogenic genes PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, aP2, LP2 suggests a commitment to fat cell differentiation in all cells. However, the lack of lipid droplet in many differentiating cells suggests adipogenic gene expression is insufficient for lipid droplet formation. Instead, cell-to-cell variability in lipid droplet formation is dependent on the cascade responses of an insulin signaling pathway which includes insulin sensitivity, kinase activity, glucose import, expression of an insulin degradation enzyme, and insulin degradation rate. Increased and prolonged insulin stimulation promotes lipid droplet accumulation in all differentiating cells. Single-cell profiling reveals the kinetics of an insulin signaling cascade as the origin of phenotypic variability in drug-inducible adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2146734285,"Despite an intense interest in the biological functions of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling enzymes, little is known about the regulation of PI3K gene expression. This also applies to the leukocyte-enriched p110delta catalytic subunit of PI3K, an enzyme that has attracted widespread interest because of its role in immunity and allergy.We show that p110delta expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. In fibroblasts, lymphocytes and myeloid cells, p110delta gene transcription appears to be constitutive and not subject to acute stimulation. 5'RACE experiments revealed that p110delta mRNA transcripts contain distinct upstream untranslated exons (named exon -1, -2a, -2b, -2c and -2d), which are located up to 81 kb upstream of the translational start codon in exon 1. The levels of all the different p110delta transcripts are higher in leukocytes compared to non-leukocytes, with the p110delta transcript containing exon -2a most abundantly expressed. We have identified a highly conserved transcription factor (TF) binding cluster in the p110delta gene which has enhanced promoter activity in leukocytes compared to non-leukocytes. In human, this TF cluster is located immediately upstream of exon -2a whilst in mouse, it is located within exon -2a.This study identifies a conserved PIK3CD promoter region that may account for the predominant leukocyte expression of p110delta."

Here we report the first psychophysical data concerning effects of microsaccade/eyeblink rate upon perceptual switches during MIB. We find that the rate of microsaccades/eyeblink rises before and after perceptual transitions from not seeing to seeing the dot, and decreases before perceptual transitions from seeing it to not seeing it. In addition, event-related fMRI data reveal that, when a dot subjectively reappears during MIB, the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal increases in V1v and V2v and decreases in contralateral hMT+. These BOLD signal changes observed upon perceptual state changes in MIB could be driven by the change of perceptual states and/or a confounding factor, such as the microsaccade/eyeblink rate."

It was subsequently shown to be governed by the five-gene dnd cluster. Similar gene clusters have now been found to be widespread among many other distantly related bacteria. Recently the dnd cluster was shown to mediate the incorporation of sulphur into the DNA backbone via a sequence-selective, stereo-specific phosphorothioate modification in Escherichia coli B7A. Intriguingly, to date all identified dnd clusters lie within mobile genetic elements, the vast majority in laterally transferred genomic islands.We organized available data from experimental and bioinformatics analyses about the DNA phosphorothioation phenomenon and associated documentation as a dndDB database. It contains the following detailed information: (i) Dnd phenotype; (ii) dnd gene clusters; (iii) genomic islands harbouring dnd genes; (iv) Dnd proteins and conserved domains. As of 25 December 2008, dndDB contained data corresponding to 24 bacterial species exhibiting the Dnd phenotype reported in the scientific literature. In addition, via in silico analysis, dndDB identified 26 syntenic dnd clusters from 25 species of Eubacteria and Archaea, 25 dnd-bearing genomic islands and one dnd plasmid containing 114 dnd genes. A further 397 other genes coding for proteins with varying levels of similarity to Dnd proteins were also included in dndDB. A broad range of similarity search, sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools are readily accessible to allow for to individualized directions of research focused on dnd genes.dndDB can facilitate efficient investigation of a wide range of aspects relating to dnd DNA modification and other island-encoded functions in host organisms. dndDB version 1.0 is freely available at http://mml.sjtu.edu.cn/dndDB/."
https://openalex.org/W2019919906,"The role of flagella and motility in the attachment of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to various surfaces is mixed with some systems requiring flagella for an interaction and others needing only motility for cells to get to the surface. In nature this bacterium is a saprophyte and contaminated produce is an avenue for infection. Previous studies have documented the ability of this organism to attach to and colonize plant tissue. Motility mutants were generated in three wild type strains of L. monocytogenes by deleting either flaA, the gene encoding flagellin, or motAB, genes encoding part of the flagellar motor, and tested for both the ability to colonize sprouts and for the fitness of that colonization. The motAB mutants were not affected in the colonization of alfalfa, radish, and broccoli sprouts; however, some of the flaA mutants showed reduced colonization ability. The best colonizing wild type strain was reduced in colonization on all three sprout types as a result of a flaA deletion. A mutant in another background was only affected on alfalfa. The third, a poor alfalfa colonizer was not affected in colonization ability by any of the deletions. Fitness of colonization was measured in experiments of competition between mixtures of mutant and parent strains on sprouts. Here the flaA and motAB mutants of the three strain backgrounds were impaired in fitness of colonization of alfalfa and radish sprouts, and one strain background showed reduced fitness of both mutant types on broccoli sprouts. Together these data indicate a role for flagella for some strains to physically colonize some plants, while the fitness of that colonization is positively affected by motility in almost all cases."
https://openalex.org/W1985917132,"The biosynthesis of the enediyne moiety of the antitumor natural product calicheamicin involves an iterative polyketide synthase (CalE8) and other ancillary enzymes. In the proposed mechanism for the early stage of 10-membered enediyne biosynthesis, CalE8 produces a carbonyl-conjugated polyene with the assistance of a putative thioesterase (CalE7). We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of CalE7 and found that the subunit adopts a hotdog fold with an elongated and kinked substrate-binding channel embedded between two subunits. The 1.75-Å crystal structure revealed that CalE7 does not contain a critical catalytic residue (Glu or Asp) conserved in other hotdog fold thioesterases. Based on biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we proposed a catalytic mechanism in which the conserved Arg37 plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of the thioester bond, and that Tyr29 and a hydrogen-bonded water network assist the decarboxylation of the β-ketocarboxylic acid intermediate. Moreover, computational docking suggested that the substrate-binding channel binds a polyene substrate that contains a single cis double bond at the C4/C5 position, raising the possibility that the C4=C5 double bond in the enediyne moiety could be generated by the iterative polyketide synthase.

The gene clusters also contain open reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins for the downstream processing of the PKS product. The involvement of similar genes in enediyne biosynthesis was later confirmed for neocarzinostatin, maduropeptin, dynemicin, and several putative enediyne natural products in soil and marine microorganisms (8.Liu W.

Recently, based on the study on the 9-membered enediyne-containing C-1027, Shen and coworkers found that the iterative PKS (SgcE) and the putative thioesterase (SgcE10) generated a conjugated polyene (1,3,5,7,9,11,13-pentadecaheptaene) through an ACP-tethered 3-hydroxy-4,6,8,10,12,14-hexadecahexaene intermediate during co-expression in Escherichia coli (12.Zhang J. Lanen S.G.V. Ju J. Liu W. Dorrestein P.C. Li W. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1461-1465Google Scholar). The release of the product catalyzed by the putative thioesterase SgcE10 presumably occurs through a combination of hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and dehydration steps. Recent biochemical studies of the iterative PKS (CalE8) from the biosynthetic pathway of calicheamicin also provided insight into the early steps of 10-membered enediyne biosynthesis (13.Kong R.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was observed that CalE8 produced a linear carbonyl-conjugated polyene (3,5,7,9,11,13-pentadecen-2-one (1)) with the assistance of the putative thioesterase CalE7 (Fig. 1). The putative biosynthetic intermediate 1 was proposed to derive from a 16-carbon-long β-ketocarboxylic intermediate tethered to CalE8 (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the loss of one carbon unit during product release, a decarboxylation process was speculated to occur following the hydrolysis of the thioester bond. polyketide synthase type I thioesterase type II thioesterase 4-hydroxylbenzoyl-CoA thioesterase high-performance liquid chromatography root mean square deviation acyl carrier protein. polyketide synthase type I thioesterase type II thioesterase 4-hydroxylbenzoyl-CoA thioesterase high-performance liquid chromatography root mean square deviation acyl carrier protein. Polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis generally involves the so-called type I and type II thioesterases for the release of final product or removal of aberrant products. Type I thioesterases (TE I) are cis-acting domains fused to the C terminus of the most downstream module of PKS or non-ribosomal peptide synthase for the release and cyclization of the final product (15.Akey D.L.

Marahiel M.A. Walsh C.T. Nature. 2000; 407: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). By contrast, type II thioesterases (TE II) are discrete proteins responsible for the trans hydrolytic release of aberrant products (17.Kim B.S. Cropp T.A. Beck B.J. Sherman D.H. Reynolds K.A. J.

TE II proteins are structurally and evolutionarily related to a family of well known α/β hydrolase that contain 240–260 residues (20.Koglin A. Lohr F. Bernhard F. Rogov V.V. Frueh D.P. Strieter E.R.

A common serine esterase motif GXSXG and another downstream motif GXH are conserved in TE II proteins (21.Linne U. Schwarzer D. Schroeder G.N. Marahiel M.A. Eur. J.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The stand-alone 146-amino acid-containing CalE7 does not belong to the TE II family, because it is neither an α/β fold hydrolase nor a protein containing the two conserved motifs for TE II. Instead, CalE7 shares moderate sequence homology with a family of hotdog fold proteins characterized by a long central α-helix packed against a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Such hotdog fold proteins include many characterized and hypothetical thioesterases that use acyl CoA as substrates (23.Dillon S.C. Bateman A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure and substrate specificity of several hotdog fold thioesterases have been determined, including YbgC from Helicobacter pylori (24.Angelini A. Cendron L. Goncalves S.

Langley R. Gulten G. Wang L. Sacchettini J.C. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we present structural and biochemical data showing that CalE7 does not contain an acidic residue in its active site and is thus likely to utilize a different catalytic mechanism. The results also suggest that CalE7 facilitates a subsequent decarboxylation step to yield the carbonyl-conjugated polyene (1). Hence, the results introduce a hotdog fold thioesterase with a novel product-releasing mechanism in comparison with the traditional type I and II thioesterases associated with the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products. Furthermore, the crystal structure revealed a kinked substrate-binding channel that is predicted to bind a cis-double bond-containing polyene substrate, raising the possibility that CalE8 is able to generate a cis-double bond. Coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, NADPH, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and stored at −20 °C. Expression vectors pET-28b(+), pET-26b(+), pCDF, and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were obtained from Novagen. The SgcE10 gene was provided by GenScript Corp. Cloning, expression, and purification of CalE8 and CalE7 have been described previously (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of CalE7 was performed using QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions and with the mutations confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified following the same procedure as the wild-type protein. For the expression and purification of SgcE10, the SgcE10 gene was subcloned into the vector pCDF-2 according to the instruction manual for pCDF-2 Ek/LIC kit (Novagen) to give the expression plasmid pCDF-SgcE10. The expression and purification of the (His)6-tagged SgcE10 was carried out following the protocol for CalE7 (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the expression plasmid was grown in LB medium supplemented with streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6. After shaking for 20 h at 16 °C, the cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer that contains 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C until use. The CalE7 gene was subcloned into pCDF-2 according to the instruction manual for pCDF-2 Ek/LIC kit (Novagen). The resulting plasmid pCDF-CalE7 was co-transformed with pET-CalE8 into the BL21(DE3) competent cells for protein co-expression. The LB medium inoculated with the transformed cells was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.6. After shaking for 20 h at 16 °C, the cells were harvested and lysed for protein purification following the procedure described previously (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because both CalE8 and CalE7 contain an His6 tag, the purification by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography yielded a solution that contains both proteins. The colorless CalE8 and colored CalE7 were subsequently separated and purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Steady-state kinetic measurement was carried out with 10.5 μm CalE7 or CalE7 mutant, 1.12 μm CalE8, 175 μm NADPH (saturating concentration), and malonyl-CoA at various concentrations in 200 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C. The reaction mixture without malonyl-CoA was equilibrated at 30 °C for 15 min in the temperature-controlled sample chamber of Shimadzu UV-visible 1700 spectrometer. Enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of malonyl-CoA. A full wavelength spectrum scan was performed at every 2-min interval throughout the course of the experiment. The absorbance at 420 nm was corrected for baseline before being used for calculation of initial velocities. The initial velocity data were fitted non-linearly to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Vmax. For large scale reactions, the pre-reaction mixture consisting of 3.6 μm CalE8, 7.0 μm CalE7, 0.15 mm acetyl-CoA, and 1.05 mm NADPH was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. 1.05 mm malonyl-CoA was added to start the reaction. Following 3 h of incubation, the yellow reaction mixture was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and extracted by using ethyl acetate. The resulting organic extract was evaporated by using a SpeedVac. The dried sample was re-dissolved in methanol before application onto an analytical eclipse XDB C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using an Agilent 1200 HPLC. A 60-min linear gradient was used starting with 100% Buffer A (HPLC grade water with 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) to 100% Buffer B (acetonitrile with 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid). The diode-array detector was set at 410 nm with a reference wavelength of 600 nm. The characterization of the products by high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry has been described previously (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCDF-CalE7 or pCDF-SgcE10 was co-transformed with pET-CalE8 into the BL21(DE3)-competent cells. The colored CalE7 and SgcE10 were expressed and purified following the procedure described above. The protein solution was treated with trifluoroacetic acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was evaporated by using a SpeedVac, and the dried sample was re-dissolved in methanol before application onto an analytical eclipse XDB C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using an Agilent 1200 HPLC. Product quantification was carried out by using the same HPLC solvent system and conditions described above. Prior to crystallization, CalE7 purified from co-expression with CalE8 was buffer exchanged and concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl using Amicon centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). An automated initial crystallization screen of 672 conditions was performed using the CyBio®-Crystal Creator (Jena Biosciences). A volume of 200 nl of purified CalE7 was added to an equal volume of crystallization solution using the sitting drop, vapor-diffusion method. Crystals were obtained at 291 K with Index Screen condition 38 (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 30% Jeffamine-M600, Hampton Research). Crystals up to 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm in size could be grown in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, 28% Jeffamine-M600. Before data collection, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 28% Jeffamine-M600 and 25% glycerol and cooled to 100 K in a gaseous N2 stream using an Oxford cryosystem. Diffraction intensities were collected at the NSRRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan) to a resolution of 1.75 Å using one single crystal and were integrated, merged, and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The structure of CalE7 was solved using the molecular replacement software MrBUMP (33.Keegan R.M. Winn M.D. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with the crystal structure of a hypothetical protein (AQ1494) from Aquifex aeolicus (PDB code 2EGI, RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative) having an overall homology of only 28% of 126 aligned residues with CalE7, as a search probe (Fig. 3A). Automated model building was carried out with Arp/warp (34.Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The structure was refined using molecular dynamics and simulated annealing as implemented in the program CNS (35.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar), with positional and individual temperature factor refinement without NCS restrains. The computer graphics software O was used for model rebuilding between refinement cycles (36.Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Analysis of the atomic model was carried out with the CCP4 suite of programs (37.Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). The refined coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the PDB (PDB code: 2W3X). The substrates used for docking were built from scratch using Build tools available in the Maestro program and were processed further with the program LigPrep (38.Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar). The docking of the substrates into the substrate-binding pocket of CalE7 was performed using GLIDE in the standard precision mode (38.Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar). Both the protein and substrates were modeled using the OPLS-AA force field (39.Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1225-11236Crossref Scopus (10455) Google Scholar). The enzymatic assays were carried out by incubating CalE8 and CalE7 with acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At alkaline pH (pH 8.8), the carbonyl-conjugated polyene 1 (C15H18O, [M+1]+, m/z 215.1432), and its geometrical isomers were the major products as shown by absorption spectroscopy and HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). The 15 carbon-containing 1 has been proposed to derive from a PKS-tethered β-ketocarboxylic acid intermediate after hydrolysis and decarboxylation (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We noticed that CalE8 and CalE7 also generated three minor products (2, 3, and 4) with shorter retention time. These minor products exhibited absorption maxima of 310 nm (2), 355 nm (3), and 375 nm (4), respectively, relative to the 395 nm maximum for 1. High resolution mass spectrometry suggested that 2, 3, and 4 are a series of aberrant or immature products with predicted molecular formula of C8H8O3 (2, [M+1]+, m/z 153.2912), C10H10O3 (3, [M+1]+, m/z 179.2309), and C12H12O3 (4, [M+1]+, m/z 205.1208). Although the characterization of the molecular structures of 2, 3, and 4 by NMR is difficult given the low yield, the deduced molecular formula and tandem mass spectrometry spectra suggested that they are most likely the lactones formed in solution from the linear tetra-, penta-, and hexaketide PKS products (supplemental Fig. S1). The yield of 1 decreased with decreasing pH to a point (pH 6.6) that 2, 3, and 4 become the major products. Importantly, only a negligible amount of 1, 2, 3, and 4 could be observed in the absence of CalE7 under all pH conditions, indicating that CalE7 is responsible for the release of 1 as well as the tetra-, penta-, and hexaketide linear intermediates. The observation that CalE7 did not discriminate the ACP domain-tethered acyl substrates with shorter chain length indicates CalE7 is not the determining factor of chain length. We previously observed the expression of product-bound CalE7 when this protein was co-expressed with CalE8 (13.Kong R. Goh L.P. Liew C.W. Ho Q.S. Murugan E. Li B. Tang K. Liang Z.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8142-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The product-bound CalE7 was used for crystallization in an attempt to obtain the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme-product complex. However, despite the intense yellow appearance of the original protein solution due to the binding of the product, crystallization in the presence of Jeffamine M-600, a polyether amine, appears to select the subpopulation of unliganded CalE7. As a result, only the structure of the apo-enzyme was obtained, which was refined to a final Rwork of 0.196 and Rfree of 0.234 with good stereochemistry (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains six molecules that can be overlaid with an average r.m.s.d. of 0.56 Å. Mobile amino acids located at the N- and C-terminal ends of each monomer could not be traced. The CalE7 monomer (Fig. 3B) exhibits a typical α/β hotdog fold with the five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet wrapping around the long α-helix α1 and two shorter α-helices α2 and α3 at the N terminus of the central helix (23.Dillon S.C. Bateman A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The main conformational differences between the six independent monomers are observed in the β5–α3 loop where a displacement of ∼2.8 Å is observed for one monomer (supplemental Fig. S2). A search for similar protein structures (40.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) revealed that CalE7 is closely related to members of YbgC-like thioesterases from E. coli and H. pylori (24.Angelini A. Cendron L. Goncalves S. Zanotti G. Terradot L. Proteins. 2008; 72: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with r.m.s.d. of 1.6 Å for 129 and 127 equivalent Cα atoms after superposition and to the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase of Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 (30.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Zhuang Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27468-27476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (with an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å for 135 equivalent Cα atoms). Based on size-exclusion chromatography, CalE7 is a tetramer in solution. Six subunits were seen in the asymmetric unit: four form a 222 (or D2) tetramer and two form a 2-fold symmetric dimer. A second complete 222 tetramer can be generated from the latter dimer via the crystallographic dyad. As seen for other hotdog fold thioesterases, dimerization proceeds through the formation of a continuous 10-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with the central helices on the inner side of the β-sheet (Fig. 3C). This buried dimer interface (4540 Å2) is stabilized via main-chain interactions between strands β2 and by residues 25–34 of the central helix α1 with their 2-fold counterparts, as well as by hydrophobic interactions between α2 of one subunit and the β1–α1 loop of the other subunit.

https://openalex.org/W2006797240,"Commensal flora and pathogenic microbes influence the incidence of diabetes in animal models yet little is known about the mechanistic basis of these interactions. We hypothesized that Myd88, an adaptor molecule in the Toll-like-receptor (TLR) pathway, regulates pancreatic β-cell function and homeostasis. We first examined β-cells histologically and found that Myd88−/− mice have smaller islets in comparison to C57Bl/6 controls. Myd88−/− mice were nonetheless normoglycemic both at rest and after an intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In contrast, after low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) challenge, Myd88−/−mice had an abnormal IPGTT relative to WT controls. Furthermore, Myd88−/− mice suffer enhanced β-cell apoptosis and have enhanced hepatic damage with delayed recovery upon low-dose STZ treatment. Finally, we treated WT mice with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics to deplete their commensal flora. In WT mice, low dose oral lipopolysaccharide, but not lipotichoic acid or antibiotics alone, strongly promoted enhanced glycemic control. These data suggest that Myd88 signaling and certain TLR ligands mediate a homeostatic effect on β-cells primarily in the setting of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2123594750,"Delayed colonic emptying leading to constipation is a significant health concern. We investigated the role of adenosine 2B receptor (A2BAR) in modulating distal colonic motility using wild-type and A2BAR-knockout (A2BAR–/–) mice. Colon motility was assessed using stool characteristics and colonic transit. Distal colonic ganglia, isolated by laser capture microdissection, were tested for A2BAR expression by RT- PCR. The distal colon contraction and relaxation responses were assessed by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in presence of A2BAR agonists, antagonists or inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) and guanylate cyclase. Nitrite levels were measured in enteric neuronal cultures exposed to A2BAR agonists/antagonists. A2BAR–/– mice display increased stool retention, decreased stool frequency, delayed colonic emptying, and decreased circular muscle relaxation. RT-PCR identified A2BAR expression in distal colonic ganglia. EFS studies revealed that enteric neuronal A2BAR is essential for distal colonic relaxation, and A2BAR antagonists can inhibit relaxation. Enteric neurons stimulated with A2BAR agonists produced more nitrite than cultures treated with antagonists. We demonstrate an essential role of A2BAR in regulating distal colon relaxation, as A2BAR activation is linked to NO signaling. Hence targeting the colonic A2BAR could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat constipation.— Chandrasekharan, B. P., Kolachala, V. L., Dalmasso, G., Merlin, D., Ravid, K., Sitaraman, S.

https://openalex.org/W1972306191,"Skeletal muscle differentiation is well regulated by a series of transcription factors. We reported previously that enhancer of polycomb1 (Epc1), a chromatin protein, can modulate skeletal muscle differentiation, although the mechanisms of this action have yet to be defined. Here we report that Epc1 recruits both serum response factor (SRF) and p300 to induce skeletal muscle differentiation. Epc1 interacted physically with SRF. Transfection of Epc1 to myoblast cells potentiated the SRF-induced expression of skeletal muscle-specific genes as well as multinucleation. Proximal CArG box in the skeletal α-actin promoter was responsible for the synergistic activation of the promoter-luciferase. Epc1 knockdown caused a decrease in the acetylation of histones associated with serum response element (SRE) of the skeletal α-actin promoter. The Epc1·SRF complex bound to the SRE, and the knockdown of Epc1 resulted in a decrease in SRF binding to the skeletal α-actin promoter. Epc1 recruited histone acetyltransferase activity, which was potentiated by cotransfection with p300 but abolished by si-p300. Epc1 directly bound to p300 in myoblast cells. Epc1+/− mice showed distortion of skeletal α-actin, and the isolated myoblasts from the mice had impaired muscle differentiation. These results suggest that Epc1 is required for skeletal muscle differentiation by recruiting both SRF and p300 to the SRE of muscle-specific gene promoters.

These results suggest that Epc1 is required for skeletal muscle differentiation by recruiting both SRF and p300 to the SRE of muscle-specific gene promoters. Skeletal muscle development requires a series of precisely orchestrated steps after mesodermal precursor cells are committed to the skeletal muscle lineage (1Li S. Czubryt M.P. McAnally J.

Upon receiving the environmental signals, myoblasts can differentiate into muscles by withdrawing from the cell cycle and fusing with neighboring myoblasts to make multinucleated myotubes (2Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During differentiation, hundreds of muscle-specific genes are transcriptionally activated, whereas the genes associated with cell proliferation are repressed (3McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Myogenic fates are determined by essential transcription factors. These include the muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) 4The abbreviations used are: MRFmuscle regulatory factorSRFserum response factorRTreverse transcriptionHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseSREserum response element. of the basic helix-loop-helix family proteins, such as MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4. Muscle differentiation depends on the interplay of these skeletal muscle-specific factors with the members of myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), a MADS box transcription factor (4Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). muscle regulatory factor serum response factor reverse transcription hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase serum response element. Serum response factor (SRF) is an important transcription factor for cell survival and differentiation in diverse tissues (5Flück M. Booth F.W. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, in skeletal muscle cells, it is well known that SRF is responsible for the transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes (6Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For example, SRF mRNA and nuclear SRF protein levels increase more than 40-fold when primary skeletal myoblasts are withdrawn from the cell cycle, which precedes the up-regulation of the muscle-specific proteins. However, the dominant-negative SRF mutant blocks the transcription of muscle-specific genes such as skeletal α-actin during myogenesis (6Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which suggests that SRF is an important prerequisite for the initiation of muscle differentiation. Recently, we reported that enhancer of polycomb1 (Epc1) mediates skeletal muscle differentiation by interacting with homeodomain only protein (Hop or Hod) and that muscle regeneration is impaired in Hop null mice (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y. Takahashi M. Jeong M.H. Kim N. Kim K.K. Kook H. J. Biol.

Epc1 was first described to enhance the phenotypes of homozygotic mutations of the polycomb group gene in Drosophila (8Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports elucidated that Epc1 may act as a transcription co-factor as a binding partner of other transcription factors such as E2F6 (9Attwooll C. Oddi S. Cartwright P. Prosperini E. Agger K.

Although Epc1 is known to associate with other transcriptional modulators, the biological role of Epc1 and its regulatory mechanism in mammalian tissues remains to be described. In this study, we postulated that Epc1 induces muscle differentiation by interacting with SRF, an important modulator of muscle differentiation (11Weinhold B. Schratt G. Arsenian S. Berger J. Kamino K. Schwarz H. Rüther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5835-5844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the mechanism of action of Epc1 in association with SRF and p300 and also investigated the muscle phenotypes of mice in which Epc1 expression was disrupted. The Epc1-mediated enhancement of SRF-dependent muscle gene expression is mediated by its interaction with p300, which possesses histone acetyltransferase activity. Epc1 heterozygous mice show a delay in myoblast differentiation, which suggests that Epc1 is a novel modulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. pCMV-myc-mouse Epc1 was described previously. pCMX-p300 was kindly provided by Prof. Debabrata Chakravarti (Northwestern University, Chicago). pCGN-HA-SRF was kindly provided by Prof. Jonathan A. Epstein (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). For the skeletal α-actin promoter-reporter assay, −450 to +26 base pairs from the transcription start site were amplified from mouse genomic DNA and subcloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The CArG-far (−419 to −410) and -near (−97 to −88) mutations of the skeletal α-actin promoter were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). si-p300 was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Chicago). All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Epc1 antibody was described previously (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y. Takahashi M. Jeong M.H. Kim N. Kim K.K.

Antibodies were used to recognize MyoD (C-20, Sc-304), myogenin (M-225, Sc-576), SRF (G-20, Sc-335), c-Myc (9E10, Sc-40), and p300 (c-20, Sc-585) (all of the above were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA)); anti-acetyl-histone H3 (06–599), anti-acetyl-histone H4 (06–866), and anti-histone H3 (05–499) (from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY)); skeletal α-actin (catalogue No. 18-272-196320, Genway Biotech, Inc., San Diego); and anti-histone H4 (catalogue No. 2592, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA). H9c2, COS-7, 293T, 10T1/2, and C2C12 cells were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank and were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 or 15% fetal bovine serum for C2C12 cells. Antisense Epc1 cells were described previously (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y. Takahashi M. Jeong M.H. Kim N. Kim K.K. Kook H. J. Biol.

For transient transfection of SRF and Epc1, pCGN-HA-SRF and/or pCMV-myc-Epc1 was introduced to 293T cells by use of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and to C2C12 or H9c2 cells by use of Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Promoter analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, fluorescent immunocytochemistry, and RT-PCR were described previously (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y.

The antibodies for Western blot analysis were anti-HA (1:500), Epc1 (1:200), p300 (1:1000), and actin (1:2000). The primer sequences for the RT-PCR reaction will be provided upon request. RT-PCR amplification products were confirmed by sequencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed by using a commercially available assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and then recovered with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA beads. After reversing the cross-links, chromatin was subjected to proteinase K digestion, and the DNA was purified. A 197-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides −192 to +5 of the rat skeletal α-actin promoter was amplified by PCR. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (12Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. Jaenisch R. Wagschal A. Feil R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4068) Google Scholar). Epc1 precipitates were then eluted with standard elution buffer, except for washing with high salt solution (500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS), and the chromatin was recruited by anti-SRF antibody. Histone acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (13Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). After cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated with specific antibody, protein A-agarose beads were added. Two μg (50 pmol) of histones (Roche Applied Science) and [14C]acetyl-CoA (50 μCi/μl, 1000 pmol/μl, Amersham Biosciences) were added to the precipitates and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by use of a quantitative imaging device (PhosphorImager, GE Healthcare). The experimental protocol was approved by the Chonnam National University Medical School Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Gene-trapped embryonic stem cells (XB645) were purchased from University of California-Davis after confirmation of the preceding sequences by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE). The gene trap vector (pGTOpfs) was inserted in the coding region in the first exon of the mouse Epc1, and the gene trap location was confirmed by sequencing (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea). The 129/Ola mouse embryonic stem cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and then subsequently transferred into pseudopregnant foster mothers. The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous Epc1 mice (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Germ-line transmission was verified by Southern blot analysis against neo probes or reporter gene in the gene trap vector. The mice were maintained by backcrossing over six generations. The isolation of myoblasts was described previously (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y. Takahashi M. Jeong M.H. Kim N. Kim K.K. Kook H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7700-7709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Longitudinal and coronal sections of hamstring muscles from either Epc1 heterozygous or wild type mice were prepared as described previously (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C.

Diaminobutyric acid (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) was used for color development in the bright field images. Skeletal α-actin was visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) after probing with specific primary antibody and anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). To investigate whether Epc1 binds to SRF, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation by transfecting pCMV-myc-Epc1 and pCGN-HA-SRF. SRF pulled down Epc1 (Fig. 1A) in 293T cells. Inversely, Epc1 could also recruit SRF (Fig. 1B). Physical interactions of endogenous Epc1 and SRF were confirmed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C). In vitro association between Epc1 and SRF was tested by a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assay; in vitro translated SRF was recruited by GST-Epc1 (Fig. 1D). Both proteins were colocalized in the nucleus of COS-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Next, the biological significance of the interaction of Epc1 and SRF was investigated. First, we measured the transcript level of Epc1 in serum-deprived C2C12 cells. As we described in the previous report using H9c2 cells (7Kee H.J. Kim J.R. Nam K.I. Park H.Y. Shin S. Kim J.C. Shimono Y. Takahashi M. Jeong M.H. Kim N. Kim K.K. Kook H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7700-7709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Epc1 was transiently up-regulated in 3–6 days after serum deprivation (data not shown). MyoD is an important MRF that induces muscle determination and differentiation (14Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of MyoD after cotransfection of SRF and Epc1. Epc1 strengthened the expression of MyoD induced by SRF (Fig. 2, A and C). Likewise, cotransfection of Epc1 and SRF synergistically induced the expression of myogenin (Fig. 2, B and D), a critical determinant of skeletal muscle differentiation and myotube formation (15Fu J. Menzies K. Freeman R.S. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12410-12418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The forced expression of SRF induced a significant increase in the number of multinucleated cells. Although Epc1 did not induce multinucleation, interestingly, it significantly potentiated the SRF-mediated myoblast differentiation (Fig. 2E). We studied whether Epc1 potentiates the SRF-mediated expression of the muscle-specific structural genes as well as transcription factors in C2C12 myoblast cells after transient transfection of pCGN-HA-SRF or pCMV-myc-Epc1. Both SRF and Epc1 were expressed appropriately, as shown in Fig. 3A. The expression level of skeletal α-actin, a primary component of skeletal muscle thin filament (16Carson J.A. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1438-C1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was increased by transfection of SRF, which was further potentiated by cotransfection of Epc1. In addition, myogenin expression was increased by transfection of both genes (Fig. 3, A and B). The transcript levels of MyoD and of muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase (17Lim W. Neff E.S. Furlow J.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 18: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were also further increased by co-transfection of Epc1 and SRF (Fig. 3, C and D). However, the transcript levels of myf-6 (Fig. 3C) or myf-5 (data not shown), which do not contain a CArG box in their promoter region (18Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), were not altered by transfection of SRF and Epc1. The changes in the amounts of transcripts of those muscle-specific genes were evaluated quantitatively by real-time PCR after three independent experiments (Fig. 3D). Like many skeletal muscle-specific genes, skeletal α-actin has an SRE in the promoter region (19Marsh D.R. Carson J.A. Stewart L.N. Booth F.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SRF/SRE is responsible for the action of Epc1, we performed a transfection assay with the minimal promoter of skeletal α-actin (20Stewart A.F. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which contains CArG boxes. Transfection of SRF transactivated the promoter by 2.5-fold over the mock-transfected basal level. Interestingly, cotransfection of Epc1 potentiated the activity by 6-fold, which suggests that the synergistic activation is mediated by the transcriptional regulation of the minimal promoter region (Fig. 4A). The mouse skeletal α-actin proximal promoter has two SREs designated as CArG-near and CArG-far boxes (19Marsh D.R. Carson J.A. Stewart L.N. Booth F.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test which CArG box is required for the synergistic action of SRF and Epc1, mutations were introduced into either the near or the far CArG box (Fig. 4B, left diagrams). Whereas Epc1 and SRF could synergistically activate the skeletal α-actin-luciferase reporter with the CArG-far mutation, the potentiation was completely abolished by the CArG-near or double CArG mutations (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S2). To examine whether Epc1 binds to the SRE together with SRF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with H9c2 cells. In contrast with mouse, rat skeletal α-actin has one CArG box with a sequence identical to the CArG-near of mouse skeletal α-actin (Fig. 4C). Epc1 antibody successfully pulled down the DNA fragments spanning the SRE in the promoter region, whereas it failed to recruit the fragments containing the exon 3 and exon 5 regions (Fig. 4, D and E). We next examined whether SRF and Epc1 bind together to the SRE by performing sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation. The Epc1 precipitates (Fig. 4F, fourth lane) were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-SRF antibody, and it was demonstrated that both Epc1 and SRF can interact with the SRE simultaneously (Fig. 4F, sixth lane). Next, as a mechanism by which Epc1 mediates SRF transactivation, we postulated that Epc1 may enhance the interaction of SRF to the SRE. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we compared the binding of SRF to the SRE in Epc1 knockdown H9c2 cells with that in mock-transfected cells. Reductions in Epc1 transcript and protein amounts were confirmed. However, the amounts of SRF were not significantly affected by Epc1 knockdown (Fig. 5A). As expected, the reduction of Epc1 expression caused a decrease in the binding of Epc1 to the SRE when the Epc1 was pulled down with anti-Epc1 antibody (Fig. 5, B and C). Interestingly, Epc1 knockdown resulted in a decrease in SRF binding to the SRE (Fig. 5, D (third lane) and E). These results indicate that Epc1 is required for the binding of SRF to the SRE. Epc1 homologues mediate epigenetic regulation to enhance the role of the polycomb group genes (21Boudreault A.A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R.T. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) by recruiting histone acetyltransferase activity in Drosophila (22Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The NuA4 complex, which contains Epc1, is known to acetylate histones, and the acetylation is mediated by Tat-interacting protein 60 (Tip60), a MYST family histone acetyltransferase (22Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These previous reports raise the possibility that Epc1 may induce the acetylation of histone residues to activate downstream genes, although little is known about Epc1-mediated histone modification in either mammalian cells or skeletal muscles. First, we measured the histone H3 and H4 acetylation status of the SRE of the skeletal α-actin promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 5, F–I, the residues of both histones H3 and H4 associated with the SRE were acetylated. However, the acetylation was greatly reduced in antisense H9c2 cells, which suggests that Epc1 is necessary for the histone acetylation of the SRE. We performed a histone acetyltransferase assay by using the GST fusion protein of Epc1 in the cell-free condition, but we did not see any intrinsic activity (data not shown). Thus, we used Epc1 immunoprecipitates for the histone acetyltransferase assay and clearly observed the acetylation of histone (Fig. 6C, second lane). The lack of intrinsic activity led us to postulate that histone acetylation was mediated by other histone acetyltransferase proteins. To answer this, immunoprecipitation assays were carried out to observe the physical interaction of Epc1 and other histone acetyltransferase proteins. First, we examined whether Epc1 interacts with Tip60 by transfecting pCMV-myc-Epc1 or pcDNA3.1-HA-Tip60; exogenous Tip60 interacted with Epc1 (data not shown). However, a previous report that Tip60 is barely detected in the skeletal muscle tissue (23McAllister D. Merlo X. Lough J. Gene. 2002; 289: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) raises the question of whether the interaction between Tip60 and Epc1 really takes place in skeletal muscle cells. Indeed, we were not able to detect Tip60 in H9c2 or C2C12 cells or in adult mouse muscle tissue (data not shown). Thus, we postulated that a histone acetyltransferase other than Tip60 may participate in the Epc1-mediated histone acetylation. We immunoprecipitated Epc1 and several histone acetyltransferase proteins such as p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) and p300 were examined. Among them, p300, which is required for skeletal muscle gene transcription (24Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), was successfully detected (Fig. 6A). Reduction of Epc1 in antisense H9c2 cells resulted in a reduction in the interaction with p300. The physical interactions between endogenous Epc1 with endogenous p300 were also confirmed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 6B) and in H9c2 cells (data not shown). The involvement of p300 in the acetylation of the Epc1-containing complex was further confirmed by measuring histone acetyltransferase activity after overexpression or knockdown of p300. When pCMX-p300 was transfected, histone acetylation was enhanced in the Epc1-containing complex precipitates in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6C, second to fourth lane). Transfection of si-p300 successfully reduced the protein amounts of p300 (Fig. 6D). Additionally, treatment with si-p300 significantly reduced the histone acetyltransferase activity in Epc1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6E, fifth lane). To investigate the biological role of Epc1, we generated Epc1 knock-out mice with gene-trapped embryonic stem cells (Fig. 7A). The homozygous mice died in embryo (Fig. 7B). However, Epc1 heterozygous mice survived for more than 6 months without apparent pathological phenotypes (data not shown). Epc1 expression was reduced in the skeletal muscles of the heterozygous mice (Fig. 8A). The expression of desmin was also significantly reduced in the mice (Figs. 7C (right panel) and 8A). In the Epc1 heterozygous mice, the expression of skeletal α-actin was reduced (Fig. 7D). Under the higher magnification, we observed that skeletal α-actin was well demarcated along with sarcomeric striation in the wild type. In contrast, the demarcation was not prominent in heterozygous group (Fig. 7E).FIGURE 8Impaired muscle differentiation in Epc1+/− mice. A, muscle-specific gene expression in hamstring muscles from three wild type and three Epc1+/− mice.

Error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcript levels (Fig. 8A) and protein amounts (Fig. 8B) of several muscle-specific genes or transcription factors in skeletal muscles were also significantly less than those in wild type mice. We examined whether the muscle differentiation of the myoblasts was impaired. Although differentiation of isolated myoblasts by serum deprivation elevated the expression of differentiation markers in the wild type, gene expression was not induced as much in myoblasts from heterozygous mice (Fig. 8C). The reduction in expression of the muscle-specific transcription factors resulted in a delay in the differentiation of the myoblasts, as evaluated by counting the multinucleated cells after serum starvation (Fig. 8D). In our previous report, we observed that Epc1 is involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, which raised the possibility that Epc1 may interact with other muscle-specific transcription factors to regulate differentiation. We have shown here that Epc1 interacts with SRF, a key regulator of diverse muscle differentiation and cell survival (1Li S. Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Wiebel F.F. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Epc1 binds to SRF and activates SRF/SRE-dependent genes by recruiting p300, which induces skeletal muscle differentiation (Fig. 9). Epc1 is required for the full activation of those muscle-specific genes. Many proteins that regulate muscle differentiation, such as GATA4, Nkx2.5, YY-1, TEF-1, and myocardin (26Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 27Gupta M. Sueblinvong V. Gupta M.P. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2007; 85: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), are abruptly induced by removing serum, which implicates the significance of SRF in the regulation of those proteins. SRF, a MADS box transcription factor related to MEF2, is required for the differentiation of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells (1Li S. Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32531-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SRF-dependent genes have similar consensus sequences in their proximal promoter regions called CArG boxes, and the binding of SRF to the promoter region activates downstream genes (26Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 27Gupta M. Sueblinvong V. Gupta M.P. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2007; 85: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Likewise, many SRF-dependent muscle-specific genes have one or more CArG boxes. MyoD is an example of a transcription factor involved in the SRF-dependent regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation; SRF modifies the transcription of MyoD by its binding to the functional CArG element in the distal regulatory region in the promoter (31L'honore A. Lamb N.J. Vandromme M. Turowski P. Carnac G. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Likewise, skeletal α-actin has an SRE in the proximal promoter region (19Marsh D.R. Carson J.A. Stewart L.N. Booth F.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the potentiation of SRF-transactivation by Epc1 is mediated by the CArG box and observed that the minimal promoter of skeletal α-actin containing the SRE was required for Epc1-mediated transactivation. In this study, we observed that Epc1 binds to SRF to enhance the muscle differentiation in the myoblast cell lines. Mouse skeletal α-actin has two CArG boxes, designated CArG-near and CArG-far, both of which can bind to SRF (32Chang P.S. Li L. McAnally J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17206-17212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By disrupting the CArG box sequences with site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the mouse CArG-near box was responsible for Epc1-mediated potentiation. This finding was further supported by the results of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using anti-Epc1 antibody in H9c2 cells. The SRE in the skeletal α-actin promoter was successfully amplified from the immunoprecipitates with anti-Epc1 antibody, which suggests that the Epc1-containing complex binds to the SRE. Interestingly, when we used anti-SRF antibody, the reduction in Epc1 expression in the Epc1 knockdown cells resulted in a decrease in the binding of SRF to the SRE. These results suggest that the Epc1·SRF-containing complex binds the SRE and that Epc1 is required for the full activation of SRF-dependent downstream genes. Numerous transcriptional coactivator complexes possess histone acetyltransferase activity, which is mediated by histone acetyltransferase enzymes such as p300, a functional homologue of CREB-binding protein (CBP), PCAF, and Tip60 (3McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Generally, the histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes induce transactivation of downstream genes by introducing structural modifications in the nucleosome of the promoter region (36Legube G. Trouche D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In yeast, a homologue of human EPC1, Esa1, has been discovered as a component of the picNuA4 complex; this complex contains histone acetyltransferase activity that is mediated by Tip60 (21Boudreault A.A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R.T. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Tan S. Côté J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, Tip60 is known to interact with SRF and to regulate early cardiac development (37Lough J.W. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by activating atrial natriuretic factor (38Kim M.S. Merlo X. Wilson C. Lough J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15082-15089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, in this study, although Tip60 could bind to Epc1, it was not present in adult skeletal muscle. Instead, an alternate histone acetyltransferase, p300, which is abundant in skeletal muscle, was successfully recruited by Epc1. It is widely accepted that histone acetyltransferase activity mediated by p300 is necessary for myogenesis, either by forming a complex to activate the E-box gene family (39Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) or by association with SRF to induce CArG box-dependent genes (31L'honore A. Lamb N.J. Vandromme M. Turowski P. Carnac G. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Wang S.X. Elder P.K. Zheng Y. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6204-6214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, p300-mediated histone acetyltransferase activity is required for myogenesis from embryonic stem cells (41Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting p300 as a regulator of the MRFs. Thus, we have shown that p300 is a component of the SRF·Epc1 complex that activates skeletal muscle-specific genes. Our observations in the present study of the phenotypes in Epc1 heterozygous mice clearly support the involvement of Epc1 in skeletal muscle maturation. Although Epc1 heterozygous mice can achieve normal growth without apparent alterations in musculature, the expression levels of the muscle-specific transcription factors were decreased and the cytoskeletal proteins were distorted. Also, the differentiation of isolated myocytes by serum deprivation was significantly impaired, which suggests a requirement for Epc1 in the maturation processes. It is interesting that skeletal α-actin arrangement was also disrupted in Epc1-heterozygous mice muscles. Considering that SRF also plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics as well as in the expression of those cytoskeletal proteins (42Miano J.M. Long X. Fujiwara K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C70-C81Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), Epc1 also seems to be required for the SRF-mediated regulation of cytoskeletons, although this will require further evaluation. Of course, it is not clear whether Epc1 plays a pivotal role in SRF-mediated transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal arrangement through its intrinsic enzymatic activity or its function of transcriptional activity. Rather, Epc1 could be a bridging molecule that works as a simple component of the Epc1·SRF·p300 complex. However, at least in part, Epc1 participates in muscle differentiation as a modulator of SRF.

https://openalex.org/W1977008074,"The M(5) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is known to play a crucial role in mediating acetylcholine dependent dilation of cerebral blood vessels. Previously, we reported that male M(5) muscarinic acetylcholine knockout mice (M5R(-/-) mice) suffer from a constitutive constriction of cerebral arteries, reduced cerebral blood flow, dendritic atrophy, and short-term memory loss, without necrosis and/or inflammation in the brain.We employed the Magnetic Resonance Angiography to study the area of the basilar artery in male and female M5R(-/-) mice. Here we show that female M5R(-/-) mice did not show the reduction in vascular area observed in male M5R(-/-) mice. However, ovariectomized female M5R(-/-) mice displayed phenotypic changes similar to male M5R(-/-) mice, strongly suggesting that estrogen plays a key role in the observed gender differences. We found that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induced nitric oxide release and ERK activation in a conditional immortalized mouse brain cerebrovascular endothelial cell line. Agonists of ERalpha, ERbeta, and GPR30 promoted ERK activation in this cell line. Moreover, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that the cross section of the basilar artery was restored to normal in male M5R(-/-) mice treated with E2. Treatment with E2 also improved the performance of male M5R(-/-) mice in a cognitive test and reduced the atrophy of neural dendrites in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. M5R(-/-) mice also showed astrocyte swelling in cortex and hippocampus using the three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscope images. This phenotype was reversed by E2 treatment, similar to the observed deficits in dendrite morphology and the number of synapses.Our findings indicate that M5R(-/-) mice represent an excellent novel model system to study the beneficial effects of estrogen on cerebrovascular function and cognition. E2 may offer new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency related memory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2062269430,"There is increasing evidence for a crucial role of proteases and metalloproteinases during axon growth and guidance. In this context, we recently described a functional link between the chemoattractive Sema3C and Matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3). Here, we provide data demonstrating the involvement of MMP-2 to trigger the growth-promoting effect of Sema3A in cortical dendrites. The in situ analysis of MMP-2 expression and activity is consistent with a functional growth assay demonstrating in vitro that the pharmacological inhibition of MMP-2 reduces the growth of cortical dendrites in response to Sema3A. Hence, our results suggest that the selective recruitment and activation of MMP-2 in response to Sema3A requires a PKC alpha dependent mechanism. Altogether, we provide a second set of data supporting MMPs as effectors of the growth-promoting effects of semaphorins, and we identify the potential signalling pathway involved."
https://openalex.org/W2002927716,"Cds1 is the ortholog of Chk2 and the major effector of the DNA replication checkpoint in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Previous studies have shown that Cds1 is activated by a two-stage mechanism. In the priming stage, the sensor kinase Rad3 and the mediator Mrc1 function to phosphorylate a threonine residue, Thr11, in the SQ/TQ domain of Cds1. In the autoactivation stage, primed Cds1 molecules dimerize via intermolecular interactions between the phosphorylated Thr11 in one Cds1 and the forkhead-associated domain of the other. Dimerization activates Cds1, probably by promoting autophosphorylation. To define the mechanisms for the autoactivation of primed Cds1 and the regulation of this process, we carried out genetic and biochemical studies to identify phosphorylatable residues required for checkpoint activation. Our data indicate that dimerization of Cds1 promotes trans-autophosphorylation of a number of residues in the catalytic domain, but phosphorylation of a highly conserved threonine residue (Thr328) in the activation loop is the only covalent modification required for kinase activation in vitro and in vivo. Autophosphorylation of Thr328 and kinase activation in unprimed, monomeric Cds1 are strongly inhibited by the C-terminal 27-amino acid tail of the enzyme. This autoinhibitory effect may play an important role in preventing spontaneous activation of the replication checkpoint during normal cell cycles. The two-stage activation pathway and the autoinhibition mechanism, which are probably shared by other members of the Chk2 family, provide sensitivity, specificity, and noise immunity, properties required for the replication checkpoint.

The two-stage activation pathway and the autoinhibition mechanism, which are probably shared by other members of the Chk2 family, provide sensitivity, specificity, and noise immunity, properties required for the replication checkpoint. DNA replication forks can be arrested or stalled by damage to DNA templates, depletion of deoxyribonucleotides, or inhibition of replisome enzymes (1.Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). If undetected, arrested or stalled replication forks may undergo collapse, resulting in loss of genetic information, mutagenesis, or even cell death. To maintain the integrity of the genome, eukaryotes have evolved a surveillance mechanism called the “replication checkpoint” that can detect perturbations of DNA replication and elicit a number of cellular responses that serve to mitigate the effects of such perturbations. These cellular responses may include stabilization of replication forks, suppression of initiation of DNA replication, increased DNA repair activity, augmented production of deoxyribonucleotide precursors, and delay of mitosis. The replication checkpoint pathway is essential for cell survival under a variety of stressful conditions and has been conserved from yeast to humans (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Nyberg K.A.

The replication checkpoint is a complex signal transduction pathway that can be separated conceptually into three functional components. Sensors detect the perturbed DNA replication forks; mediators transduce the checkpoint signal, whereas effectors regulate the cell cycle and promote cell survival. Genetic studies, especially those in the yeasts, have identified most, if not all, of the essential factors of the pathway. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, six Rad proteins mediate the sensor function (for reviews, see Refs. 7.Boddy M.N. Russell P. Curr.

The protein kinase Rad3 (ATR in human cells) binds an essential co-factor Rad26 (ATRIP in human cells), and the complex associates with stalled replication forks. Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form the “9-1-1” ring structure similar to that of the replication processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Rad17, in association with Rfc2-5, loads the 9-1-1 complex onto DNA at stalled forks. After detection of stalled forks by the sensor complexes, the mediator protein Mrc1 protein (Claspin in human cells) functions to facilitate the Rad3-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the effector protein kinase Cds1 (Chk2 in human cells) (9.Tanaka K.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the first or priming stage, the sensor kinase Rad3 phosphorylates two functionally redundant Cds1-docking repeats in the middle of the mediator Mrc1.

Once recruited to the proximity of the assembled sensor complex, Cds1 is phosphorylated by Rad3 at Thr11. In the second or autoactivation stage, primed Cds1 molecules dimerize by two identical intermolecular interactions between phosphorylated Thr11 and the FHA domain. Dimerization promotes autophosphorylation and activation of Cds1. This two-stage activation mechanism is supported by genetic studies (9.Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat.

Protein kinases can be activated by a variety of mechanisms. Although phosphorylation of the activation loop, usually by an upstream kinase of a signal transduction pathway, is the most common mechanism for kinase activation, some protein kinases can be activated by phosphorylation of residues outside the activation loop (for reviews, see Refs. 24.Nolen B.

Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), by removal of an inhibitory element (27.Huse M. Muir T.W. Xu L. Chen Y.G. Kuriyan J. Massagué J. Mol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Since the autoactivation of primed Cds1 requires dimerization, three possible activation mechanisms can be proposed. First, like many other protein kinases, Cds1 may be activated by phosphorylation of the activation loop (24.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). There are several known examples of kinase activation via trans-autophosphorylation of the activation loop. In these cases, the activation loop usually contains a consensus phosphorylation site of the kinase itself. This is not the case for Cds1 family kinases. A second possibility is that dimerization of Cds1 may allow intermolecular interactions that promote activation, as has been suggested for the epidermal growth factor receptor (26.Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Finally, activation of Cds1 may be a consequence of phosphorylation of residue(s) outside the activation loop. In the second and the third models, phosphorylation of the two essential threonine residues in the activation segment observed previously in mammalian Chk2 (22.Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and in the S. cerevisiae homologue Rad53 (29.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) would be a by-product, not a cause, of kinase activation. Several previous observations have provided evidence in support of the possibility that activation of Cds1 requires autophosphorylation. First, Cds1 is a phosphoprotein, and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment of cells induces further phosphorylation that is partially dependent on the kinase activity of Cds1 itself. 4Y.-J. Xu and T. Kelly, unpublished results. In the case of mammalian Chk2, the ortholog of Cds1, sites of phosphorylation have been mapped to the activation segment residues, Thr383 and Thr387 (22.Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30.Schwarz J.K. Lovly C.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 598-609PubMed Google Scholar), as well as to residues Ser379 (31.Lovly C.M. Yan L. Ryan C.E. Takada S. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 30311-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which lie outside of the activation segment. Phosphorylation has also been mapped by mass spectrometry to sites within and outside of the activation segment of Rad53 (29.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the S. cerevisiae homologue of Cds1. Second, genetic studies have shown that residues Thr328 and Thr332 in the activation segment of Cds1 (corresponding to Thr383 and Thr387 of Chk2 and Thr354 and Thr358 of Rad53) are essential for kinase activity (11.Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34.Usui T. Petrini J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2797-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Third, phosphatase treatment of “activated Cds1” purified from HU-treated cells abolishes kinase activity (11.Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, activation of induced Cds1 dimers in vitro is dependent upon ATP (11.Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe experiments aimed at distinguishing among the three potential mechanisms for Cds1 activation. We show that there are only three phosphorylatable residues in the Cds1 kinase domain (Thr328, Thr332, and Tyr352) that are essential for activation of the replication checkpoint in vivo and for enzyme activity in vitro. Of these three residues, Thr328 in the activation loop is a target of autophosphorylation, and its phosphorylation is the only covalent modification required for Cds1 activation. Autophosphorylation of Thr328 occurs in trans and only proceeds at an appreciable rate when the enzyme is at high local concentration. Presumably, one molecule in a Cds1 dimer transiently assumes an active conformation and phosphorylates the Thr328 in the activation loop of the other molecule. The activated molecule can then rapidly phosphorylate its dimeric partner. The second essential residue, Thr332, which is also in the activation loop, is not phosphorylated and is likely required, directly or indirectly, for catalysis. The third essential residue Tyr352 can be autophosphorylated in vitro with the Cds1 purified from S. pombe, and its phosphorylation is strongly stimulated by dimerization. However, Tyr352 phosphorylation is not readily observed in vivo and is not required for Cds1 activation. Our data rule out the other two possible mechanisms for Cds1 activation: phosphorylation of sites outside of the activation segment and phosphorylation-independent conformational changes induced by dimerization. We also report that the C terminus of Cds1 is a cis-regulatory element that can dramatically suppress Cds1 autoactivation in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data explain how the replication checkpoint can be sensitive and specific and also possess a high threshold for spontaneous activation. S. pombe strains and growth media were prepared by standard methods (35.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Two S. pombe strains were specifically made for this study: YJ373 h+ cds1(D312E)-6his2HA(int) and YJ374 h+cds1–6his2HA(int). Mutations of the potential phosphorylation sites in Cds1 were made by QuikChange mutagenesis PCR using the high fidelity DNA polymerase pfu on plasmid pYJ294 (prom-cds1–6his1HA-LEU2). All sequences and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Vectors were introduced into the S. pombe strain GBY191: h+ Δcds1::ura4+ by electroporation (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad). All strains used in this study contain the auxotrophic markers leu1-32, ura4-D18, ade6-M210, or ade6-M216. To test the drug sensitivity, 2 × 107 cells/ml of logarithmically growing S. pombe were diluted 5-fold and spotted onto YE6S plates containing HU or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at the indicated concentrations. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, plates were photographed. Inactive wild-type Cds1–6his1HA and its mutant proteins were expressed on a plasmid under the cds1+ promoter in Δcds1::ura4+ or Δrad3::ura4+Δcds1::ura4+ cells. Cells from a 2-liter culture were harvested, washed once with ice-cold distilled H2O, and resuspended in an equal volume (ml/g) of 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 120 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysate was made by the coffee mill method and clarified by repeated centrifugations at 4 °C, 43,000 × g, for 20 min. Extracts were mixed with 1 ml of prewashed Talon resin (Clontech), rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, washed five times with the washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm imidazole), and eluted in elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 150 mm imidazole. Eluted Cds1 was concentrated in a Centricon 10 concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by silver staining. Occasionally, the inactive Cds1 was further purified by HA antibody beads, as described for purification of activated Cds1. To purify activated Cds1–6hisHA, cells were treated with 25 mm HU in EMM6S[leu−] medium at 30 °C for 4 h. Cell extract was similarly prepared and added to 500 μl of prewashed anti-HA antibody beads in a 10-ml Econo-Column (Bio-Rad). The column was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, washed five times, and eluted in the elution buffer containing 1 mg/ml HA peptide. To purify Cds1 and its mutant proteins from E. coli, Cds1 containing a cleavable His6 tag at the N terminus was co-expressed with untagged λ-phosphatase on the same pET-28 vector. The proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells at 25 °C for 4 h after adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Cells were lysed by a cell disruptor (Avestin, Inc.) in 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.6). Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, 43,000 × g, for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). After extensive wash in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted by an imidazole gradient. The His6 tag was cleaved off by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) and removed by running through the HisTrap column one more time. Cds1 was then further purified by MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) and gel filtration. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay. Two established assays were used to measure Cds1 activity. The first assay uses GST-Wee1 (amino acids 11–152) as the substrate essentially as described previously (36.Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysate was made from five OD cells by a mini-bead beater in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm, for 5 min, the supernatant was added to glutathione beads with bound GST-Wee1, rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with ice-cold PBS-T buffer, mixed with 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm KCl, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP), and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize GST-Wee1, and the kinase activity was measured by PhosphoImaging. The second assay uses myelin basic protein (MyBP) as the substrate as described (37.Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Cds1–6hisHA in cell extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody beads. After washes with ice-cold PBS-T, 20 μl kinase reaction buffer containing 5 μg MyBP was added to the beads, incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cds1 in top half of the gel was revealed by silver staining or Western blotting using anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). MyBP in the bottom half of the gel was visualized by Coomassie staining. 32P incorporation was measured by phosphorimaging. The affinity-purified phospho-specific rabbit antibodies T328-P, T332-P, and Y352-P were prepared by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. The three phosphopeptides T328-P (CTGTFLEpTFCGTM), T332-P (CLETFCGpTMGYLA), and Y352-P (CVNLDGGpYDDKVD) were conjugated to KLH and used as the immunogens. The reactivity ratios of phosphorylated titer versus the nonphosphorylated titer for all antibodies are ≥99:1 and were confirmed by Western blotting after the peptides and phosphorylated peptides were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. S3). To suppress the cross-reactivity between T328-P and T332-P antibodies, anti-T328-P antibody was incubated with the membrane in the presence of 1 μm T332-P peptide, whereas T332-P antibody was incubated with 1 μm T328-P peptide. After several washes in TBS-T, the bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat against rabbit antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). We have previously shown that artificial dimerization of the C-terminal region of Cds1 (amino acids 152–460), containing the kinase domain, can promote autophosphorylation and kinase activation both in vitro and in vivo (11.Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As a first step toward defining the autoactivation mechanism, we carried out a large scale mutational analysis of the kinase domain to determine the potential autophosphorylation sites that are required for checkpoint function. As shown in the diagram of Fig. 1, there are 52 phosphorylatable residues (28 serines, 16 threonines, and 8 tyrosines) within this region of Cds1. Each serine or threonine was mutated to alanine, either individually or as part of a small cluster. Similarly, each tyrosine was individually mutated to phenylalanine. The resulting mutant proteins were each expressed in Δcds1 cells under control of the cds1+ promoter and tested for sensitivity to either HU or the DNA-damaging agent MMS. Surprisingly, only three of the 52 phosphorylatable sites in the C-terminal region of Cds1, Thr328, Thr332, and Tyr352, proved to be essential for Cds1 function following treatment with HU or MMS (Fig. 1, left). The T328A and T332A mutants were as sensitive to HU as Cds1 null cells, whereas the Y352F mutant was slightly less sensitive, indicating that it retained a low level of checkpoint function (Fig. S1). The responses of the remaining mutants were identical to those of wild-type cells, indicating that the corresponding phosphorylatable residues are not essential for Cds1 activity or are functionally redundant. The similar pattern of sensitivity to HU and MMS suggests that Cds1 is activated by a similar mechanism in response to depletion of deoxyribonucleotides or DNA damage. Thr328 and Thr332 reside in the activation segment of Cds1 along with three other nonessential phosphorylatable residues Thr322, Thr324, and Tyr335 (see Fig. 3B and Ref. 24.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Thr328 is in the activation loop, and Thr332 is in the P+1 loop. Tyr352 lies in the αEF/αF loop, which interacts with and probably stabilizes the activation loop (24.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 38.Johnson D.A. Akamine P. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan M. Taylor S.S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2243-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Among the nine tyrosines in the full-length Cds1 molecule, Tyr352 is the only one that is required for full checkpoint activity (data not shown). The catalytic domain of Cds1 is followed by a C-terminal “tail” of 27 residues that is rich in hydrophilic and phosphorylatable residues (7 serines and 4 threonines; see enlarged portion of Cds1 in the lower part of Fig. 1). Most of the serines are clustered in two triplets (marked by black bars). None of the mutations in this region, including a deletion of all 27 residues (Δ434–460), increased sensitivity to HU, indicating that the C-terminal tail is not essential for Cds1 activation (bottom of Fig. 1 and Fig. S6). However, as described in more detail below, we later found that the C-terminal tail is autoinhibitory for Cds1 activation (see Fig. 6). A deletion mutation (Δ443–460) that removes the two serine triplets in this domain can dramatically facilitate autoactivation of Cds1 in vitro and in vivo (see Fig. 6). For simplicity, we refer this mutant as Cds1(ΔC) in the following studies. To map the autophosphorylation site(s), wild-type Cds1 and Cds1(ΔC), which lacks the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, were expressed from plasmids under the control of the cds1+ promoter in Δrad3Δcds1 cells and purified by affinity chromatography. For comparison, we also purified “activated” wild-type Cds1 from HU-treated cells. The purified proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP to label the autophosphorylation sites and then digested with trypsin. The resulting phosphopeptides were separated by thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography in two dimensions (39.Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., San Francisco1999: 18.9.1-18.9.28Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the patterns of phosphopeptides derived from the three proteins were quite similar. Two phosphopeptides in the digest of wild-type Cds1, located between spots d and e, were absent from the digest of Cds1(ΔC), suggesting that they were derived from the C-terminal tail. The remaining phosphopeptides (spots a–g) were found in all three digests and presumably included the phosphorylation site(s) responsible for Cds1 activation, since incubation with ATP can activate the kinase activity of all three proteins (e.g. see Fig. 6A). Of these, phosphopeptide b was autophosphorylated to a greater extent in Cds1(ΔC) than in wild-type or “activated” Cds1. Since Cds1(ΔC) is more readily autoactivated in vitro than wild-type Cds1 (Fig. 6A),"
https://openalex.org/W2170619021,"Background The eukaryotic elongation factor EF-1α (also known as EF1A) catalyzes aminoacyl-tRNA binding by the ribosome during translation. Homologs of this essential protein occur in all domains of life, and it was previously thought to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Recently, however, a number of eukaryotes were found to lack EF-1α and instead encode a related protein called EFL (for EF-Like). EFL-encoding organisms are scattered widely across the tree of eukaryotes, and all have close relatives that encode EF-1α. This intriguingly complex distribution has been attributed to multiple lateral transfers because EFL's near mutual exclusivity with EF-1α makes an extended period of co-occurrence seem unlikely. However, differential loss may play a role in EFL evolution, and this possibility has been less widely discussed. Methodology/Principal Findings We have undertaken an EST- and PCR-based survey to determine the distribution of these two proteins in a previously under-sampled group, the Euglenozoa. EF-1α was found to be widespread and monophyletic, suggesting it is ancestral in this group. EFL was found in some species belonging to each of the three euglenozoan lineages, diplonemids, kinetoplastids, and euglenids. Conclusions/Significance Interestingly, the kinetoplastid EFL sequences are specifically related despite the fact that the lineages in which they are found are not sisters to one another, suggesting that EFL and EF-1α co-occurred in an early ancestor of kinetoplastids. This represents the strongest phylogenetic evidence to date that differential loss has contributed to the complex distribution of EFL and EF-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2053701876,"Background Local natural laboratories, designated by us as the “Evolution Canyon” model, are excellent tools to study regional and global ecological dynamics across life. They present abiotic and biotic contrasts locally, permitting the pursuit of observations and experiments across diverse taxa sharing sharp microecological subdivisions. Higher solar radiation received by the “African savannah-like” south-facing slopes (AS) in canyons north of the equator than by the opposite “European maquis-like” north-facing slopes (ES) is associated with higher abiotic stress. Scorpions are a suitable taxon to study interslope biodiversity differences, associated with the differences in abiotic factors (climate, drought), due to their ability to adapt to dry environments. Methodology/Principal Findings Scorpions were studied by the turning stone method and by UV light methods. The pattern observed in scorpions was contrasted with similar patterns in several other taxa at the same place. As expected, the AS proved to be significantly more speciose regarding scorpions, paralleling the interslope patterns in taxa such as lizards and snakes, butterflies (Rhopalocera), beetles (families Tenebrionidae, Dermestidae, Chrysomelidae), and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Conclusions/Significance Our results support an earlier conclusion stating that the homogenizing effects of migration and stochasticity are not able to eliminate the interslope intra- and interspecific differences in biodiversity despite an interslope distance of only 100 m at the “EC” valley bottom. In our opinion, the interslope microclimate selection, driven mainly by differences in insolance, could be the primary factor responsible for the observed interslope pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1994672914,"Background While it is clearly admitted that normal behavioural development is determined by the interplay of genetic and environmental influences, this is much less the case for psychiatric disorders for which more emphasis has been given in the past decades on biological determinism. Thus, previous studies have shown that Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) were not affected by parental style. However, animal research suggests that different behavioural traits can be differentially affected by genetic/environmental factors. Methodology/ Principal Findings In the present study we hypothesized that amongst the ASD, language disorders may be more sensitive to social factors as language is a social act that develops under social influences. Using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, we compared the early characteristics of sensori-motor and language development in a large sample of children with ASD (n = 162) with parents belonging to different levels of education. The results showed that children raised by parents with a high level of education displayed earlier language development. Moreover, they showed earlier first words and phrases if their mother was at a high level of education, which reveals an additional gender effect. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge this study may trigger important new lines of thought and research, help equilibrate social and purely biological perspectives regarding ASD and bring new hopes for environmentally based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2016036595,"The nematode cuticle is a tough extracellular matrix composed primarily of cross-linked collagens and non-collagenous cuticulins. It is required for nematode motility and protection from the external environment. Little is known about how the complex process of cuticle formation has been adapted to the specialized requirements of the nematode cuticle, which is structurally and compositionally unique from other organisms. The C. elegans gene cuti-1 (CUTicle and epithelial Integrity) encodes a nematode-specific protein. We have shown that CUTI-1 is expressed in the epithelia and in seam cells. Within these tissues the expression of cuti-1 mRNA cycles throughout development in line with the molting cycle, a process that involves synthesis of a new cuticle. In addition, knockdown of cuti-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) results in worms that display post-embryonic phenotypes related to cuticle dysfunction and defects in epithelial integrity. This is one of the first reports of a nematode-specific protein involved in extracellular matrix formation. It provides further insight into how novel ways have evolved to regulate the formation of the cuticle, which is the primary protective barrier and skeletal component of nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2163799234,"Maternal licking and grooming (LG) exerts profound influence on hippocampal development and function in the offspring. However, little information is available on the effects of variations in maternal care on other brain regions. Here we examined the effects of variation in the frequency of maternal LG on morphological and electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex in adult offspring. Compared to low LG offspring, high LG offspring displayed decreased dendritic complexity, reduced spine density and decreased amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents. These changes were accompanied by higher levels of reelin expression in offspring of high LG mothers. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential amount of naturally-occurring variations in maternal LG is associated with enduring changes in dendritic morphology and synaptic function in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1997078416,"The maltose transporter gene is situated at the MAL locus, which consists of genes for a transporter, maltase, and transcriptional activator. Five unlinked MAL loci (MAL1, MAL2, MAL3, MAL4, and MAL6) constitute a gene family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expression of the maltose transporter is induced by maltose and repressed by glucose. The activity of the maltose transporter is also regulated post-translationally; Mal61p is rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane and degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the presence of glucose. We found that S. cerevisiae strain ATCC20598 harboring MAL21 could grow in maltose supplemented with a non- assimilable glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose, whereas strain ATCC96955 harboring MAL61 and strain CB11 with MAL31 and AGT1 could not. These observations implied a Mal21p-specific resistance against glucose-induced degradation. Mal21p found in ATCC20598 has 10 amino acids, including Gly-46 and His-50, that are inconsistent with the corresponding residues in Mal61p. The half-life of Mal21p for glucose-induced degradation was 118 min when expressed using the constitutive TPI1 promoter, which was significantly longer than that of Mal61p (25 min). Studies with mutant cells that are defective in endocytosis or the ubiquitination process indicated that Mal21p was less ubiquitinated than Mal61p, suggesting that Mal21p remains on the plasma membrane because of poor susceptibility to ubiquitination. Mutational studies revealed that both residues Gly-46 and His-50 in Mal21p are essential for the full resistance of maltose transporters against glucose-induced degradation."

Biol. 1992; 224: 639-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), E1 (4Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V.

Structure. 1998; 6: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins consist of three domains with distinct properties; the receptor domain (R), which binds a specific outer membrane receptor on the target cell, and the translocation domain (T) at the N terminus, responsible for traversing the outer membrane and the periplasmic space to deliver the channel-forming domain (C) at the C terminus to the bacterial inner membrane. The bundle of 10 α-helices that compose the C domain changes its conformation to form a voltage-gated ion channel in the plasma membrane. Opening of the channel produces an efflux of ions that depletes the cellular energy resources and ultimately leads to cell death. The x-ray structure of full-length, soluble colicin Ia (69 kDa) has been determined (6Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The monomeric molecule is mostly α-helical, with the R domain separated from the T and C domains by a pair of unusually long (∼160 Å) α-helices thought possibly to span the periplasmic space during channel formation (6Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The C domain is characterized by two hydrophobic helices (VIII and IX; residues Ala-580—Ile-612) that is surrounded by the remaining eight largely amphipathic α-helices. The same structural motif for the C domain is conserved in other members of the colicin family and is also present in the channel-forming domains of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A, and the Bcl family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (7Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This pair of helices, termed the hydrophobic hairpin, is instrumental in driving the initial membrane insertion event (8Kienker P.K. Qiu X. Slatin S.L. Finkelstein A. Jakes K.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that is followed by a series of large scale pH and voltage-dependent conformational changes in the C domain, resulting in the opening of the ion channel in the plasma membrane (9Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lindeberg M. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 157: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and cross-linking of site-directed cysteine mutants (9Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the initial membrane-bound intermediate exists as a two-dimensional helical array of the eight amphipathic helices (I-VII and X) spread across the membrane surface, with the hydrophobic helices (VIII and IX) embedded in the bilayer. A recent electron paramagnetic resonance study using preparations of spin-labeled ColA proteoliposomes has supported a similar umbrella model where the eight amphipathic helices reside at the air-water interface for the closed-channel state (13Padmavathi P.V. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled cysteine mutants have also been used to determine how much of the C domain (aside from the hydrophobic hairpin) crosses the plasma membrane (14Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Kienker P.K. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) for colicin Ia. A large region of the amphipathic sequence (helices II-V; residues Leu-474—Tyr-541) has been found to cross from the cis to the trans side of the membrane in planar lipid bilayer experiments, resulting in a four-transmembrane segment molecule that is thought to form the ion channel. Because the 12–13 residue α-helices of the C domain are well short of the ∼20 residues required to span the plasma membrane, it has been proposed that conformational changes causing helix extension take place during the channel formation process. 13C spin diffusion NMR has indicated that whereas the overall secondary structure of the C domain is preserved, most of the helices undergo “opening,” and modulation of the tertiary structure allows for the required extension of the helices to cross the plasma membrane and form the channel (16Luo W. Yao X. Hong M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6402-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The internal structure of the colicin Ia channel has been investigated by examining the effect of different nonelectrolyte molecules on the single-channel conductance in planar lipid bilayer membranes (17Krasilnikov O.V. Da Cruz J.B. Yuldasheva L.N. Varanda W.A. Nogueira R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was determined that the diameter at the cis entrance (equivalent to the outside of the cell) is 18 Å, and the diameter at the trans entrance (inside the membrane) is 10 Å, with a 7 Å diameter constriction located in close proximity to the trans entrance of the channel. More recent studies (18Kienker P.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) employing the substituted cysteine accessibility method to determine what residues line the open colicin Ia channel suggest an hourglass-shaped pore with the most constricted part near the cis rather than the trans side, as opposed to the conclusion of Krasilnikov et al. (17Krasilnikov O.V. Da Cruz J.B. Yuldasheva L.N. Varanda W.A. Nogueira R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both studies point to a pore constriction inside the membrane, and as pointed out by Kienker et al. 18Kienker P.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), there exist plausible explanations to reconcile some of the differing results. The large diameter of the colicin Ia channel coupled with the studies which indicate that each colicin Ia molecule contributes four transmembrane segments in the membrane integrated state (14Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) suggests that the ion channel is formed by a multimer of colicin Ia molecules. However, all of the past studies directed at determining the oligomeric state of any of the colicin channels indicate a monomeric structure. The question as to how a four-transmembrane monomeric protein can form an ion channel of sufficient diameter to allow the passage of ions as large as tetraethyl ammonium (19Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) has remained unanswered. In this work we have subjected colicin Ia incorporated into lipid bilayer membranes to structural and biochemical investigations. We show, based on cross-linking and velocity sedimentation experiments, single-particle analysis of electron micrographs and results from electron crystallographic analysis of two-dimensional crystals of colicin Ia that the protein forms oligomers upon insertion into the bilayer. The suggested architecture of this oligomer based on the ∼17 Å resolution three-dimensional model and the biological implications, are discussed. Recombinant full-length colicin Ia was expressed in pKSJ311-containing E. coli TG1 cells and purified (supplemental text S1).

Purified protein was either freshly used for subsequent study or stored in aliquots at −80 °C until required in sodium citrate buffer (full-length colicin Ia) or Tris buffer (colicin Ia CFD). Samples of the purified proteins were shown to possess normal channel-forming properties in planar lipid bilayer experiments, as described in Kienker et al. (20Kienker P.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A.

The lipid film was resuspended at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl and hydrated for 1 h at 37 °C. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by extrusion through a 200-nm polycarbonate filter using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti). To incorporate colicin Ia into the preformed liposomes, purified protein was added to the LUV suspension at lipid-protein ratio of 6:1 (w/w) in sodium acetate buffer, and the mixture was incubated for 2–3 h in a water bath at 37 °C. The integration of colicin Ia CFD into lipid bilayer membranes was tested by subjecting the proteoliposomes to high salt/high pH as follows. A suspension of LUVs loaded with the colicin Ia CFD (lipid-protein ratio 8:1) was centrifuged through a 10% (w/v) sucrose cushion at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7 for 5 min using a H2O bath sonicator (Fisher). The suspension was treated with 4.5 m urea and 2.5 m NaCl for 1 h at room temperature as described (21Miercke L.J. Betlach M.C. Mitra A.K. Shand R.F. Fong S.K. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3088-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and then titrated to pH 11–12 with 1 m NaOH stock and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the reaction mixture was titrated back to pH 7 with 1 m HCl stock solution and then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7 for 1 h at room temperature to remove excess urea and NaCl. Finally, the so-treated liposomes were recovered by centrifugation as above through a 10% (w/v) sucrose cushion. Pellets and corresponding supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3) (Thermo Scientific) was used for cross-linking experiments and prepared fresh for each cross-linking reaction. The suspension of colicin Ia-incorporated LUVs prepared as described above in acetate buffer was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 2 h at 25 °C to change the pH to within the recommended range for the cross-linking reaction (i.e. pH 7–9). The dialyzed proteoliposome suspension was then centrifuged in an Airfuge (Beckman) at 20 p.s.i. (∼100,000 × g) for 10 min to remove any remaining protein that was not incorporated into the liposomes. The proteoliposome pellet was resuspended in the above buffer and repelleted as before to ensure complete removal of unincorporated colicin Ia. BS3 in 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was added to the proteoliposome suspension at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 stock solution to a final concentration of 50 mm followed by a further incubation at 25 °C for 15 min. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). Proteoliposomes containing cross-linked colicin Ia were solubilized by the addition of 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) (Anatrace) and incubation at 25 °C overnight with gentle stirring. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in an Airfuge (Beckman) at 20 p.s.i. for 10 min. The supernatant (100 μl) was applied to a Superose 6 column (30 × 10 mm) (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) DDM and controlled by an AKTA chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The column was calibrated with molecular weight standards (of known Stokes radii) thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), apoferritin (6.1 nm), catalase (5.22 nm), aldolase (4.8 nm), and bovine serum albumin (3.55 nm). The Stokes radii for colicin Ia peaks were estimated by comparison of the elution volume against the elution volumes for the calibration standards. 100 μl of solubilized cross-linked colicin Ia was layered onto a preformed linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient containing 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) DDM and prepared using a SG15 gradient maker (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Additional gradients were prepared and layered with 100 μl of 2 mg/ml each of the following molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin (669 kDa; 19 S), apoferritin (440 kDa; 17 S), catalase (232 kDa; 11.4 S), aldolase (158 kDa; 7.88 S), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa; 4.4 S). The gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 5 °C in an AH-650 rotor (Sorvall) at 30,400 rpm (87,400 × g). After centrifugation, 350-μl fractions were removed from the bottom of the tube using a peristaltic pump, and aliquots of the standards were analyzed for absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions of the gradient containing solubilized, cross-linked colicin Ia were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid then acetone and analyzed by electrophoresis on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). Using the estimated sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) and Stokes radius (RS) values, the experimental molecular weight range of multimeric colicin Ia was calculated (22Post P.L. Tyska M.J. O'Connell C.B. Johung K. Hayward A. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11679-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the equation, molecular weight = s20,wN6πn RS/(1 − υρ), where Avogadro's number (N) = 6.023 × 1023, viscosity coefficient (n) = 1 × 10−2 g·s−1·cm−1, solution density (ρ) = 1 g·cm−3, and partial specific volume (υ) = 0.72 cm3·g−1 (assumed to be that of an average soluble protein). For two-dimensional crystallization trials, purified colicin Ia in 20 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.2, 50 mm NaCl, at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, was mixed with a 70:30 mixture of DMPG and DMPC at lipid-protein ratio of 1:2–1:4 (w/w). Lipid dissolved in chloroform was dried under N2 and then solubilized for 1–2 h into a 2% (w/v) aqueous solution of n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Anatrace) at 25 °C with gentle stirring. After incubation of the lipid/protein/detergent mixture at 25 °C for 2–3 h, 50-μl aliquots were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 (SPECTRAPOR 10-kDa cut-off) at 37 °C until the detergent was deemed to have been completely removed (indicated by inability to break the surface tension of a water droplet). Typically 5-μl samples of two-dimensional crystallization trials and samples from colicin Ia/lipid reconstitution assays were applied to glow-discharged (hydrophilic) 300-mesh copper electron microscopy grids coated with plastic-supported continuous carbon film. The sample was allowed to adsorb for 90 s before being washed three times with filtered, distilled H2O and stained with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Excess stain was removed by blotting with filter paper (Whatman No. 1), and the grid was allowed to air dry. For screening two-dimensional crystallization trials, a Philips CM12 operated at 120 kV and equipped with a BIOSCAN CCD camera (GATAN Inc) was used. For data collection, samples were examined using a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV and equipped with a LaB6 filament. Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 52,000 at 2.0–3.0 μm under-focus (for two-dimensional crystals) or 1.5–3.0 μm under-focus (for single particle images). Electron microscopy image film (Kodak SO-163) was used, which was developed for 10 min in D19 (diluted 1:1 with H2O). Images of tilted crystals (up to ±50°) were recorded at ∼10° intervals in a tilt series starting with the nominally untilted view. Micrographs with minimal astigmatism and drift, as judged by optical diffraction, were selected for digitization using a Super CoolScan 9000 ED (Nikon). For images of two-dimensional crystals, typically areas of ∼0.4 × 0.4 μm (on the specimen) were digitized at 4,000 dpi, corresponding to sampling at ∼1.2 Å on the specimen. For images used for single particle analysis, digitization was carried out at 2442 dpi, corresponding to ∼2 Å on the specimen. The processing of the images of two-dimensional crystals was carried out using the MRC suite of programs (23Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 24Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) with usually two rounds of unbending for each image, as described e.g. in Hyun et al. (25Hyun J.K. Coulibaly F. Turner A.P. Baker E.N. Mercer A.A. Mitra A.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 11075-11083Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (supplemental Text S2). For single-particle image analysis, 4305 tilted pairs (0° and 45°) of isolated, membrane-inserted Colicin Ia particles were reconstructed by using the Xmipp program (26Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velázquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) suite and the random-conical tilt approach (27Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Reference models for simultaneous three-dimensional maximum-likelihood refinement (28Scheres S.H. Gao H. Valle M. Herman G.T. Eggermont P.P. Frank J. Carazo J.M. Nature Methods. 2007; 4: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were constructed after separating the dataset into three classes using maximum-likelihood classification (29Scheres S.H. Valle M. Carazo J.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 243-244Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Scheres S.H. Valle M. Nuñez R. Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Herman G.T. Carazo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Approximately 1250 particles were assigned to the final reconstruction after 25 cycles of iterative refinement (supplemental Text S2). Colicin Ia CFD incorporated into proteoliposomes (POPG:POPC = 1:1) at pH 4.5 were treated with high concentrations of urea and NaCl as well as extreme alkaline pH and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g. SDS-PAGE analysis of this sample showed that ∼80% of the protein was retained in the proteoliposome pellet (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates that under the protocol of using acidic pH and negatively charged lipids that we have followed throughout this work for inducing insertion into lipid bilayers, a major fraction of the protein is in a stable, membrane-integrated state rather than peripherally attached to the lipid bilayer. After cation exchange chromatography of cell lysate overexpressing recombinant colicin Ia, SEC using Superdex 200 in 20 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.2, 50 mm NaCl produced a large peak and several small peaks. The SDS-PAGE of the major colicin Ia peak, which runs anomalously at ∼60 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1), shows that the protein used in all subsequent experiments has been purified to homogeneity. To use the cross-linking reagent BS3, unilamellar vesicles composed of DMPC and DMPG (1:1) loaded with full-length colicin Ia at pH 4.5 was dialyzed against HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. About 50% of the protein was retained in the lipid-associated state, as judged by subsequent centrifugation and SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B). This stably inserted colicin Ia was then subjected to cross-linking experiments. The SDS-PAGE band for colicin Ia monomer at ∼60 kDa disappears after cross-linking, and a faint smear of ∼150-kDa appears in the range where we expect to see a dimer or a trimer of colicin Ia (estimated molecular mass of 138 or 208 kDa) (Fig. 1B). However, the majority of the cross-linked protein sample migrates only a short distance into the separating portion of the SDS-PAGE and, therefore, represents an assembly possessing a much larger molecular mass. These observations taken together suggest that (a) colicin Ia is not monomeric but oligomeric in the lipid bilayer, and (b) whereas it may initially organize as a dimer (or trimer) after insertion into the lipid bilayer, ultimately a much larger multimeric state of the protein is formed, which conventional SDS-PAGE fails to resolve. For accurate estimation of the mass of oligomeric colicin Ia in the lipid bilayer, cross-linked protein from proteoliposomes was solubilized with 2% (w/v) DDM, then analyzed by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 column calibrated with protein standards of known molecular weight and Stokes radii (RS) and sedimentation coefficients (s20,w). When soluble, monomeric colicin Ia was subjected to SEC under the same buffer conditions, the retention volume corresponded to a Stokes radius of 3.35 nm (data not shown). SEC of cross-linked solubilized colicin Ia sample demonstrated that it eluted across a broad range of retention volumes (Fig. 2A) with RS ranging from 6.09 to 7.91 nm (Fig. 2B). This shift in elution peak from 3.35 nm indicates that colicin Ia likely exists in a multimeric form(s) upon insertion into the lipid bilayer. Eluted fractions from the Superose 6 column were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4–8% Tris acetate gel and showed the presence of multiple protein species of molecular mass corresponding potentially to monomer, dimer, trimer, up to hexamer (∼460 kDa) (Fig. 2C). Examination of these fractions by transmission electron microscopy after staining with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate revealed a protein population of large heterogeneous multimers (data not shown). Peaks that eluted at higher retention volumes (13.8 and 14.24 ml), corresponding to RS of 5.55 and 5.29 nm, respectively, displayed a relatively more homogeneous population of irregularly shaped objects (data not shown). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, these fractions were found to contain high molecular mass species (larger than 460 kDa), which may represent colicin Ia oligomers with tightly bound lipid/detergent molecules displaying an anomalous elution profile. Rate zonal sedimentation analysis was used to estimate the sedimentation coefficient for cross-linked colicin Ia after solubilization from proteoliposomes by 2% (w/v) DDM. Sucrose gradients were run, and the migration distance for molecular mass standards was used to plot a calibration curve (Fig. 3A). Migration of cross-linked colicin Ia was compared with those for the protein standards of known sedimentation coefficients (Fig. 3B). Results of this experiment agreed with the results from the SEC experiment described above. Once again, there appear to be several protein species of large molecular mass with estimated s20,w ranging from 9.0 to 16.75 S (where S = Svedberg unit = 1 × 10−13 s). When compared with the migration of monomeric colicin Ia, these enhanced sedimentation coefficient values again indicate the presence of colicin Ia multimer that is generated upon protein insertion into the lipid bilayer. Quantitatively, using the dependence of molecular mass on sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the quoted S values above, the sedimentation of these colicin Ia multimers translate to species of molecular mass in the range of ∼222 to ∼537 kDa. These values would correspond to apparent masses of hydrodynamic complexes consisting of approximately three to eight colicin Ia monomers (monomer = 69 kDa) and including masses of any associated lipids and detergent molecules. The successful two-dimensional crystallization trials produced small (∼0.5 × 0.5 μm), well ordered crystalline patches of ring-shaped particles on vesicles or sheets arranged in a close-packed hexagonal array (Fig. 4, A and B). This represents the first instance that a crystalline array of colicin Ia in lipid bilayer membranes has been observed. With the constraint that in vitro, acidic pH and negatively charged lipids promote membrane insertion of colicin Ia, many different reconstitution regimens were explored (31Kühlbrandt W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Yeager M. Unger V.M. Mitra A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 135-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Supplemental Table S1 provides a summary of the various reconstitution/crystallization conditions that were explored. A dispersed accumulation of ring-shaped particles, such as in the crystals, was often seen adjacent to the crystalline lattice (Fig. 4C). A high concentration of such particles distinguished by areas of sequestered uranyl acetate stain was often indicative of the existence of two-dimensional crystals in the vicinity when crystallization trials were screened. The diffraction spots in the calculated Fourier transform of a nominally untilted crystal extended to ∼18 Å resolution after correcting for lattice distortions (Fig. 5A). The phase residual for symmetry-related reflections calculated using the program ALLSPACE indicated that the plane group of symmetry p3 was the most likely choice (Table 1).

We report the cloning of one Smad6 and two Smad7 (Smad7a and Smad7b) chick homologs and their expression and regulation in the developing limb. Smad6 and Smad7a are expressed in dynamic patterns reflecting the domains of BMP gene expression in the limb. Activation and inhibition of the BMP signaling pathway in limb mesenchyme indicates that negative Smad gene expression is regulated, at least in part, by BMP family signals."
https://openalex.org/W2072671683,"Heart failure is associated with impairment in nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilatation, which has been demonstrated to result from a reduction in the relative expression of the leucine zipper positive (LZ+) isoform of the myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light chain phosphatase. Further, captopril preserves normal LZ+ MYPT1 expression, the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated vasodilatation and modulates the expression of genes in the p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades. This study tests whether angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) with losartan decreases p42/44 MAPK or p38 MAPK signaling and preserves LZ+ MYPT1 expression in a rat infarct model of heart failure. In aortic smooth muscle, p42/44 MAPK activation increases and LZ+ MYPT1 expression falls after LAD ligation. Losartan treatment decreases the activation of p42/44 MAPK to the uninfarcted control level and preserves normal LZ+ MYPT1 expression. The expression and activation of p38 MAPK, however, is low and does not change following LAD ligation or with losartan therapy. These data suggest that either reducing or blocking the effects of circulating angiotensin II, both decreases the activation of the p42/44 MAPK signaling cascade and preserves LZ+ MYPT1 expression. Thus, the ability of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs to modulate the vascular phenotype, to preserve normal flow mediated vasodilatation may explain the beneficial effects of these drugs compared to other forms of afterload reduction in the treatment of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1991818231,"Background The conformational energy landscape of a protein, as calculated by known potential energy functions, has several minima, and one of these corresponds to its native structure. It is however difficult to comprehensively estimate the actual numbers of low energy structures (or decoys), the relationships between them, and how the numbers scale with the size of the protein. Methodology We have developed an algorithm to rapidly and efficiently identify the low energy conformers of oligo peptides by using mutually orthogonal Latin squares to sample the potential energy hyper surface. Using this algorithm, and the ECEPP/3 potential function, we have made an exhaustive enumeration of the low-energy structures of peptides of different lengths, and have extrapolated these results to larger polypeptides. Conclusions and Significance We show that the number of native-like structures for a polypeptide is, in general, an exponential function of its sequence length. The density of these structures in conformational space remains more or less constant and all the increase appears to come from an expansion in the volume of the space. These results are consistent with earlier reports that were based on other models and techniques."
