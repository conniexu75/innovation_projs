https://openalex.org/W2059185804,"The p53 gene is frequently mutated in a wide variety of human cancers. However, the role of the wild-type p53 gene in growth control is not known. Hybrid proteins that contain the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 and portions of p53 have been used to show that the p53 protein contains a transcription-activating sequence that functions in both yeast and mammalian cells. The NH2-terminal 73 residues of p53 activated transcription in mammalian cells as efficiently as the herpes virus protein VP16, which contains one of the strongest known activation domains. Combined with previous data that showed p53 is localized to the nucleus and can bind to DNA, these results support the idea that one function of p53 is to activate the transcription of genes that suppress cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2086532812,"The protein encoded by the wild-type p53 proto-oncogene has been shown to suppress transformation, whereas certain mutations that alter p53 become transformation competent. Fusion proteins between p53 and the GAL4 DNA binding domain were made to anchor p53 to a DNA target sequence and to allow measurement of transcriptional activation of a reporter plasmid. The wild-type p53 stimulated transcription in this assay, but two transforming mutations in p53 were unable to act as transcriptional activators. Therefore, p53 can activate transcription, and transformation-activating mutations result in a loss of function of the p53 protein. The inability of the p53 mutant proteins to activate transcription may enable them to be transformation competent."

https://openalex.org/W2047423042,"During terminal differentiation keratinocytes move out of the basal layer of the epidermis and thereby lose contact with the basement membrane. We show that terminal differentiation in culture involves loss of adhesiveness to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I and IV. The adhesive changes precede, by several hours, loss of the alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins from the cell surface. Keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin is mediated by the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin, and the decrease in adhesion of intact cells to fibronectin is correlated with a decrease in the ability of alpha 5 beta 1 receptors to bind fibronectin. Thus modulation of integrin function early in terminal differentiation may be an early event determining cell migration out of the basal layer."
https://openalex.org/W1977120851,"The TFP1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two proteins: the 69-kilodalton (kD) catalytic subunit of the vacuolar proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) and a 50-kD protein. The 69-kD subunit is encoded by the 5' and 3' thirds of the TFP1 coding region, whereas the 50-kD protein is encoded by the central third. Evidence is presented that both the 69-kD and 50-kD proteins are obtained from a single translation product that is cleaved to release the 50-kD protein and spliced to form the 69-kD subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1519535724,"Proteins of the annexin/lipocortin family act as in vitro anticoagulants by binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles. In this study, we investigated whether annexin V (placental anticoagulant protein I) would bind to human platelets. Annexin V bound to unstimulated platelets in a reversible, calcium-dependent reaction with an apparent Kd of 7 nM and 5000-8000 sites/platelet. Additional binding sites could be induced by several platelet agonists in the following order of effectiveness: A23187 greater than collagen + thrombin greater than collagen greater than thrombin. However, neither ADP nor epinephrine induced additional binding sites. Three other proteins of the annexin family (annexins II, III, and IV) competed for annexin V platelets binding sites with the same relative potencies previously observed for binding to phospholipid vesicles. Phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylserine completely inhibited binding of annexin V to platelets. Annexin V completely blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to thrombin-stimulated platelets. These results support the hypothesis that phosphatidylserine exposure occurs during platelet activation and may be necessary for assembly of the prothrombinase complex on platelet membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1584684122,"Cysteine residues 110 and 187 are essential for the formation of the correct bovine rhodopsin structure (Karnik, S. S., Sakmar, T. P., Chen, H.-B., and Khorana, H. G. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8459-8463). We now show that the sulfhydryl groups of these 2 cysteine residues interact to form a disulfide bond. Rhodopsin mutants containing cysteine----serine substitutions were prepared as follows. In one mutant, CysVII, all the 10 cysteine residues of rhodopsin were replaced by serines. A second mutant, CysVIII, contained only C110 and C185; a third mutant, CysIX, contained only C185 and C187 while the fourth mutant, CysX, contained only C110 and C187. Only mutant CysX formed functional rhodopsin. Mutants CysVIII and CysIX reacted with [3H]iodoacetic acid showing the presence of free sulfhydryl groups while mutant CysX was inert to this reagent. CysX reacted with cyanide ion to form a thiocyanate derivative showing the presence of a disulfide bond. The C110-C187 disulfide bond is buried in rhodopsin because reactions with disulfide reducing agents and cyanide ion require prior treatment with denaturants."
https://openalex.org/W2091075468,"U6 is one of the five small nuclear RNA's (snRNA's) that are required for splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). The size and sequence of U6 RNA are conserved among organisms as diverse as yeast and man, and so it has been proposed that U6 RNA functions as a catalytic element in splicing. A procedure for in vitro reconstitution of functional yeast U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) with synthetic U6 RNA was applied in an attempt to elucidate the function of yeast U6 RNA. Two domains in U6 RNA were identified, each of which is required for in vitro splicing. Single nucleotide substitutions in these two domains block splicing either at the first or the second step. Invariably, U6 RNA mutants that block the first step of splicing do not enter the spliceosome. On the other hand, those that block the second step of splicing form a spliceosome but block cleavage at the 3' splice site of the intron. In both domains, the positions of base changes that block the second step of splicing correspond exactly to the site of insertion of pre-mRNA-type introns into the U6 gene of two yeast species, providing a possible explanation for the mechanism of how these introns originated and adding further evidence for the proposed catalytic role of U6 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2031400562,"Direct osmotic stress measurements have been made of forces between helices of xanthan, an industrially important charged polysaccharide. Exponentially decaying hydration forces, much like those already measured between lipid bilayer membranes or DNA double helices, dominate the interactions at close separation. Interactions between uncharged schizophyllans also show the same kind of hydration force seen between xanthans. In addition to the practical possibilities for modifying solution and suspension properties through recognition and control of molecular forces, there is now finally the opportunity for theorists to relate macroscopic properties of a polymer solution to the microscopic properties that underlie them."
https://openalex.org/W1501217717,"VMA3, a structure gene of the vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase subunit c of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been cloned and characterized. The VMA3 gene encodes a hydrophobic polypeptide with 160 amino acids as reported previously by Nelson and Nelson (Nelson, H., and Nelson, N. (1989) FEBS Lett. 247, 147-153). Peptide sequence analysis indicated that the VMA3 gene product lacks N-terminal methionine and does not have a cleavable signal sequence. To investigate functional and structural roles of the subunit c for vacuolar acidification and protein transport to the vacuole, haploid mutants with the disrupted VMA3 gene were constructed. The vma3 mutants can grow in nutrient-enriched medium, but they have completely lost the vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity and the ability of vacuolar acidification in vivo. The subunit c was found to be indispensable for the assembly of subunits a and b of the H(+)-ATPase complex. The disruption of the VMA3 gene causes yeast cells with considerable lesions in vacuolar biogenesis and protein transport to the vacuole and inhibits endocytosis of lucifer yellow CH completely."
https://openalex.org/W1601001606,"This study describes the identification and characterization of a soluble interleukin-1 (IL-1) binding protein in the conditioned media from Raji human B-lymphoma cells. The soluble IL-1 binding material was isolated by IL-1 affinity chromatography, and treatment with trypsin decreased its ability to bind to IL-1 demonstrating its protein nature. The soluble IL-1 binding protein was specific for IL-1 and was able to discriminate between Il-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in a manner analogous to the membrane-bound Raji IL-1 receptor. The specificity of the IL-1 binding protein was further established in two ways. 1) Cell-free supernatants from Raji receptor-negative cells did not contain any IL-1 binding protein, thus ruling out nonspecific interactions between IL-1 and a serum or other protein present in the conditioned medium; and 2) the soluble binding protein inhibited IL-1 binding to Raji cells in a dose-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of IL-1 beta binding showed the dissociation constant (KD) to be 5.1 nM for the soluble IL-1 binding protein compared with 0.8 nM for the membrane-bound IL-1 receptor. Gel chromatography of the soluble binding protein yielded a major peak of IL-1 binding activity with a molecular mass of 35-45 kDa. The characteristics of the soluble IL-1 binding protein described above are consistent with those of the extracellular binding domain of the membrane-bound Raji IL-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514276081,"A photoactivatable analog of 11-cis-retinal has been used to probe the orientation of retinal in bovine rhodopsin. The analog binds to the opsin to regenerate a chromophore with lambda max at 458 nm. The linkage site of the analog to the opsin was confirmed to be Lys-296 as in 11-cis-retinal rhodopsin. The analog-reconstituted rhodopsin activated transducin and was phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase on illumination. On photolysis of rhodopsin containing the radioactively labeled analog at 365 nm at -15 degrees C, 20-25% of the analog was covalently linked to the protein. Proteolysis of the labeled protein and characterization of the appropriate peptides showed that cross-linking of the analog was predominantly to helices C or F. When analog reconstituted rhodopsin in rod outer segments was photolyzed, cross-linking was predominantly to helix C. However, when analog-reconstituted rhodopsin, purified in lauryl maltoside, was photolyzed, labeling occurred mainly in helix F. Sequence analysis showed major sites of cross-linking to be Phe-115, Ala-117, Glu-122, Trp-126, and Ser-127 in helix C while Trp-265 was the major site in helix F. The results suggest that the beta-ionone ring of retinal orients toward helices C and F."
https://openalex.org/W1581338941,"The gradients of the major inorganic ions across the plasma membrane of heart were examined to determine the factors controlling the extent and direction of the changes induced during injury, certain diseases, and electrolyte disturbances. The ionic environment was altered by changing only the concentration of inorganic phosphate, [sigma Pi]o, from 0 to 1.2 to 5 mM in the Krebs-Henseleit buffer perfusing working rat hearts. Raising [sigma Pi]o from 1.2 to 5 mM resulted in a decrease in total Mg2+ content and calculated free cytosolic [Mg2+] from 0.44 to 0.04 mM, conversion of 4 mmol of MgATP2- to ATP4- and a decrease in measured intracellular [Cl-]i from 41 to 16 mM. At all levels of [sigma Pi]o, both the [Na+]i and [K+]i were invariant at about 3 mM and 130 mM, respectively, as was the energy of hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate bond of sigma ATP, delta GATP Hydr, of -13.2 kcal/mol. The relationship maintained between the ions on both sides of the plasma membrane by the 3Na+/2K(+)transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37) and an open K+ channel was: (formula; see text) The energy of the gradients of the other inorganic ions across the plasma membrane, delta G[ion]o/i, exhibited three distinct quanta of energy derived from the prime quantum of delta GATP Hydr of -13.2 kcal/mol. The second quantum was about one-third of delta GATP Hydr or +/- 4.4 kcal/mol and comprised the delta G[Na+]o/i, delta G[Mg2+]o/i, and delta G[HPO42-]o/i. These results indicated near-equilibrium was achieved by the reactants of the 3Na+/2K(+)-ATPase, the K+ channel, the Na(+)-Pi co-transporter, and a postulated net Mg2+/H2PO4- exchanger. The third quantum was one-third of delta G[Na+]o/i or about +/- 1.5 kcal/mol and comprised delta G[H+]o/i, delta G[HCO3-]o/i, and delta G[Cl-]o/i. The delta G[K+]o/i was 0, indicating near-equilibrium between the chemical energy of [K+]o/i and the E across the plasma membrane of -83 mV. It is concluded that the gradients of the major inorganic ions across the plasma membrane and the potential across that membrane constitute a Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium system catalyzed by transport enzymes sharing common substrates. The chemical and electrical energies of those gradients are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2007665663,"Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subclass of glutamate receptors is a critical step in the selection of appropriate synaptic connections in the developing visual systems of cat and frog. Activity-dependent development of mammalian motor neurons was shown to be similarly mediated by activation of the NMDA receptor. The expression of the Cat-301 proteoglycan on motor neurons was developmentally regulated and could be specifically inhibited by blockade of the NMDA receptor at the spinal segmental level. In the adult, Cat-301 immunoreactivity on motor neurons was not diminished by NMDA receptor blockade. The NMDA receptor may regulate the expression of a class of neuronal proteins (of which Cat-301 is one example) that underlie the morphological and physiological features of activity-dependent development."
https://openalex.org/W1601961990,"In an attempt to identify potential regulatory mechanisms for erythrocyte membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, the kinetics and pH dependence of the band 3-ankyrin interaction were investigated. Association of 125I-ankyrin with KI-stripped inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles was found to proceed in two kinetic phases. The initial, fast phase (t1/2 approximately 15-30 min) involved predominantly the binding of ankyrin to low affinity sites (KD approximately 130 nM) in a pH-dependent manner. The apparent pKa values describing this reversible pH dependence (7.2 +/- 0.1 and 9.2 +/- 0.1) defined states of band 3 with high, moderate, and no capacity to bind ankyrin (in order of increasing pH). Since the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 also exists in 3 distinct conformational states characterized by apparent pKa values of 7.2 and 9.2, it was hypothesized that the reversible structural equilibrium in band 3 could influence ankyrin binding. The second or slow phase of ankyrin binding to band 3 involved the conversion of low to high affinity sites (KD approximately 13 nM). This phase, which was largely temperature and pH independent, required roughly an order of magnitude longer to reach completion than the fast phase. Unfortunately, even though the slow phase could be cleanly separated from the fast phase at low pH, insufficient data were available to formulate a physical interpretation of its origin. Significantly, however, even after completion of the slow phase under the most quantitative binding conditions identified, a maximum of only 26% of the band 3 was found to bind ankyrin in situ. Although higher ankyrin-band 3 stoichiometries may be achievable with the isolated cytoplasmic fragment of band 3, we interpret the above 1:4 stoichiometry to suggest that the tetramer of band 3 constitutes the predominant ankyrin binding oligomer of band 3 on the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2160175948,"To map the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in lambda site-specific recombination, Int cleavage assays with suicide substrates, nuclease protection patterns, gel retardation experiments, and quantitative Western blotting were applied to wild-type attL and attL mutants. The results lead to a model in which one IHF molecule bends the attL DNA and forms a higher order complex with the three bivalent Int molecules required for excisive recombination. It is proposed that each of the Int molecules binds in a unique manner: one bridges two DNA binding sites in cis, one is held via its high affinity amino-terminal DNA binding domain, and the third depends upon protein-protein interactions in addition to its low affinity carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain. This protein-DNA complex contains two unsatisfied DNA binding domains, each with a different sequence specificity, and is well suited to specific interactions with an appropriate recombination partner."
https://openalex.org/W1536726659,"Vitamin K-dependent protein S is shown to contain four very high affinity Ca2(+)-binding sites. The number of sites and their affinities were determined from Ca2+ titration in the presence of the chromophoric chelator Quin 2. In 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5, the four macroscopic binding constants are K1 greater than or equal to 1 x 10(8) M-1, K2 = 3 +/- 2 x 10(7) M-1, K3 = 4 +/- 2 x 10(6) M-1, and K4 = 9 +/- 4 x 10(5) M-1. At low ionic strength, the corresponding values are K1 greater than or equal to 2 x 10(9) M-1, K2 = 9 +/- 4 x 10(8) M-1, K3 = 2 +/- 1 x 10(8) M-1, and K4 = 9 +/- 4 x 10(7) M-1. To localize the Ca2(+)-binding sites, protein S was subjected to proteolysis using lysyl endopeptidase. This yielded a 20-21-kDa fragment which comprised the third and fourth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and remained high affinity Ca2(+)-binding site(s). The susceptibility of the EGF-like domains to proteolysis increased when Ca2+ was removed from protein S indicating that the Ca2+ binding is important for the stability and/or conformation of the EGF domains. Three of the four EGF-like domains in protein S contain beta-hydroxyasparagine. In each of these domains there is a cluster of three or four negatively charged amino acid residues which are likely to contribute to the extraordinary high Ca2+ affinity. From sequence homology it is suggested that this novel type of high affinity Ca2(+)-binding site is present in several other proteins, e.g. in the EGF-like domains in the low sensity lipoproteins receptor, thrombomodulin, the Notch protein of Drosophila melanogaster, and transforming growth factor beta 1-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1557673266,"Mechanisms involved in the development or the regression of myocardial hypertrophy cannot be fully explained as responses to blood pressure control alone. We had hypothesized that the development of hypertrophy is initiated by a signal (mechanical or humoral) to the myocardium, which in turn produces a soluble factor that triggers protein synthesis and initiates myocardial growth. Using the stimulation of protein synthesis in isolated cardiac myocytes obtained from normal rat hearts as an assay system, we have identified a soluble factor from the hypertrophied myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats. This factor, which has been purified to apparent homogeneity, is a protein of 12 kDa. The sequence of three internally liberated peptides containing 7-24 residues was determined. Based on the determined amino acid sequences of these peptides, this factor (designated myotrophin) appears to be a novel protein that shows no homology with any previously described growth factors. Myotrophin is present in human, dog, and rat hypertrophied hearts (28-35% stimulation of protein synthesis over control) and in small amounts in normal hearts (5-6% stimulation). Myotrophin causes two dose-dependent effects in neonatal cardiac myocytes: an increase in the surface area of the myocyte and the appearance of organized myofibrils, which become apparent within 48 h. Myotrophin may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy as well as in the normal development of cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1584129915,"The interaction of protein S with membranes and subsequent combination with complement C4b-binding protein (C4BP) was studied. Protein S interacted with phospholipid vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner typical of other vitamin K-dependent proteins. Association of C4BP with protein S showed no apparent selectivity for membrane-bound or solution phase protein S. When bound to the membrane, the protein complexes projected out from the vesicle surface and induced vesicle radius changes of 11.4 nm for tightly packed protein S alone and 17.5 nm for the protein S-C4BP complex. Due to a low density of the protein S-C4BP on the membrane at saturation, the actual projection of this complex out from the membrane surface would be much greater than 17.5 nm. A low saturation density suggested that the protein complex had a large two-dimensional hydrodynamic radius in the plane of the membrane that prevented tight packing of protein. In the presence of calcium, the protein-protein interaction was rapid (ka greater than or equal to 1.10(6) M-1 s-1) and had very high affinity (KD less than or equal to 10(-10) M). The dissociation rate was slow with an estimated rate constant of less than or equal to 2.10(-4) s-1 at 25 degrees C. Protein-protein interaction was much slower in the absence of calcium with an estimated association rate constant of only 2.10(4) M-1 s-1. Consequently, the protein-protein interaction was greatly enhanced by calcium. The very high affinity interaction between protein S and C4BP suggested specificity and an important function for the protein S-C4BP complex in blood. In this regard it was important that C4BP which was bound to protein S on the phospholipid surface could interact with complement protein C4b. These results suggested that protein S may serve an important role in localizing C4BP to negatively charged phospholipid. This would provide regulation of complement activation at sites where the coagulation system is activated such as on the surface of activated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1595071073,"The F1-ATPase from chloroplasts (CF1) lacks catalytic capacity for ATP hydrolysis if ATP is not bound at noncatalytic sites. CF1 heat activated in the presence of ADP, with less than one ADP and no ATP at non-catalytic sites, shows a pronounced lag in the onset of ATP hydrolysis after exposure to 5-20 microM ATP. The onset of activity correlates well with the binding of ATP at the last two of the three noncatalytic sites. The dependence of activity on the presence of ATP at non-catalytic sites is shown at relatively low or high free Mg2+ concentrations, with or without bicarbonate as an activating anion, and when the binding of ATP at noncatalytic sites is slowed 3-4-fold by sulfate. The latent CF1 activated by dithiothreitol also requires ATP at noncatalytic sites for ATPase activity. A similar requirement by other F1-ATPases and by ATP synthases seems plausible."
https://openalex.org/W1544398217,"The anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S interacts with the complement regulatory protein C4b-binding protein (C4BP), both in purified systems and in plasma. The concentrations of these proteins in plasma are approximately equimolar (0.3 microM) and 30-40% of protein S in plasma is found in the noncomplexed state. Only the uncomplexed form of protein S displays anticoagulant activity and studies have shown that patients with a selective deficiency of free protein S have a high incidence of thrombosis. In this study, we report that the protein S-C4BP interaction is at least 100-fold tighter in the presence of Ca2+ than in EDTA. The KD in the presence of Ca2+ was estimated with a gel filtration technique to be less than 5 x 10(-10) M, whereas in the presence of EDTA, it was approximately 100-fold higher. Ca2+ titration experiments suggested that the Ca2+ sites which function in the protein S-C4BP interaction are of high affinity which, in turn, suggests that they may be independent of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid region and may be present in the epidermal growth factor-like domains of protein S. The high affinity of the protein S-C4BP interaction in the presence of Ca2+ suggested that virtually all of the protein S in whole blood should be complexed with C4BP. However, even though the protein S-C4BP interaction in Ca2(+)-containing serum was shown to have the same high affinity as in purified systems, approximately 30-40% of the protein S in serum was free. These results appear best explained by the presence of a third component in whole blood which regulates the protein S-C4BP interaction, keeping approximately 30-40% of circulating protein S in its free, functionally anticoagulant form. It is speculated that persons with little free protein S may be deficient in this hypothetical third component."
https://openalex.org/W1588816960,"The B subunit (approximately 60 kDa) of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase is one of the two major subunits comprising the hydrophilic catalytic complex of the enzyme. Using left and catalytic complex of the enzyme. Using left and right primers which bind two highly conserved sequences of the B subunit, an 836-base pair fragment was amplified from human brain cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragment was used to probe a Northern blot and to screen a brain cDNA library. A single RNA band, 3.2 kilobases (kb) in length, was detected on Northern blots. A positive cDNA clone containing a 2.5-kb insert was isolated and sequenced. It included a long 3'-untranslated region (greater than 1.2 kb) and was missing a minor portion of the 5'-end of the coding region. The coding region of the brain cDNA sequence was 77% identical at the nucleotide level and 90% identical at the amino acid level to the previously reported sequence for the B subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from human kidney (Sudhof, T. C., Fried, V. A., Stone, D. K., Johnston, P. A., and Xie, X.-S. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 86, 6067-6071). Within the coding region of the brain cDNA, which is 6 amino acid residues shorter at the 3'-end than the kidney sequence, an 11% difference in the GC content was calculated. The 3'-noncoding sequence of the brain cDNA was completely unrelated to that of kidney and was three times longer. We conclude that the B subunit cDNAs from human kidney and brain represent different isoforms. This is the first demonstration of an isoform of a vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1515862194,"A fluorophore, 9-anthroyl (AN) group, was covalently incorporated into the 23-kDa NH2-terminal peptide segment of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) (Hiratsuka, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18188-18194). The fluorescent S-1 derivative (AN-S-1) was utilized to detect conformational changes in the 23-kDa segment associated with ATP hydrolysis of S-1. The extrinsic fluorescence of AN-S-1 was sensitive to binding of ligands. Upon addition of adenyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and ADP, fluorescence of AN-S-1 decreased by 10, 34, and 50%, respectively. Using this fluorescence decrease, the number of ligand binding sites (n) and the dissociation constant (KD) for the binary complexes of AN-S-1 were obtained: n = 0.96, KD = 15 microM for AMP-PNP; n = 1.0, KD = 5.0 microM for PPi; n = 0.99, KD = 27 microM for ADP. When ATP was added to AN-S-1, the fluorescence intensity decreased rapidly by about 30%, and this fluorescence level was maintained during the steady state of ATP hydrolysis. As the substrate was used up, the fluorescence intensity decreased further to 50% of the original level. Model experiments with AN-N-acetylserine suggest that the fluorophore attached to S-1 is gradually exposed to more hydrophilic surface of protein with a progress of the ATPase reaction. The results indicate that conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis occur in the vicinity of the fluorophore attached to the 23-kDa NH2-terminal peptide segment of S-1."
https://openalex.org/W1764768847,"ATP is involved in conferring transport competence to numerous mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol. Unfolded precursor proteins were found not to require ATP for import into mitochondria, suggesting a role of ATP in the unfolding of precursors. Here we report the unexpected finding that a hybrid protein containing the tightly folded passenger protein dihydrofolate reductase becomes unfolded and specifically translocated across the mitochondrial membranes independently of added ATP. Moreover, interaction of the precursor with the mitochondrial receptor components does not require ATP. The results suggest that ATP is not involved in the actual process of unfolding during membrane translocation of precursors. ATP rather appears to be necessary for preventing the formation of improper structures of precursors in the cytosol and for folding of imported polypeptides on (and release from) chaperone-like molecules in the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1536132002,"The dermis of a child with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS-IV) contained about 11% of the normal amount of type III collagen and cultured dermal fibroblasts produced a reduced amount of type III procollagen which was secreted poorly. Type III collagen produced by these cells contained normal and abnormal alpha-chains and cyanogen bromide peptides. The site of the structural defect in the abnormal alpha 1 (III) chains was localized to the region of Met797, which is at the junction of the two carboxyl-terminal CB5 and CB9 cyanogen bromide peptides. Chemical cleavage of heteroduplexes formed between EDS-IV mRNA and a normal cDNA clone covering the CB5 and CB9 region showed that about 100 nucleotides were mismatched. Sequencing of amplified and cloned cDNA spanning the mutant region revealed a 108 nucleotide deletion corresponding to amino acid residues Gly775 to Lys810. The deleted nucleotide sequence corresponded to sequences that, by analogy to the organization of the type I collagen genes, should be precisely encoded by exon 41 of the COL3A1 gene. Sequencing of amplified genomic DNA, prepared using disimilar amounts of primers specific for exons 41 and 42, displayed a base substitution (G-to-A) in the highly conserved GT dinucleotide of the 5' splice site of intron 41. Normal sequences were also obtained from the normal allele. It is likely that the GT-to-AT transition at the splice donor site of intron 41 generated an abnormally spliced mRNA in which sequences of exon 40 and 42 were joined together with maintenance of the reading frame. The corresponding peptide deletion included the cyanogen bromide cleavage site Met797-Pro798 and the mammalian collagenase cleavage site at Gly781-Ile782. These losses account for the resistance of EDS-IV collagen to cyanogen bromide and mammalian collagenase digestion. Cultured fibroblasts produced normal homotrimer, mutant homotrimer, and mixed heterotrimer type III collagen molecules. The mutant homotrimer molecules were the major pepsin-resistant species and about 69% of the alpha 1(III) mRNA was in the mutant form."

The steady state concentration of the phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of ATP is increased by La3+. The enzyme cross-reacts with a monoclonal antibody (mAb-5F10) raised against the human erythrocyte Ca2+ pump. The enzyme has been purified using a mAb-5F10 antibody affinity column. CNBr digestion of the isolated protein has yielded two peptides which have been sequenced. One of them matches perfectly a sequence contained in the erythrocyte Ca2+ pump, the other is very homologous to another domain in the erythrocyte pump. In spite of the absence of calmodulin stimulation, 125I-calmodulin overlay experiments on the purified liver ATPase under denaturing conditions have revealed that the enzyme binds calmodulin even more strongly than the erythrocyte pump. Immunocytochemical experiments on liver slices using the mAb-5F10 antibody have shown that the enzyme is located predominantly in the blood sinusoidal domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1583424062,"An antipeptide antibody was produced against a peptide corresponding to residues 877-888 of fast twitch rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. This antipeptide antibody bound strongly to the ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles only after the vesicles had been solubilized with the detergent C12E8 indicating that its epitope was located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Digestion of sarcoplasmic reticulum or purified (Ca2(+)-MG2+)-ATPase by proteinase K for up to 1 h resulted in a stable ATPase fragment of 30 kDa containing the epitope for the above antibody and the epitope for an antibody directed against the C terminus. Further proteolysis revealed smaller fragments (Mr 19,000 and 13,000) containing both epitopes. By contrast, small fragments of the ATPase (less than 29 kDa) containing the N-terminal epitope were not observed even after short exposures to proteinase K. These data support the view that the (Ca2(+)-MG2+)-ATPase has 10 transmembranous helices."
https://openalex.org/W1589328760,"Abstract Fragmentation of the heparan sulfate chains from bovine glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by hydrazine/nitrous acid treatment followed by NaB3H4-reduction yielded a mixture of six sulfated disaccharides containing D-glucuronic (GlcUA) or L-iduronic acid (IdUA) and terminating in 2,5-anhydro[3H]mannitol (AnManH2), in addition to the nonsulfated component GlcUA beta 1----4AnManH2. Among these products two novel disaccharide units were identified as IdUA alpha 1----4AnManH2(3-SO4) and IdUA(2-SO4)alpha 1----4AnManH2(3-SO4); these accounted for 22% of the total sulfated species indicating that there are 2-3 residues of 3-O-sulfated glucosamine/heparan sulfate chain. The disulfated disaccharide was shown through its release by direct nitrous acid treatment to be situated in a GlcNSO3-IdUA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO3(3-SO4) sequence which is distinct from that in which 3-O-sulfated glucosamine is located in the antithrombin-binding region of heparins. Analyses of heparan sulfate from lens capsule, a nonvascular basement membrane, indicated the absence of sequences containing 3-O-sulfated glucosamine, although otherwise the sulfated disaccharides produced by hydrazine/nitrous acid/Na-B3H4 treatment (GlcUA beta 1----4AnManH2(6-SO4), IdUA alpha 1----4AnManH2(6-SO4), IdUA(2-SO4)alpha 1----4AnManH2 and IdUA(2-SO4)alpha 1----4AnManH2(6-SO4] were the same as from GBM. Examination of the GBM heparan sulfate domains after nitrous acid treatment indicated that the O- as well as N-sulfate groups are clustered in an iduronic acid-rich 10-disaccharide peripheral segment, while the internal region (approximately 20 disaccharides) is composed primarily of repeating GlcUA beta 1----4GlcNAc units. The localization of chain diversity to the outer region may facilitate interactions of the heparan sulfate with other macromolecular components."
https://openalex.org/W2094711368,"The presence and distribution of calsequestrin (CS), Ca2+ pump, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor were investigated biochemically and immunologically in microsomal (P3) fractions isolated from chicken cerebrum and cerebellum. Two different batches of polyclonal antibodies specific for chicken skeletal muscle CS identified a Ca2+ binding, CS-like protein that was extremely enriched in cerebellum P3 fractions and absent from all cerebrum fractions. The cerebellum CS-like protein was deemed authentic CS because the N-terminal amino acid domain and peptide mapping were identical to those of skeletal muscle CS in the same species. CS was detected in striated muscles and cerebellum only. Cerebellum P3 fractions were also found to be considerably enriched in Ca2+ pump and IP3 receptor compared with the homologous cerebrum fractions, as judged by measurements of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+ ATPase activity, IP3-induced Ca2+ release, and [3H]IP3 binding, respectively. Cerebellum microsomal fractions therefore appear to contain membrane fragments endowed with Ca2+ pump, IP3 receptor, and CS, i.e., three key components of a Ca2+ storage organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1578967853,"Stimulation of macrophages with platelet-activating factor (PAF) elicits an increase of intracellular calcium concentration, Ca2+i, which was monitored here at the single cell level with the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2. The sustained component of this Ca2+i increase reflects the dynamic balance achieved between enhanced Ca2+ influx and efflux. In macrophages where a steady increase of Ca2+i has been evoked by 50 nM thapsigargin (a molecule known to empty Ca2+ stores and elevate Ca2+i in various cell types), PAF activates Ca2+ efflux, without causing a preceding increase in Ca2+i. This result shows that in this case, Ca2+ extrusion is not merely a consequence of a Ca2+i increase. PAF-evoked Ca2+ extrusion does not result from the activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Exogenous arachidonic acid (10-100 microM) elicits Ca2+ efflux in macrophages where Ca2+i has been previously elevated by either PAF or thapsigargin. PAF-induced Ca2+ extrusion is blocked by 4-bromophenacylbromide, an inhibitor of arachidonic acid production by phospholipase A2. Together, these results suggest that arachidonic acid, which is produced in PAF-stimulated macrophages, contributes to the regulation of a Ca2+ extrusion system, which is presumably a Ca2(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1582560650,"A1 is a core protein of the eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and is under study here as a prototype single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein. A1 is a two-domain protein, NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal, with highly conserved primary structure among vertebrate homologues sequenced to date. It is well documented that the NH2-terminal domain has single-stranded DNA and RNA binding activity. We prepared a proteolytic fragment of rat A1 representing the COOH-terminal one-third of the intact protein, the region previously termed COOH-terminal domain. This purified fragment of 133 amino acids binds to DNA and also binds tightly to the fluorescent reporter poly(ethenoadenylate), which is used to access binding parameters. In solution with 0.41 M NaCl, the equilibrium constant is similar to that observed with A1 itself, and binding is cooperative. The purified COOH-terminal fragment can be photochemically cross-linked to bound nucleic acid, confirming that COOH-terminal fragment residues are in close contact with the polynucleotide lattice. These binding results with isolated COOH-terminal fragment indicate that the COOH-terminal domain in intact A1 can contribute directly to binding properties. Contact between both COOH-terminal domain and NH2-terminal domain residues in an intact A1:poly(8-azidoadenylate) complex was confirmed by photochemical cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1545005572,"Mg2+ is known to be a potent inhibitor of F1 ATPases from various sources. Such inhibition requires the presence of a tightly bound ADP at a catalytic site. Results with the spinach chloroplast F1 ATPase (CF1) show that the time delays of up to 1 min or more in the induction or the relief of the inhibition are best explained by a slow binding and slow release of Mg2+ rather than by slow enzyme conformational changes. CF1 is known to have multiple Mg2+ binding sites with Kd values in the micromolar range. The inhibitory Mg2+ and ADP can bind independently to CF1. When Mg2+ and ATP are added to the uninhibited enzyme, a relatively fast rate of hydrolysis attained soon after the addition is followed by a much slower steady-state rate. The inhibited steady-state rate results from a slowly attained equilibrium of binding of medium Mg2+. The Kd for the binding of the inhibitory Mg2+ is in the range of 1-8 microM, in the presence or absence of added ATP, as based on the extent of rate inhibition induced by Mg2+. Assessments from 18O exchange experiments show that the binding of Mg2+ is accompanied by a relatively rapid change to an enzyme form that is incapable of hydrolyzing MgATP. When ATP is added to the Mg2+- and ADP-inhibited enzyme, the resulting reactivation can be explained by MgATP binding to an alternate catalytic site which results in a displacement of the tightly bound ADP after a slow release of Mg2+. Both an increase in temperature (to 50 degrees C) and the presence of activating anions such as bicarbonate or sulfite reduce the extent of the Mg2+ inhibition markedly. The activating anions may bind to CF1 in place of Pi near the ADP. Whether the inhibitory Mg2+ binds at catalytic or noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites or at another location is not known. The Mg2(+)- and ADP-induced inhibition appears to be a general property of F1 ATPases, which show considerable differences in affinity for ADP, Mg2+, and Pi. These differences may reflect physiological control functions."
https://openalex.org/W1547761830,"LaATP is shown to be an effective inhibitor of the calcium ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum because the binding of LaATP to cE.Ca2 results in the formation of lanthanum phosphoenzyme, which decays slowly. Steady-state activity of the calcium ATPase in leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles is inhibited 50% by 0.16 microM LaCl3 (15 nM free La3+, 21 nM LaATP) in the presence of 25 microM Ca2+ and 49 microM MgATP (5 mM MgSO4, 100 mM KCl, 40 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C). However, 50% inhibition of the uptake of 45Ca and phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP in a single turnover experiment requires 100 microM LaCl3 (28 microM free La3+) in the presence of 25 microM Ca2+; this inhibition is reversed by calcium but inhibition of steady-state turnover is not. Therefore, binding of La3+ to the cytoplasmic calcium transport site is not responsible for the inhibition of steady-state ATPase activity. The addition of 6.7 microM LaCl3 (1.1 microM free La3+) has no effect on the rate of dephosphorylation of phosphoenzyme formed from MgATP and enzyme in leaky vesicles, while 6.7 mM CaCl2 slows the rate of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis as expected; 6.7 microM LaCl3 and 6.7 mM CaCl2 cause 95 and 98% inhibition of steady-state ATPase activity, respectively. This shows that inhibition of ATPase activity in the steady state is not caused by binding of La3+ to the intravesicular calcium transport site of the phosphoenzyme. Inhibition of ATPase activity by 2 microM LaCl3 (0.16 microM free La3+, 0.31 microM LaATP) requires greater than 5 s, which corresponds to approximately 50 turnovers, to reach a steady-state level of greater than or equal to 80% inhibition. Inhibition by La3+ is fully reversed by the addition of 0.55 mM CaCl2 and 0.50 mM EGTA; this reactivation is slow with t1/2 approximately 9 s. Two forms of phosphoenzyme are present in reactions that are partially inhibited by La3+: phosphoenzyme with Mg2+ at the catalytic site and phosphoenzyme with La3+ at the catalytic site, which undergo hydrolysis with observed rate constants of greater than 4 and 0.05 s-1, respectively. We conclude, therefore, that La3+ inhibits steady-state ATPase activity under these conditions by replacing Mg2+ as the catalytic ion for phosphoryl transfer. The slow development of inhibition corresponds to the accumulation of lanthanum phosphoenzyme. Initially, most of the enzyme catalyzes MgATP hydrolysis, but the fraction of enzyme with La3+ bound to the catalytic site gradually increases because lanthanum phosphoenzyme undergoes hydrolysis much more slowly than does magnesium phosphoenzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1573218071,"We have characterized the helicase activity of transcription termination factor rho on a variety of substrates. Helicase activity requires specific recognition of a single-stranded region of RNA upstream (5') of the nucleic acid duplex on which rho acts. Spacer sequences of at least 450 nucleotides can be inserted between the rho-binding signals and the duplex region with little effect on activity. RNA-DNA helices of up to 120 base pairs, but not as long as 210 base pairs, can be disrupted efficiently by rho. The stoichiometry of release of substrates with long spacer sequences, as with the standard substrate, approaches a value of one RNA released per rho hexamer; thus cooperative binding by rho does not account for action at a distance. Instead, these results are consistent with a model in which a single rho hexamer binds initially to terminator sequences and then either loops out or tracks along the intervening RNA to reach the duplex region. Results with complex substrates are inconsistent with looping and support the tracking model: under conditions that allow disruption of RNA-DNA, but not RNA-RNA helices (0.4 mM Mg2+), the presence of a short RNA-RNA helix acts as a block to the disruption of an RNA-DNA helix downstream. These findings are discussed in relation to the mechanism of the helicase activity as well as its role in rho-dependent transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W1550811483,"Vesicular fragments of longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum were loaded with calcium by active transport, sedimented by centrifugation, and resuspended in neutral buffer and [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Under these conditions, calcium efflux from the loaded vesicles occurred at rates varying from 100 to 700 nmol/mg/min, depending on the calcium load. If either Ca2+ (microM), Mg2+ (mM), K+ or Na+ (greater than 10 mM) were added to the resuspension medium, the rate of efflux was reduced. In the presence of Mg2+ and EGTA, a large inhibition of calcium efflux was produced by formation of phosphoenzyme intermediate with Pi. In this case, addition of ADP again started calcium efflux, coupled with ATP synthesis. The rates of uncoupled or coupled efflux were approximately the same. The observed calcium fluxes are attributed to a slow channel formed by ATPase transmembrane helices (MacLennan, D. H., Brandl, C. J., Korczak, B., and Green, N. M. (1985) Nature 316, 686-700) and are capable of long range interaction with the catalytic site. Coupling of transport and catalytic activities is thereby produced by phosphorylation and ligand binding. The channel includes negatively charged residues that are likely to influence calcium fluxes through cation binding. It is proposed that this channel is the mechanistic device for active transport of calcium across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, and for its reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1517656414,"Phosphorylation of the human interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) receptor was studied in three cell lines of distinct lineages using radiophosphate labeling techniques. Receptors from unstimulated Colo-205 displayed a low level of constitutive phosphorylation which was enhanced 5.3-fold following exposure of the cells to either purified recombinant human IFN gamma or phorbol myristate acetate. Enhanced receptor phosphorylation was specific, dose- and time-dependent, reversible, and affected only serine and threonine residues. Increased phosphorylation was observed only when cells were treated with human IFN gamma or phorbol myristate acetate and not with murine IFN gamma, human IFN alpha, human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or epidermal growth factor. The biologic relevance of IFN gamma receptor phosphorylation was suggested by three additional observations; 1) there was a close correlation between the extent of receptor phosphorylation and the magnitude of the cellular response induced, 2) TNF alpha concomitantly enhanced both IFN gamma-dependent HLA-DR expression and IFN gamma-dependent receptor phosphorylation on Colo-205, and 3) phosphorylation of functionally inactive recombinant murine IFN gamma receptors expressed on transfected human 293 or Colo-205 cells was not induced by murine IFN gamma but was induced by the homologous human ligand. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the IFN gamma receptor is an important step in the development of IFN gamma-dependent cellular responses and indicates that phosphorylation requires a functionally active receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1500101066,"The transmembrane topography of the Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase has been investigated using purified, reconstituted components and direct protein chemical techniques. Reconstituted proteoliposomes containing H(+)-ATPase molecules oriented predominantly with their cytoplasmic surface facing outward were treated with trypsin to liberate peptides present on the cytoplasmic surface of the H(+)-ATPase as recently described (Hennessey, J.P., Jr., and Scarborough, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 532-537. The released peptides were then separated from the proteoliposomes by gel filtration chromatography and further purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Fourteen such peptides were identified by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, directly defining these parts of the molecule as present on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Moreover, this information identified several additional flanking stretches as likely to be cytoplasmically located by virtue of the fact that they are too short to cross the membrane and return. These results and the results of other recent experiments establish 417 residues of the 919 present in the ATPase molecule, at positions 2-100, 186-256, 441-663, and 897-920, as cytoplasmically located. Taken together with the results of our preliminary investigations of the membrane embedded sectors of the ATPase, this information allows the formulation of a reasonably detailed model for the transmembrane topography of the ATPase polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1497653445,"Studies involving 32P labeling and wet ashing of isolated dynein reveal that isolated dynein contains approximately 6 mol of phosphate predominantly distributed over four polypeptides of molecular masses of 78, 76, 47, and 23 kDa. Dynein must, therefore, be phosphorylated to at least this extent in vivo. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and an axonemal cAMP-dependent protein kinase contaminating the dynein preparation can further phosphorylate dynein in vitro. Each kinase can place up to 0.5 mol of phosphate on native dynein polypeptides of molecular masses of 78 and 34 kDa. Removal of two of the phosphates on isolated dynein by either acid or alkaline phosphatase results in a 28% decrease in the specific activity of dynein in the presence or absence of microtubules. Selective attenuation of the microtubule-activated ATPase, but not the uncoupled free dynein ATPase, would be indicative of a regulatory function of the phosphates. The in vivo regulation of the dynein ATPase by the two phosphates accessible to acid or alkaline phosphatase is therefore subject to question. Other phosphates on dynein must be examined for their effect on the microtubule-dynein cross-bridge cycle and motility before phosphorylation can definitively be established as a mode of dynein regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1511755224,"Genomic clones containing the 5'-terminal portion of the human CRE-BP1 gene that encodes transcriptional regulator binding to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) were isolated. Multiple transcriptional start sites in the promoter region were identified by nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension analysis. By DNase I footprinting with use of purified transcription factor Sp1 and nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells, 11 Sp1-binding sites, two CCAAT sequences, two CREs, and three unknown factor recognition elements were found. Transfection of chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids containing various deletions of the promoter into CV-1 cells indicated that the region between nucleotides -50 and 90, which contained three Sp1-binding sites and one CRE, was sufficient for basal promoter activity. These results suggest that multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins may control the expression of the CRE-BP1 gene, although Sp1 seems to be important for the basal promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1929647770,"Reversal of the cycle of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase starts from ATPase phosphorylation by Pi, in the presence of Mg2+, and leads to ATP synthesis. We show here that ATP can also be synthesized when Ca2+ replaces Mg2+. In the absence of a calcium gradient and in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, ATPase phosphorylation from Pi and Ca2+ led to the formation of an unstable phosphoenzyme. This instability was due to a competition between the phosphorylation reaction induced by Pi and Ca2+ and the transition induced by Ca2+ binding to the transport sites, which led to a conformation that could not be phosphorylated from Pi. Dimethyl sulfoxide and low temperature stabilized the calcium phosphoenzyme, which under appropriate conditions, subsequently reacted with ADP to synthesize ATP. Substitution of Co2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, or Ni2+ for Mg2+ induced ATPase phosphorylation from Pi, giving phosphoenzymes of various stabilities. However, substitution of Ba2+, Sr2+, or Cr3+ produced no detectable phosphoenzymes, under the same experimental conditions. Our results show that ATPase phosphorylation from Pi, like its phosphorylation from ATP, does not have a strict specificity for magnesium."
https://openalex.org/W1983803488,"Some protein kinases and phosphatases are myristoylated on their amino terminus, which perhaps contributes to subcellular localization or regulation. Glycoprotein CD45, a hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase, was examined for fatty acid content. The CD45 protein incorporated [3H]myristate, but little [3H]palmitate. The label was not metabolized and reincorporated into amino acids or saccharides, as revealed by peptide maps of CD45 labeled with [3H]myristate, 14C-labeled amino acids, [35S]methionine, or 125I, and glycosidase treatments, respectively. The myristate label was resistant to mild alkaline methanolysis and was found in fatty acid and sphingosine, indicating an unusual form of lipid attachment to CD45."
https://openalex.org/W1527579012,"The peptides, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly-NH2, Leu-Arg-Arg-Gln-Ala-Leu-Gly-NH2, and Leu-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Leu-Gly-NH2, serve as active site-directed inhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine cardiac muscle. The Asn-containing peptide is a 10-fold more potent inhibitor than its Ala- and Gln-containing counterparts. All three peptides are linear competitive inhibitors versus a peptide-based substrate and uncompetitive inhibitors versus MgATP. The enhanced inhibitory potency of the Asn-peptide, in conjunction with the observed loss of ATP-ase activity of the enzyme in the presence of the inhibitor, suggests that asparagine may serve as a through-space isostere of serine. The uncompetitive inhibition pattern displayed by amide-capped peptides versus MgATP indicates that these species bind in an ordered fashion to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with MgATP binding first."
https://openalex.org/W1485554810,"Abstract We have investigated some unusual aspects of the inhibition of mammalian thymidylate synthase (TS) by the folate antimetabolite, 10-propargyl-5,8-dideaza-folic acid (CB 3717). From our results, we conclude that binding of CB 3717 metabolites to one subunit of L1210 TS modified the conformation of the second active site of this enzyme so that it retained the ability to bind 5-fluro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) but not its catalytic activity. Exposure of intact mouse L1210 cells to CB 3717 resulted in inactivation of cellular TS activity, yet desalted cytosol preparations from these cells retained the ability to bind FdUMP. The same effect was found with several analogs of CB 3717. Complexes of FdUMP formed in vitro with TS from cells exposed to CB 3717 were covalent and co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with complexes of FdUMP, folate cofactor, and TS from cells not exposed to CB 3717. In the presence of dUMP, a tightly bound complex rapidly formed between isolated pure TS and the pentaglutamate of CB 3717 but not the monoglutamate form of this compound. Binding experiments using CB 3717 pentaglutamate-inhibited TS suggested a stoichiometry of 1 mol of FdUMP bound per mol of dimeric TS."
https://openalex.org/W1566227921,"The rate of ATP hydrolysis under multi- and unisite conditions was determined in the native F1-inhibitor protein complex of bovine heart mitochondria (Adolfsen, R., MacClung, J.A., and Moudrianakis, E.N. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 1727-1735). Aurovertin was used to distinguish between hydrolytic activity catalyzed by the F1-ATPase or the F1-inhibitor protein (F1.I) complex. We found that incubation of aurovertin with the F1.I complex, prior to the addition of substrate, results in a stimulation of the hydrolytic activity from 1 to 8-10 mumol min-1 mg-1. The addition of aurovertin to a F1.I complex simultaneously with ATP results in a 30% inhibition with respect to the untreated F1.I. In contrast, if the F1.I complex is activated up to a hydrolytic activity of 80 mumol min-1 mg-1, aurovertin inhibits the enzyme in a manner similar to that described for F1-ATPase devoid of the inhibitor protein. The native F1.I complex catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP under conditions for single catalytic site, liberating 0.16-0.18 mol of Pi/mol of enzyme. Preincubation with aurovertin before the addition of substrate had no effect under these conditions. On the other hand, if the F1.I ATPase was allowed to hydrolyze ATP at a single catalytic site, catalysis was inhibited by 98% by aurovertin. In F1-ATPase, the hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP bound to the first catalytic site is promoted by the addition of excess ATP, in the presence or absence of aurovertin. Under conditions for single site catalysis, hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP in the F1.I complex was not promoted by excess ATP. We conclude that the endogenous inhibitor protein regulates catalysis by promoting the entrapment of adenine nucleotides at the high affinity catalytic site, thus hindering cooperative ATP hydrolysis."
