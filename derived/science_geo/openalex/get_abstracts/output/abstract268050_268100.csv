https://openalex.org/W1977945389,"Biomass burning is widespread, especially in the tropics. It serves to clear land for shifting cultivation, to convert forests to agricultural and pastoral lands, and to remove dry vegetation in order to promote agricultural productivity and the growth of higher yield grasses. Furthermore, much agricultural waste and fuel wood is being combusted, particularly in developing countries. Biomass containing 2 to 5 petagrams of carbon is burned annually (1 petagram = 1015 grams), producing large amounts of trace gases and aerosol particles that play important roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate. Emissions of carbon monoxide and methane by biomass burning affect the oxidation efficiency of the atmosphere by reacting with hydroxyl radicals, and emissions of nitric oxide and hydrocarbons lead to high ozone concentrations in the tropics during the dry season. Large quantities of smoke particles are produced as well, and these can serve as cloud condensation nuclei. These particles may thus substantially influence cloud microphysical and optical properties, an effect that could have repercussions for the radiation budget and the hydrological cycle in the tropics. Widespread burning may also disturb biogeochemical cycles, especially that of nitrogen. About 50 percent of the nitrogen in the biomass fuel can be released as molecular nitrogen. This pyrodenitrification process causes a sizable loss of fixed nitrogen in tropical ecosystems, in the range of 10 to 20 teragrams per year (1 teragram = 1012 grams)."

These were just the most recent and drmatic in a series of changes in plants and animals caused by experimental exclusion of Dipodomys. In this ecosystem kangaroo rats are a keystone guild: through seed predation and soil disturbance they have major effects on biological diversity and biogeochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073695654,Absorption and scattering by aerosols and reflection of solar radiation from the surface determine the sign of the change in the planetary albedo caused by the presence of aerosols. This change in planetary albedo results in atmospheric heating or cooling. Small changes in the ratio of absorption to scattering over time can reverse such heating or cooling trends.
https://openalex.org/W2047136988,"In the Appalachians, late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogenesis is widely regarded as resulting from dextral oblique collision between irregular margins of Gondwana and Laurentia. However, this relative plate motion cannot account for coeval convergence in the Ouachitas and Variscides and is incompatible with some tectonic transport indicators in the Appalachians. An alternative kinematic model is proposed in which early sinistral transpression in the Appalachians is followed by counterclockwise rotation of Gondwana and the development of a system of dextral strike-slip faults extending from southern Europe to Alabama."
https://openalex.org/W2020402758,"Postglacial, right-lateral, strike-slip movement along the Boconó fault, measured on detailed topographic maps, averages 66 meters. The rate of movement was approximately 0.66 centimeter per year, as indicated by carbon-14 dating of associated soil. This evidence suggests that postglacial movement between the Caribbean and Americas plates occurred mainly along the Boconó fault and the north coast of Venezuela."
https://openalex.org/W2024649224,"Studies of living polymers have greatly enriched our knowledge of the behavior of ions and ion-pairs in organic media. Future investigations will lead to more detailed knowledge of these interesting species. Especially, intramolecular associations or intramolecular solvation by the polymer chains provide promising field for additional studies, and one example of such phenomena was reported recently by Fisher and Szwarc."

https://openalex.org/W2069921171,"Marked increases in interstitial salinity occur in two drill holes located in the Gulf of Mexico at a water depth of more than 3500 meters. The increases probably arose through diffusion of salt from buried evaporites. In one hole, however, brackish water was encountered on penetrating the oil-permeated cap rock of a salt dome. The phenomenon is attributed to production of fresh water during oxidation of petroleum hydrocarbons and decomposition of gypsum to form native sulfur."

https://openalex.org/W2009813764,When water flows under the edge of a surface film the large viscous shear stress at the edge prevents the film from spreading and raises a ridge on the water surface. Near the top of its downstream flank the ridge has an abrupt change in curvature that we see as a line on the water.

The end point of digestion is indicated by the release of a glass bead, when two pieces of lens paper sealed together by the substrate separate due to its digestion by the enzyme."
