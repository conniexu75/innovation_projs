https://openalex.org/W2026263038,"Paired helical filaments (PHF), which constitute a distinct type of pathological neuronal fiber, are the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles that occur in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Their insolubility in sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea has prevented the analysis of their subunit composition by gel electrophoresis. A monoclonal antibody (DF2) was isolated that specifically labeled PHF at both the light and electron microscopic levels. It labeled a small polypeptide (5 kilodaltons) that was shown to be ubiquitin in immunoblots of the soluble fraction of brain homogenates. To obtain direct evidence that ubiquitin is a component of PHF, PHF were treated with concentrated formic acid and digested with lysylendopeptidase; ubiquitin-derived peptides were then identified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Two fragments in the PHF digest were identified as derived from ubiquitin by protein sequencing. This procedure should make possible definitive identification of other PHF components."
https://openalex.org/W2073946289,"Conjugation of ubiquitin to intracellular proteins mediates their selective degradation in eukaryotes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, four distinct ubiquitin-coding loci have been described. UBI1, UBI2, and UBI3 each encode hybrid proteins in which ubiquitin is fused to unrelated sequences. The fourth gene, UBI4, contains five ubiquitin-coding elements in a head-to-tail arrangement, and thus encodes a polyubiquitin precursor protein. A precise, oligonucleotide-directed deletion of UBI4 was constructed in vitro and substituted in the yeast genome in place of the wild-type allele. ubi4 deletion mutants are viable as vegetative cells, grow at wild-type rates, and contain wild-type levels of free ubiquitin under exponential growth conditions. However, although ubi4/UBI4 diploids can form four initially viable spores, the two ubi4 spores within the ascus lose viability extremely rapidly, apparently a novel phenotype in yeast. Furthermore, ubi4/ubi4 diploids are sporulation-defective. ubi4 mutants are also hypersensitive to high temperatures, starvation, and amino acid analogs. These three conditions, while diverse in nature, are all known to induce stress proteins. Expression of the UBI4 gene is similarly induced by either heat stress or starvation. These results indicate that UBI4 is specifically required for the resistance of cells to stress, and that ubiquitin is an essential component of the stress response system."
https://openalex.org/W1495239533,"Previous studies have shown that the region of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) responsible for receptor binding resides in the amino-terminal fragment (ATF, residues 1-135) (Stoppelli, M.P., Corti, A., Soffientini, A., Cassani, G., Blasi, F., and Assoian, R.K. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 82, 4939-4943). The area within ATF responsible for specific receptor binding has now been identified by the ability of different synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the amino terminus of uPA to inhibit receptor binding of 125I-labeled ATF. A peptide corresponding to human [Ala19]uPA-(12-32) resulted in 50% inhibition of ATF binding at 100 nM. Peptides uPA-(18-32) and [Ala13]uPA-(9-20) inhibit at 100 and 2000 microM, respectively. The human peptide uPA-(1-14) and the mouse peptide [Ala20]uPA-(13-33) have no effect on ATF receptor binding. This region of uPA is referred to as the growth factor module since it shares partial amino acid sequence homology (residues 14-33) to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Furthermore, this region of EGF is responsible for binding of EGF to its receptor (Komoriya, A. Hortsch, M., Meyers, C., Smith, M., Kanety, H., and Schlessinger, J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1351-1355). However, EGF does not inhibit ATF receptor binding. Comparison of the sequences responsible for receptor binding of uPA and EGF indicate that the region of highest homology is between residues 13-19 and 14-20 of human uPA and EGF, respectively. In addition, there is a conservation of the spacings of four cysteines in this module whereas there is no homology between residues 20-30 and 21-33 of uPA and EGF. Thus, residues 20-30 of uPA apparently confer receptor binding specificity, and residues 13-19 provide the proper conformation to the adjacent binding region."
https://openalex.org/W1993686365,"We have characterized regulatory regions of the human IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL2Rα) promoter. 5′ deletion constructs extending to −327 directed CAT expression in HTLV-I-infected T cells, which express IL2Rα constitutively, and in Jurkat cells, which express IL2Rα only after induction. Deletions to −267 and −265 were active only in HTLV-I-transformed T cells, but their activity in Jurkat cells was restored by cotransfection of a construct expressing the HTLV-I transactivator protein (tat-I). However, HTLV-I-infected human osteosarcoma cells do not express IL2Rα-CAT constructs. Thus cell-type-specific factors are required for IL2Rα expression, and direct or indirect interaction(s) between tat-I and a specific region of the IL2Rα promoter may cause altered regulation. Tat-I also augments IL2-CAT expression under some conditions, suggesting possible autocrine or paracrine mechanisms for HTLV-I-induced leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2011498074,"Molecular analysis of the KAR1 gene of yeast has shown that it is required for both mitosis and conjugation. The gene was originally identified by mutations that prevent nuclear fusion. By in vitro mutagenesis and gene replacement we have demonstrated that the gene is an essential cell division cycle gene. Temperature-sensitive mutant strains show defects in spindle pole body duplication and chromosome disjunction. Overproduction of the gene product blocks spindle pole body duplication, producing a cell cycle arrest phenotype similar to that of the Kar- temperature-sensitive mutations. Long, aberrant extranuclear microtubules are formed in the temperature-sensitive mutants arrested at the nonpermissive temperature as well as in kar1-1 during conjugation. These observations suggest that the KAR1 gene is required for the normal function of both the intranuclear and extranuclear microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1982375617,"To determine the structural features responsible for the curvature of kinetoplast DNA, we studied 13 adenine tracts in Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast DNA. The structures of the A tracts were analyzed by cutting the DNA with hydroxyl radical. Reactivity of hydroxyl radical toward the DNA backbone progressively decreased in the 5'----3' direction of each A tract. The cutting pattern of the T-rich strand was offset by 1 or 2 bp from the pattern on the A-rich strand. An A tract in a restriction fragment from plasmid pBR322 had the same cutting pattern as the kinetoplast A tracts. We interpret these experiments to show that in A tracts the width of the minor groove decreases smoothly from the 5'----3' end of the A tract."
https://openalex.org/W2130316073,"We show that the HAP1 protein binds in vitro to the upstream activation site (UAS) of the yeast CYC7 gene. Strikingly, this sequence bears no obvious similarity to the sequence bound by HAP1 at UAS1 of the CYC1 gene. The CYC1 and CYC7 sites compete for binding to HAP1 and have comparable affinities for the protein. The gross features of the interaction of HAP1 with the two sites are similar: multiple major and minor groove contacts, spanning 23 bp, on one helical face, with a back-side major groove contact toward one end. The precise positions of the contacts differ, however. A mutant form of HAP1, HAP1–18, abolishes the ability of the protein to bind to UAS1 but not CYC7 DNA. Possible mechanisms for how a single protein recognizes two sequences are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1544869976,"The superoxide-forming NADPH oxidase of human neutrophils was studied in subcellular fractions of unstimulated cells. Purified neutrophils were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and separated on Percoll density gradients into four fractions: alpha, azurophil granules; beta, mostly specific granules; gamma, plasma membrane, and cytosol. NADPH-dependent O2-. formation by these fractions was quantitated as the rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. In the presence of cytosol, NADPH, and either arachidonic acid (optimum 90 microM) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (optimum 160 microM), 70-75% of the oxidase was in the beta fraction and about 25% was in the gamma fraction. A similar distribution was found for cytochrome b559 and FAD, two putative components of the oxidase. The reaction rates observed with arachidonic acid activation were sufficient to account for 25-75% of the O2-. generated by intact neutrophils. The properties of the beta and gamma enzymes were similar and closely resembled those of the oxidase in intact neutrophils or disrupted prestimulated cells. These included resistance to azide and cyanide, a pH optimum of 7.4, and a preference for NADPH (Km approximately 40-45 microM) rather than NADH (Km approximately 2.5 mM) as the electron donor. The combination of beta and gamma fractions displayed additive activity. The activatable oxidase required Mg2+ but not Ca2+. ATP was required for maximum reaction rates. When beta and gamma membranes were preincubated with cytosol and arachidonic acid in the presence of millimolar Mg2+ and then ultracentrifuged membrane-bound O2-. -forming activity was recovered in the pellet and the enzyme required only NADPH (i.e. no cytosol, arachidonic acid, or Mg2+) for expression of activity. These data suggest that cytosol contains a Mg2+-dependent oxidase-activating factor. Molecular sieve chromatography of cytosol indicated a single peak of activity (i.e. ability to activate O2-. generation by beta and/or gamma fraction) eluting with molecules of about 10,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W2074007751,"We show that the yeast HAP1 activator locus encodes a protein that binds in vitro to the upstream activation site, UAS1, of the CYC1 gene (iso-1-cytochrome c). Binding of wild-type HAP1 and truncated HAP1 derivatives to UAS1 is evident in crudely fractionated yeast extracts using the gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. The binding of HAP1 in vitro, like the activity of UAS1 in vivo, is stimulated by heme. HAP1 binds to region B, one of two portions of UAS1 shown to be important by genetic analysis of the site. Surprisingly, HAP1 binds to the same sequence as a second factor, RC2. Both HAP1 and RC2 bind to the same side of the helix, and make similar but not identical major and minor groove contacts that span two full turns. An additional factor that binds to the second important part of UAS1, the region A factor (RAF), is also identified. A model depicting the interplay of HAP1, RC2, and RAF in the control of UAS1 is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1531564543,"The role of guanine nucleotides in insulin secretion was investigated in electrically permeabilized RINm5F cells. Ca2+ stimulated insulin release (EC50 approximately 2 microM Ca2+). The GTP stable analog, GTP gamma S, elicited insulin secretion at vanishingly low Ca2+ concentrations (less than 10(-11) M), slightly potentiated the response to intermediate Ca2+ levels, but exerted less than additive effects at maximal Ca2+ concentrations. The GDP analog, GDP beta S, inhibited both GTP gamma S- and Ca2+-stimulated secretion. The action of GTP gamma S was not mediated by cAMP, as the latter only enhanced Ca2+-induced secretion. In contrast, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, promoted insulin release at nonstimulatory Ca2+ levels as well as potentiating the Ca2+ response. GTP analogs stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2), as assessed by inositol phosphate generation. However, this could not fully explain guanine nucleotide-induced secretion because: GTP gamma S-stimulated PtdInsP2 breakdown was totally dependent on Ca2+ and abolished at Ca2+ below 10(-11) M; at these Ca2+ levels, activators of protein kinase C were weak or ineffective secretagogues; the GTP analog Gpp(NH)p was much less effective than GTP gamma S in activating PtdInsP2 hydrolysis, while fully mimicking the effect on Ca2+-independent secretion. Both GTP gamma S-induced PtdInsP2 hydrolysis and insulin release were insensitive to pertussis toxin and cholera toxin. The findings point to a guanine nucleotide-regulated site in the activation of insulin secretion different from the known transmembrane signalling systems."
https://openalex.org/W1975337504,"E. coli rho factor can unwind a short RNA-DNA duplex in vitro. The duplex is formed between a polylinker sequence at the 3' end of RNA derived from the rho-dependent terminator trp t' and the complementary sequence in a single-strand DNA molecule. Release of trp t' RNA from the duplex requires nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by rho's NTPase activity and is dependent on rho recognition of the RNA that is 5' to the RNA-DNA duplex region. The direction of helix unwinding appears to be 5' to 3' along the RNA molecule. These characteristics now account for how the RNA-binding and RNA-dependent NTP hydrolysis activities of rho may participate directly in transcription termination. Our results suggest that NTP hydrolysis is utilized to help unwind the RNA-DNA duplex at the 3' end of a nascent transcript, facilitating RNA release from the DNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1496239188,"Increasing the intracellular flux of O-2 by incubating aerobic Escherichia coli with paraquat or plumbagin markedly lowered the alpha, beta-dihydroxyisovalerate dehydratase activity detectable in extracts from these cells. This effect was not seen in the absence of dioxygen and was exacerbated by inhibiting protein biosynthesis with chloramphenicol. These effects of paraquat and of plumbagin were both time- and concentration-dependent. Transfer of E. coli from aerobic to anaerobic conditions caused a rebound of the dehydratase activity, in the continued presence of paraquat and of chloramphenicol, indicating the presence of a mechanism for reactivating this enzyme. The instability of the dehydratase activity in cell extracts was exacerbated by selective removal of superoxide dismutase, but not of catalase, by immunoprecipitation. Addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase reversed the effect of immunoprecipitation; whereas catalase or inactive superoxide dismutase were ineffective. We conclude that the dehydratase is inactivated by O-2. This could account for the bacteriostatic effects of dioxygen and of paraquat."
https://openalex.org/W1591452120,"We have located presumptive chromosomal loop anchorage elements within the mouse heavy chain immunoglobulin locus. Analysis of 31 kilobases spanning diversity, joining, enhancer, switch, and the mu and delta constant regions reveals that only a single 1-kilobase segment exhibits specific binding to nuclear matrices. It is of particular significance that the transcriptional enhancer element resides within this matrix association region (MAR). Fine structure mapping indicates that binding is mediated by A+T-rich approximately 350-base pair segments that reside on either side of the enhancer. The MAR sequences residing 5' of the enhancer contain topoisomerase II consensus sequences like the MAR located upstream of the kappa light chain gene enhancer. The heavy chain gene MARs, however, exhibit a lower affinity for matrix association compared to the kappa gene MAR. Significantly, the juxtaposition of enhancer elements with MARs appears to be evolutionarily conserved within the immunoglobulin genes, suggesting that MARs may act as positive and/or negative regulators of enhancer function."
https://openalex.org/W2001429874,"The LDL receptor, which mediates the cellular uptake of cholesterol, is subject to classic end-product repression when cholesterol accumulates in the cell. We here show that the sensitivity to end-product repression depends upon a 42 bp element in the 5'-flanking region of the human LDL receptor gene. This sequence, designated sterol regulatory element 42 (SRE 42), contains two 16 bp direct repeats that exhibit positive and negative transcriptional activities. Cells transfected with a fusion gene containing SRE 42 inserted into the promoter of the herpes simplex viral TK gene produced abundant mRNA when grown without sterols. When sterols were present, the mRNA was reduced by 57%-95%, depending on the number of copies of SRE in the fusion gene. These transfection data plus DNAase I footprinting experiments suggest a model of end-product repression in which the end product (sterols) opposes the action of a positive transcription factor that binds to a discrete promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W1518719712,"Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, is known to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization and Na+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The fact that the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, amiloride, blocks angiotensin II-stimulated Na+ influx and is itself a vasodilator suggests that Na+/H+ exchange may play a role in the angiotensin II-mediated effects on VSMC. We have used a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye to study Na+/H+ exchange in cultured rat aortic VSMC. Basal intracellular pH was 7.08 in physiological saline buffer. Angiotensin II stimulation caused an initial transient acidification, followed by a Na+-dependent alkalinization. Angiotensin II increased the rate of alkalinization with apparent threshold, half-maximal, and maximal effect of 0.01, 3, and 100 nM, respectively. Angiotensin II stimulation appeared to be mediated by a shift in the Km of the Na+/H+ exchanger for extracellular Na+. Since angiotensin II activates phospholipase C in VSMC, we tested the possibility that angiotensin II increased Na+/H+ exchange by activation of protein kinase C via stimulation of diacylglycerol formation. The phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), stimulated Na+/H+ exchange in VSMC cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium, and the subsequent angiotensin II response was inhibited. However, VSMC grown in serum and treated for 24 h with TPA to decrease protein kinase C activity showed no inhibition of angiotensin II-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange. TPA caused no intracellular alkalinization of VSMC grown in serum, while the angiotensin II response was actually enhanced compared to VSMC deprived of serum for 24 h. We conclude that angiotensin II stimulates an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange system in cultured VSMC which is mediated by protein kinase C-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Angiotensin II-mediated Na+ influx and intracellular alkalinization may play a role in excitation-response coupling in vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1566173303,"We have identified tyrosine 122 of the A subunit of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase as the tyrosine that becomes covalently bound to DNA when the enzyme breaks the phosphodiester bonds of DNA. The covalent gyrase X DNA complex was isolated following cleavage of the DNA by gyrase in the presence of the gyrase inhibitor oxolinic acid. The active site tyrosine was first mapped to two overlapping peptides. Its precise position in the sequence of the A subunit of gyrase was then determined by sequencing of a peptide bound to DNA. We also present a method for mapping sites of DNA attachment in a protein of known amino acid sequence. The covalent complex of DNA and protein is treated with proteases that cut specifically. The electrophoretic mobilities of the resulting peptide-bound DNA molecules are correlated with the sizes of the bound peptides, allowing determination of the site of attachment of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1557907474,"The effect of pertussis toxin treatment was studied on the inhibitory effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on adenylate cyclase activity in rat aorta. The incubation of rat aorta washed particles with pertussis toxin and [alpha-32P]NAD resulted in the ADP-ribosylation of a single 40-kDa protein. In addition, pertussis toxin treatment enhanced guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities and attenuated the ANF-mediated inhibition of basal, isoproterenol-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. These data suggest that ANF receptors are coupled to adenylate cyclase through inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1564289759,"Abstract The wild-type yeast nuclear gene, PIS, encodes phosphatidylinositol synthase (CDPdiacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11) (Nikawa, J., and Yamashita, S. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 143, 251-256). We now report the sequence of the cloned 2, 129-base pair DNA and the location of the PIS coding region within the sequence. The PIS coding frame is capable of encoding 220 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 24,823. On Northern blot analysis, an RNA species that hybridized with the coding region was detected in the total poly(A)+ RNA of the wild-type yeast. The primary translation product contains a region showing local sequence homology with yeast phosphatidylserine synthase (EC 2.7.8.8) and Escherichia coli 3-phosphatidyl-1'-glycerol-3'-phosphate synthase (EC 2.7.8.5), suggesting that these three enzymes are evolutionarily related. The PIS gene was disrupted in vitro through insertion of the yeast HIS3 gene into the coding region. A heterozygous diploid, PIS/pis::HIS3, constructed from a PIS/PIS his3/his3 diploid by replacing one of the wild-type PIS genes with the disrupted PIS gene, showed no segregation of viable His+ spores on tetrad analysis, indicating that disruption of the PIS gene is lethal. The nonviable spores were in an arrested state with a characteristic terminal phenotype, suggesting that the function of the PIS gene is essential for progression of the yeast cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1598093499,"Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, increases free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by release of nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores and stimulates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx, presumably via Na+/H+ exchange. We recently have found that the angiotensin II-mediated change in VSMC intracellular pH has two components, an early rapid acidification phase and a slower recovery phase involving Na+-dependent alkalinization. In the present study, we show that the early acidification is not mediated via Na+/H+ exchange. Instead, we propose a mechanism which involves increases in [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ efflux with a subsequent rise in intracellular H+. Agonists, in addition to angiotensin II, which increase [Ca2+]i in cultured VSMC, including platelet-derived growth factor, vasopressin, and bradykinin, induce an acidification, while agonists which fail to raise [Ca2+]i do not. The time course and magnitude of agonist-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux correlate with the acidification response. The angiotensin II concentration-response relationship for acidification and Ca2+ mobilization are similar. Furthermore, inhibition of changes in [Ca2+]i by treatment with phorbol ester, cyclic GMP, or quin2 loading prevent agonist-mediated acidification. The effects of altering extracellular [Ca2+] and [H+] on agonist-mediated intracellular acidification and H+ efflux suggest that the acidification is due to ATP-dependent unidirectional H+ influx, perhaps via the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, and not to a Ca2+/H+ antiport. This agonist-mediated acidification represents a previously undescribed ionic event in VSMC activation which may be involved in excitation-response coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1574239487,"Abstract To determine whether multiple forms of the Na+,K+-ATPase beta subunit exist in rat kidney and brain, we constructed cDNA libraries from both tissues and isolated clones carrying inserts coding for this subunit. Characterization of these cDNAs by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing suggests that a single form of the beta subunit protein is present in these tissues. We did, however, find that the beta subunit was encoded by multiple mRNAs which can be grouped into classes based on the lengths of their 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Size variation at the 3' end is due to the use of at least two of the five potential polyadenylation sites, whereas variation at the 5' end appears to be due to the use of different initiation sites. Northern blot analysis demonstrates the presence of multiple mRNA species which correlate with the sizes observed for the different cDNA classes and also demonstrates that the larger mRNA species are present at different levels in kidney and brain. S1 and primer extension analyses suggest that the observed tissue differences in the expression of these mRNAs are due to transcription from multiple initiation sites, whose strength is tissue-dependent. In the 3' untranslated region, comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the rat beta subunit cDNAs to those from other species reveals regions of high sequence similarity."
https://openalex.org/W1571424022,"An experimental arrangement was described that enables nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of compressed plant cells to be recorded while circulating a medium through the sample. The system provided a convenient arrangement for monitoring by 31P NMR the behavior of plant cells over a long period of time under different conditions such as sucrose starvation. Perfusion of compressed sycamore cells with sucrose-free culture medium triggered a progressive decrease in the glucose 6-P and uridine-5'-diphosphate-alpha-D-glucose resonances over 30 h. When almost all the intracellular carbohydrate pool had disappeared the nucleotide triphosphate resonances decline progressively. These changes were accompanied by a Pi accumulation in the vacuole and a phosphorylcholine (P-choline) accumulation in the cytoplasm. The very long lag phase observed for ATP and P-choline evolution was comparable with that observed for the progressive intracellular digestion of cytoplasmic constituents (Journet, E., Bligny, R. and Douce, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3193-3199). Addition of sucrose in the circulating system after a long period of sucrose starvation led to a disappearance of the cytoplasmic Pi resonance and a marked increase in that of glucose 6-P. Under these conditions the vacuolar Pi pool did not fluctuate to buffer the Pi in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that Pi which has been sequestered in the vacuole during the course of sucrose starvation is not restored to the cytoplasm for rapid metabolic processes. Furthermore, the presence of P-choline in plant cells in large excess should be considered as a good marker of membrane utilization after a long period of sucrose starvation and is very likely related to stress."
https://openalex.org/W1548284562,"We have investigated the vitellogenin (VTG) receptor system in Xenopus oocytes since these cells are specialized for endocytosis. Oocytes have between 0.2 and 3 X 10(11) receptors per 1-mm cell. There is only a single class of receptors of low affinity (1.3 X 10(-6) M at 22 degrees C and 2-4 X 10(-6) M at 0 degree C), but high specificity (less than 5% nonspecific binding at 2 X 10(-6) M). The specific internalization rate of the VTG receptor (around 2 X 10(-3) s-1) is first order, highly variable, and at the upper end of the range of values reported for mammalian cells. The receptor association rate constant (9.6 X 10(2) M-1 s-1) is extremely low although the dissociation rate constant was immeasurable. Calcium is required for VTG binding, and low pH does not dissociate the VTG-receptor complex. Monensin treatment at 100 microM caused the loss of surface receptors with a t1/2 of 3 h and the accumulation of internalized ligand in a pre-lysosomal endocytic compartment. Conversely, the recovery of surface VTG receptors that were removed with trypsin occurred with a t1/2 of about 2 h. These observations indicate that oocytes have very large intracellular pools of receptors and that although surface receptors are internalized on the time scale of minutes, the intracellular pool is recycled on the time scale of hours."
https://openalex.org/W1549618031,"alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) causes an increase in tyrosinase activity (O-diphenol-O2 oxidoreductase; EC 1.14.18.1) in Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cell cultures following a lag period of approximately 9 h. Treatment of cells with 2 × 10(-7)M alpha-MSH for 6 days results in a 90-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. The hormone-mediated increase in tyrosinase activity is dependent upon continued transcription since the enzyme induction is suppressed by either cordycepin (1 microgram/ml) or alpha-amanitin (10 micrograms/ml). Immunoprecipitation analysis of pulse-labeled tyrosinase from control and MSH-treated cultures (48-h exposure) has demonstrated that MSH stimulates tyrosinase synthesis by approximately 4-fold, a level of induction which does not correspond to the observed 14-fold increase in enzyme activity. When immunotitration curves were developed from cell extracts of control and MSH-treated cultures using immunoprecipitation and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocols, evidence for the presence of immunologically active but catalytically less active enzyme in untreated melanoma cell cultures was demonstrated. Degradation rates of tyrosinase were found to be similar in control cultures or in cells treated with MSH for up to 48 h. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to stimulating tyrosinase synthesis, MSH may also promote an increase in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582769290,"The cross-linking agent ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidyl succinate) was used to covalently link 125I-labeled gastrin releasing peptide (125I-GRP) to an Mr 75,000-85,000 surface protein in Swiss 3T3 cells that displays many characteristics of a specific receptor for peptides of the bombesin family. This protein was not present in other cell lines which do not exhibit receptors for bombesin-like peptides. Unlabeled GRP competed for affinity labeling of the Mr 75,000-85,000 protein in a concentration-dependent manner, and other bombesin-related peptides also inhibited the cross-linking of 125I-GRP to this component. In contrast, high concentrations of a variety of other peptide hormones and mitogens had no effect. Affinity labeling of the Mr 75,000-85,000 protein was dependent on the concentration of 125I-GRP and exhibited saturability. 125I-GRP affinity labeling of this protein was also demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These studies suggest that an Mr 75,000-85,000 surface protein with an isoelectric point of 6.0 to 6.5 is a major component of the receptor for peptides of the bombesin family in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2139798079,"gamma delta resolvase, a transposon-encoded protein active in site-specific recombination, induces a structural change in the DNA at the recombinational crossover point that results in enhanced intercalation of the foot-printing reagent MPE X Fe(II). The structural change correlates with the formation of a bend in the DNA: a mutant resolvase that binds to the crossover site but induces little or no bend does not promote intercalation. The properties of the mutant protein suggest that the induced structural change, which we propose is a localized kink, is required for recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1947794470,"This study investigated fluctuations of cytosolic pH (pHi) of cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in reaction to metabolic alterations induced by angiotensin II (AII). Serially passed VSMCs from Wistar rat aortae were grown on coverslips and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator 2‘,7‘-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. A biphasic reaction was seen after exposure of these cells to AII (1 nM to 1 microM); an initial and relatively brief phase of acidification was followed by sustained alkalinization. The rate of acidification and magnitude of alkalinization were dose-dependent. This biphasic effect of AII was also demonstrated in Ca2+-free medium and was mimicked by subjecting VSMCs to the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 microM) in Ca2+-containing medium but not in Ca2+-free medium. Verapamil (10 microM) almost entirely eliminated the AII-induced acidification, whereas amiloride analogues 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (100 microM) as well as Na+-deficient medium abolished the subsequent (alkalinization) phase produced by the hormone. Activation of the Na+/H+ antiport by subjecting VSMCs to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM) prevented a subsequent effect of AII on the pHi profile. This resistance to a further action of the hormone was not mediated via cytoplasmic alkalinization. AII produced a dramatic redistribution in the cellular compartments of 45Ca2+ associated with accelerated 45Ca2+ washout. These findings suggest that the AII-induced acidification phase may relate to activation of the Ca2+ pump (Ca2+/H+ exchange) and that this process can take place in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The alkalinization phase is the consequence of stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport, which in cultured VSMCs can be activated by a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ as well as other mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2015204307,"We have previously characterized a cell line transformed by a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, SE21Q1b, which contains a mutation preventing encapsidation of genomic RNA. A unique property of this mutant is that cellular RNAs are packaged into virions, even in the presence of replication-competent virus. In the current study, SE21Q1b quail cells were transfected with the plasmids pRSVneo or pCMVneo. Virions produced by SE21Q1b neoR clones contained neo RNA, and when virus from some SE21Q1b neoR clones was used to infect a chemically transformed quail cell line, QT35, neoR QT35 clones were obtained that contained single integrated copies of the neo gene. An intron inserted into pRSVneo was removed during gene transfer. These data are consistent with transfer of neo mRNAs by a pathway involving reverse transcription of mRNA encapsidated within SE21Q1b virions, and integration of resultant cDNAs into the genome of infected QT35 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1625313056,"Gangliosides have profound modulatory effects on protein phosphorylation in brain. A protein kinase activated directly by gangliosides has been partially purified from the particulate fractions of guinea pig brain through extraction with nonionic detergent, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, and gel filtration. This novel ganglioside-stimulated protein kinase is distinct from cAMP-dependent, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases. The partially purified kinase preparation could undergo ganglioside-stimulated autophosphorylation of a major phosphoprotein with Mr corresponding to 68,000. It also could phosphorylate exogenous substrates such as the synthetic peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala Ser-Leu-Gly. The requirement of gangliosides for the activation of kinase activity is dose-dependent and specific. Among the various gangliosides tested, GT1b and GD1a were found to be the most potent activators, whereas GD1b and GM1 were slightly less effective. The activation process is rapid and does not require the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of gangliosides is not mediated through limited proteolysis or Ca2+-glycolipid complexes. Although the exact physiological significance of the ganglioside-stimulated protein kinase is not known at present, it is possible that certain functions related to gangliosides in the nervous system are mediated through the activation of this novel enzyme."

It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is characterized by variable expressivity and late age-of-onset. Linkage studies have established the locus on chromosome 19. In order to identify tightly linked probes for diagnosis as well as to define in detail the DM gene region, chromosome 19 libraries were constructed and screened for restriction fragment length polymorphisms tightly linked to DM. A genomic clone, LDR152 (D19S19), was isolated that is tightly linked to DM; recombination fraction = 0.0 (95% confidence limits 0.0-0.03); lod score, 15.4."
https://openalex.org/W1982266866,"A mutation in the white gene of Drosophila mauritiana that results from insertion of the transposable element mariner is genetically unstable in both germ cells and somatic cells. Somatic instability is indicated by the occurrence of animals having mosaic eyes with patches of pigmented cells on a peach-colored background. Normally uncommon, the frequency of mosaicism is so greatly enhanced in a particular mutant strain that virtually every animal in the strain is an eye-color mosaic. The molecular basis of the mosaicism is the excision of the mariner element from its location in the DNA of the white gene in somatic cells. The phenomenon results from a single dominant genetic factor located in chromosome 3. Genetic control over the excision of transposable elements may play a role in determining the persistence of transposable elements in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1596697139,"The catalytic subunit of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase (Damuni, Z., Merryfield, M.L., Humphreys, J.S., and Reed, L.J., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 4335-4338) has been purified over 50,000-fold from extracts of bovine kidney mitochondria. The apparently homogeneous protein consists of a single polypeptide chain with an apparent Mr = approximately 33,000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. BCKDH phosphatase, with an apparent Mr = 460,000, was dissociated to its catalytic subunit with no apparent change in activity, at an early stage in the purification procedure by treatment with 6 M urea. The specific activity of the catalytic subunit was 1,500-2,500 units/mg. The catalytic subunit exhibited approximately 10% maximal activity with 32P-labeled pyruvate dehydrogenase complex but was inactive with phosphorylase a and with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The catalytic subunit, like the Mr = 460,000 species, was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of BCKDH phosphatase inhibitor protein, was unaffected by protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2, and was inhibited by nucleoside tri- and diphosphates but not by nucleoside monophosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1533026352,"Abstract The specific binding of radiolabeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) to intact rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2) cells was followed for 24 h. In the presence of 0.5-1.5 nM 1,25(OH)2D3, hormone binding increased over a period of 12 h, from 1.1 X 10(4) to 1.3 X 10(5) receptors/cell. The elevated level of hormone binding persisted through 24 h provided that the initial concentration of hormone was maintained. The concentration dependence of this increase in receptor level was centered between 10 and 30 pM 1,25(OH)2D3, and the binding at 12 h exhibited the metabolite specificity expected for a 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. The t 1/2 values for the disappearance of unoccupied and occupied receptors were roughly the same, approximately 2.7 h; therefore, the increase in hormone binding was not due to receptor stabilization. In comparison, hormone-receptor complexes appeared to dissociate with a t 1/2 of 1 h. alpha-Amanitin treatment reduced the magnitude of receptor accumulation by 50-60%, indicating that mRNA synthesis was required to achieve the maximal response. Ligand-dependent regulation of cellular receptor levels provides a mechanism for amplifying the primary hormonal signal and is predicted to influence the kinetics, magnitude, and dose dependence of cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1608904857,"Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of a 1.8-kilobase DNA fragment containing the cell cycle-regulated thymidylate synthase gene (TMP 1) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. This analysis has revealed a 912-base pair open reading frame which encodes a 304-amino acid residue protein with a calculated Mr of 35,007. The tmp1-6 and cdc21-1 mutant alleles of this gene also have been sequenced, and both show single base pair changes which would result in different amino acid substitutions. The amino acid sequence of the yeast thymidylate synthase gene derived from the DNA sequence shows considerable homology when compared with the human, mouse, Herpesvirus saimiri, Leishmania major, Leishmania tropica, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, bacteriophage T4, and Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3T enzymes. Northern blot hybridization reveals that the TMP 1 mRNA is a 1.15-kilobase polyadenylated transcript. A set of consensus yeast mRNA splice sequences appears within the open reading frame of TMP 1, but S1 nuclease protection experiments reveal that splicing of the mRNA does not occur. Disruption of the gene by the introduction of a large insertion did not produce any defect besides the expected dependence on dTMP for growth. Specifically, the viability of the mutants in the presence of dTMP indicates that the protein does not play a significant structural role in a complex of replication enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1664582989,"Several T-cell functions are controlled by the regulatory peptide interleukin 2 (IL-2). Binding of IL-2 with specific receptors has been well documented, but the molecular mechanism by which IL-2/IL-2 receptor interaction is transduced is not known. We have found that treatment of IL-2-dependent T-cell lines with IL-2 is followed by a rapid stimulation of inositol phospholipid metabolism, as determined by isotopic methodology employing myo-[1,2-3H]inositol. Increased incorporation of the metabolic precursor into phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, together with the appearance of radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, occurred within minutes of treatment with IL-2 of factor-dependent CT6 cells. Analysis of labeled water-soluble compounds from prelabeled cells indicated a rapid (within 1 min) stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis following IL-2 treatment. Increased recovery of [3H] inositol phosphates and appearance of [3H]inositol trisphosphate were observed after treatment with IL-2 of CT6 cells, as well as of a second IL-2-dependent cell line, CTB6. These findings suggests that inositol phospholipid-derived metabolites (i.e. diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate) may be part of the mechanism by which certain IL-2 signals are transduced."
https://openalex.org/W1902044850,"Abstract The binding of 125I-labeled human hemopexin to human leukemia HL60 cell at 4 degrees C was saturable with time and with increasing concentrations of 125I-hemopexin. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed the presence of approximately 42,000 binding sites/cell with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.0 X 10(-9) M. When cells were incubated with radioactive hemopexin at 37 degrees C, 125I-hemopexin was rapidly bound and then was dissociated after the release of heme. Treatment of surface-bound 125I-hemopexin with divalent lysine-directed cross-linking disuccinimidyl suberate revealed a membrane polypeptide of about 80,000 Da, to which hemopexin is cross-linked. To examine the fate of the internalized heme, lysates from the cells previously incubated with [59Fe]heme-hemopexin complex were analyzed by CM-cellulose and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography. A considerable amount of the radioactivity was present in the fraction which co-eluted with the myeloperoxidase activity. When myeloperoxidase was isolated from the cells incubated with [59Fe]heme-hemopexin complex by immunoprecipitation with anti-myeloperoxidase antibody, radiolabeled iron associated with myeloperoxidase increased with time, and more than 30% of the radioactivity in the cells was present in the myeloperoxidase. These results indicate that the binding of hemopexin to the surface receptors triggers a release of heme and that this heme is incorporated into the intracellular myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1521881983,"Abstract Gelsolin is one of many binding proteins which regulate the structure of intracellular microfilaments. A secretory form of gelsolin, a protein also known as actin depolymerizing factor or brevin, is present in animal sera. In the present studies, we: demonstrate that a 90-kDa secretory protein produced by chicken gizzard smooth muscle is serum gelsolin; show that chicken serum gelsolin, as compared with its mammalian counterparts, lacks 26 amino acid residues at its NH2-terminal end; show that gizzard smooth muscle devotes on the order of 100 times more of its total protein synthetic effort (about 1% of the total) to the production of serum gelsolin than does liver, a previously speculated major source of this protein; and give evidence that rat tissues which are rich in smooth muscle cells (blood vessels, uterine muscle) also produce serum gelsolin. Our work suggests that, in vivo, smooth muscle-containing tissues may be major producers of the serum form of this binding protein."

This fragment seems to be responsible for not only cell-specific but also lymphokine-induced expression of the IL-2 receptor gene as assessed by DNA transfection. The same DNA fragment directed cell-specific transcription of the IL-2 receptor gene in extract of HTLV-I-infected T cells, MT-1, but not of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, CESS. The addition of small amounts of MT-1 extract to CESS extract resulted in specific expression of the IL-2 receptor gene, indicating that cell-specific expression is regulated by trans-acting molecules in MT-1 extract."
https://openalex.org/W1516815059,"cDNA fusions were employed to construct a 35-kDa hybrid protein bearing the amino-terminal signal sequence of pre-ornithine carbamoyltransferase (pOCT), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, fused to the carboxyl-terminal half of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G). Following transcription-translation in vitro, the hybrid protein was imported by purified mitochondria and processed at its amino terminus by the matrix processing enzyme. The protein, however, remained anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane, apparently in a transmembrane configuration, via the hydrophobic VSV G stop-transfer domain; a small portion (approximately 2 kDa) of the G protein fragment was accessible to protease digestion only after selective permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane with digitonin, a finding consistent with localization of the extreme carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of G in the intermembrane space. The results demonstrate that the membrane-anchor domain of VSV G can function in a post-translational manner and can operate in membranes other than those derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, it appears to be selectively recognized as a stop-transfer signal by the translocation machinery of the mitochondrial inner, rather than outer, membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1560646479,"F9 teratocarcinoma cells contain a cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) that may mediate the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of this cell line. Specific [3H]retinoic acid binding to CRABP in F9 stem cell cytosol is protein-dependent, reaches equilibrium within 4 h at 4 degrees C, and yields 643 +/- 105 fmol of [3H]retinoic acid per mg of protein with an apparent dissociation constant of 9.2 +/- 1.1 nM. When F9 stem cells are grown in the presence of either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or sodium butyrate, CRABP activity is stimulated 2-4-fold. The effect of these drugs on CRABP activity is both time and concentration-dependent, resulting in an increase in the number of binding sites for [3H]retinoic acid with no change in their affinity. The new [3H]retinoic acid-binding sites have a sedimentation coefficient of 2 S and are not displaced by excess retinol. When F9 stem cells are grown in the presence of cyclic 8-bromo-AMP or cholera toxin, no increase in CRABP activity is observed. We conclude that the stimulation of CRABP activity by dibutyryl cyclic AMP may result from the action of butyrate. In addition, the stimulation of retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation by cyclic AMP analogs (Strickland, S., Smith, K.K., and Marotti, K.R. (1980) Cell 21, 347-355) and the inhibition of this differentiation by butyrate (Levine R. A., Campisi, J., Wang, S.-Y., and Gudas, L. J. (1984) Dev. Biol. 105, 443-450) are not correlated with increases or decreases, respectively, in the level of CRABP activity."

Half-maximal stimulation, 1.5- to 3-fold at pH 7.0-7.3, occurred at 0.5 mM spermine. Protein phosphatase SP exhibited an apparent Mr = 140,000-170,000 as estimated by gel-filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. Two major subunits, with apparent Mr = 60,000 and 34,000, were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel-permeation chromatography of protein phosphatase SP on Sephacryl S-200 in the presence of 6 M urea and 1.4 M NaCl increased its activity 3- to 6-fold and was accompanied by conversion to the catalytic subunit with an apparent Mr = approximately 34,000. Protein phosphatase SP was inactive with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and was not inhibited by protein phosphatase inhibitor 1, inhibitor 2, or the protein inhibitor of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase phosphatase. Protein phosphatase SP was inhibited by sheep antibody to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A from rabbit skeletal muscle. It appears that protein phosphatase SP is related to protein phosphatase 2A."

It was demonstrated that short chains of polyphosphate serve as primers by using [32P]polyphosphate, 6-80 residues in length for synthesis of long-chain polyphosphate glucokinase, the radiolabel was found to be at the end of the polymer, proving that the mechanism of elongation of polyphosphate by polyphosphate kinase is strictly processive. Only 1 out of 3-8 of the polyphosphate chains contained the primer, indicating that there is a second unknown pathway of initiation which does not involve the polyphosphate primer. The termination of polyphosphate synthesis was investigated. With polyphosphate as a primer, the majority of the synthesized polyphosphate was 750 residues in length. With phosphate, in place of the polyphosphate primer, the major portion was about 2,000 residues in length but there was a large span of chain lengths down to 300. Termination is influenced by pH, temperature, and the concentration of the polyphosphate primer, with the chain length decreasing as either the temperature or the concentration of primer is increased."
https://openalex.org/W1629297288,"Abstract [18O]3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO), labeled at the anomeric oxygen, was prepared by exchange with [18O]H2O and used to follow the route of oxygen transfer during cytidine 5'-monophosphate-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (CMP-KDO) formation catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyl-transferase (CMP-KDO synthetase). The 31P-NMR signal of the phosphoryl group of CMP-KDO (-5.85 ppm), which appeared as a single resonance when CMP-KDO formation took place with unenriched KDO, appeared as two peaks when CMP-KDO formation took place in the presence of a mixture of [16O]-and [18O]KDO. These results demonstrate the retention of 18O during CMP-KDO formation. Confirmation that the labeled oxygen in CMP-KDO was retained in the bridge position between CMP and KDO came from 13C-NMR studies of CMP-KDO formed in the presence of 90% [2-13C, 18O] KDO. The prominent C-2 KDO resonance in CMP-KDO, which is normally a doublet at 101.4 ppm (Kohlbrenner, W.E., and Fesik, S.W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14695-14700), appeared as four peaks when a mixture of [2-13C,16O]- and [2-13C, 18O]KDO was used, confirming the direct bonding of 18O to the C-2 of KDO in CMP-KDO. These results are consistent with a nucleophilic displacement mechanism for CMP-KDO formation."
https://openalex.org/W1564743124,"The accessibility of the tryptophans in dog kidney Na,K-ATPase was studied with the technique of quenching by acrylamide. By use of a modified Stern-Volmer equation, fa, the effective fraction of tryptophans most exposed to quencher, and Ka, the effective quenching constant, were calculated. The direct Stern-Volmer plots are nonlinear under nondenaturing conditions, indicating that the tryptophan residues are unequally accessible to quencher. Modified Stern-Volmer plots revealed marked differences in the exposure of tryptophans in the E1 and E2 states. In the presence of Na or ADP, ligands that stabilize E1, these plots curve downward, indicating that the in addition to buried (unquenched) tryptophans, there is a heterogeneous class of tryptophans. In the presence of K or ouabain, conditions that favor E2, the modified Stern-Volmer plots are linear, consistent with a homogeneous population of tryptophans. Treatment with chymotrypsin to block the E1 to E2 transition results in a new set of quenching parameters which are unchanged with Na or K. Even after detergent denaturation (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 30 min), Stern-Volmer plots are nonlinear, and a significant fraction of tryptophan residues remain inaccessible to quencher. Denaturation with urea or guanidine HCl plus dithiothreitol increases the fraction of quenchable fluorescence even more, but still a small fraction, about 7-13%, is buried. The observed changes in exposure of the tryptophan residues would seem to account for the differences in intrinsic fluorescence seen on adding K and Na to Na,K-ATPase. The present results provide new evidence that a significant rearrangement of amino acid residues results from the E1 to E2 transition. Furthermore, a region of the molecule is inaccessible even after denaturation; this may correspond to highly hydrophobic stretches that are normally buried in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1579743167,"Abstract The ability of 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin (125I-labeled hCG) to bind and stimulate steroidogenesis was studied in light cells (density, 1.053-1.065 g/cm3) and heavier cells (density, 1.090-1.110 g/cm3) purified from collagenase-dispersed rat testicular interstitial cells by unit gravity sedimentation (Bhalla, V.K., Rajan, V.P., Burgett, A.C., and Sohal, G.S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5313-5321). Preferential localization of gonadotropin binding sites was demonstrated on light cells, and the heavier cells produced testosterone in response to hCG without occupancy of high affinity (Kd = 2.02 X 10(-10) M) binding sites. In this study, established methods for interstitial cell purification involving gradient centrifugation were utilized to demonstrate the cell heterogeneity. Light cells bound hCG with high affinity (Kd = 3 X 10(-10) M) without manifestation of steroidogenic response. The heavier cells responded to hCG with elicitation of steroidogenesis, but the occupancy was negligible. Stimulation of steroidogenesis by hCG in heavier cells was dose and time dependent. Dibutyryl and bromo cyclic AMP (1 mM) also promoted steroidogenesis comparable to a level stimulated by the tropic hormone (700% stimulation). The concept of spare receptors was tested in purified cell fractions. Upon cell purification, no saturable high affinity binding sites were observed in the heavier cell fraction. Autoradiographic analyses at the electron microscopical level supported this conclusion. Our data suggest that target cell activation is not preceded by hormone occupancy of high affinity binding sites. A model for defining the functional domains of the physiological receptor for hCG is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1558031976,"Nuclei of substantial purity were isolated from the middle or posterior silk glands of the silkworm Bombyx mori larvae. Both the fibroin H- and L-chain gene sequences in the isolated nuclei from the posterior silk glands of the fifth instar larvae, where the genes are transcribed actively, are extremely sensitive to the digestion with DNaseI; on the other hand, these sequences in the middle silk gland nuclei from the same larvae, where the genes are not expressed, are markedly resistant to the digestion. The H-chain gene sequences in the posterior silk gland nuclei from the fifth instar larvae are also highly susceptible to the digestion with micrococcal nuclease, HinfI, and HhaI. The digestion products with micrococcal nuclease show a continuous size distribution. The H-chain gene sequences in the middle silk gland nuclei or the posterior silk gland nuclei from the fourth molting stage are cleaved partially into nucleosome dimer to oligomer sizes upon digestion with higher concentrations of micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that the inactive forms of the H-chain gene chromatin are constructed by folding of the chromatin fiber containing a regular array of nucleosomes. Hypersensitive sites to micrococcal nuclease are present near both ends of the second exon, a major body of the fibroin H-chain gene, in both the active and inactive forms of the chromatin. The DNaseI or micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of the H-chain gene chromatin in the posterior silk gland nuclei shows periodical changes corresponding to the intermolt-molt-intermolt cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1599549197,"Two testicular interstitial cell fractions, light and heavier, biochemically and morphologically distinct were obtained by a unit gravity sedimentation procedure. Binding sites for 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were preferentially localized in the light cell fraction (apparent Kd = 2.02 X 10(-10) M; Bmax = 1.17 X 10(-5) nmol/2 X 10(6) cells). These cells did not synthesize testosterone in response to hCG, but the basal release of testosterone was higher than by cells in the heavier fraction (2.49 +/- 0.02 ng/2 X 10(6) cells in the light versus 0.22 +/- 0.00 ng/2 X 10(6) cells in the heavier fraction). The cells in the heavier fraction bound little or no hCG. The binding data from this fraction did not obey saturation kinetics, but testosterone levels were elevated 700-800% in the presence of hCG (i.e. basal value 0.22 +/- 0.00 ng/2 X 10(6) cells versus 1.81 +/- 0.04 ng/2 X 10(6) cells in hCG-stimulated cells). Electron microscopy revealed that heavier cells had features typical of Leydig cells such as large ovoid nucleus with peripherally located heterochromatin, numerous mitochondria with tubular cristae, some lipid droplets, extensively developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and well developed Golgi complex. The cells in the light fraction contained an ovoid nucleus with one or more deep infoldings, and their most notable cytoplasmic feature was the presence of numerous vacuoles of varying sizes and shapes. Based upon this and the investigation which follows (Bhalla, V.K., Flasch, M.V., Browne, E.S., Sohal, G.S., and Sharawy, M.M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5322-5332), we conclude that occupancy of high affinity hCG binding sites, generally assumed to be coupled to steroidogenesis, is not necessarily related to the elicitation of this biological response."
https://openalex.org/W1481472516,"The phosphorylation of glucose by polyphosphate glucokinase with both long- and short-chain polyphosphates has been shown to occur by either a nonprocessive mechanism, i.e. with repeated association and dissociation of the polyphosphate from the enzyme after each phosphorylation or by a quasiprocessive mechanism in which several phosphorylations occur prior to the release of polyphosphate and the reassociation with the enzyme. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by polyphosphate kinase is by a strictly processive mechanism; the phosphorylation occurs without release of the polymer from the enzyme prior to termination of the reaction (Robinson, N. A., Clark, J. E., and Wood, H. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5216-5222). The demonstration that the mechanism is quasi-or nonprocessive was accomplished by electrophoresis using a variety of concentrations of polyacrylamide gels which made it possible to detect the intermediate sizes formed during the reactions. It also has been shown that all chains longer than about 100 are used simultaneously, but with chains of less than 100 residues, there is preferential utilization of the longest chains. Thus a narrow range of sizes is formed from a heterogeneous mixture of long chains. It is this formation of the narrow range of sizes that makes it possible to use polyphosphate glucokinase for the determination of the average size of long chains (Pepin, C. A., Wood, H. G., and Robinson, N. A. (1986) Biochem. Int. 12, 111-123)."
https://openalex.org/W1515565736,"Abstract In order to understand the coordinate regulation between the alpha-like and beta-like globins during the developmental switches in hemoglobin synthesis, we have studied the rabbit alpha-like globin gene family. A cluster of six linked genes arranged 5'-zeta 1-alpha 1-theta 1-zeta 2-zeta 3-theta 2-3' has been isolated as a set of overlapping clones from a library of rabbit genomic DNA. Blot-hybridization analysis of genomic DNA not only confirms this linkage arrangement but also reveals the presence of additional zeta and theta genes. We propose that this gene cluster was generated by a block duplication of a set of alpha-like genes; the proposed duplication unit is zeta-zeta-alpha-theta. Further duplications of a zeta-zeta-theta set are also proposed to have occurred. As expected for a duplicated locus, the rabbit alpha-like gene cluster contains long blocks of internal homology. The Z homology block is about 7.2 kilobase pairs long and contains the zeta genes; the T homology block is about 4.7 kilobase pairs long and contains a theta gene. Surprisingly, both Z and T homology blocks are flanked by a common junction sequence (J) which contains a region very similar to the 3'-untranslated sequence of an alpha-globin gene. Analysis of the J sequences suggests a recombination mechanism by which the alpha gene could have been deleted from the second set of genes in the cluster (zeta 2-zeta 3-theta 2). The relationships among the genes in characterized alpha-like gene clusters in mammals are summarized. The rabbit gene cluster differs from those of other mammals principally in the loss of a gene orthologous to the human psi alpha 1 and in the block duplication of the zeta-zeta-alpha-theta gene set."
