https://openalex.org/W2084936584,"The development of cell or gene therapies for diseases involving cells that are widely distributed throughout the body has been severely hampered by the inability to achieve the disseminated delivery of cells or genes to the affected tissues or organ. Here we report the results of bone marrow transplantation studies in the mdx mouse, an animal model of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which indicate that the intravenous injection of either normal haematopoietic stem cells or a novel population of muscle-derived stem cells into irradiated animals results in the reconstitution of the haematopoietic compartment of the transplanted recipients, the incorporation of donor-derived nuclei into muscle, and the partial restoration of dystrophin expression in the affected muscle. These results suggest that the transplantation of different stem cell populations, using the procedures of bone marrow transplantation, might provide an unanticipated avenue for treating muscular dystrophy as well as other diseases where the systemic delivery of therapeutic cells to sites throughout the body is critical. Our studies also suggest that the inherent developmental potential of stem cells isolated from diverse tissues or organs may be more similar than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2001620484,"During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15–30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.

EGF receptor epidermal growth factor Src homology 2 domain growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 Src homology and collagen domain protein phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-γ Son of Sevenless homolog protein The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 belongs to the family of protein-tyrosine kinase receptors, which regulate cell growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1Schlessinger J.

Biol. 1994; 59: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). EGFR is activated by binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or another EGF family factor (e.g. transforming growth factor-α). This binding causes EGFR dimerization and rapid activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase followed by autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic receptor domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR generates a biochemical message for a battery of cytoplasmic target proteins that contain characteristic protein domains, such as Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and phosphotyrosine binding domains (e.g. see Refs. 4Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 5Carpenter G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Binding and phosphorylation/activation of these proteins, e.g. growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), Src homology and collagen domain protein (Shc), phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ), and others lead to a further propagation of the signal through multiple interacting pathways. Several signaling pathways emanating from EGFR involve activation of SOS (Son of Sevenless homolog protein), the downstream target of which is Ras protein. Mitogenic signaling by EGFR is associated with Ras-dependent stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, leading to phosphorylation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. Although a predominant role of EGFR and other tyrosine kinase receptors is stimulation of cell growth and proliferation, recent data suggest that the physiological outcome of tyrosine kinase signaling strongly depends on the timing, duration, and amplitude of activation of signaling components (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 7Shymko R.M. De Meyts P. Thomas R. Biochem.

Initially, signaling pathways were viewed as linear relay routes, which simply transmitted and amplified signals. Now it is increasingly appreciated that signaling responses are shaped by multiple interactions of many components of signaling networks (9Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). A subtle difference in input signals and/or interaction kinetics may result in differential response patterns and, eventually, in alterations in gene expression by signal-regulated transcription factors. For instance, variable strength of Raf-1 activation (the first kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, a direct downstream target of Ras) has been linked to such opposing responses as the induction of DNA synthesis and growth inhibition (10Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 11Lloyd A.C. Obermuller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Experiments with PC12 cells have shown that the specificity of cellular responses depends on the duration of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) (the terminal kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade),e.g. whether Erk activation is transient or sustained (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar,14York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.

Therefore, signaling through the same pathway in the same cell type may result in completely different outputs depending on the amplitude and persistence of activation of signaling intermediates,i.e. on their kinetic behavior. The kinetics (i.e. the transient and steady-state behavior) of the cellular response to EGF depends on many factors, including the number of receptors displayed on the cell surface; the concentration of the growth factor, docking, and target proteins; and their initial activity states. Moreover, other signaling pathways that share or interact with one or more components of the EGFR pathway can influence the kinetic pattern of EGFR signaling. Although a large body of data describes EGFR signaling at the molecular level, the manner in which the complex pattern of cellular responses to EGF is controlled remains poorly understood. An important reason is the lack of a quantitative description of EGFR signaling network, which hampers a careful examination of the influence of multiple factors. Detailed understanding of the dynamics of complex cellular responses requires a combination of experimental and computational approaches (17Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1998; 280: 852-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Huang C.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The early events of EGFR signaling, such as EGF binding and receptor autophosphorylation, binding and activation of Grb2, phosphorylation of Shc and PLCγ, and activation of SOS, develop in a time frame of seconds. There are slower processes involving receptor internalization and its subsequent degradation in lysosomes, which have an important role in EGF-induced signaling (20Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 21Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Ludlow L.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol.

Activation and binding of ligands causes the recruitment of EGFR to clathrin-coated pits and transfer to endosomes. These processes are developing over time frames of minutes to hours, i.e. much more slowly than early EGFR signaling events, which evolve to a quasi-steady-state level in a time scale of seconds. Here we will study the short term response (up to 120 s) to EGF stimulation. The aim of the present study is to give a quantitative description of the short term EGFR signaling based on a detailed kinetic scheme of the interactions of proteins and other signaling molecules involved. To this end, we combine a computational approach with experimental analysis of the time course of activation/phosphorylation of different components of the EGFR signaling pathway in isolated rat hepatocytes. We test the model against the experimental data to gain a better understanding of the factors governing the kinetics of phosphorylated signaling intermediates. In particular, the model explains why the total phosphorylated EGFR and its complexes with target proteins exhibit pronounced maxima and then descend to sustained levels, whereas the total concentration of phosphorylated forms of Shc and the concentrations of Shc-Grb2 and Shc-Grb2-SOS complexes increase monotonically, reaching a quasi-steady-state level. We demonstrate which enzyme activities and kinetic constants exert significant control over the EGFR signaling and how the transient behavior is regulated. This analysis will enable us to assess how the EGFR signaling system can process information and generate distinct outputs in response to stimuli. Antibodies against EGFR (sheep polyclonal) and PLCγ (mixed mouse monoclonals) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Shc (rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal), anti-Grb2 (mouse monoclonal), and anti-phosphotyrosine-horseradish peroxidase (type RC20H) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine-agarose conjugates (mouse monoclonal) were obtained from Sigma, and anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Pierce. Gradient gels and nitrocellulose membranes were from Bio-Rad, and detection of the Western blots was done by chemiluminescence using Supersignal reagent (Pierce). Collagenase type I was from Worthington, and bovine serum albumin fraction V and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. EGF (receptor grade), protein G-Sepharose, and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma. Other chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Isolated hepatocytes were prepared from the livers of male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats by collagenase perfusion as described previously (23Hoek J.B. Thomas A.P. Rubin R. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 682-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell preparations were suspended in a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing NaCl (127 mm), NaHCO3 (25 mm), KCl (4 mm), MgCl2 (1.2 mm), potassium phosphate (1.2 mm), Hepes (10 mm, pH 7.4), CaCl2 (1.0 mm), and glucose (15 mm) and stored on ice until use. Incubations were carried out in a shaking water bath at 37 °C in capped plastic flasks in a gas phase of 95% O2, 5% CO2. Cells were preincubated at a cell density of 107 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 45 min to optimize receptor presentation on the cell surface, prior to stimulation with different concentrations of EGF (24Gladhaug I.P. Refsnes M. Christoffersen T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1992; 37: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped after 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 s by a 1:1 dilution of a sample of the incubation mixture with ice-cold lysis buffer containing (final concentrations) Hepes (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (150 mm), EGTA (5 mm), glycerol (10%), Triton X-100 (1%), NaF (100 mm), sodiumo-vanadate (0.2 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm), and the commercially available protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 10 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged in the cold room (4 °C) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge 5 min at top speed to remove the Triton-insoluble fraction and either used immediately or stored at −70 °C until use. In some experiments, cells were lysed with a digitonin-containing buffer instead of with Triton X-100. The concentration of digitonin was 150 μg/ml, equivalent to 5–7 μg/mg of protein, sufficient to achieve maximal release of soluble proteins, as determined from the release of lactate dehydrogenase. Other treatment conditions were similar to those described above. The particulate fraction from digitonin-treated cells was further extracted by resuspending in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS plus 1% deoxycholate. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by a modification of the procedures described in Ref. 25Saso K. Moehren G. Higashi K. Hoek J.B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 2073-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Antibody titration experiments established that maximally effective (>90%) immunoprecipitation of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of the relevant proteins was achieved at high antibody:antigen ratio. Based on these titration studies, equal volumes (25–100 μl) of lysate and undiluted commercial antibody solution were mixed and incubated for a minimum of 4 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Immune complexes with anti-EGFR antibody (sheep, polyclonal IgG) and PLC-γ (mixed mouse monoclonal) were captured by the addition of 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose added during the final hour, and anti-SHC (rabbit polyclonal IgG) complexes were captured with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed three times with HNTG buffer (Hepes (20 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (150 mm), Triton X-100 (0.1%), glycerol (10%), sodium o-vanadate (0.2 mm), NaF (10 mm), and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitates and full lysate samples were dissolved in Laemmli buffer (20% glycerol, 3% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient gels electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (Tris 10 mm, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) at room temperature. For Western blotting, all antibodies were diluted in TBST according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min and washed four times for 10 min with TBST before detection by chemiluminescence. Quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins following EGF stimulation was carried out by the following procedure. Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) immunoprecipitates of each sample were loaded onto the gels side-by-side with the corresponding samples of EGFR or PLC-γ immunoprecipitates, after appropriate dilution with HNTG buffer to achieve a signal intensity in the same range as that of the corresponding tyrosine-phosphorylated protein on the Western blot. Alternatively, anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates were loaded side by side with a sample of the corresponding total lysate (after appropriate dilution with HNTG), and the resulting nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies to EGFR or SHC. This procedure allowed for quantitation of tyrosine phosphorylation of specific target proteins by normalization to the total target protein in the lysate. A similar strategy was followed to assess the extent of Grb2 coprecipitation with either EGFR or SHC proteins. After chemiluminescence, a range of different film exposures was made for each membrane to avoid overexposure and to maintain band densities within a linear range for densitometric quantitation. Protein bands were identified according to their molecular weights and by comparison with specific immunoprecipitates. Bands were analyzed densitometrically using a Sharp JX-330 gel scanner and quantified by the Image Master ID software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results from multiple (4Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. for different estimates from a single experiment, representative of three or more similar experiments. For a quantitative analysis of the EGFR signaling network, an adequate description is required of the reactions that contribute to the experimentally detected protein-protein interactions and tyrosine phosphorylation events. The kinetic scheme presented in Fig. 1 forms the basis for the integration of the experimental study and the computational analysis. In step 1, EGF binds to the extracellular domain of the monomeric EGFR (designated as R in the kinetic scheme) and forms the EGF·EGFR complex (designated as Ra). EGF binding drives the association of two receptor monomers into an activated receptor dimer (step 2). Recent studies (26Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 27Sherrill J.M. Kyte J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5705-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that a 2:2 (EGF:EGFR) complex is the predominant form of the receptor dimer (designated as R2). The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues by receptor tyrosine kinase is combined into a single step 3, yielding a form designated as RP. Although multiple tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor are targets for autophosphorylation, we did not attempt to distinguish experimentally between different phosphorylated forms of the receptor, and, as we will discuss below, the initial computational analysis also does not require a functional distinction to be made. Step 4 is the dephosphorylation of RP, catalyzed by one or more phosphotyrosine phosphatase(s) (28Hashimoto N. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Z.Y. Walsh A.B. Wu L. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5386-5392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation triggers the binding of cytoplasmic proteins to the receptor. We consider here three proteins that directly interact with phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor, namely Grb2, Shc, and PLCγ (4Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Although several other proteins bind to the activated EGFR, it is helpful to consider a limited number of target proteins as an initial core model. It is not entirely clear whether these multiple proteins can bind simultaneously to their target phosphotyrosine residues on the same receptor molecule or whether the binding of, for example, Grb2 to the receptor hampers the binding of PLCγ (competitive binding). The model depicted in Fig. 1 considers the binding of cytoplasmic proteins to occur by a competitive mechanism. The advantage of a model with competitive binding is that it allows us to consider receptor phosphorylation as a single step rather than monitoring different phosphorylated forms of R2 as distinct entities. We also assume that, when Grb2, Shc, or PLCγ are bound to EGFR, the corresponding phosphotyrosine residues are not available to receptor phosphotyrosine phosphatases. The implications of these assumptions for the dynamic pattern of EGFR signaling will be considered below. Which mechanism of interactions of EGFR and adapter proteins occurs in vivo remains to be identified. The entire network of reactions of the receptor with its cytoplasmic target proteins can now be divided into three coupled cycles of interactions with Grb2, PLCγ, and Shc, respectively. One receptor cycle includes the binding of PLCγ (step 5 in Fig. 1, resulting in the formation of the complex designated as R-PL) and phosphorylation of PLCγ at two tyrosine residues by receptor tyrosine kinase (step 6, yielding the complex R-PLP). The partial cycle of the receptor is completed by the dissociation of R-PLP into phosphorylated phospholipase Cγ (PLCγP) and RP in step 7. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is thought to be necessary for its activation and the subsequent formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and generation of a Ca2+ response (30Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 31Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PLCγP can translocate to cytoskeletal or membrane structures (step 25), which yields bound PLCγP-I (32Yang L.J. Rhee S.G. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7156-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pei Z. Yang L. Williamson J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another partial receptor cycle starts with the binding of Grb2 to a receptor phosphotyrosine (step 9, forming the complex R-G). The complex of the EGF receptor with the adapter protein Grb2 is a branch point that leads to several signaling pathways through binding to different potential targets. Here we consider the link of EGFR to the Ras signaling pathway. The SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to proline-rich regions of the Ras-specific GDP-GTP exchange factor SOS. In step 10, SOS binds to the receptor-bound Grb2, resulting in the formation of the ternary complex R-G-S. The binding of SOS to the EGFR-Grb2 complex localizes SOS in the vicinity of Ras, which is anchored to the cell membrane. The ternary complex R-G-S dissociates (step 11), yielding the phosphorylated receptor (RP) and the complex G-S, which further dissociates into Grb2 and SOS (step 12). The final EGFR cycle considered here includes the formation of the complex of Shc with EGFR (R-SH) (step 13 in Fig. 1) and its subsequent phosphorylation at Tyr317 by receptor tyrosine kinase (step 14, yielding R-ShP). This allows Grb2 to also bind to EGFR indirectly through phosphorylated Shc, forming a ternary complex (R-Sh-G) (step 17). There are three embedded EGFR cycles that involve Shc protein. The shortest of these cycles is completed in step 15, where the complex R-ShP dissociates, yielding the phosphorylated receptor (RP) and phosphorylated Shc (ShP). The second cycle is completed in step 18, where the ternary complex R-Sh-G dissociates into RP and the complex Sh-G. The longest of the three embedded cycles includes SOS binding to R-Sh-G, leading to the formation of a four-protein complex, R-Sh-G-S (step 19). The complex R-Sh-G-S can also be formed by association of R-ShP and G-S complexes in step 24. The third cycle is completed in step 20, where the complex R-Sh-G-S dissociates, releasing the phosphorylated receptor (RP) and the complex Sh-G-S. It is unknown whether the binding of the phosphorylated target proteins to EGFR protects them against specific phosphatases. The kinetic scheme of Fig. 1 assumes that PLCγP and ShP are dephosphorylated only after they dissociate from the receptor (steps 16 and 8). However, this assumption is not critical, provided the dephosphorylation of bound target proteins proceeds no faster than that of their unbound phosphorylated forms. After phosphorylated Shc dissociates from the receptor (ShP), it retains its ability to bind various SH2 domain-containing targets. The remaining steps in Fig. 1 constitute the cycle of ShP. The scheme shows that Grb2 binds to ShP, forming the complex Sh-G (step 21). The GDP-GTP exchange factor SOS is able to bind to Grb2 complexed with phosphorylated Shc, forming the ternary complex Sh-G-S (step 22). The dissociation of the complex Sh-G-S yields G-S and ShP (step 23). In order to integrate the experimental observations in a description of the dynamic behavior of the EGFR signaling network, we converted the reaction scheme of Fig. 1 into a set of mathematical equations known as chemical kinetics equations (34Tyson J.J. Novak B. Odell G.M. Chen K. Thron C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 89-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For changes with time of the concentration of any component,e.g. the receptor form RP, one can write the following.Rate of change of RP concentration=total rate of RP production−total rate of RP consumptionEquation 1 Here the total rate is the sum of the rates that produce or consume RP according to the kinetic diagram. For instance, the total rate of RP production equals the sum of the (net) rates of six steps (steps 3, 7, 11, 15, 18, and 20; see Fig. 1).

If the same compound participates in reactions taking place in different compartments with different volumes, the effective concentration of that compound will be different depending on the volume of the corresponding compartment. Step 1 (EGF binding to EGFR) could be considered as taking place in the extracellular compartment with a given initial concentration of EGF. The concentration of EGFR in the extracellular compartment would then be calculated as the number of the receptors on the cell surface divided by the (average) volume of incubation medium per cell (V m). In step 2, association and dissociation of the receptor monomers occurs in the cell membrane. All other steps are considered as taking place in the cytosolic compartment. Therefore, the same mole number of EGFR would give rise to three EGFR concentrations (representing the different compartments). However, for computational purposes, it is more convenient to deal only with a single concentration"

https://openalex.org/W1971197630,"The stereotyped mating behaviour of the Caenorhabditis elegans male is made up of several substeps: response, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion and sperm transfer. The complexity of this behaviour is reflected in the sexually dimorphic anatomy and nervous system. Behavioural functions have been assigned to most of the male-specific sensory neurons by means of cell ablations; for example, the hook sensory neurons HOA and HOB are specifically required for vulva location. We have investigated how sensory perception of the hermaphrodite by the C. elegans male controls mating behaviours. Here we identify a gene, lov-1 (for location of vulva), that is required for two male sensory behaviours: response and vulva location. lov-1 encodes a putative membrane protein with a mucin-like, serine-threonine-rich amino terminus followed by two blocks of homology to human polycystins, products of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney-disease loci PKD1 and PKD2. LOV-1 is the closest C. elegans homologue of PKD1. lov-1 is expressed in adult males in sensory neurons of the rays, hook and head, which mediate response, vulva location, and potentially chemotaxis to hermaphrodites, respectively. PKD-2, the C. elegans homologue of PKD2, is localized to the same neurons as LOV-1, suggesting that they function in the same pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1690222005,"The U.S. Congress, in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) established a framework for regulation of dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For dietary supplements, the FDA regulates labeling to limit health claims, but is not empowered to insist on rigorous studies establishing safety before marketing (as would be required for drugs or food additives). This creates a substantial potential risk to the health of the public, and serious adverse effects have been reported from some dietary supplements that are currently being marketed. The author recommends that a new category of dietary supplements, called nutraceuticals, be established for supplements to be administered at doses that exceed normal human exposure to these agents in foods. Regulations should require that these nutraceuticals be judged safe before they are marketed."

Phosphoamino acid analysis of eNOS from bovine aortic endothelial cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate demonstrated that only phosphoserine was present in eNOS under both static and flow conditions. Fluid shear stress induced phosphate incorporation into two specific eNOS tryptic peptides as early as 30 s after initiation of flow. The flow-induced tryptic phosphopeptides were enriched, separated by capillary electrophoresis with intermittent voltage drops, also known as “peak parking,” and analyzed by collision-induced dissociation in a tandem mass spectrometer. Two phosphopeptide sequences determined by tandem mass spectrometry, TQpSFSLQER and KLQTRPpSPGPPPAEQLLSQAR, were confirmed as the two flow-dependent phosphopeptides by co-migration with synthetic phosphopeptides. Because the sequence (RIR)TQpSFSLQER contains a consensus substrate site for protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), we demonstrated that LY294002, an inhibitor of the upstream activator of PKB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibited flow-induced eNOS phosphorylation by 97% and NO production by 68%.

Endothelial cells synthesize NO tonically and increase NO production in response to agonists and increased fluid shear stress (FSS). Endothelial NO contributes to blood vessel homeostasis by regulating vessel tone (1Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S.

These modifications increase eNOS compartmentalization to plasmalemmal caveolae and facilitate release of NO from cells (5Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C.

Recent studies suggest that the activity of eNOS is regulated in a reciprocal manner through caveolin-1 inhibition and Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

Increased FSS stimulates an increase in free intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i from intracellular stores (15James N.L. Harrison D.G. Nerem R.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Geiger R.V. Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Nerem R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1411-C1417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leading to a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent increase in eNOS activity. However, recent investigations show that increases in [Ca2+]i do not fully explain the rapid rise in NO production in response to FSS (17Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to 25 dynes/cm2 FSS for 30 s caused a 7-fold rise in NO production and a corresponding 2-fold increase in eNOS phosphorylation, whereas the calcium ionophore A23187 neither caused rapid NO production nor any net increase in eNOS phosphorylation (17Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that an increase in FSS could be transduced to increased NO production via activation of a protein kinase cascade resulting in phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. The objectives of the present work were to elucidate the eNOS sites phosphorylated in response to increased FSS and to identify potential protein kinase mediators of the mechanotransduction of FSS to NO production. The amino acid residues phosphorylated in small proteins may be determined by fractionation of tryptic peptides by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (18Gygi S.P. Han D.K. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, tryptic fragmentation of large proteins such as eNOS creates numerous peptides whose rapid elution from HPLC exceeds the scan rate of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This prevents acquisition of sequences, by collision-induced dissociation (CID), of a substantial fraction of the peptides. Additionally, phosphopeptides from proteins isolated from a cell will nearly always exist as minor ions due to sub-stoichiometric phosphorylation compared with nonphosphorylated peptides and will not be scanned as major parent ions. In order to identify phosphorylation sites in eNOS, tryptic phosphopeptides were first enriched by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The peptides were then separated by peak parking solid phase extraction capillary electrophoresis (SPE-CE), which extends the peak analysis time to provide for both increased scan times of parent ions and increased MS/MS analyses of each selected peptide according to optimized CID parameters. The identity of two specific eNOS residues phosphorylated in response to flow was determined, and evidence was obtained linking FSS to eNOS phosphorylation and NO production via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB). We present evidence that PKB phosphorylates eNOSin vitro at the same site phosphorylated in the cell and that the phosphorylation increases eNOS enzymatic activity.

BAEC cultures were established and maintained in culture in medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal calf serum as described (17Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Cells from passage 3–8 were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and used at 60–80% confluency for labeling and shear stress experiments. Cells were exposed to laminar FSS in a cone and plate viscometer as described (19Traub O. Yan C. Berk B. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Hardood Academic Publishers, UK1999Google Scholar). BAEC at 60–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and labeled with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Na3VO4 (200 μm) was added to the culture medium for 10 min prior to harvest. Cells were maintained in static culture or exposed to 12–15 dynes/cm2 FSS for the indicated times in a cone and plate viscometer (19Traub O. Yan C. Berk B. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Hardood Academic Publishers, UK1999Google Scholar).

Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of protein as determined by Bradford assay were used for all immunoprecipitations. The supernatants were precleared as described (20Acres R.B. Conlon P.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Gallis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16210-16214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 4 h at a final NaCl concentration of 400 mm (21Peltz G.A. Gallis B. Peterlin B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) on a rocker with 60 μl of a 20% suspension (v/v) of protein A-agarose and 5 μg of anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody. The immune pellets were washed four times with 0.8 ml of lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and the eluates from the immune pellets were stored at −20 °C. Immunoprecipitated eNOS in SDS sample buffer was fractionated on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis apparatus. The gel was soaked in 100 ml of transfer buffer (24 mm Tris base, 181 mmglycine) for 10 min, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for 70 min. For Western blotting, proteins (30 μg/lane) were fractionated on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking for 1 h in 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were reacted with anti-phospho-PKB or anti-PKB antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution. After washing, the blot was reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and chemiluminescence was performed. For blotting of proteins to PVDF Immobilon P membrane, the gel was transferred at 35 V for 5 h in transfer buffer containing 20% methanol. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described (22Affolter M. Watts J.D. Krebs D.L. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). eNOS was immunoprecipitated from six [32P]orthophosphate-labeled 100-mm culture dishes and 12 non-labeled culture dishes of BAEC exposed to 15 dynes/cm2FSS for 1 min. The pooled immunoprecipitates were separated on a 0.75-mm thick, 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The eNOS was located by silver staining (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), excised from the gel, and the incorporation of32P was determined by Cerenkov counting. The gel slices were washed in 1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, shrunk by dehydration in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. eNOS was reduced in the gel slices by incubation in 1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA under N2 gas for 1 h at 56 °C. For alkylation (25Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), 4-vinylpyridine was diluted to 2% (v/v) directly into the reduction buffer, and the gel slices were incubated with intermittent shaking for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. After S-pyridylethylation, the buffer was removed, and the gel slices were washed with 1% ammonium bicarbonate and shrunk with acetonitrile. Gel slices were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and the washing, shrinking, and drying procedure was repeated (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The gel slices containing reduced and alkylated eNOS were digested with 100 ng of sequencing grade trypsin as described (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Ninety-five percent of the tryptic phosphopeptides were recovered from the gel slice, as determined by Cerenkov counting. An ion metal affinity column (IMAC) was constructed and operated as described previously (22Affolter M. Watts J.D. Krebs D.L. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. To each end of a 10-cm-long piece of Teflon tubing (1/16 inches outer diameter × 0.0001 inches inner diameter) a piece of polyimide-coated fused silica capillary (PlymicroTechnologies, Tucson, AZ) was inserted and held in place by a union (Valco, Houston, TX). Prior to fixing the second of the two polyimide capillaries in place the open Teflon end was placed in a slurry of POROS-MC (PerSeptive) inside a vessel pressurized by helium, and the IMAC column was packed to a length of 5 cm under 500 pounds/square inch pressure. The second piece of fused silica capillary was then fixed in place with a second union. For operation one of the two polyimide capillaries was placed in a helium pressure vessel and the other served as an outlet. The IMAC column was prepared for use by washing (5 min/wash at 5 pounds/square inch) sequentially with water, 0.1 m EDTA, water, 0.1 m acetic acid, 0.1m FeCl3, and 0.1 m acetic acid. The sample, reconstituted in 0.1 m acetic acid, was loaded in entirety and followed by washing with 0.1 m acetic acid, water, 0.1% NH4H2PO4 for elution of bound phosphopeptides, water, and 0.1 m EDTA. Peptides were concentrated after IMAC, reconstituted in 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid (solvent A) and injected onto the HPLC column. HPLC was carried out on a Michrome Bioresources instrument (Auburn, CA) equipped with a 0.5-mm C18 column. A linear gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile, which contained 0.4% acetic acid and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid wash, was used to elute peptides from the column. One-minute fractions were collected and 32P content per fraction estimated by Cerenkov counting. Fractions from the HPLC separation intended for SPE-CE were concentrated slightly to remove excess acetonitrile, as described (26Figeys D. Corthals G. Gallis B. Ducret A. Corson M. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sample was pressure-injected on a C18 cartridge (1 mm × 250 μm) placed at the head of the CE capillary. A series of washes both desalted and prepared the sample for CE which began when a small plug of organic solvent was pressure-injected onto the SPE cartridge (27Figeys D. Ducret A. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Figeys D. van Oostveen I. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1822-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Peptides were sequenced on a Finnigan (San Jose, CA) TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a home-built electrospray ionization device described previously (26Figeys D. Corthals G. Gallis B. Ducret A. Corson M. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Data acquisition was computer-controlled using a program written in instrument control language that automatically provided data-dependent ion selection and varied capillary electrophoretic voltage. Ion selection and CE voltage were dependent on ion intensity such that as an ion reached a given intensity the mass spectrometer simultaneously switched from full scan mode to MS/MS mode and the CE voltage decreased from −20 to −5 kV. When the ion signal decreased below a preset threshold, the mass spectrometer returned to initial scanning/electrophoretic conditions. NO released by BAEC was measured as its nitrogen oxide (NOx) metabolites, using a chemiluminescence detector as described in detail (17Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). pCeNOS, the plasmid for the expression of His6 eNOS inEscherichia coli, was constructed using two sequential two-piece ligations. An NdeI-SfiI fragment including the initial 533 nucleotides of bovine eNOS cDNA (29Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P. Uematsu M. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Murphy T.J. J.

This fragment was purified and used as a template to create a HindIII-SfiI1 fragment using additional polymerase chain reaction, using this sense primer 5′-TATCCCAAGCTTGGGTGATTACCATATGGCCCA and the former antisense primer. This fragment (a HindIII-SfiI fragment with an internal NdeI site) was purified and cut withHindIII and SfiI. pBluescript eNOS (29Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P.

Ligation products were transformed into DH5α cells, and colonies were screened for positive recombinants via restriction digest.

Kinase reactions using PKB to phosphorylate eNOS were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of stoichiometry 150 ng of PKB was used to phosphorylate 10 μg of eNOS with [γ-32P]ATP (90 μm) at a specific activity of 2800 cpm/pmol. At the indicated time points, aliquots of the reaction were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and eNOS was separated by SDS-PAGE and then localized by silver staining. The eNOS bands were excised, and incorporation was determined by Cerenkov counting. For activation of eNOS by PKB, 300 ng of PKB (specific activity 560 nmol/min mg using eNOS as a substrate) was incubated with 2.5 μg of recombinant eNOS in a 20-min protein kinase reaction at 30 °C. Reactions without PKB were run in parallel. After phosphorylation, 1-μg aliquots of eNOS from the kinase reactions with and without PKB were diluted into 100-μl eNOS assays containing 20 μml-[U-14C]arginine (1375 cpm/pmol), 3 μm CaCl2, 4 μmFAD, 4 μm FMN, 4 μm BH4, 1 mm NADPH, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 μm calmodulin, and reactions were carried out exactly as described (34Kumar V.B.

Labeled arginine was separated from labeled citrulline by thin layer chromatography (34Kumar V.B. Bernardo A.E. Alshaher M.M. Buddhiraju M. Purushothaman R. Morley J.E. Anal.

BAEC were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM containing 200 μm Na3VO4. Cells were maintained in static condition or subjected to laminar FSS (19Traub O. Yan C. Berk B. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Hardood Academic Publishers, UK1999Google Scholar). The cells were lysed; eNOS was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by autoradiography (Fig.1 A). eNOS was basally phosphorylated in cells maintained in static culture (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), and exposure to laminar FSS caused a rapid, nearly 2-fold increase (17Corson M.A. James N.L.

BAEC were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of Na3VO4 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and maintained under static condition or exposed to FSS at 15 dynes/cm2 for 1 min. Fig. 1 B shows that eNOS contains only phosphoserine under both static and flow conditions (n = 3). No other phosphoamino acid was detected in eNOS. The eNOS transferred to nitrocellulose (shown in Fig. 1 A) was subjected to tryptic cleavage and the tryptic peptides were spotted onto a thin layer plate. The peptides were fractionated in the first dimension by HVE and in the second dimension by TLC. Autoradiograms of the thin layer plates are shown in Fig. 2. Under static conditions eNOS contained 8–10 phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 A), two of which, F1 and F2, increased with time when BAEC are exposed to 15 dynes/cm2 FSS (Fig. 2, B—D). The relative volumes of each of the basal and flow-stimulated phosphopeptides were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis in two independent experiments examining phosphate incorporation as a function of shear stress duration (Table I). Whereas the incorporation of phosphate into eNOS during a 10-min time course was approximately 2-fold, the specific incorporation into the flow-dependent phosphorylation sites F1 and F2 was more pronounced.

https://openalex.org/W2086908980,"Evolutionary game theory1,2 is concerned with the evolutionarily stable outcomes of the process of natural selection. The theory is especially relevant when the fitness of an organism depends on the behaviour of other members of its population. Here we focus on the interaction between two organisms that have a conflict of interest. The standard approach to such two-player games is to assume that each player chooses a single action and that the evolutionarily stable action of each player is the best given the action of its opponent. We argue that, instead, most two-player games should be modelled as involving a series of interactions in which opponents negotiate the final outcome. Thus we should be concerned with evolutionarily stable negotiation rules rather than evolutionarily stable actions. The evolutionarily stable negotiation rule of each player is the best rule given the rule of its opponent. As we show, the action chosen as a result of the negotiation is not the best action given the action of the opponent. This conclusion necessitates a fundamental change in the way that evolutionary games are modelled."

https://openalex.org/W1973160416,"At synaptic junctions, specialized subcellular structures occur in both pre- and postsynaptic cells. Most presynaptic termini contain electron-dense membrane structures, often referred to as active zones, which function in vesicle docking and release. The components of those active zones and how they are formed are largely unknown. We report here that a mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans syd-2 (for synapse-defective) gene causes a diffused localization of several presynaptic proteins and of a synaptic-vesicle membrane associated green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the active zones of syd-2 mutants were significantly lengthened, whereas the total number of vesicles per synapse and the number of vesicles at the prominent active zones were comparable to those in wild-type animals. Synaptic transmission is partially impaired in syd-2 mutants. syd-2 encodes a member of the liprin (for LAR-interacting protein) family of proteins which interact with LAR-type (for leukocyte common antigen related) receptor proteins with tyrosine phosphatase activity (RPTPs). SYD-2 protein is localized at presynaptic termini independently of the presence of vesicles, and functions cell autonomously. We propose that SYD-2 regulates the differentiation of presynaptic termini in particular the formation of the active zone, by acting as an intracellular anchor for RPTP signalling at synaptic junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2003647788,"Aberrant protein processing with tissue deposition is associated with many common neurodegenerative disorders; however, the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors has made it difficult to decipher the sequence of events linking protein aggregation with clinical disease. Substantial progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiology of prototypical conformational diseases and protein polymerization in the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins). Here we describe a new disease, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies, characterized clinically as an autosomal dominantly inherited dementia, histologically by unique neuronal inclusion bodies and biochemically by polymers of the neuron-specific serpin, neuroserpin. We report the cosegregation of point mutations in the neuroserpin gene (PI12) with the disease in two families. The significance of one mutation, S49P, is evident from its homology to a previously described serpin mutations, whereas that of the other, S52R, is predicted by modelling of the serpin template. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for a familial dementia and imply that inhibitors of protein polymerization may be effective therapies for this disorder and perhaps for other more common neurodegenerative diseases."

Despite the important role that the p38 family of kinases plays in the generation of biological responses in various systems, its role in the generation of interferon signals is unknown. Furthermore, there has been no link established to date between the p38 Map kinase and the Type I IFN-activated Jak-Stat pathway. In the present report, we provide the first evidence that p38 is phosphorylated and that its catalytic domain is activated in response to treatment of target cells with Type I interferons. In addition, we demonstrate that IFN-dependent gene transcription via IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) is inhibited by blocking the activation of p38. Viewed together, these findings suggest a critical role for p38 in the generation of Type I interferon signals and the induction of interferon responses. The Daudi (lymphoblastoid), Molt-4 (acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia), and KG-1 (acute myeloid leukemia) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p38 using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunocomplexes were subsequently washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mmMgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μm ATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-ATF-2 fusion protein, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody. Cells were serum-starved by overnight incubation in RPMI medium-1% fetal calf serum. They were subsequently incubated in RPMI medium without serum for 2 h and then treated with the indicated IFNs for the indicated times, in the presence or absence of 10 μmSB203580, which was added 30 min prior to IFN treatment. The cells were then lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MapKap kinase-2 or MapKap kinase-3, immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmATP), and the immune complex kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp-25 protein (Stress Gen Laboratories) as a substrate and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of Hsp-25 was detected by autoradiography. Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and an ISRE-luciferase plasmid using the Superfect transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). The ISRE-luciferase construct included the wild type ISG15 ISRE (TCGGGAAAGGGAAACCG AAACTGAAGCC) cloned via cohesive ends into the BamHI site of the pZtkLuc vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with 5000 units/ml of IFNα, in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580, that was added to the cultures 30 min prior to IFNα treatment. In the experiments in which the effects of overexpression of a mutant p38 were determined, the cells were transfected with a mutated dominant-negative p38 DNA subcloned in the pCMV5 vector (pCMV-p38AGF) (24Derijard B.

Davis, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) or the pCMVHis vector (pCMV) (used as a control). The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and after cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. Genomic DNA affinity chromatography from untreated or IFNα-treated cells, in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580, was performed essentially as described previously (25Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N.

The composition of the ISGF3 complex was confirmed by supershifting with antibodies against Stat-1 and Stat-2. We sought to determine whether the p38 Map kinase is tyrosine-phosphorylated/activated during IFNα treatment of IFNα-sensitive cell lines. Molt-4 or Daudi cells were treated in the presence or absence of IFNα or IFNβ, and after cell lysis, total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of p38 (New England Biolabs). In both Molt-4 and Daudi cells, we noticed that the phosphorylated form of p38 was induced after IFNα or IFNβ treatment (Fig.1), suggesting that this member of the MAP family of kinases is a substrate for upstream MKK kinases and possibly is activated by Type I IFNs to transduce downstream signals. Similarly, Type I IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 was seen in the IFN-sensitive KG-1 myeloid cell line. 2S. Uddin and L. C. Platanias, unpublished observations. The kinetics of this Type I IFN-dependent phosphorylation of p38 were such that peak phosphorylation of the kinase occurred at 30 min, with the signal declining by 60 min, suggesting that the activation/phosphorylation of p38 by interferons is rapid and transient (Fig.2).Figure 2Kinetics of the Type I IFN-dependent phosphorylation of p38. Molt-4 cells were treated with IFNβ for the indicated times. Total cell lysates, corresponding to 1 × 106 cells, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of p38 (left panel). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with an antibody against p38 (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the kinase activity of p38 is induced by Type I IFN treatment, KG-1 or Daudi cells were treated with IFNβ, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p38 antibody, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using a glutathione fusion protein encoding for ATF-2 as an exogenous substrate. IFN treatment resulted in activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of ATF-2 in both cell lines, indicating that the phosphorylation of p38 results in activation of its catalytic domain (Fig.3). Previous studies have identified MapKap kinase-2 and MapKap kinase-3 as the in vivo substrates for the kinase activity of p38 in response to stress and other stimuli (15Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R.

To determine whether these kinases are also activated downstream of the p38 kinase during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, lysates from IFNβ-treated or untreated cells were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against MapKap kinase-2 or MapKap kinase-3 and in vitrokinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates. The results in Fig. 4 demonstrate that both downstream effectors of the p38 MAP kinase pathway are activated by IFN treatment and that such activation is blocked by treatment of cells with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580, suggesting that the regulatory effects of the p38 pathway in IFN signaling are mediated, at least in part, by these kinases. We subsequently sought to identify the functional consequences of this Type I IFN-dependent activation of the p38 pathway. In the IFN system, it is well established that gene transcription is regulated by the Stat pathway. A major signaling cascade involves association of activated Stat-2 and Stat-1 with p48 to form the mature ISGF3 complex, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription via binding to ISREs (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). We examined whether inhibition of the activity of p38 kinase blocks IFN-induced gene transcription via ISREs in gene reporter assays. IFN-sensitive U2OS cells, in which the p38 kinase is also activated by Type I IFNs,2 were transfected with a plasmid containing an ISRE-luciferase construct and treated with IFNα in the presence or absence of the SB203580 inhibitor. As expected, IFNα treatment of cells resulted in a significant increase in luciferase activity (Fig.5 A). Treatment of cells with SB203580 clearly reduced such induction (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the p38 pathway mediates signals required for ISRE-regulated gene transcription during activation of the Type I IFN receptor. To further establish the role of p38 in the induction of IFNα gene transcription via ISREs, we measured IFNα-dependent induction of luciferase activity in cells overexpressing a p38 kinase that cannot undergo phosphorylation/activation (p38AGF), as the tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation sites have been mutated (24Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 B, overexpression of p38AGF blocked the IFNα-induced increase in luciferase activity, establishing that a functional p38 kinase is essential for transcriptional regulation via ISREs. It is well established that IFN regulation of gene transcription in the interferon system is dependent on phosphorylation of Stat proteins and the formation of DNA binding complexes by activated Stat proteins (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). IFN-induced complexes include Stat 1:2 heterodimers that participate in the formation of the active ISGF3 complexes that regulate gene transcription via ISREs (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). As SB203580 and overexpression of a dominant-negative p38 construct inhibited induction of IFNα-dependent gene transcription, we sought to determine whether the IFNα activation of p38 affects tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the DNA binding activity of Stat proteins that form the ISGF3 complex. We determined whether treatment of cells with SB203580 inhibits detection of the IFNα-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated/activated form of Stat-1. Daudi cells were treated with IFNα in the presence or absence of SB203580, and total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of Stat-1. As shown in Fig.6 A, SB203580 had no effect on the IFNα-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-1 on tyrosine 701. We then sought to determine whether overexpression of the dominant-negative p38-AGF mutant also blocks the IFNα-dependent induction of the phosphorylated form of Stat-1. Overexpression of the p38AGF mutant in U2OS cells had no effect on the induction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Stat-1 (Fig.6 B), consistent with the findings using the SB203580 inhibitor. We also determined the effect of the SB203580 inhibitor on the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-1 and Stat-2 in Daudi cell lysates, in which Stat-1 was directly immunoprecipitated by an anti-Stat-1 antibody. Incubation of the cells with the inhibitor, at doses that selectively block p38 activation and inhibit IFNα-induced gene transcription, did not have a significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-1 and Stat-2 (Fig.7, A–C). Some minimal inhibition of the phosphorylation of Stat-1 protein at 30 min of IFNα treatment seen in this experiment was not consistently seen (data not shown). We next performed GDAC studies to determine whether nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of ISGF3 are regulated by p38. Nuclear extracts from IFNα-treated cells, incubated in the presence or absence of SB203580, were analyzed using GDAC and the high salt eluate fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Anti-Stat immunoblotting revealed that after IFNα treatment, nuclear extracts from U2OS cells contained inducible DNA binding factors that correspond to the Stat proteins, Stat-1 and Stat-2, the induction of which was not affected by treatment of cells with SB203580 (Fig. 7 D). To further characterize the IFNα-inducible Stat-containing DNA binding activities, we performed gel mobility shift assays, using the ISRE recognition element. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of SB203580, and the formation of ISGF3-ISRE complexes in response to IFNα was determined. As shown in Fig. 7 E, the formation of DNA binding Stat-complexes was not blocked by inhibition of the kinase activity of p38. Thus, although the function of the p38 kinase is essential for Type I IFN-dependent gene transcription, its activation is not required for Stat-tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding. In the present study, we provide the first evidence for the existence of a Type I IFN-dependent signaling pathway involving activation of the p38 kinase and downstream regulation of the MapKap-2 and Mapkap-3 kinases. This pathway is apparently regulated upstream by a member of the MKK family of kinases, as evidenced by the rapid Type I IFN-dependent phosphorylation of p38. Previous studies have established that MKK3 and MKK6 are selective activators of p38 (17Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), whereas MKK4 activates both p38 and JNK. It remains to be seen whether any of the known MKK family members, or a novel MKK, regulate the Type I IFN-dependent activation of this pathway. Our findings also provide direct evidence that the p38 pathway acts in coordination with the Jak-Stat pathway to regulate IFN-dependent gene transcription. It is well known that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats is required for their translocation to the nucleus and DNA binding. As inhibition of p38 activation blocks IFN gene transcription without affecting Stat DNA binding, our data establish that the p38 pathway does not affect Jak kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats. It has been reported that maximal activation of transcription by Stat-1 in response to IFNγ requires serine phosphorylation of Stat-1 in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation (31Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 28: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 32Zhu X. wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but the serine kinase regulating Stat-1 phosphorylation is unknown. Although there is no direct evidence so far that serine phosphorylation of Stat-1 and/or Stat-2 also occurs in the Type I IFN system, it is possible that such phosphorylation occurs and is regulated by a serine kinase downstream of p38, therefore modifying the transcriptional activity of Stat1, Stat2, or both. Another explanation, however, is that the p38 pathway converges with the Stat pathway further downstream, possibly at the nucleus, and cooperates with it to regulate transcription of interferon sensitive genes. Such a model for a synergism between these two pathways is similar to the previously described effects of p38 on NF-κB dependent pathways, where pharmacological inhibition of p38 has been shown to block NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, without affecting NF-κB-dependent binding activity (34Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Viewed together, these data strongly suggest that the p38 pathway regulates gene transcription without affecting the DNA binding activity of transcription factors. The results presented herein provide the first evidence for such effects on gene products regulated by the IFN-activated Jak-Stat pathway."

Here we report interactions between p75NTR and the six members of TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors) family proteins. The binding of different TRAF proteins to p75NTR was mapped to distinct regions in p75NTR. Furthermore, TRAF4 interacted with dimeric p75NTR, whereas TRAF2 interacted preferentially with monomeric p75NTR.

Coexpression of TRAF2 with p75NTRenhanced cell death, whereas coexpression of TRAF6 was cytoprotective. Furthermore, overexpression of TRAF4 abrogated the ability of dimerization to prevent the induction of apoptosis normally mediated by monomeric p75NTR. TRAF4 also inhibited the NF-κB response, whereas TRAF2 and TRAF6 enhanced p75NTR-induced NF-κB activation.

The cellular responses to neurotrophins are elicited via two specific surface receptors: Trk (tropomyosin-related kinase) tyrosine kinase receptors and the common neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR (1Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Trk proteins have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. Binding of neurotrophins to Trks activates their kinase domains, triggering downstream Ras signaling pathways, which are responsible for a series of trophic factor responses, e.g.neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth from cultured neurons, and differentiation of PC12 cells (2Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In comparison to Trk family members, p75NTR functions are less well established and remain controversial (3Barker P.A. Cell Death & Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Bredesen D.E. Ye X. Tasinato A. Sperandio S. Wang J.J. Assa-Munt N. Rabizadeh S.

Cell Death & Differ. 1998; 5: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). p75NTR has been shown to facilitate and regulate the function of Trk receptors (6Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 7Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S.

However, p75NTR is also capable of triggering cellular responses independent of Trk receptors (7Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S.

A. 1994; 91: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar): in the absence of neurotrophins, overexpression of p75NTR induces apoptosis. Furthermore, studies of p75-null mice revealed increased numbers and somal sizes of medial septal and diagonal band cholinergic neurons compared with control animals (10Van der Zee C.E. Ross G.M. Riopelle R.J. Hagg T. Science. 1996; 274: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,11Yeo T. Chua-Couzens J. Valletta J. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Mobley W.C. Longo F.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7594-7605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that p75NTR is likely to be involved in the programmed cell death of this population of neurons. In addition, p75NTR has been reported to mediate NGF-induced NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activation in Schwann cells (12Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm- Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and SAPK/JNK (stress-activated protein kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation in oligodendrocytes (13Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p75NTR belongs to the TNFR/NGFR cell surface receptor superfamily (14Smith C. Farrah T. Goodwin R. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). Based on their intracellular domains, the TNFR/NGFR receptor superfamily members are divided into two major subgroups: one group that includes the so-called “death domain” and another that does not (4Bredesen D.E. Ye X. Tasinato A. Sperandio S. Wang J.J. Assa-Munt N. Rabizadeh S. Cell Death & Differ. 1998; 5: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Members of the former group, including Fas and TNFR I, typically mediate apoptosis. In contrast, members of the latter group often differentially deliver signals for either induction or suppression of apoptosis, depending upon the cell contexts. Remarkably, compared with the extensive literature describing signal transduction of TNFR, FAS/APO-1, and other members of this cytokine receptor family, little is known about the p75NTR signal transduction pathways. Ligand binding to TNFR and FAS/APO-1 induces receptor aggregation, recruiting cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as FADD and pro-caspase-8 to the receptor complex (15Wallach D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, this has not been shown to be the case for p75NTR. One family of signaling proteins in the TNF receptor complex is composed of the TRAF family proteins, originally described by Goeddel and colleagues (16Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). TRAF proteins were isolated based on their ability to interact with the cytosolic domains of specific TNFR family members. To date, six members of the TRAF family have been identified. These TRAF proteins have two main characteristics: first, all contain conserved C-terminal TRAF domains, which are responsible for homo- or heteroligomerization and for the interaction with the cytoplasmic regions of specific TNFR superfamily receptors (16Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D.

Second, all TRAF proteins other than TRAF1 contain an N-terminal RING finger structure and multiple zinc fingers, which appear to be critical for their effector functions (17Cheng G. Cleary A.M.

TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 interact with the downstream kinase NF-κB inducing kinase (24Song H.Y. Régnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) have also been reported to interact with TRAF proteins and mediate NF-κB activation. On the other hand, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ASK1, a TRAF interacting kinase, was recently demonstrated to be a downstream target of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 in the JNK signaling pathway (30Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). To investigate signal transduction mediated by p75NTR, we analyzed the interaction between p75NTR and the TRAF family members. Here we show that all six TRAF proteins interact with p75NTR. These proteins constitute the first group of adapter molecules to be identified for p75NTR. We also demonstrate that TRAF2 and TRAF4 bind to distinct domains of p75NTR, and TRAF2, TRAF4, and TRAF6 differentially modulate the ability of this receptor to induce cell death and NF-κB activation. Immortalized 293T cells, derived from human embryonic kidney, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Transient transfections of HKE 293T cells were performed using a modified calcium-phosphate procedure as described previously (31Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Efficiency of transfection was estimated in parallel experiments using eukaryotic assay vector pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pCH110 contains the gene encoding β-galactosidase under control of the SV40 early promoter. Cells that express β-galactosidase were monitored by 5-bromo-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside staining. The coding region of human TRAF1, murine TRAF5, and human TRAF6 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pSG5-TRAF1 (gift of G. Mosialos), pMKITNeo-HA-mTRAF5 (gift of H.

After digestion, the EcoRI/XhoI fragments were ligated into pcDNA3-myc (gift of Y. Takahashi) to create pcDNA3-myc-hTRAF1, pcDNA3-myc-mTRAF5, and pcDNA3-myc-hTRAF6. The full-length human TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, and TRAF4 (308–470) were cloned in-frame into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA vector (32Krajewski S. Zapata J. Krajewska M. Van Arsdale T. Shabaik A.

IκBαM, an IκBα dominant negative mutant was obtained from Doug Green (34Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar) driving luciferase expression. NF-κB activity was monitored by measuring the luciferase activity of cells transfected with NF-κB reporter gene. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with various TRAF and p75NTR constructs in the presence of the reporter (ratio 5:1). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined using the Boehringer Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. One-dimensional immunoblotting experiments using antibodies raised against p75NTR (Promega), Myc epitope (Babco), or HA epitope (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were performed as described previously (36Srinivasan A. Foster L.M. Testa M.P. Ord T. Keane R.W. Bredesen D.E. Kayalar C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5654-5660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results were detected with the ECL system (Amersham) and autoradiographs were recorded onto X-Omat AR films (Kodak). The analysis was performed within the range of linearity of the film. Cell death was analyzed using the trypan blue staining procedure as described previously (37Mah S.P. Zhong L.T. Liu Y. Roghani A. Edwards R.H. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 17 μm tamoxifen (Sigma) for 2 h before being collected, washed in serum-free media, and resuspended in serum-free medium. Cells were stained with 0.04% trypan blue (Sigma) before counting. The percentage of cell death was determined as the percentage of trypan blue positive cells in each sample. p75IC(Lys245-Val396), p75ICΔC83(Lys245-Leu313), and p75ICΔN82(Thr327-Leu386) were polymerase chain reaction amplified and cloned into GST (glutathioneS-transferase) fusion expression vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5′ primers were: 1) 5′-CGGGATCCGCAATGAAGAGGTGGAACAGCTGC-3′ (for GST:p75IC and GST:p75ICΔC83); 2) 5′-CGCGGATCCACCTGGCGACATCTGGCAGGC-3′ (for p75ICΔN82). The 3′ primers were: 1) 5′-ACGTCGACTCACACTGGGGATGTGGCAGTGGACTC-3′ (for GST:p75IC) and 2) 5′-ACGTCGACTACAGGGGCAGGCTACTG-3′ (for GST:p75ICΔC83); and 3) 5′CGGAATTCGCTTAGACTCTCCACAATGTCAGC3′ (for GST:p75ICΔN82). GST:p75IC and GST:p75ICΔC83 were cloned in-frame intoBamHI-SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1. p75ICΔN82 was cloned in BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. For in vitrobinding assays, HEK 293T cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with expression vectors for different TRAFs. 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of E1A buffer (18Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). For eachin vitro binding assay, 5 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with 250 μl of cell lysate overnight at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed multiple times with the same buffer. Proteins on the beads were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Co-transfected HEK 293T were harvested, washed, and resuspended in E1A buffer (500 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) (18Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (Babco), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or anti-Flag antibody (M2, Kodak), using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). After extensive washes, proteins bound to the Sepharose were analyzed by immunoblotting. In light of the signal transduction mediated by the interactions between TNFR family members and the TRAF proteins, we investigated the potential interactions between p75NTR and TRAF family members. Flag-tagged p75NTR and HA- or Myc-tagged TRAF1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 were coexpressed in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. After the immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-TRAF2, anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies, p75NTR was found to associate with all of the TRAF proteins (Fig. 1). These findings suggested that p75NTR bound to TRAF proteins via the conserved C-terminal TRAF domain. In support of this idea, N-terminal deletion mutants of TRAF2 and 4, which retained the TRAF domains, were found to associate with p75NTR (Fig. 1, B andC). The intracellular domain of p75NTR contains two distinct regions: a highly conserved and unstructured juxtamembrane region and a six-helical bundle type II death domain-like sequence in the C terminus (38Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To map the domains required for TRAF interaction within p75NTR, we utilized a GST pull-down assay. Various deletion mutants of GST-p75IC fusion proteins were incubated with TRAF2 or TRAF4 in HEK 293T cell extracts. Immunoblotting of the proteins precipitated by the glutathione-Sepharose showed that TRAF2 interacted with the C-terminal helical region of the p75IC (Thr327-Leu386) (Fig.2 B). In contrast, TRAF4 associated with the N-terminal juxtamembrane region of p75IC (Lys245-Gly313) (Fig. 2 B). In a recent report, it was shown that TRAF6 also bound to the juxtamembrane region of p75NTR (39Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TRAF2, -5, and -6 have been demonstrated to be mediators of NF-κB activation initiated by multiple TNFR family members (20Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 21Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that p75NTR may induce the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in Schwann cells following NGF binding (12Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm- Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.-A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRAF proteins have any effect on p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation, we utilized a luciferase reporter system in HEK 293T cells. Overexpression of p75NTR in HEK 293T cells led to a modest activation of NF-κB, measured by NF-κB dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 3). Co-transfection of a trans-dominant inhibitor for NF-κB activation, IκBαM (34Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar), resulted in increased apoptosis in comparison to that induced by p75NTR expression alone (Fig.4). This finding indicates that NF-κB plays an anti-apoptotic rather than a pro-apoptotic role during p75NTR induced cell death in HEK 293T cells. Our observation is compatible with previous reports that the NF-κB activation protects various types of cells against apoptosis caused by stimuli including TNF-α, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapy drugs (34Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 40Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with 2.5 μg of pFKBP-p75IC (p75+) or pcDNA3 control plasmid (p75−) and 2.5 μg of pLXSN or NF-κB activation super suppressor pLXSN-IκBαM. Cell death was monitored 48 h after transfection, using trypan blue exclusion as described under “Materials and Methods.” Standard deviations are indicated (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although all six TRAF proteins were found to interact with p75NTR, only TRAF2, -4, and -6 had significant effects on p75NTR-induced NF-κB activation when each of the six TRAF family proteins was individually coexpressed with p75NTRand NF-κB response was measured by NF-κB dependent luciferase activity (data not shown). Both TRAF2-p75NTR and TRAF6-p75NTR coexpression had synergistic effects on NF-κB activation. Overexpression of TRAF2 by itself led to an approximately 5-fold induction of NF-κB dependent luciferase activity. While expression of p75NTR alone led to only a modest NF-κB activation of 3-fold, coexpression of TRAF2 with p75NTR led to NF-κB activation of approximately 12-fold (Fig. 3 A). In comparison to TRAF2, coexpression of TRAF6 with p75NTR had a more profound synergistic effect on NF-κB activation: expression of TRAF6 alone led to an increase of NF-κB dependent luciferase production of 30-fold, whereas coexpression of TRAF6 with p75NTR led to an activation of approximately 90-fold (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the positive effect on NF-κB activation conferred by TRAF2 and TRAF6, TRAF4 had an inhibitory effect on p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation. TRAF4 expression in the absence of p75NTR had no effect on the basal level of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 C), compatible with previous reports for TRAF4 (42Kawamata S. Hori T. Imura A. Takaori-Kondo A. Uchiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5808-5814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, when coexpressed with p75NTR, TRAF4 completely blocked NF-κB activation by p75NTR (Fig. 3 C). We further analyzed whether TRAF4 could affect NF-κB activation induced by TRAF2/p75NTR or TRAF6/p75NTR. Interestingly, TRAF4 selectively blocked NF-κB activation induced by co-transfection of TRAF6 and p75NTR (Fig. 3 D), suggesting the possible competition between TRAF4 and TRAF6 for p75NTR. TRAF4 expression did not affect NF-κB activation by TRAF6 alone, nor did it affect NF-κB activation by TRAF2 or TRAF2/p75NTR (Fig. 3 D). One of the important functions of p75NTR is apoptosis induction, which has been described both in the absence of neurotrophins (8Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L. Yang J. Bitler C. Butcher L. Bredesen D. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 9Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7594-7605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and following neurotrophin binding (43Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Dobrowsky R. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 44Frade J.-M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.-A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In cases in which p75NTR was shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis in the absence of ligand binding, the pro-apoptotic effect of p75NTR overexpression could be reversed by dimeric peptides derived from NGF (45Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y.M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), FKBP based dimerizing drugs,2 or (dimeric) neurotrophins (8Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L. Yang J. Bitler C. Butcher L. Bredesen D. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of TRAF family members on p75NTR-induced apoptosis, with and without enforced dimerization. We utilized the fusion construct of p75IC and the FK506-binding protein (FKBP), pFKBP-p75IC, described by Wang et al. 2This construct allows enforced dimerization of p75IC upon addition of the divalent ligand AP15102 (46Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). As described,2 expression of monomeric p75IC in the absence of AP1510-induced cell death in HEK 293T cells. Addition of AP1510 led to the dimerization of p75IC and inhibition of cell death, demonstrating that p75IC in the monomeric form, but not multimeric form, induces cell death. Coexpression of TRAF2, TRAF4, or TRAF6 with pFKBP-p75IC had prominent yet distinct effects on p75NTR-induced apoptosis in HEK 293T cells. Coexpression of TRAF2 with p75NTR led to a marked increase of p75NTR-induced cell death (Fig.5 A). Expression of TRAF2 in the absence of p75NTR was not pro-apoptotic, arguing that TRAF2 enhances the pro-apoptotic effect of p75NTR but is not, in and of itself, pro-apoptotic (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, expression of a TRAF2 dominant negative mutant lacking the N-terminal 272 amino acids (T2ΔN) significantly decreased p75NTR-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). Apoptosis induced by the coexpression of TRAF2 and pFKBP-p75IC was completely suppressed by enforced dimerization with AP1510. Thus although TRAF2 markedly enhanced p75NTR-induced apoptosis, it did not affect the ability of dimerization to suppress the pro-apoptotic effect of p75NTR. In contrast, TRAF4 expression did not enhance monomeric p75NTR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 C). However, TRAF4 completely suppressed the ability of p75NTRdimerization to block cell death induction by p75NTR (Fig.5 C). TRAF6, in contrast, protected HEK 293T cells from p75NTR-induced apoptosis. Coexpression of TRAF6 suppressed cell death induced by monomeric p75NTR. The suppression of cell death was as efficient as that resulting from enforced dimerization of pFKBP-p75IC with AP1510 (Fig. 5 D). As with TRAF2, TRAF6 did not affect the suppression of p75-induced cell death upon dimerization with AP1510 (Fig. 5 D). Because of the multimerization-dependent effects of TRAF2 and TRAF4 on p75NTR induced apoptosis, TRAF2 affecting p75NTR-induced apoptosis, which is a function of p75NTR monomer, and TRAF4 affecting the inhibition of apoptosis induction that occurs with p75NTR dimerization, we investigated the interactions between TRAF2, TRAF4, and p75NTR as a function of p75NTR dimerization. pFKBP-p75IC was coexpressed with TRAF2 or TRAF4 in HEK 293T cells, and AP1510 was administered to induce dimerization of p75NTR. Fig. 6 B shows that TRAF4 coimmunoprecipitated with dimeric, but not monomeric, p75NTR. In contrast, TRAF2 interacted preferentially with monomeric p75NTR (Fig. 6 A). Some p75NTR did coimmunoprecipitate with TRAF2 in the presence of AP1510. This may either represent incomplete dimerization of pFKBP-p75IC by AP1510 (in which case, residual monomeric p75NTR may be coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF2) or binding of TRAF2 to dimeric p75NTR with reduced affinity. In either case, however, TRAF2 interacted preferentially with monomeric p75NTR, whereas TRAF4 interacted solely with dimeric p75NTR. Although accumulated evidence has demonstrated the ability of the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR to signal in the absence of Trk proteins in certain cellular contexts (4Bredesen D.E. Ye X. Tasinato A. Sperandio S. Wang J.J. Assa-Munt N. Rabizadeh S. Cell Death & Differ. 1998; 5: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Carter B.D. Lewin G.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 187-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the nature of p75NTR signaling pathways has been elusive. In the current study, we observed that multiple TRAF family members interacted with the common neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation after overepression in HEK 293T cells. Considering that TRAF proteins are capable of forming hetero- and homodimers through the common TRAF domain (or the unique isoleucine zipper regions in the case of TRAF3 and TRAF5) (48Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the interactions we detected between TRAF proteins and p75NTR may be direct or indirect. NMR structural analysis has disclosed two distinct structural domains in the intracytoplasmic region of p75NTR: an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal region with six α-helices. The latter region is reminiscent of the structure of the death domains of Fas and RAIDD (38Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), with the exception that Fas and RAIDD display a type I death domain, whereas p75NTR displays a type II death domain. In the current study, we found that TRAF2, TRAF4, and TRAF6 selectively interact with these two different regions of p75NTR. Specifically, the TRAF2-p75NTRinteraction required the helical C-terminal region (residues Thr327-Leu386) and the TRAF4-p75NTRand TRAF6-p75NTR interactions required the juxtamembrane region (residues Lys245-Gly313) (39Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A similar scenario has been reported for CD40-TRAF interactions: TRAF1, -2, -3, and -5 bind to a different region of CD40 than the site required for TRAF6 interaction (48Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 49Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TRAF2 and TRAF6, when coexpressed with p75NTR, enhanced the modest NF-κB activation induced by p75NTR expression alone, consistent with their roles as NF-κB activators in the signaling pathways triggered by other members of the TNFR/NGFR superfamily. TRAF6 was a much stronger inducer of NF-κB activation than TRAF2. No previous role has been described for TRAF4, although it demonstrates structural similarity to other TRAF proteins. Our current results indicate that TRAF4 is a negative regulator of NF-κB activation by p75NTR: TRAF4 inhibited NF-κB activation by both p75NTR and p75NTR/TRAF6 while it did not affect NF-κB activation induced by TRAF2-p75NTRcoexpression. These data suggest that signals derived from TRAF2 and TRAF6 may be differentially regulated, which would be compatible with the observation that TRAF4 and TRAF6 bound to the juxtamembrane region of p75NTR, while TRAF2 interacted with the C-terminal helical region of p75NTR. We also found that the interactions between TRAF proteins and p75NTR could modulate p75NTR-induced apoptosis in HEK 293T cells with markedly differing results: TRAF2 enhanced monomeric p75NTR-mediated apoptosis, but had no effect on apoptosis in the absence of p75NTR. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2, TRAF2 (272–501), inhibited p75NTR-induced cell death, arguing that TRAF2 plays a role in the endogenous pathway of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. TRAF2, however, did not affect the dimerization-induced inhibition of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. This combination of effects is compatible with the finding that TRAF2 interacted preferentially with monomeric p75NTR. In contrast, TRAF4 interacted with dimeric, but not monomeric, p75NTR, and its functional effects on p75NTR-induced apoptosis were found to be compatible with that interaction: TRAF4 had no effect on p75NTRmonomer-induced apoptosis, but TRAF4 completely suppressed the dimerization-induced inhibition of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. In the case of TRAF6, it protected HEK 293T cells from p75NTR monomer-induced cell death, but did not have a significant effect on the inhibition of apoptosis upon dimerization of p75NTR. According to the recent report by Khursigaraet al. (39Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), TRAF6 interacts with multimerized p75NTR since interaction between TRAF6 and p75NTR is dependent on NGF binding. The role of NF-κB activation during apoptosis induced by various stimuli is still in debate. In our current studies, NF-κB activation did not correlate well with apoptosis induction, implying that other variables (e.g. SAPK/JNK activation) may turn out to be more important. On one hand, NF-κB activation appeared to protect HEK 293T cells from p75NTR-induced cell death, since the expression of the transdominant inhibitor for NF-κB activation, IκBαM, led to an elevated level of apoptosis when cells were challenged by overexpression of p75NTR. Also, the strong NF-κB inducer TRAF6 was cell protective, and the NF-κB inhibitor TRAF4 blocked cell rescue upon dimerization of p75NTR. On the other hand, TRAF2 promoted cell death yet increased NF-κB activation. It has been reported that targeted disruption of the TRAF2 gene in mice results in increased sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis, implying an antiapoptotic function for TRAF2 (50Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). However, there may be distinct regulation of the signals derived from the interactions between p75NTR and TRAF2 or TRAF6, since these interactions were mapped to different regions in the intracytoplasmic region of p75NTR. In addition, the fact that TRAF2 interacts with reporter-interacting protein, a death-domain-containing protein kinase may possibly explain why, as a NF-κB activator, TRAF2 is able to enhance p75NTR-induced cell death, given that overexpression of reporter-interacting protein has been shown to induce apoptosis, mimicking TNFα effect on cells (51Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The effect of TRAF2 and TRAF4 on p75NTR-induced cell death and NF-κB activation is consistent with our unpublished observations 3X. Ye, T. VanArsdale, H. Zhang, and D. E. Bredesen, unpublished observations. that TRAF2 and TRAF4 are expressed endogenously in PC12 cells. TRAF4 is reported to be expressed in post-mitotic undifferentiated neurons (52Masson R. Régnier C.H. Chenard M-P. Wendling C. Mattei M-G. Tomasetto C. Rio M-C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating its function in neural development and neurogenesis. Our results suggest a model for the effects of TRAF2, TRAF4, and TRAF6 on p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation and apoptosis (Fig. 7). They do not exclude the possibility that these TRAF family members have effects on other cellular parameters. Furthermore, cells other than HEK 293T cells may respond differently. HEK 293T cells were utilized because the pro-apoptotic effects of p75NTR in neural cells have been reproduced in HEK 293T cells,2 and thus HEK 293T cells serve as a useful model for studies of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. It is important to analyze the functions of the various TRAF proteins in vivo using mice with targeted disruption of the TRAF genes. Future in vivo studies should provide additional insight into the functions of these signal transducing molecules and the signaling pathways trigged by the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR.

https://openalex.org/W2083314849,"TEL is a gene frequently involved in specific chromosomal translocations in human leukemia and sarcoma that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcriptional regulators. TEL is unusual among other ETS proteins by its ability to self-associatein vivo, a property that is essential to the oncogenic activation of TEL-derived fusion proteins. We show here that TEL is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of ETS-binding site-driven transcription of model and natural promoters. Deletion of the oligomerization domain of TEL or its substitution by the homologous region of monomeric ETS1 impaired the ability of TEL to repress. In contrast, substitution of the oligomerization domain of TEL by unrelated oligomerization domains resulted in an active repressor, showing that the ability of TEL to repress depends on its ability to self-associate. The study of the properties of TEL fusions to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4 identified two autonomous repression domains in TEL, distinct from its oligomerization domain, that are essential to the ability of TEL to repress ETS-binding site-containing promoters. These results have implications for the normal function of TEL, its relation to other ETS proteins, and its role in leukemogenesis.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4374-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). TEL shares with other ETS proteins an evolutionarily conserved domain (ETS domain) that is responsible for its ability to bind consensus ETS-binding site (EBS) DNA elements (12Poirel H. Oury C. Carron C. Duprez E. Laabi Y. Tsapis A. Romana S.P. Mauchauffe M. Le Coniat M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It also shares with a subset of other ETS proteins a conserved amino-terminal domain that is referred to as the B domain, the pointed domain, or the helix-loop-helix domain (2Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Lovett M. Gilliland D.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 14Jousset C. Carron C. Boureux A. Tran Quang C. Oury C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Charon M. Levin J. Bernard O. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the structure of the B/pointed domain of ETS1 by NMR shows that this domain identifies a novel fold, unrelated to the helix-loop-helix motif (15Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. Donaldson L.W. Mackereth C.D. Seidel J.J. Graves B. McIntosh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although its precise function is unknown, the B/pointed domain of several ETS proteins appears to modulate their transcriptional activation properties, presumably via specific protein-protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogene as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-88Google Scholar). The B domain of TEL has the unique property of inducing its stable homotypic oligomerization as well as that of TEL-derived fusion proteins (4Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E. McLaughlin J.

The ability of this domain to induce protein self-association results in the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of TEL-ABL, TEL- platelet-derived growth factor β receptor, and TEL-JAK2, a property that is essential to their transforming and leukemogenic properties (4Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E. McLaughlin J. Bohlander S.K. Rowley J.D. Witte O.N. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Lacronique V.

Tsai S. Zielinska-Kwiatkowska A.G. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17525-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the transcriptional regulatory properties of TEL are unknown. We show here that TEL is a potent sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of both model and natural EBS-containing promoters/enhancers. TEL repressive activity is shown to depend upon both its ability to oligomerize through the B domain and the presence of distinct autonomous repression domains.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that TEL encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. TEL-repressive activity depends upon two autonomous transcriptional repression domains. The first maps to a region rich in proline residues (20% proline between amino acid residues 171 and 285). High content in proline is a feature found in other transcriptional repression domains (23Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The second encompasses the 55 carboxyl-terminal residues of the exon 5-derived region and the adjacent ETS domain. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to its role in nuclear localization and specific DNA binding, the ETS domain also mediates protein-protein interactions with unrelated factors either on its own or in combination with an adjacent domain (25Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 27Kim W.Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions are rather promiscuous with several ETS domains being able to interact with the same partner, whereas others are highly specific. The ETS domain of ETS1 can replace that of TEL, suggesting that the exon 5-encoded moiety of this repression domain is essential to its specificity. The analysis of deletion and substitution mutants in the oligomerization/B domain show that in order to repress EBS-driven transcription, TEL needs to assemble into oligomers. This suggests that self-association is likely to release TEL repression domains from inhibitory constraints to activate their interaction with either transcriptional co-repressors or with components of the RNA polymerase II initiation complex.Whether the oligomerization/B domain of TEL is also associated with intrinsic repressive properties could not be addressed directly since its fusion to the DNA binding domains of either Gal4 or LexA resulted in insoluble proteins. 2R. G. Lopez, C. Carron, C. Oury, P. Gardellin, O. Bernard, and J. Ghysdael, unpublished observations.However, the fact that the unrelated oligomerization domain of Zebra and Gal42 can replace the oligomerization domain of TEL to generate an active repressor does not support this notion. Like Gal4-DBD, the Zebra coiled-coil domain is not a repression domain as evidenced by its inability to regulate LexA operator-driven transcription when fused to the LexA DNA binding domain.2We therefore favor a model in which the main contribution of the B domain of TEL to EBS-mediated repression is to induce protein self-association.The oligomerization domain of TEL shares significant homology to the SPM domain found in a subset of the Polycomb group of transcriptional repressors and their vertebrate homologs (28Bornemann D. Miller E. Simon J. Development. 1996; 122: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SPM domain is important to both homotypic and heterotypic interactions between these proteins and the assembly of multiprotein complexes (29Peterson A.J. Kyba M. Bornemann D. Morgan K. Brock H.W. Simon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6683-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that TEL is unlikely to be a component ofPolycomb group complexes. First, we failed to detect heteromer formation between TEL and Rae28, the mouse homolog ofDrosophila Polyhomeotic.2 Second, immunofluorescence analyses show that TEL does not co-localize with the large nuclear domains formed by Polycomb group proteins in mammalian cells. 3A. Otte and J. G., unpublished observations.In the ETS family, TEL is most closely related to DrosophilaYAN in both the ETS and B domains. YAN was genetically identified as an inhibitor of the Sevenless signaling pathway in R7 photoreceptor cell development (30Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and more generally in establishing proper regulation of several developmental decisions (31Rebay I. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 857-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 32Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Rogge R. Green P.J. Urano J. Horn-Saban S. Mlodzik M. Shilo B.Z. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. Development. 1995; 121: 3947-3958PubMed Google Scholar). YAN is also a repressor of EBS-driven transcription that can compete for DNA binding with transcriptional activators of the ETS family likePntP2 or interfere with the activity of unrelated factors like D-Jun (34O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 35Treier M. Bohmann D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1995; 83: 753-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whether the repressive activity of YAN also requires its B domain and whether it depends upon an intrinsic repression domain is unknown. The B domain of YAN is also endowed with self-oligomerization properties, although the strength of the interaction is weaker than that of TEL.2 This suggests that YAN-repressive function may also require self-association. YAN function is negatively controlled by extracellular signal-regulated kinase in cell fate specification in the eye and by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in dorsal closure, a property that appears to result from its direct phosphorylation by these kinases on several serine and threonine residues (31Rebay I. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 857-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 32Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TEL phosphorylation is also induced following activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in mammalian cells. TEL therefore appears to belong to the small class of ETS transcriptional repressors including YAN, ERF (36Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and NET (37Maira S. Wurtz J. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5849-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) whose activity is controlled by mitogenic and/or cell cycle-dependent signals.Although frequently altered in human leukemia, TEL is not essential for the differentiation of mouse hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and fetal liver hematopoiesis in vivo (13Wang L.C. Kuo F. Fujiwara Y. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4374-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, TEL appears to be required for hematopoietic stem cells and/or committed progenitors of all lineages to stably colonize bone marrow (38Wang L.C. Swat W. Fujiwara Y. Davidson L. Visvader J. Kuo F. Alt F.W. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2392-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This suggests that TEL could act in concert either with specific activators of the ETS family or with unrelated activators to control the response of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to stroma-derived signals. Such a dual control could ensure that transient stroma-controlled intracellular signals result in important changes in the expression of genes involved in either migration, homing, proliferation, and/or differentiation of these cells.The most frequent chromosomal translocation involving TEL in leukemia is the t(12;21)(p13;q22) which is found in about 25% of the cases of childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the expression of a TEL-AML1 chimeric protein in which the 336 amino-terminal residues of TEL are fused to most of AML1B, a Runt family protein (8Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Bohlander S.K. Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray-Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C. Rowley J.D. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1995; 85: 3662-3670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the promoter context, AML1B is either an activator or a repressor of transcription (for review see Ref. 39Ito Y. Bae S.C. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogene as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 107-132Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TEL-AML1 is a repressor of model promoters normally activated by AML1B in transient transfection assays, suggesting that its leukemogenic properties may result from repression of genes normally activated by AML1B (40Hiebert S.W. Sun W. Davis J.N. Golub T. Shurtleff S. Buijs A. Downing J.R. Grosveld G. Roussell M.F. Gilliland D.G. Lenny N. Meyers S. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the repression domains of TEL identified in our study is retained in TEL-AML1. If this domain turns out to be active in TEL-AML1 to repress physiologically important genes, leukemogenesis by TEL-AML1 could also involve the abnormal regulation of genes normally repressed by AML1 through the use of TEL-specific repressive mechanisms.A frequent feature of TEL-AML1-associated leukemia is the loss of the non-rearranged TEL allele, a property that appears to be associated with disease progression (8Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Bohlander S.K. Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray-Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C. Rowley J.D. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1996; 88: 785-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As TEL and TEL-AML1 are able to form hetero-oligomers in vitro through their B domain (43McLean T.W. Ringold S. Neuberg D. Stegmaier K. Tantravahi R. Ritz J. Koeffler H.P. Takeuchi S. Janssen J.W. Seriu T. Bartram C.R. Sallan S.E. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 4252-4258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that expression of TEL in t(12;21) leukemic cells interferes with the activity of TEL-AML1. However, TEL appears unable to override the repressive activity of TEL-AML1 in transient assays (40Hiebert S.W. Sun W. Davis J.N. Golub T. Shurtleff S. Buijs A. Downing J.R. Grosveld G. Roussell M.F. Gilliland D.G. Lenny N. Meyers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Alternatively, loss of TEL function could activate a pathway that cooperates with TEL-AML1 in leukemogenesis. Our study shows that TEL is a repressor of the FLI-1 promoter, suggesting that loss of TEL could lead to the deregulated expression ofFLI-1 in t(12;21) leukemic cells. Activation ofFLI-1 expression is observed in >75% of Friend murine leukemia virus-induced mouse erythroleukemia, and enforced expression of FLI-1 is sufficient to inhibit Epo-induced differentiation and to induce proliferation of primary erythroblasts (44Pereira R. Tran Quang C. Lesault I. Dolznig H. Beug H. Ghysdael J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, gain of function mutations of FLI-1 or of the closely related ERG protein as the result of specific chromosomal translocations is a frequent event in human cancer (for review see Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogene as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-88Google Scholar). If TEL indeed controls the expression of FLI-1 in TEL-AML1 leukemic cells, disruption of a FLI-1 pathway could have a more general role in leukemia than previously anticipated. Genes of the ETS family encode transcriptional regulators that are essential for a variety of developmental processes and for the response of cells to extracellular stimuli (for review see Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogene as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-88Google Scholar). Specific ETS genes are frequently rearranged in human solid tumors and leukemias as the result of chromosomal translocations.TEL 1(ETV6) is an ETS family member that was originally identified by virtue of its fusion to the 3′-half of the gene encoding the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia harboring a t(5;12)(q33;p13) chromosomal translocation (2Golub T.R.

TEL shares with other ETS proteins an evolutionarily conserved domain (ETS domain) that is responsible for its ability to bind consensus ETS-binding site (EBS) DNA elements (12Poirel H. Oury C. Carron C. Duprez E. Laabi Y. Tsapis A. Romana S.P. Mauchauffe M. Le Coniat M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It also shares with a subset of other ETS proteins a conserved amino-terminal domain that is referred to as the B domain, the pointed domain, or the helix-loop-helix domain (2Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Lovett M. Gilliland D.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 14Jousset C. Carron C. Boureux A. Tran Quang C. Oury C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Charon M.

The recent elucidation of the structure of the B/pointed domain of ETS1 by NMR shows that this domain identifies a novel fold, unrelated to the helix-loop-helix motif (15Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N.

Although its precise function is unknown, the B/pointed domain of several ETS proteins appears to modulate their transcriptional activation properties, presumably via specific protein-protein interactions (for review, see Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogene as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-88Google Scholar). The B domain of TEL has the unique property of inducing its stable homotypic oligomerization as well as that of TEL-derived fusion proteins (4Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E. McLaughlin J.

The ability of this domain to induce protein self-association results in the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of TEL-ABL, TEL- platelet-derived growth factor β receptor, and TEL-JAK2, a property that is essential to their transforming and leukemogenic properties (4Golub T.R.

We show here that TEL is a potent sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of both model and natural EBS-containing promoters/enhancers. TEL repressive activity is shown to depend upon both its ability to oligomerize through the B domain and the presence of distinct autonomous repression domains. DISCUSSIONThis study shows that TEL encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. TEL-repressive activity depends upon two autonomous transcriptional repression domains.

Since this channel is normally activated by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation, we examined kinase activities recruited following βA treatment of cortical neurons and SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma. βA increased channel phosphorylation; this increase was unaffected by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 but was reduced by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor PD98059. Pharmacological and antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of MAP kinase activity also reduced βA-induced accumulation of calcium, reactive oxygen species, phospho-tau immunoreactivity, and apoptosis. These findings indicate that MAP kinase mediates multiple aspects of βA-induced neurotoxicity and indicates that calcium influx initiates neurodegeneration in AD. βA increased MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of membrane-associated proteins and reduced phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins without increasing overall MAP kinase activity. Increasing MAP kinase activity with epidermal growth factor did not increase channel phosphorylation. These findings indicate that redirection, rather than increased activation, of MAP kinase activity mediates βA-induced neurotoxicity.

Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid reactive oxygen species mitogen-activated protein bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the cognitive function of the brain. Pathological changes in AD are punctuated by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as well as extensive neuronal loss (1Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Amyloid plaques, which accumulate extracellularly, are composed of aggregated β-amyloid (βA; Refs. 2Prelli F. Castano E. Glenner G.G. Frangione B. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 3Mori H. Takio K. Ogawara M. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17082-17086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 42-amino acid peptide is generated by alternate cleavage from the larger “amyloid precursor protein” (4Haas C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J.

Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 237-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). βA is either directly toxic to neurons in culture or potentiates neuronal vulnerability to excitatory neurotoxins (e.g. Refs. 6Koh J. Yang L.L. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1990; 533: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar and 7Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects may derive from the formation of ion channels within the cell membrane by βA, fostering direct leakage of calcium into cells (8Lin M. Mirzabekov T. Kagan B. Fiskum G. Neurodegenerative Diseases. Plenum Press, New York1996: 331-336Crossref Google Scholar). Additional studies indicate that, rather than forming de novo calcium channels, βA induces calcium influx via existing channels (9Shea T.B. Prabhakar S. Ekinci F.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), including the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel (10Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Increased calcium influx, with resultant disruption of calcium homeostasis, may be the underlying cause of βA neurotoxicity and ultimate neurodegeneration (7Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Arias C. Arrieta I. Tapia R. J. Neurosci.

A consequence of disruption in calcium homeostasis is the induction of oxidative stress and accumulation of free radicals, collectively referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS; Ref. 15Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). One target of ROS is the phospholipid membrane (16Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar, 17McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar, 18Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulative ROS-induced membrane damage compromises membrane integrity and increases the permeability of several ions, including calcium; resultant calcium influx is a crucial factor in neurodegeneration (19Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Copani A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Calcium influx, moreover, promotes recruitment of other ion channels and generation of additional ROS, resulting in neuronal excitotoxicity (20Dykens J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 21Choi D.W. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 58-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 22Khodorov B.

Importantly, ROS accumulation fosters calcium influx, which, in turn, fosters yet further ROS accumulation (23Lafon-Cazal M. Pletri S. Culcasi M. Bockaert J. Nature. 1993; 364: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). βA-induced aberrant calcium influx may therefore initiate a cascade of cytosolic calcium and ROS accumulation. In this regard, additional studies have attributed βA toxicity to ROS accumulation (24Behl C. Davis J. Cole G.M. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 25Behl C. Davis J. Lesley R. Schubert D.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel (activated by βA; Ref. 10Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) is activated by phosphorylation (27Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), elucidation of kinase pathways activated by βA represents one potential approach toward understanding βA-induced neurodegeneration. In the present study, we demonstrate that βA induces calcium influx by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel and that inhibition of MAP kinase activity prevents multiple known aspects of βA toxicity. SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine scrum in 5% CO2. Cultures were differentiated for 7 days with 10 μm retinoic acid, during which time they elaborate extensive neurites that exhibit characteristics of axons (28Shea T.B. Dergay A.N. Ekinci F.J. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1997; 22: 45-49Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were harvested from day 16 embryonic mice and cultured on poly-l-lysine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing B27 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the absence of serum according to Ref. 29Boyne L.J. Martin K. Hockfield S. Fischer I. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Cells were utilized 3 days after plating, during which time they had established polarity and elaborated axons (e.g. Fig. 1). SH-SY-5Y cells and cortical neurons were deprived of serum and treated for 2 h with one or more of the following: βA25–35and βA1–40 (Sigma; 10–25 μm for cortical neurons and 22–40 μm for SH-SY-5Y cells (9Shea T.B.

Cultures of SH-SY-5Y cells were radiolabeled by inclusion of 100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate in culture medium during these incubations as described previously (33Shea T.B. Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additional cultures were transfected with oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence of MAP kinase in sense (ATG GCG GCG GCG GCG GCG GCT) or antisense (AGC CGC CGC CGC CGC CGC CAT) orientation; these antisense oligonucleotides have previously been demonstrated effective at down-regulation of MAP kinase steady-state levels (34Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (32 μg) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 32 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) that was diluted to a total of 150 μl with serum-free medium. Cultures in serum-free medium were incubated for 6 h with a final concentration of 4 μg/ml oligonucleotide/Superfect mixture, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum and 4 μg/ml oligonucleotides (without Superfect). Cultures were maintained for 6 days in the presence of oligonucleotides (shown in preliminary studies to be required for reduction of MAP kinase steady-state levels), during which time they received fresh medium containing serum and oligonucleotides every 2 days. All supplies were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Intracellular calcium concentration was monitored as described previously (28Shea T.B. Dergay A.N. Ekinci F.J. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1997; 22: 45-49Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by incubation with Fluo-3 (acetoxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Images were captured using a DAGE CCL-72 cooled CCD camera via a Scion LG-3 frame grabber operated by NIH Image analysis software and stored in a Macintosh Power PC 7100AV (e.g. Refs. 35Cressman C.M. Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 36Shea T.B. Cressman C.M. Beermann M.L. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1539-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis was carried out with NIH Image software (28Shea T.B. Dergay A.N. Ekinci F.J. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1997; 22: 45-49Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cultures were treated with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 20 min. The cultures were rinsed with serum-free medium. Intracellular peroxide levels were measured in individual cells in multiple cultures under a fluorescein optic (24Behl C. Davis J. Cole G.M. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The antioxidant vitamin E (0.15 mg/ml) was included in some cultures to curtail intracellular ROS accumulation, and additional cultures received 10 nmH2O2 to induce ROS (24Behl C. Davis J. Cole G.M. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Cells fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and immunostained by sequential reaction with a mouse monoclonal antibody (PHF-1; generous gift of Dr. Peter Davies) raised against tau from paired helical filaments from AD brains, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and visualization by standard methods (37Shea T.B. Paskevich P.A. Beermann M.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained following substitution of methanol for paraformaldehyde. Additional controls, which yielded only background fluorescence, included substitution of nonimmune murine IgG for PHF-1 or omission of primary antibody. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman, and membrane preparations were generated by centrifugation of the homogenate for 15 min at 13,000 × g (38Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Aliquots of resultant membranes (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) proteins were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The L voltage calcium channel was immunoprecipitated from membrane preparations using a mouse anti-dihydropyridine antibody specific for this channel (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY; Ref. 38Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) followed by protein G-Sepharose via standard procedures (36Shea T.B. Cressman C.M. Beermann M.L. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1539-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated material was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Dried gels were placed against X-Omat film (Kodak) to generate autoradiographs. βA-treated and untreated SH-SY-5Y cultures were rinsed, scraped from the plate, and homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots (200 μg) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for phosphorylated p42 and p44 MAP kinase (NE BioLabs, Beverly, MA), which provided an index of relative levels of phosphorylated (active) kinase. MAP kinase activity was assayed via the “MAP kinase immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay kit” according to the manufacturer's instructions (catalog no. 17-184; Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from additional aliquots (500 μg) by incubation for 2 h with anti-rat MAP kinase antibody R2 complexed with protein A-agarose. Controls included nonspecific IgG instead of anti-MAP IgG. Immunoprecipitated samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C along with myelin basic protein as substrate and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and analyzed by scintillation counting. Fifty to one hundred cells in at least five randomly selected microscopic fields processed as above for cytosolic calcium, ROS, or PHF-1 immunoreactivity were scored for fluorescent intensity using NIH Image analysis software (35Cressman C.M. Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Representative background areas devoid of cells were similarly analyzed and subtracted from cell values to yield net densitometric values. All fields for each individual assay were illuminated, captured, and processed at the identical intensity. Cell aggregates were excluded from the assays; only individual cells were encircled. Immunoblots and autoradiographs were digitized with a UMAX flat bed scanner and subjected to whole band densitometric analyses using NIH Image as described (35Cressman C.M. Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Values were exported to Excel for statistical analyses via Student's t test. SH-SY-5Y cells in duplicate cultures in the absence (Control) or presence of 10 or 20 μm PD98059, 22 μm βA25–35, or both, were trypsinized 24 h after incubation, and viable cells were counted in a hemacytometer using trypan blue. All experiments were carried out at least twice with comparable results. Presented results are representative of all experiments. Our prior studies demonstrated that treatment of SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells and mouse cortical neurons with 40 and 25 μm βA, respectively, induced widespread neurodegeneration within 2 h (9Shea T.B. Prabhakar S. Ekinci F.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, treatment of SH-SY-5Y cells and cortical neurons for 2 h with lower βA concentrations (22 and 10 μm, respectively, did not invoke significant overt cell loss for 24 h, which provided an experimental window to monitor upstream events prior to degeneration. Treatment with these lower concentrations for 30 min to 2 h induced accumulation of phosphorylated tau epitopes common to those that accumulate in affected neurons in AD (Fig. 1). In addition, a 2-h treatment of SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells with βA induced a >6-fold increase in phosphorylation of membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 2). These findings indicated these culture systems could serve as models for probing the intracellular consequences of βA toxicity. Since calcium influx following βA exposure has been attributed to activation of the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel (10Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we examined potential kinases affected by βA treatment. Immunoprecipitation of the channel followed by autoradiography confirmed that βA increased channel phosphorylation by >2-fold (Fig. 3).

Moreover, PD98059 reduced overall phosphorylation of membrane-associated proteins following βA treatment (Fig. 2). As expected, cell-free assays of MAP kinase activity revealed considerable constitutive MAP kinase activity in non-βA-treated SH-SY-5Y cells; no further increase was observed in cells treated for 2 h with βA (Fig.5; but see also Ref. 39Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These findings suggested, at least under conditions of prior activation of MAP kinase, that βA can redirect MAP kinase to phosphorylate the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel without necessarily invoking a significant increase in overall MAP kinase activity. In support of this conclusion, we observed that, along with increasing phosphorylation of membrane-associated proteins, βA induced a compensatory decrease in phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins (Fig.6). Moreover, PD98059 diminished this decrease in cytosolic protein phosphorylation along with inhibiting the increase in membrane-associated protein phosphorylation.Figure 5MAP kinase is constitutively active in differentiated SH-SY-5Y cells and its activity is not increased by short term βA treatment. Homogenates of untreated and βA-treated SH-SY-5Y cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody that recognizes only phosphorylated MAP kinase (top panel) and a MAP activity assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate (lower panel). Note that phosphorylated MAP kinase is present in untreated SH-SY-5Y cells as evidenced by immunoblot analysis; the activity of this kinase was further confirmed by its ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (see also Fig. 4). Note further that no additional increase in MAP kinase activity (as indicated by lack of increase in phosphoisoforms and activity) was induced following βA treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6βA reduces MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins.

SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells and mouse cortical neurons were treated for 30 min to 2 h with and without 22 μm (for neuroblastoma) or 10 μm (for neurons) βA25–35 or βA1–40 in the presence and absence of vitamin E, BAPTA, and 10 μmPD98059 and assayed for calcium influx, ROS and PHF-1 immunoreactivity (Figs. 7 and8). Both βA peptides induced an increase in intracellular calcium, ROS, and phospho-tau immunoreactivity in both culture types (Figs. 7 and 8). Maximal cytosolic calcium levels were obtained prior to maximal levels of ROS and PHF-1 in both cell types (Fig. 7). The intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA, inhibited the βA-induced increase in intracellular calcium, ROS, and PHF-1 (p < 0.001; Fig. 8). The antioxidant, vitamin E, blocked accumulation of ROS and PHF-1 (p < 0.001) but did not significantly lower the level of the βA-induced increase in intracellular calcium (Fig. 8). These latter findings suggested that accumulation of ROS and phospho-tau immunoreactivity may be secondary effects of the βA-induced increase in intracellular calcium. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction in SH-SY-5Y MAP kinase levels (Fig. 9) also diminished βA-induced cytosolic accumulation of calcium, ROS, and PHF-1 (Fig. 10).Figure 8Pharmacological inhibition of MAP kinase diminishes the increase in cytosolic calcium, ROS , and phospho-tau immunoreactivity induced by βA25–35 and βA1–40. Panels present phase and corresponding UV images of representative fields of cortical and SH-SY-5Y cultures processed to visualize calcium, ROS, and PHF-1 immunoreactivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cultures were treated for 2 h as indicated with βA (10 μm for cortical cultures, 22 μm for SH-SY-5Y cells) in the presence and absence of 10 μmPD98059, BAPTA, and vitamin E. For clarity of images, only cells treated with βA1–40 in the presence and absence of PD98059 are presented. The accompanying graphs present densitometric data derived from multiple fields of cultures treated as described above. Both βA peptides induced a significant (p < 0.005 or less) increase in cytosolic calcium, ROS, and PHF-1 in both cell types. Note that BAPTA and PD98059 prevented the βA-induced accumulation of calcium, ROS, and PHF-1 immunoreactivity (p < 0.05 or less). Vitamin E inhibited the βA-induced increase in ROS and PHF-1 (p< 0.05 or less) but did not block calcium accumulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Antisense oligonucleotides reduce steady-state levels of MAP kinase.

Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), continued treatment for 24 h results in approximately 50% loss of both SH-SY-5Y cells (Fig. 7) and cortical neurons (not shown; see also Refs. 9Shea T.B.

These findings further indicate that alterations in MAP kinase activity represent a pivotal event in βA neurotoxicity. Higher levels of this inhibitor were toxic, in accordance with the pivotal role of MAP kinase in signal transduction; as anticipated, toxic levels of PD98059 did not provide protection against βA neurotoxicity (Fig. 11). The findings of the present study confirm and extend the demonstration by Ueda and co-workers (10Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) that βA induces calcium influx via the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel.

Woodgett J.R. Miller C.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 4: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The findings of the present study potentially shed light upon this controversy in that MAP kinase may not directly phosphorylate tau but instead may, by activating the L voltage sensitive calcium channel, foster tau phosphorylation by other calcium-dependent kinases. Notably, the intracellular tau kinases, calcium-calmodulin kinase and protein kinase C, are both calcium-dependent. In addition, prior phosphorylation of tau by CaM or protein kinase C facilitates subsequent phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (57Singh T.J. Zaidi T.O. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 358: 4-8Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 58Singh T.J. Haque N. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 358: 267-272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MAP kinase-mediated calcium influx following βA treatment may therefore induce downstream activation of a succession of tau kinases. Similarly, βA-induced phosphorylation of the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel may involve additional kinases upstream and/or downstream of MAP kinase. In support of the potential involvement of MAP kinase in AD, MAP kinase activity is detected within affected regions susceptible to AD neurodegeneration (59Pei J.J. Sersen E. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Brain Res. 1994; 655: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be activated in AD (60Perry G. Roder H. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Friedlich A. NeuroReport. 1999; Google Scholar), and at least one novel MAP kinase is detected within neurons (61Mohit A.A. Martin J.H. Miller C.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). While βA is capable of increasing MAP kinase activity (39Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Hong S. Joe E.H. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is of interest that, under conditions of constitutive MAP kinase activity, βA is capable of inducing this kinase to phosphorylate a distinct set of substrates without necessarily invoking a significant increase in kinase activity. βA also did not increase MAP kinase activity in a prior study (62Takashima A. Honda T. Yasutake K. Michel G. Murayama O. Murayama M. Ishiguro K. Yamaguchi H. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 31: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that βA can induce neurodegenerative effects by relatively subtle alteration of signal transduction pathways. Subtle alteration of signal transduction is consistent with the protracted degeneration of neurons in situ in AD. Moreover, depending upon the mode of analysis (e.g. canvassing exclusively for increased activity of one or more kinases), such subtle consequences may escape detection. βA-induced neurotoxicity has been separately attributed to calcium influx, ROS accumulation, and increased phosphorylation of tau (7Mattson M.P.

In addition to inhibition of tau phosphorylation, inhibition of MAP kinase prevented multiple consequences of βA toxicity, including accumulation of cytosolic calcium ROS, and ultimate neuronal death. These findings indicate that MAP kinase plays a pivotal role in βA neurotoxicity and highlight MAP kinase-mediated pathways as potential therapeutic targets to alleviate the progression of AD (63Jin L.W. Saitoh T. Drugs Aging. 1995; 6: 136-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this regard, calcium chelation by BAPTA suppressed both ROS phospho-tau accumulation following βA treatment, demonstrating that calcium influx alone can provoke the additional aspects of βA neurotoxicity. This interpretation is further supported by the observation of maximal calcium accumulation prior to that of ROS or PHF-1 during βA treatment of both cortical neurons and SH-SY-5Y cells. Our data also demonstrate that prevention of accumulation of ROS attenutates βA neurotoxicity despite cytosolic calcium accumulation, further suggesting that ROS accumulation is downstream of calcium accumulation in βA toxicity. These findings collectively suggest that aberrant activation of the L voltage-sensitive calcium channel by MAP kinase may represent the initial toxic event resulting from βA treatment. This latter conclusion should be viewed with caution, however, since βA induced MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of many membrane-associated proteins, one or more of which may also contribute to neurodegeneration. An important unexpected aspect of the present study is that redirection, rather than increased activity, of MAP kinase by βA is what promotes the above intracellular cascade leading to neurodegeneration. Epidermal growth factor, which increases MAP kinase activity (32Chajry N. Martin P.-M. Pages G. Cochet C. Afdel K. Berthois Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), did not alter channel phosphorylation, yet βA, which does not increase MAP kinase activity as shown herein, did alter channel phosphorylation. These data suggest that redirection of, rather than an overall increase in, MAP kinase activity is a unique and essential event in βA-induced neurotoxicity."

Tie2 activation and phosphorylation are presumed to occur through mechanisms common to previously described receptor tyrosine kinases,i.e. by inducing receptor dimerization, which leads totrans-phosphorylation. In various systems, receptor tyrosine kinase activation can result from either homo- or heterodimerization, and dimerization has been shown to occur through a variety of mechanisms (13Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Many soluble ligands form covalently or noncovalently linked homo- or hetero-oligomers (13Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

For example, disulfide-linked homodimerization of vascular endothelial growth factor creates a complex with two symmetric vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding sites formed by loop 2 of one vascular endothelial growth factor monomer and loop 3 of the other, thus facilitating the bridging of two receptor molecules (20Heldin C.H.

In contrast, human growth hormone exists as a monomer but has two binding sites capable of binding two growth hormone receptor molecules to induce dimerization (23Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M.

A third mechanism of receptor tyrosine kinase activation has been described for the epidermal growth factor receptor in which the binding of an epidermal growth factor monomer induces a conformational change in the receptor's extracellular domain that stabilizes interactions between two occupied epidermal growth factor receptor molecules (24Hurwitz D.R.

Finally, ligands for the EPH-related family of receptor tyrosine kinases do not function as conventional soluble factors but must be presented in membrane-bound form, possibly facilitating ligand dimerization or aggregation (28Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Which of these mechanisms, if any, mediates Tie2 activation is unclear. We have begun structural analysis of Ang1 and Ang2 to determine the mechanism by which these two ligands have opposing effects on endothelial Tie2. These two structurally related glycoproteins are predominantly composed of an amino-terminal coiled coil domain and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. Here we show that Ang1 and Ang2 form distinct arrays of homo-oligomeric complexes mediated by their coiled coil domains but that their differential effects on endothelial-Tie2 phosphorylation is mediated by their fibrinogen-like domains. Murine Ang1 cDNA was cloned from cytoplasmic RNA from C2C12 murine myoblasts by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by polymerase chain reaction amplified with oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CGCTGGCAGTACAATGACAGT-3′ and 5′-GTGGCGATTCTGTTGACCTCA-3′ withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The Ang1 cDNA sequence was confirmed to be correct and includes 13 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region (including the translation initiation consensus recognition sequence (29Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar)), the entire Ang1 coding region, and 180 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region. Murine Ang2 cDNA was similarly cloned from total cellular RNA isolated from the uterus of a CD1xC57BL/6xSJL mouse using oligonucleotide primers, 5′-ACAGCCCTGTGCCTTAGACAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTATGCACTGGTGTCTCTCA-3′, and includes 85 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region, the entire protein coding domain, and 79 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region. Sequence analysis was identical to the previously published Ang2 cDNA sequence (4Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H.

These aa substitutions, therefore, probably represent Ang2 polymorphisms. Salient features of plasmids used in these studies are shown in Fig. 1. Ang1 and Ang2 were ligated into pEF2 (gift from G. Trinchieri) (30Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) to create mammalian expression vectors, pAng1 and pAng2, in which they are under transcriptional control of the human EF-1α promoter/enhancer elements and use the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1). To create pAng1-Fc, in which Ang1 was fused to the hinge region and CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1, an XhoI site was introduced downstream of the penultimate Ang1 codon of pAng1 by site-directed mutagenesis using the GeneEditorTM in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and the Ang1 coding region was ligated into the NotI/XhoI site of Ig/pEF-BOS (a gift from P. Kincade (31Oritani K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). pAng2-Fc was created by introducing a BamHI site 3′ to Ang2 codon 494 in pAng2 and ligating the Ang2 coding region into theNotI/BamHI site of Ig/pEF-BOS. To facilitate construction of Ang1 deletion mutants, chimeras, and epitope-tagged constructs, in-frame HindIII sites were introduced into pAng1 by site-directed mutagenesis 3′ to Ang1 codons 20 and 273 to create plasmid pAng1H/H273. HindIII sites were similarly introduced into pAng2 3′ to Ang2 codon 20 to create pAng2H and introduced 3′ to codons 20 and 268 to create plasmid pAng2H/H268. pAng1fib and pAng2fib were then created by deleting theHindIII fragments of pAng1H/H273 and pAng2H/H268, thus deleting codons 21–273 of Ang1 and codons 21–268 of Ang2. pHA-Ang2, a plasmid encoding Ang2 N-terminally tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, YPYDVPDYA, was created by ligating self-annealed primers HA-F and HA-R (see below) into the HindIII site 3′ to codon 20 in pAng2H. pMyc-Ang2, which encodes Ang2 N-terminally tagged with the Myc epitope, EQKLISEEDL, was similarly created using self-annealed primers Myc-F and Myc-R. pAng1/2 was created by ligating the HindIII fragment of Ang1H/H273 into pAng2fib and encodes a chimeric protein in which the Ang1 coiled coil domain is fused to the Ang2 fibrinogen-like domain. pAng2/1 was similarly created by ligating theHindIII fragment of pAng2H/H268 into pAng1fib. pAng1cc and pAng2cc were created by introducing a premature termination codons downstream of Ang1 codon 265 in plasmid, pAng1, and downstream of Ang2 codon 269 in plasmid, pAng2, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. To create pTie2-Fc, a BamHI site was engineered downstream of the mouse Tie2 ectodomain, 3′ to codon 744, in plasmid ptek (gift from D. Dumont (32Dumont D.J. Gradwohl G.J. Fong G.H. Auerbach R. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1293-1301PubMed Google Scholar),), and the Tie2 ectodomain was ligated into the NotI/BamHI site of Ig/pEF-BOS. The primers used were as follows: HA-F, 5′-AGCTGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTCATATGG-3′; HA-R, 5′-AGCTCCATATGAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAC-3′; Myc-F, 5′-AGCTGGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGCATATGG-3′; and Myc-R, 5′-AGCTCCATATGCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCC-3′. 293T human embryonic kidney cells and MS-1 murine microvascular endothelial cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (each at 100 μg/ml). 293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate, and conditioned media were prepared by culturing transiently transfected cells in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and ITS (Collaborative Biomedical). At 48 h, conditioned medium was harvested and filtered, and protease inhibitors were added (aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). Transiently transfected cells were cultured in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with ITS (insulin transferrin selenium) and 125 μCi/ml Easy Tag Express-(35S) Protein Labeling Mix (NEN Life Science Products) to create35S-labeled Ang1, Ang2, or their mutants. Conditioned medium from 293T cells transiently transfected with pTie2-Fc or Ig/pEF-BOS was used as a source of Tie2-Fc or the Fc fragment alone, respectively. Ang1, Ang2, and their mutants were precipitated from conditioned medium with Tie2-Fc (5 μg), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing (5% 2-mercaptoethanol) or nonreducing (no 2-mercaptoethanol) conditions and transferred to a Protran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were probed with antibodies against the amino or carboxyl terminus of Ang1 or Ang2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and an HRP-conjugated anti-goat antibody coupled with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to visualize bands. An anti-Myc antibody produced by the murine hybridoma, 9E10 (ATCC), was used for immunoprecipitation of Myc-Ang2. An antibody reactive with the HA epitope, 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was used in Western analyses to detect HA-Ang2 and imaged using an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and ECL. The relative abundance of different oligomers of Ang1 and Ang2 was determined by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc System with Molecular Analyst software and analysis using ImageQuant software. MS-1 cells grown to late confluence and serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with ITS were incubated for 10 min with medium conditioned by transiently transfected 293T cells. After stimulation, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 138 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.025 mm p-nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF), and Tie2 was immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction using a polyclonal antibody reactive with the carboxyl terminus of Tie2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western analysis was performed on immunoprecipitates, and Tie2 phosphorylation was analyzed by probing blots with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and PY20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After stripping, blots were reprobed for Tie2 with an anti-Tie2 antibody. Since Tie2 is presumed to require dimerization or multimerization for activation, we examined the oligomeric structure of Ang1 to determine whether Ang1 may act to bridge receptor molecules. Ang1 was precipitated from conditioned medium of 293T cells transiently transfected with pAng1 using Tie2-Fc, a Tie2-immunoglobulin fusion protein in which the Tie2 ectodomain was fused to the hinge region and Fc domain of human IgG1. Western analysis using an antibody reactive with the Ang1 amino terminus showed that Tie2-Fc-precipitated Ang1 migrated as a single 70-kDa band under reducing conditions; however, under nonreducing conditions, Ang1 migrated in multiple bands of higher molecular mass (Fig.2, left panels). The band of fastest mobility migrated with a molecular mass of 196 kDa, and multiple bands with slower mobility were also seen. These data demonstrate that soluble Ang1 exists in disulfide-linked oligomeric complexes, raising the possibility that this feature of Ang1 may be an important determinant in modulating Tie2 activity. To determine whether Ang2 also forms disulfide-linked oligomeric structures, Ang2 precipitated by Tie2-Fc from conditioned medium of transiently transfected 293T cells was examined by Western analysis using an antibody reactive with the Ang2 amino terminus. Under reducing conditions, Ang2 migrated as a single 65-kDa band (Fig. 2,right panel). Like Ang1, under nonreducing conditions, multiple bands of higher molecular mass were observed (Fig.2, right panel). In contrast to Ang1, the Ang2 band of greatest mobility migrated at 140 kDa, and, by scanning densitometry, a greater fraction of total Ang2 was in this oligomeric complex when compared with Ang1 (69% compared with 33%). Thus, both soluble Ang1 and Ang2 exist in arrays of disulfide-linked oligomeric complexes, but the different mobilities of these oligomeric complexes on nonreducing gels suggest that these ligands have different oligomeric structures. To determine the composition of Ang1 and Ang2 complexes, Ang1- and Ang2-expressing 293T cells were cultured in the presence of [35S]cysteine/methionine, and the radiolabeled ligands were precipitated from conditioned medium using Tie2-Fc. Under nonreducing conditions, Ang1 and Ang2 migrated in complexes comparable with those seen on Western analysis (Fig.3), which again demonstrated the distinctive oligomerization patterns of these two ligands. Of note, the higher order multimers of Ang1 and Ang2, as well as the faster mobility oligomers, have distinct mobilities on nonreducing gels. Under reducing conditions, the Ang1 oligomers migrated as a single 70-kDa band, and the Ang2 oligomers migrated as a single 65-kDa band (Fig. 3), suggesting that the complexes seen under nonreducing conditions are composed either of homo-oligomers of these ligands or of hetero-oligomers in which Ang1 and Ang2 complex with other factors of similar mobility. To determine whether Ang1 homo- and/or hetero-oligomerizes, we created pAng1-Fc, which encodes an Ang1-immunoglobulin chimera in which Ang1 was fused to the hinge region and Fc domain of human IgG1. Ang1-Fc, unlike Ang1, can be precipitated by protein A-agarose (Fig.4 A). When Ang1-Fc was precipitated by protein A-agarose from conditioned medium of 293T cells co-transfected with pAng1-Fc and pAng1, Ang1 was coprecipitated, demonstrating that Ang1 and Ang1-Fc hetero-oligomerize and strongly suggesting that soluble Ang1 complexes are composed of homo-oligomers of Ang1 (Fig. 4 A). To determine if Ang1 also hetero-oligomerizes with another 70-kDa factor, Ang1-Fc-expressing 293T cells were cultured in the presence of [35S]cysteine/methionine, and radiolabeled-Ang1-Fc was precipitated from conditioned medium using protein A-agarose. Reducing SDS-PAGE revealed a single predominant ∼105-kDa band, demonstrating that Ang1-Fc does not hetero-oligomerize with another 70-kDa factor (Fig. 4 B). (The faint, nonstoichiometric faster mobility bands seen in this lane represent proteolytic decay products of Ang1-Fc (data not shown).) However, precipitation of Ang1-Fc from conditioned medium of cells co-transfected with pAng1-Fc and pAng1 coprecipitated an additional 70-kDa factor, consistent with the observation that Ang1-Fc and Ang1 hetero-oligomerize (Fig.4 B). We conclude from these observations that soluble Ang1 exists in homo-oligomeric complexes and that the molecular mobilities of these complexes on nonreducing SDS-PAGE are most consistent with homotrimers and higher order oligomers. To examine the oligomeric composition of Ang2, we created pMyc-Ang2 and pHA-Ang2, which encode Ang2 tagged at the amino terminus with a Myc or hemagglutinin epitope, respectively. (An Ang2-Fc chimera was poorly expressed, necessitating an alternate strategy for determining the oligomeric composition of Ang2.) To determine if Ang2 homo-oligomerizes, 293T cells were co-transfected with pMyc-Ang2 and pHA-Ang2, and Myc-Ang2 was immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium using an anti-Myc antibody, 9E10. Western analysis of immunoprecipitates probed for the HA epitope demonstrated that HA-Ang2 was co-precipitated with Myc-Ang2 (Fig.5, lane 4). 9E10 did not immunoprecipitate HA-Ang2 or Ang2 (Fig. 5, lane 2, and data not shown), demonstrating that HA-Ang2 was co-precipitated by Myc-Ang2. Furthermore, HA-Ang2 co-precipitated by Myc-Ang2 formed disulfide-linked oligomeric complexes comparable with Ang2 under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5, lane 6). We conclude from these data that Ang2, like Ang1, forms homo-oligomeric complexes. Interestingly, Myc-Ang2 was also shown to hetero-oligomerize with and co-precipitate HA-Ang1, demonstrating that Ang1 and Ang2 have the potential to hetero-oligomerize (data not shown). Whether or not Ang1 and Ang2 hetero-oligomerize in vivo is unknown, and the activity of such hetero-oligomers in modulating Tie2 is unknown. Nonreducing gels suggest that the oligomeric structures of Ang1 and Ang2 are different (Fig. 3), raising the possibility that this distinguishing feature might be an important determinant of their effect on Tie2. Whereas the mobilities of Ang1 complexes are most consistent with Ang1 existing as trimers and higher order oligomers, mobilities of Ang2 complexes suggest that it forms dimers and higher order oligomers. To determine whether elements in the coiled coil domain or the fibrinogen-like domain determine the pattern of oligomerization, we created pAng1/2 and pAng2/1, which encode chimeric glycoproteins containing the Ang1 coiled coil domain fused to the Ang2 fibrinogen-like domain or the Ang2 coiled coil domain fused to the Ang1 fibrinogen-like domain, respectively (see Fig. 1). 293T cells transiently transfected to express Ang1/2 or Ang2/1 were cultured in the presence of [35S]cysteine/methionine, and radiolabeled Ang1/2 and Ang2/1 were precipitated from conditioned medium using Tie2-Fc. Under reducing conditions, Ang1/2 migrated at 70 kDa, comparable with Ang1, while Ang2/1 migrated at 65 kDa, comparable with Ang2 (Fig. 6, lanes 1–4). Under nonreducing conditions, Ang1/2 yielded an oligomerization pattern virtually identical to that yielded by Ang1, while Ang2/1 yielded a pattern comparable with that of Ang2 (Fig. 6,lanes 11–14), demonstrating that Ang1 and Ang2 oligomerization patterns are determined by their coiled coil domains. That the coiled coil domains determine the pattern of Ang1 and Ang2 oligomerization does not rule out the possibility that their fibrinogen-like domains play a role in their oligomerization. To localize the domain that mediates Ang1 oligomerization, we created pAng1cc and pAng1fib, which encode the Ang1 coiled coil domain and its fibrinogen-like domain, respectively. To determine if either domain alone was sufficient to mediate Ang1 oligomerization, 293T cells were co-transfected with pAng1-Fc and either pAng1cc or pAng1fib. Ang1cc was not precipitated by protein A-agarose from conditioned medium of cells transfected with pAng1cc; however, Ang1cc was co-precipitated with Ang1-Fc from conditioned medium of cells co-transfected with pAng1-Fc and pAng1cc (Fig. 7 A, comparelanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, under nonreducing conditions, Ang1cc migrated with the disulfide-linked oligomers (Fig. 7 A, lane 6). In contrast, Ang1-Fc did not co-precipitate Ang1fib from conditioned medium of cells co-transfected with pAng1-Fc and pAng1fib (Fig.7 B, lane 4), although easily detectable levels of Ang1fib were contained in the conditioned medium (Fig. 7 B, lane 5). These observations demonstrate that the Ang1 coiled coil domain, but not the fibrinogen-like domain, is sufficient to mediate Ang1 disulfide-linked homo-oligomerization. The Ang2 coiled coil domain, but not its fibrinogen-like domain, was similarly found to be sufficient to mediate its homo-oligomerization (data not shown). To examine the possibility that the different oligomeric structures of Ang1 and Ang2 determine their effect on Tie2, MS-1 murine endothelial cells were stimulated with Ang1, Ang2, Ang1/2, or Ang2/1. Tie2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-Tie2 antibody, and Western blots of immunoprecipitates were probed for phosphotyrosine and for Tie2. Background phosphorylation of Tie2 was never entirely eliminated, even when cells were serum-starved overnight. However, as previously demonstrated (4Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), Ang1, but not Ang2, induced phosphorylation of Tie2 an average of 3-fold in three separate experiments (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Ang2/1, but not Ang1/2, also induced Tie2 phosphorylation an average of 3-fold, comparable with Ang1 (Fig. 8). Ang1/2 binds Tie2 comparably to both Ang1 and Ang2 (Fig. 6 and data not shown); therefore, lack of Tie2 induction does not result from disruption of its Tie2 binding domain. These data demonstrate that the effect of Ang1 and Ang2 on Tie2 is linked to their fibrinogen-like domain. Furthermore, they suggest that the different oligomerization patterns of Ang1 and Ang2 do not determine their effect on Tie2 activity. Here we have shown that secreted Ang1 and Ang2 exist in distinct arrays of disulfide-linked homo-oligomeric complexes. The smallest Ang1 oligomer has a mobility most consistent with a homotrimer but predominantly exists in higher order oligomers. The smallest Ang1 oligomer migrates slightly faster than would be expected for a homotrimer (apparent molecular mass of 196 kDa compared to the expected mass of 210 kDa). Gel mobility is a function of both size and shape; therefore, this aberrant mobility is probably caused by molecular constraints that multiple intermolecular disulfide bonds place on the ability of Ang1 to migrate as linear polypeptide strand. In contrast, the smallest Ang2 oligomer has a mobility most consistent with a homodimer, and only a minority of Ang2 exists in higher order oligomers. We have shown that the coiled coil domains of Ang1 and Ang2, but not their fibrinogen-like domains, are sufficient to mediate oligomerization and furthermore that the distinct oligomerization patterns of Ang1 and Ang2 are linked to their coiled coil domains. Finally, we have shown that the Tie2-agonistic property of Ang1 is linked to its fibrinogen-like domain but not its coiled coil domain. That both Ang1 and Ang2 form higher order disulfide-linked oligomers demonstrates that multiple cysteine residues form intermolecular disulfide bonds. Since Ang1cc forms disulfide bonds with Ang1-Fc, at least one of the cysteine residues flanking the coiled coil domain, at position 41, 54, or 265 of Ang1, must form an intermolecular disulfide bond. Similarly, at least one of the coiled coil domain-flanking cysteines at positions 41 and 53 of Ang2 must form intermolecular disulfide bonds in order for Ang2cc to disulfide-link to Ang2. Although more than one of these cysteine residues may form disulfide bonds, we have not ruled out the possibility that cysteine residues located in the fibrinogen-like domain also form intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, since the fibrinogen-like domain alone did not mediate oligomerization, any such disulfide bonds formed by cysteine residues within this domain must require the presence of the coiled coil domain. The coiled coil domains of Ang1 and Ang2 are 63% identical and 91% similar, allowing for conservative amino acid substitutions, and both domains were predicted by the MultiCoil program to oligomerize (33Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The probability that the Ang1 coiled coil domain oligomerizes was predicted to be greater than 95%, while Ang2 was scored as having approximately an 80% probability of oligomerizing. However, both Ang1 and Ang2 are predicted to dimerize and not to form trimers. It is, therefore, surprising that the smallest molecular weight Ang1 oligomer on nonreducing gels appears to migrate as a homotrimer and has a mobility that is clearly distinct from the smallest Ang2 oligomer, although we have not formally ruled out the possibility that Ang1 forms homodimers that migrate aberrantly on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The higher molecular weight Ang1 and Ang2 multimers also have distinct mobilities, and the different relative amounts of lower and higher molecular weight oligomers suggests that Ang1 has a greater propensity to multimerize than Ang2. Some oligomerization domains show a greater propensity to oligomerize or polymerize at higher concentrations (34Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and we have not examined whether Ang1 and Ang2 oligomerization patterns are concentration-dependent. However, such concentration dependence would not explain the greater propensity of Ang1 to multimerize, because the concentration of Ang2 in conditioned medium of transiently transfected cells was approximately 10-fold greater than that of Ang1 (data not shown). The homo-oligomeric structure of Ang1 suggests that it activates Tie2 by bridging receptor molecules. However, simply bridging receptor molecules appears to be insufficient to activate endothelial-Tie2, because Ang2 homo-oligomers, which presumably bridge Tie2 receptors, do not activate endothelial-Tie2. Furthermore, the specific pattern of oligomerization was not linked to the ligands' ability to induce Tie2 phosphorylation. Ang1/2 had an oligomerization pattern indistinguishable from Ang1 yet did not induce Tie2 phosphorylation, while Ang2/1 had an oligomerization pattern similar to Ang2 yet induced Tie2 phosphorylation. The differences in oligomerization patterns raise the possibility that Ang1 and Ang2, besides activating or inhibiting Tie2 phosphorylation, have other functions that are modulated by their different oligomeric forms. Precedence for receptors showing such discriminatory behavior has been demonstrated with the Eph receptors, in which different oligomeric forms of ephrin-B1 modulate distinct Eph receptor-mediated responses (35Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Which Ang1 and Ang2/1 multimers induce Tie2 phosphorylation has not been defined. Additionally, Tie2 may have other, as yet unidentified, functions that are modulated by specific Ang1 or Ang2 oligomers. While the Tie2-agonistic property of Ang1 was linked to the fibrinogen-like domain, the mechanism by which it activates Tie2 has not been defined. Our preliminary results suggest that the fibrinogen-like domains of Ang1 and Ang2 contain the Tie2-binding domains, but these domains bind Tie2 only when dimerized or oligomerized. Whether oligomerization stabilizes the ligand-receptor interaction or whether the Tie2-binding domains are composed of more than one protomer of Ang1 or Ang2 is unclear. However, binding alone is not sufficient to mediate Tie2 phosphorylation. That binding and bridging of receptor molecules appear, based on our results, not to be sufficient to induce Tie2 phosphorylation raises the question of whether Ang1 induces a conformational change in Tie2 that is permissive for phosphorylation or, alternatively, whether it recruits accessory molecules important in inducing Tie2 phosphorylation. Ongoing studies will attempt to determine which, if either, of these mechanisms mediates Tie2 activation."

We investigated a possible mechanism that could ensure rapid and efficient phosphorylation of these channels by PKA upon stimulation of cAMP-mediated signaling pathways. A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) bind to the regulatory R subunits of PKA and target the holoenzyme to defined subcellular compartments and substrates. Class C channels isolated from rat brain extracts by immunoprecipitation contain an endogenous kinase that phosphorylates kemptide, a classic PKA substrate peptide, and also the main phosphorylation site for PKA in the pore-forming α1 subunit of the class C channel complex, serine 1928. The kinase activity is inhibited by the PKA inhibitory peptide PKI(5–24) and stimulated by cAMP. Physical association of the catalytic C subunit of PKA with the immunoisolated class C channel complex was confirmed by immunoblotting. A direct protein overlay binding assay performed with 32P-labeled RIIβ revealed a prominent AKAP with an M r of 280,000 in class C channel complexes. The protein was identified by immunoblotting as the microtubule-associated protein MAP2B, a well established AKAP. Class C channels did not contain tubulin and MAP2B association was not disrupted by dilution or addition of nocodazole, two treatments that cause dissociation of microtubules. In vitro experiments show that MAP2B can directly bind to the α1 subunit of the class C channel. Our findings indicate that PKA is an integral part of neuronal class C L-type Ca2+ channels and suggest that the AKAP MAP2B may mediate this interaction. Neither PKA nor MAP2B were detected in immunoprecipitates of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-type glutamate receptors or class B N-type Ca2+ channels.

Like other voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, neuronal L-type channels consist of several subunits including the α1, α2δ, and β polypeptides (6Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). α1 is the critical subunit which constitutes the ion-conducting pore (6Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

The shorter forms (180–190 kDa) are derived from their longer counterparts (200–220 kDa) by C-terminal truncation (8Hell J.W. Yokoyama C.T. Wong S.T. Warner C. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

In hippocampal slices, this modification of the C terminus of α1C is induced by Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and mediated by the Ca2+-dependent cytosolic protease calpain (10Hell J.W.

C-terminal truncation increases the activity of this channel about 4-fold (11Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

This pattern of α1Cimmunoreactivity is detected at neuronal somata and proximal dendrites in most areas of the brain and in the hippocampus throughout the dendritic regions. Localization of α1C was further established by immunoelectron microscopy which disclosed that class C L-type channels are clustered at postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus (10Hell J.W.

Myocardial contraction is induced by Ca2+ influx through class C channels and up-regulated by β-adrenergic signaling resulting in PKA-mediated stimulation of these channels (14Reuter H.

In its inactive form, PKA is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits (20Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Four R subunits (RIα, β, and RIIα, β) and three C subunits (Cα, β, and γ) are encoded by different genes. Binding of 4 cAMP molecules to homodimeric R subunits induces a conformational change, drastically reduces the affinity for C subunits, and promotes dissociation of C subunits which phosphorylate target substrates, thereby modifying their functions (20Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The PKA holoenzyme is directed to a variety of substrates and intracellular locations by adapter proteins called protein kinase A anchor proteins or AKAPs (21Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The RII subunits bind tightly with a large hydrophobic surface along one side of an amphipathic helix in AKAPs. The RII tethering site is conserved among the otherwise structurally divergent AKAPs (21Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gray P.C. Scott J.D.

Peptides corresponding to the RII-binding site disrupt PKA-mediated regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in neurons (23Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L.

Both neurotransmitter-activated adenylyl cyclase and the class C Ca2+ channel accumulate in the postsynaptic plasma membrane of dendrites. One potential mechanism that could facilitate rapid and precisely focused transmission of signals borne by cAMP to the channel involves the direct physical interaction between a PKA·AKAP complex and the target channel. We discovered that the neuronal class C L-type Ca2+ channel complex contains PKA as well as MAP2B, a neuronal AKAP (25Vallee R.B. DiBartolomeis M.J. Theurkauf W.E. J.

Anti-MAP2 and anti-AKAP220 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Control antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA). All preparative steps were performed at 0–4 °C using pre-cooled solutions. Forebrains from 3–6-week-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were directly homogenized in 10 ml/brain Triton X-100 solubilization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (see “Materials”). Hearts were frozen and pulverized under liquid N2 in a steel mortar and then solubilized in 10 ml of Triton X-100 solubilization buffer; to allow post-mortem proteolytic conversion of the long form of α1C into its short form, for some cardiac extracts EDTA, EGTA, aprotinin, leupeptin, and calpain inhibitor I and II were omitted. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min (50,000 rpm at 4 °C, 65 Ty rotor) before immunoprecipitation. If crude membrane fractions were used for solubilization, rat forebrains were homogenized in 10 ml of buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm EGTA, nocodazole (10 μm, if indicated), and protease inhibitors (see “Materials”). Homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C (JA-18 rotor) to remove larger cell fragments including nuclei. Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation for 30 min (50,000 rpm at 4 °C, 65 Ty rotor) and the supernatants saved and stored frozen as a source of soluble, native MAP2B for in vitro interaction assays with α1C. Membranes from one adult rat forebrain were solubilized on ice in 10 ml of Triton X-100 solubilization buffer (see above) and insoluble material removed by ultracentrifugation as described above. For the isolation of MAP2B by double-immunoprecipitation, membranes from one rat forebrain were solubilized in 2 ml of 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors for 20 min at 60 °C. SDS was neutralized by addition of 8 ml of Triton X-100 solubilization buffer and insoluble material removed by ultracentrifugation. Proteins which nonspecifically bind to Sepharose beads were removed by preincubation with Sepharose CL-4B (75 μl of Sepharose/0.5 ml of extract) for 30 min and subsequent centrifugation with a table top centrifuge. Triton X-100 extracts (0.5 ml) were incubated on ice with either 10 μg of affinity purified anti-CNC1 antibody, 10 μg of control rabbit IgG, 2 μl of anti-GluR1 antiserum, 10 μg of affinity purified anti-CNB1, or 0.5 μl of anti-NR1 ascites.

Initial immunocomplexes were treated with 30 μl of dissociation buffer (1.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 60 °C in a thermomixer, diluted with 450 μl of dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors in TBS), and spun. Supernatants were incubated with anti-CNC1 or control rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed, incubated for 2 h on a tilting mixer with 1 ml of the cytosolic brain fraction (see above), washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and analyzed by immunoblotting. In some MAP2B binding experiments, MAP2B was first purified to homogeneity by double immunoprecipitation from SDS solubilized brain membrane extracts with anti-MAP2B and protein G-Sepharose by the same procedure described for α1C. After the second immunoprecipitation MAP2B was eluted with dissociation buffer and, after addition of a 10-fold excess of dilution buffer, incubated with protein A-Sepharose-α1C immunocomplexes (or control IgG immunocomplexes) obtained from cardiac tissue by double immunoprecipitation (see above). The purity of MAP2B isolated by double immunoprecipitation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and immunoblotting. After SDS-PAGE using gels polymerized from 6% acrylamide and 0.16% bisacrylamide unless indicated otherwise, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm pore diameter). Blots were blocked for 2 h with 10% skim milk powder in TBS (TBS-milk) and probed for 2 h with anti-CH1923–1932P (1:10 in TBS-milk), anti-CNC1 (1:100 in TBS-milk), anti-PKA C subunit (1:50 in TBS-milk), anti-MAP2B (1:1,000 in TBS-milk), anti-AKAP150 (1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-AKAP220 (1:1,000 in TBS-milk), or anti-α-tubulin (1:1,000 in TBS-milk).

Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 45 μl of phosphorylation buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (20 μg/ml)). This buffer was supplemented with 1.5 mm CaCl2, 50 μg of diolein, and 2.5 mg of phosphatidylserine for phosphorylation in the presence of PKC. Samples were incubated with 0.5–1 μg of PKA or PKC and 50 μmunlabeled ATP (for immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P) or 0.2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (for autoradiography) in a thermomixer for 30 min at 32 °C, washed three times with radioimmunoassay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm 2-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate), and once in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Phosphorylation of α1C by endogenous kinase was carried out as above without any exogenous kinase added in the absence or presence of 5 μm cAMP. The pellets were extracted with SDS sample buffer (see above) before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P or autoradiography. For pretreatment with cAMP, immunocomplexes were incubated with various concentrations of cAMP in buffer containing 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, for 10 min at 32 °C in a thermomixer, and washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Samples were then phosphorylated by endogenous kinase with 50 μm unlabeled ATP in the absence or presence of 5 μm cAMP and 1 μm PKI for 25 min at 32 °C before immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in phosphorylation buffer in the absence or presence of 1 μm pki. 30 μm kemptide (NH2-LRRASLG-COOH) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added and samples incubated in a thermomixer for 25 min at 32 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 16% (final concentration) acetic acid. The supernatants were spotted onto P81 cation exchange paper (Whatman). The P81 paper was washed four times for 15 min with 0.1% phosphoric acid, and incorporation of 32P measured by Cerenkov counting. To determine the specific PKA component of the total 32P incorporation, the counts obtained with addition of PKI were subtracted from the counts without PKI. Western blots were probed with 0.3 nm32P-RIIβ (2 × 105 cpm 32P radioactivity/ml) and RII-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography as described previously (37Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 1928, which is included only in the 210-kDa form of α1C, has been identified as the main if not only phosphorylation site for PKA in this subunit (18De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochem. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To produce a phosphospecific antibody that specifically recognizes α1Cwhen phosphorylated at serine 1928, we immunized rabbits with a PKA-phosphorylated peptide covering residues 1923–1932 of α1C. The resulting antibody anti-CH1923–1932P detected a single band when total brain homogenized in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors was used for immunoblotting. The band migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 210 kDa in a gel made from 5% acrylamide (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and hardly entered the separating phase of a gel polymerized from 10% acrylamide, a classic property of the larger form of α1C (Fig.1 A, lane 1). These data indicate that anti-CH1923–1932P recognizes the long form of α1C with high specificity. To test whether α1C has to be phosphorylated by PKA for anti-CH1923–1932P binding, class C channels were solubilized with Triton X-100 in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and immunoprecipitated with anti-CNC1 which is directed against a different epitope in the central part of α1C. Under these conditions, α1C will be dephosphorylated by phosphatases present in the tissue and is not recognized by anti-CH1923–1932P (Fig.1 A, lane 3). However, if the immunocomplex containing α1C was phosphorylated with purified PKA before immunoblotting, anti-CH1923–1932P detected α1C (Fig.1 A, lane 4). This phosphorylation was mediated by PKA because it was completely blocked by the PKI(5–24) peptide (39Graves L.M. Bornfeld K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Leslie C.C. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a highly specific PKA-inhibitory peptide derived from the endogenous PKA inhibitor PKI (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Thus anti-CH1923–1932P specifically binds α1C with high affinity only when α1C is phosphorylated at its PKA site. The findings also indicate that α1C is partially phosphorylated on serine 1928 in intact brain. Amino acids surrounding serine 1928 constitute a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKC. Incubation of immunoprecipitated class C channel complexes with purified PKC and ATP also resulted in phosphorylation of serine 1928; however, the phosphorylation was blocked by the PKI peptide (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). Thus, phosphorylation of serine 1928 was catalyzed by endogenous PKA that copurified with the class C channel. To ensure that PKC was active and capable of phosphorylating α1C as described earlier (8Hell J.W. Yokoyama C.T. Wong S.T. Warner C. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19451-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the immunocomplex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and PKC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1 C). The short (190 kDa) form of α1C, which is not a PKA substrate, was phosphorylated as efficiently as the long form (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). In addition, in several experiments a third, phosphorylated polypeptide was observed migrating above the long form of α1C. No signals were detected in immunoprecipitates isolated with nonspecific antibody, demonstrating that immunoisolation of class C channels was specific (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). Channel complexes were immunoprecipitated in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors to promote dephosphorylation via endogenous protein phosphatases.

Caveolin-3 mRNA and protein expression are dramatically induced during the differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts, coincident with myoblast fusion. In these myotubes, caveolin-3 localizes to the sarcolemma (muscle cell plasma membrane), where it associates with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. However, it remains unknown what role caveolin-3 plays in myoblast differentiation and myotube formation. Here, we employ an antisense approach to derive stable C2C12 myoblasts that fail to express the caveolin-3 protein. We show that C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense undergo differentiation and express normal amounts of four muscle-specific marker proteins. However, C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense fail to undergo myoblast fusion and, therefore, do not form myotubes. Interestingly, treatment with specific p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors blocks both myotube formation and caveolin-3 expression, but does not affect the expression of other muscle-specific proteins. In addition, we find that three human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines do not express caveolin-3 and fail to undergo myoblast fusion. Taken together, these results support the idea that caveolin-3 expression is required for myoblast fusion and myotube formation, and suggest that p38 is an upstream regulator of caveolin-3 expression.

Caveolin-3 is localized to the muscle cell plasma membrane (sarcolemma) where it forms a complex with dystrophin and its associated glycoproteins (15Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S.

However, under certain conditions caveolin-3 can be physically separated from the dystrophin complex (16Crosbie R.H. Yamada H. Venzke D.P. Lisanti M.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This indicates that, although caveolin-3 is dystrophin-associated, it is not absolutely required for the biogenesis of the dystrophin complex (16Crosbie R.H. Yamada H. Venzke D.P. Lisanti M.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Caveolin-3 is most closely related to caveolin-1, based on protein sequence homology; caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 are ∼65% identical and ∼85% similar (see Tang et al. (13Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T.

However, caveolin-3 mRNA is expressed predominantly in muscle tissue types (skeletal muscle, diaphragm, and heart) (13Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I.

Identification of a muscle-specific member of the caveolin gene family has implications for understanding the role of caveolins in different muscle cell types (smooth, cardiac, and skeletal), as previous morphological studies have demonstrated that caveolae are abundant in these cells. A number of studies have highlighted the importance of caveolae and caveolins in the pathogenesis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. More specifically, dystrophin has been localized to plasma membrane caveolae in smooth muscle cells using immuno-electron microscopy techniques (17North A.J. Galazkiewicz B. Byers T.J. Glenney J.R. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and skeletal muscle caveolae undergo characteristic changes in their size and distribution in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, but not in other forms of neuronally based muscular dystrophies examined (18Bonilla E. Fishbeck K. Schotland D. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 104: 167-173PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that muscle cell caveolae may play an important role in muscle membrane biology. In collaboration with Minetti and colleagues, we have recently identified an autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C)1 in two Italian families that is due to a deficiency in caveolin-3 expression. Analysis of their genomic DNA reveals two distinct mutations in the caveolin-3 gene: (i) a 9-base pair microdeletion that removes the sequence TFT from the caveolin-scaffolding domain, and (ii) a mis-sense mutation that changes a proline to a leucine (Pro → Leu) in the transmembrane domain (19Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Both mutations lead to a loss of ∼90–95% of caveolin-3 protein expression. These results indicate that dramatic reductions in caveolin-3 can produce a disease phenotype in humans. However, it remains unknown whether caveolin-3 expression is required to generate or maintain the differentiated state of muscle cells. To address this issue, we used an antisense approach to essentially ablate caveolin-3 expression in C2C12 cells, a well established murine skeletal myoblast cell line. Our results indicate that drastic down-regulation of caveolin-3 (to undetectable levels) prevents or inhibits myotube formation, but does not affect the expression of a panel of muscle-specific marker proteins. Thus, a deficiency in caveolin-3 expression seen in LGMD-1C patients could potentially slow the process of myotube formationin vivo and partially explain the pathogenic phenotype of this human genetic disorder.

The pCAGGS construct was co-transfected with a plasmid containing hygromycin resistance (pCB7). C2C12 cells were transfected with caveolin-3 antisense vector using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. Resistant clones were selected using hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Individual clones were isolated using cloning rings. Lysates from differentiated C2C12 were prepared and assayed for reductions in the expression of caveolin-3 by immunoblotting. C2C12 cells were also transfected with empty vector alone as a critical control. C2C12 cells were treated for the indicated period of time with 10 μm amounts of SB203580, SB202190, or SB202474 (an inactive control compound) (Calbiochem, Inc.). Similar results were obtained at a concentration of 5 μm. C2C12, RD, A673, and Hs729 cells were grown in plastic tissue culture dishes and photographed using an inverted Nikon microscope. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% or 8% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% powdered skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (∼1,000-fold diluted in TBST) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (∼5,000-fold diluted). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to selectively down-regulate the expression of the caveolin-3 protein, we engineered an expression vector containing the untagged full-length caveolin-3 cDNA in the antisense orientation. For this purpose, we used the well established murine C2C12 skeletal myoblast cell line. Cultured C2C12 cells offer a convenient system to study skeletal myoblast differentiation. These cells can be induced to differentiate from myoblasts into myotubes bearing an embryonic phenotype in low mitogen medium over a period of 2 days. Briefly, proliferating C2C12 cells are cultured in high mitogen medium (DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% chicken embryo extract) and induced to differentiate at confluence in low mitogen medium (DMEM containing 3% horse serum). Overt differentiation is indicated by the assembly of multi-nucleated syncytia, which commences ∼36–48 h after the cells are switched to low mitogen media. In addition, we have previously shown that both mRNA and protein levels of caveolin-3 are dramatically induced during the course of differentiation of C2C12 cells from myoblasts to myotubes (13Tang Z.

These caveolin-3 antisense constructs were first tested in transient transfection assays with C2C12 cells and were found to significantly reduce the expression levels of endogenous caveolin-3 during myoblast differentiation, as compared with mock-transfected or vector alone controls (data not shown). Given the preliminary success of this approach in transient transfections, we decided to derive stable cell lines that harbor this caveolin-3 antisense construct. Three C2C12 cell lines harboring caveolin-3 antisense were derived, and they all behaved similarly. As a consequence, one clone was selected for in depth analysis. Fig. 1 shows a Western blot analysis of the expression of caveolin-3 in C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense and untransfected control cells. Note that caveolin-3 levels are effectively reduced during the differentiation process. In addition, caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 levels were not affected by the expression of caveolin-3 antisense, demonstrating that the expression of caveolin-3 antisense selectively down-regulates the expression of caveolin-3. Importantly, C2C12 cells harboring vector alone did not show any changes in the levels of caveolin-3 expression (see below). To investigate whether targeted down-regulation of the caveolin-3 protein overtly affects the differentiation process, we next evaluated the expression of a panel of muscle-specific marker proteins in C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense. These markers included both cytoskeletal elements (troponin T and myosin heavy chain) and muscle-specific plasma membrane components (β-dystroglycan and dystrophin). Fig.2 shows the results of this analysis. Interestingly, C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense expressed normal levels of troponin T, myosin heavy chain, β-dystroglycan, and dystrophin, as compared with untransfected control C2C12 cells. These results clearly indicate that the process of differentiation is not overtly affected by targeted down-regulation of caveolin-3 expression. Myoblast fusion and myotube formation is indicated by the assembly of multi-nucleated syncytia, which commences ∼36–48 h after the C2C12 cells are switched to low mitogen media and can be observed morphologically. Interestingly, C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense failed to undergo myotube formation (Fig.3 A), despite the fact that they undergo differentiation normally and continue to express muscle-specific marker proteins that are a hallmark of normal adult muscle (Fig. 2). In striking contrast, C2C12 cells harboring vector alone continue to express muscle-specific protein markers, caveolin-3, and undergo myotube formation normally (Fig.4). These results indicate that targeted down-regulation of the caveolin-3 protein is sufficient to block myoblast fusion and subsequent myotube formation.Figure 4Characterization of the phenotype of C2C12 cells harboring vector alone. A, Western blot analysis. Expression of troponin T (upper panel) and caveolin-3 (lower panel) in two independent clones harboring vector alone and in normal parental C2C12 cells is shown. Note that C2C12 cells harboring vector alone did not show reductions in the expression level of caveolin-3 or troponin T and behaved as parental C2C12 cells. Each lane contains equal amounts of total protein. B, morphological characterization. Left panels, cells grown in proliferation medium (Prolif); right panels, cells grown in differentiation medium (Diff). The results obtained with two representative clones are shown here. Note that C2C12 cells harboring vector alone show normal myotube formation after 2 days of differentiation, as compared with parental C2C12 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One possibility is that caveolin-3 down-regulation may cause a delay, rather than a block in myotube formation. To address this issue, we examined myoblast fusion after 5 days of differentiation. Even under these condition, no myoblast fusion/myotube formation was observed with C2C12 cells that harbor caveolin-3 antisense (Fig. 3 B), as compared with control C2C12 cells. These results are more consistent with the idea that down-regulation of caveolin-3 results in a block in myoblast fusion, rather than a delay. As we recently observed that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway is a prerequisite for the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes (24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we next assessed the activation state of the p38 pathway during differentiation in C2C12 cells. For this purpose, we used immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibody probes that are routinely used to assess p38 activation. We observed that p38 MAP kinase activation occurred early during the differentiation program and was transient, with peak activity on day 2 (Fig.5). In contrast, the protein levels of total p38 MAP kinase remain relatively constant, as seen using a phospho-independent antibody probe. Thus, these results are in agreement with our previous results with the adipocyte system (24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We next used a well established and highly selective p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) to assess the role of p38 activation in the differentiation of C2C12 cells. Importantly, this inhibitor does not affect the activation of the p42/44 and the stress-activated protein/c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAP kinase pathways (see Ref. 24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, and references therein). Using this approach with the adipocyte system, we recently showed that activation of p38 is required for achieving the differentiated adipogenic phenotype and for up-regulation of the caveolin-1 protein product (24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that treatment with the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) selectively blocks the expression of the caveolin-3 protein, but has little or no effect on the expression of other specific markers of the muscle cell plasma membrane or cytoskeletal elements. In addition, treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked myoblast fusion/myotube formation (Fig.7 A). However, addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 after 2 days of differentiation did not reverse myoblast fusion. Fig. 8 shows a direct comparison of the effects of caveolin-3 antisense or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 on myotube formation. Note that both treatments effectively block this process.Figure 7Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase blocks myotube formation.

Note that myotube formation is compromised if the p38 inhibitor is added at day 0 or day 1 of differentiation. In contrast, if the inhibitor is added after day 2, no effect on myotube formation is observed. B, as inA, except parental C2C12 cells were differentiated for 2 days or 5 days in the absence or presence of SB203580, SB202190, or SB202474, each at a concentration of 10 μm. Each compound was added at the beginning of differentiation (day 0). Note that either p38 inhibitor (SB203580 or SB202190) blocks myoblast fusion, while an inactive control compound (SB202474) has no effect on myoblast fusion. Virtually identical results were obtained after either 2 days or 5 days of differentiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase blocks myotube formation: comparison with the phenotype of C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense.

Our results indicate that the second p38 inhibitor (SB202190) effectively blocks caveolin-3 expression and myoblast fusion, while SB202474 is inactive as predicted (Figs. 6 B and7 B). Virtually identical results were obtained after either 2 days or 5 days of differentiation. RD cells are a well established human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. As caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated in a variety of transformed fibroblastic and human breast cancer cell lines (25Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we next examined the expression of the caveolin-3 protein in RD cells. Interestingly, RD cells express muscle-specific markers (such as troponin T), but do not express the caveolin-3 protein product (Fig.9 A). In addition, they fail to undergo myoblast fusion (Fig. 9 B). Thus, it appears that caveolin-3 expression is down-regulated during skeletal muscle cell transformation. As a consequence of these observations with RD cells, we analyzed two additional ATCC cell lines derived from human rhabdomyosarcomas (A673 and Hs729) and the results are shown in Fig. 9 (A andB). Note that A673 and Hs729 cells do not express the caveolin-3 protein product and they fail to undergo myoblast fusion. Thus, our results indicate that in all three rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cell lines (RD, A673, and Hs729 cells), caveolin-3 levels are down-regulated and these cell lines fail to undergo myoblast fusion. However, it is important to note that recombinant expression of caveolin-3 in RD cells was not sufficient to drive myoblast fusion and myotube formation (data not shown). These results indicate that although caveolin-3 expression may be required for or greatly facilitates myoblast fusion, caveolin-3 expression is clearly not sufficient to drive myoblast fusion in the context of RD cells. LGMD-1C is an autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that is genetically caused by mutations within the coding region of the caveolin-3 gene. In collaboration with Minetti and colleagues (19Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), we have recently identified two different families in Italy with this form of muscular dystrophy. In these patients, the levels of the caveolin-3 protein are reduced by ∼90–95% as revealed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. These results indicate that dramatic reductions in caveolin-3 can produce a disease phenotype in humans. However, it remains unknown whether caveolin-3 expression is required to generate or maintain the differentiated phenotype of muscle cells. Here, we have directly addressed this issue by using an antisense approach to ablate caveolin-3 expression in C2C12 cells. We show that C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense undergo differentiation and express normal amounts of four muscle-specific marker proteins. However, C2C12 cells harboring caveolin-3 antisense fail to undergo myoblast fusion and do not form myotubes. Thus, a deficiency in caveolin-3 expression may potentially slow the process of myotube formation in vivo, contributing to the pathogenesis of LGMD-1C. Using phosphospecific antibody probes, we noted that p38 MAP kinase activation was transiently induced during the early phase of myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, treatment with a specific p38 inhibitor (either SB203580 or SB202190) blocked both myotube formation and caveolin-3 expression, but did not affect the expression of other muscle-specific proteins. These results support the idea that caveolin-3 expression is required for myoblast fusion and myotube formation, and suggest that p38 is an upstream regulator of caveolin-3 expression. These data also suggest that p38 MAP kinase activation and subsequent caveolin-3 expression at the muscle cell plasma membrane must play a critical role in myoblast fusion. Recently, we and other laboratories have shown that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway occurs during a variety of differentiation processes. Inhibition of p38 activation effectively blocks these differentiation processes. These processes include the nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PC12 cells into neuron-like cells (30Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes (24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and the erythropoietin-mediated induction of red blood cell formation (31Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of 3T3-L1 cells, we have also shown that treatment with p38 MAP kinase inhibitors blocks the induction of caveolin-1 protein expression (24Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Normally, both the caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels are induced ∼10–25-fold during the process of adipogenesis (14Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 32Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, by analogy with p38-mediated regulation of caveolin-1 expression during adipogenesis, it is not completely unexpected to observe that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway prevents expression of the caveolin-3 protein and inhibits myotube formation. While our paper was being revised, two other groups reported the effects of p38 inhibition on C2C12 (33Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and L8 (34Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) myoblast differentiation. As we observe here, they also found that p38 activation was required for myotube formation. However, they did not evaluate the effects of p38 inhibition on the expression of caveolin-3 and they did not implicate p38-mediated induction of caveolin-3 in the process of myotube formation. In addition, their results with p38 inhibitors independently support our current results made here using an antisense approach to selectively down-regulate caveolin-3 protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2772065758,"Intron sizes vary widely among different genes and among homologous genes of different species. The distribution of intron sizes may be maintained in a steady state, reflecting the processes of insertion and deletion of gene sequences, or it may be that the distribution is constrained by natural selection1,2,3. If intron size is governed by natural selection, there should be a statistical association between this size and the rate of recombination per map unit of the genome, assuming that natural selection is less effective in genomic regions of low recombination4,5,6. Here we show that larger introns of Drosophila melanogaster occur preferentially in regions of low recombination, which is consistent with large introns having a deleterious effect. The association is significant (P=40.001, linear regression), despite the fact that no effort was made to stratify the data by other factors that affect intron size, such as the size of the associated coding region7 or the presence of regulatory sequences inside the intron."
https://openalex.org/W2094990443,"We have previously identified a specific receptor for collagenase-3 that mediates the binding, internalization, and degradation of this ligand in UMR 106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. In the present study, we show that collagenase-3 binding is calcium-dependent and occurs in a variety of cell types, including osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells. We also present evidence supporting a two-step mechanism of collagenase-3 binding and internalization involving both a specific collagenase-3 receptor and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Ligand blot analysis shows that (125)I-collagenase-3 binds specifically to two proteins ( approximately 170 kDa and approximately 600 kDa) present in UMR 106-01 cells. Western blotting identified the 600-kDa protein as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Our data suggest that the 170-kDa protein is a specific collagenase-3 receptor. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-null mouse embryo fibroblasts bind but fail to internalize collagenase-3, whereas UMR 106-01 and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts bind and internalize collagenase-3. Internalization, but not binding, is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein. We conclude that the internalization of collagenase-3 requires the participation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and propose a model in which the cell surface interaction of this ligand requires a sequential contribution from two receptors, with the collagenase-3 receptor acting as a high affinity primary binding site and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediating internalization."

High affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2Rs) are composed of three chains, denoted IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γc. IL-2 induces the heterodimerization of IL-2Rβ and γc, which together are necessary and sufficient for IL-2 signaling (3Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y.

Given the diverse array of molecules associating with cytokine receptors such as the IL-2 receptor, it is clear that the different signals they exert must be carefully controlled. In general, the functional outcome of biochemical events triggered by cytokines represents a balance between activating and inhibitory signals believed to function as part of negative feedback loop(s). The inhibitory signals play an important role in the control of the magnitude and duration of the cellular response to extracellular stimuli.

CIS (now also denoted as CIS-1) is the prototype member of the CIS/JAB/SOCS/SSI family of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 22Aman M.J. Leonard W.J. Curr.

It is induced in hematopoietic cells within 30 min of stimulation by IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin, but not by stem cell factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or IL-6 (15Yoshimura A.

STAT response elements have been identified in the promoter region of CIS, allowing its induction by a variety of cytokines including IL-2 (23Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once expressed, CIS/JAB/SOCS/SSI proteins interfere with signaling events and suppress cytokine-specific cellular responses. JAB/SOCS-1/SSI-1 has been shown to associate with Jak kinases and to inhibit their catalytic activities. Previously, it was demonstrated that CIS could associate with the IL-3 receptor β chain and erythropoietin receptor upon appropriate stimulation. Furthermore, CIS was shown to reduce the proliferative responsiveness of cells to IL-3 (15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and to partially inhibit erythropoietin-induced Stat5 phosphorylation and transactivation in HEK293 cells reconstituted with the erythropoietin receptor and Stat5 (23Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that CIS can associate with IL-2Rβ and that it can inhibit more than one IL-2-related signaling pathway. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were prepared from normal donors using standard methods. To generate “preactivated PBL,” freshly isolated PBL were cultured for 72 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (“complete medium”), and 2 μg/ml PHA-L (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and then washed and rested for 24 h in complete medium. NK-like YT cells were cultured and maintained in complete medium. 32D cells were maintained in complete medium supplemented with 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol and 5% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. Transfectants expressing IL-2Rβ were generated by electroporating cells (5 × 106 cells/400 μl) with linearized pCDNA3zeo (InVitrogen) containing IL-2Rβ using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad; 300 V, 960 microfarads; average time constant = 30 ms). After 24 h, cells were aliquoted into a 24-well plate and selected in 0.8 mg/ml ZeocinTM (InVitrogen). Resistant clones were tested for IL-2Rβ expression by Western blotting using goat anti-human IL-2Rβ antiserum (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). 293T+ cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293T+ cells at 50% confluency were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation reagents (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), as described previously (24Aman M.J.

Transient transfections of YT and 32D-IL-2Rβ cells for luciferase reporter assays were performed using the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, 1–2 × 106 cells were incubated with up to 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 200 μg of DEAE-dextran in 1 ml of STBS buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by washing once with medium. For YT cells, 18 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 2 nm IL-2 for an additional 12–24 h and then harvested. 32D-IL-2Rβ cells were incubated with either 0.05% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (which is sufficient to maintain cell viability but not growth) or with 2 nm IL-2 or 5% WEHI-3B conditioned medium for 24–36 h. For luciferase assays, lysates were prepared using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega). Protein concentrations were measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and 5–20 μg of protein were used for luciferase assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected with IL-2Rβ to create Ba/F3-IL-2Rβ cells. Ba/F3-IL-2Rβ-CIS cells additionally express CIS in pMAMneo (so that its expression can be induced by steroids; see Ref. 15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G.

Northern blotting was performed using 2 μg/lane of poly(A)+ RNA on 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels as described previously (25Ascherman D.P. Migone T.-S. Friedmann M.C. Leonard W.J. J. Biol.

Erdos M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22733-22736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length murine CIS cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18S. FLAG-tagged wild type CIS and truncation mutants of CIS were generated by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into pME18S, and sequenced. A point mutation converting arginine 107 to lysine (R107K) in the SH2 domain was introduced into the CIS cDNA using standard polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type human IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rβ mutant constructs used in this study have been described (8Zhu M. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol.

The NF-κB-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct, pTKκB3, containing three copies of the human immunodeficiency virus κB site, has been described previously (28Lin J.-X. Bhat N. John S. Queale W.S. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6201-6210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Stat5a, Stat5b, IL-2Rβ, γc, and Jak3 cDNAs were all human cDNAs. The β-casein reporter construct was generated by cloning three repeats of the GAS motif from the β-casein promoter and the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter into pGL-2basic (Promega). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CIS antiserum was prepared as described previously (15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc mAb 9E10 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG M2 mAb was from Eastman Kodak Co.; anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs 4G10 and PY20 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Lck antiserum was a gift of Dr. L. Samelson (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). Mikβ1 mAb to IL-2Rβ was provided by Drs. M. Tsudo (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute) and J. Hakimi (Hoffmann-La Roche), and Mikβ3 mAb to IL-2Rβ was provided by M. Tsudo. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotonin, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer and immunoblotted or were immunoprecipitated for 1–2 h at 4 °C using specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. To investigate the potential role of CIS in IL-2 signaling, we first examined the expression of CIS mRNA in response to IL-2 and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in normal human PBL. In unstimulated freshly isolated PBL, CIS mRNA was not detected (Fig.1 A, lane 1); however, IL-2 induced CIS mRNA within 30 min (lane 2), and the levels of CIS mRNA increased with time, with high level expression being sustained for at least 24 h (lanes 4, 6, and8). Stimulation of PBL with PHA also induced CIS, but with a slower time course so that it was 4 h before even very low levels of CIS mRNA were detected (compare lanes 3,5, and 7 with lane 1). However, by 24 h, the level of CIS expression was comparable with that seen with IL-2 (lane 9). These data suggest that PHA may not induce CIS expression directly but rather indirectly through induction of IL-2 production, given that at least 4 h is typically needed before appreciable levels of IL-2 protein can be detected after PHA activation. When PBL were preactivated with PHA for 3 days and then rested overnight in IL-2-free medium, a treatment that induces maximal expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors and primes cells for potent cellular responsiveness to IL-2, CIS mRNA expression was rapidly induced by IL-2 and sustained at a high level for at least 24 h (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). We also investigated the expression pattern of CIS protein in these cells. CIS protein was potently expressed within 24 h, and high levels were maintained for at least 72 h (Fig.1 C, lanes 1–4). As noted above, CIS is induced by both erythropoietin and IL-3 and can associate with both the erythropoietin receptor and the murine IL-3 receptor β chain (15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of CIS to associate with the IL-2Rβ chain. Lysates from IL-2-stimulated, preactivated PBL were immunoprecipitated with Mikβ3 mAb to IL-2Rβ and then Western blotted with anti-CIS antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 D, CIS coprecipitated with IL-2Rβ, indicating a physical interaction between these two proteins. Although the degree of apparent interaction was inducible (Fig. 1 D), it was not as marked as was the inducibility of CIS (Fig. 1 C). To further investigate this situation, we also evaluated coprecipitation in Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with IL-2Rβ (Fig. 2). In these cells, IL-2 stimulates CIS expression (Fig. 2 A). However, as in PBL, it was difficult to detect a CIS-IL-2Rβ interaction with anti-IL-2Rβ antibodies (data not shown), but this interaction was revealed with more sensitive anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 B). The relatively weak coprecipitation of CIS and IL-2Rβ could reflect low stoichiometry; alternatively, a higher stoichiometry might exist but might not be readily detected given that neither the anti-CIS nor anti-IL-2Rβ antibodies are particularly robust. It is also possible that the weak coprecipitation could also reflect a comparatively low affinity or transient interactions. To map the region of IL-2Rβ required for its interaction with CIS, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293 T+ cells transfected with murine CIS plus wild type IL-2Rβ or IL-2Rβ mutants containing various internal deletions or C-terminal truncations (see Fig. 3 A for a schematic of IL-2Rβ, including the locations of the A (residues 313–382) and S (residues 267–323). For unclear reasons, we consistently observed lower CIS expression when CIS was co-expressed with mutants of IL-2Rβ lacking either the A or S regions. Therefore, we increased the amount of the CIS plasmid cotransfected with IL-2RβΔA or IL-2RβΔS in order to achieve more similar levels of CIS expression (Fig.3 B, lanes 4 and 5 versus lane 1; middle panel; note that murine CIS is routinely detected as a doublet). When CIS and wild type IL-2Rβ were cotransfected (lane 1) and then immunoprecipitated with Mikβ1 mAb to IL-2Rβ, CIS was efficiently coprecipitated (lane 1, top panel). Deletion of the S region partially decreased the degree of association of IL-2Rβ with CIS (lanes 3 and 5), whereas deletion of the A region of IL-2Rβ abrogated CIS interaction (lanes 2 and 4; note that no CIS was coprecipitated in lane 4 (upper panel) although expression of CIS in this lane was higher than in lane 3(middle panel), where CIS weakly coprecipitated with IL-2RβΔS). We next analyzed several C-terminal IL-2Rβ truncation mutants for their abilities to bind CIS. These experiments revealed that the sequences beyond amino acid 350 were dispensable for this interaction, while truncation at amino acid 330 abrogated the association (Fig.3 C, upper panel). Therefore, these results identify amino acids 330–350 as critical for CIS binding, complementing the deletion analysis. The fact that a mutant lacking the S region (residues 267–323) showed reduced association with CIS (Fig.3 B) suggests the presence of an additional direct or indirect contact point within the S region or suggests that deletion of the S region has conformational effects resulting in reduced association. To clarify the region of CIS that mediates its interaction with IL-2Rβ, we generated wild type CIS and C-terminal truncation mutants of CIS that were FLAG-tagged at their C termini. The truncation mutants contained either the first 82 amino acids (the residues N-terminal to the SH2 domain, denoted CISNT) or the first 177 amino acids (retaining the N-terminal region as well as the SH2 domain, denoted CISΔCT)(Fig.4 A). Following coexpression of these constructs with wild type IL-2Rβ in 293 T+ cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed (Fig. 4 B,top panel, lanes 1–3). Whereas CISΔCT could associate with IL-2Rβ as well as wild type CIS (Fig. 4 B, middle panel,lane 1 versus lane 3), CISNT (which lacks the SH2 domain) could not (lane 2), suggesting that the interaction of CIS with IL-2Rβ might involve a classical SH2/phosphotyrosine interaction. This hypothesis is consistent with the suggestion that tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of IL-3Rβ and the erythropoietin receptor could associate with CIS (15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the association of CIS with IL-2Rβ did not appear to require the tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rβ as demonstrated by the ability of CIS to associate with an IL-2Rβ mutant in which all six cytoplasmic tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines (IL-2RβFFFFFF) (Fig. 4 C, middle panel,lane 3 versus lane 1). Even wild type IL-2Rβ does not appear to be phosphorylated in these 293 transfections (data not shown and shown below in Fig. 6 B, top panel,lane 1). However, we used the IL-2RβFFFFFF construct to exclude the possibility that a low but undetectable level of tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rβ played a role in the interaction seen in Fig. 4 C. To more directly assess the role of the CIS SH2 domain in the CIS-IL-2Rβ interaction, we prepared a CIS mutant in which arginine 107 in the phosphotyrosine binding FLVR motif was changed to lysine (CISR107K). While this type of mutation is known to disrupt the ability of SH2 domains to bind phosphotyrosine (29Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 30Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), it had little effect on the ability of CIS to associate with IL-2Rβ (Fig.4 C, middle panel, lane 2). Together, the above results indicate that at leastin vitro the CIS-IL-2Rβ interaction does not require a classical SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction between CIS and IL-2Rβ. Therefore, the ability of IL-2Rβ to interact with CISΔCT but not CISNT suggests either that other residues distinct from the FLVR motif in the SH2 region are important for binding or that the CISNT construct has a severely altered structure resulting from deletion of the SH2 domain. The above results do not exclude a partial contribution of an SH2-mediated interaction of CIS with IL-2Rβ; they instead demonstrate that non-SH2-mediated interactions also exist. Interestingly, in 293 cells, the common β chain (βc) of the IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors associated with CIS and augmenting its phosphorylation by cotransfecting Jak1 did not significantly increase its association with CIS (Fig.5). Previously, CIS was shown to associate with IL-3Rβ and the EPO receptor after ligand stimulation (15Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, the role of ligand requirement for this induction may have been in part related to the stronger induction of CIS in the presence of ligand. Thus, like IL-2Rβ, βc may at least in part associate with CIS independently of a phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction.Figure 6CIS inhibits Lck-mediated phosphorylation of IL-2R β.

Accordingly, overexpression of dominant negative mutants of p38 and MKK6 largely decreased hyperosmotic STAT1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase different from Jak1 is involved in stress-activation of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2.

Regulation by MAP kinases has been implicated in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In mammals, MAP kinases are divided into at least three subfamilies: the “classical” extracellular signal-regulated kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2), the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and the cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein/p38. Whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases are preferentially activated by a variety of cell growth and differentiation stimuli and by hypoosmolarity, JNK and p38 are primarily activated by various environmental stresses (for reviews, see Refs. 1Waskiewicz A.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar).Another key signaling system involved in the signal transduction of numerous interleukins and the interferons as well as a number of growth and differentiation factors is the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. The binding of mediators to their respective receptors activates tyrosine kinases of the Jak family, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT factors (for a review, see Ref. 9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). At least upon IL-6 signaling, also the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is subject to phosphorylation, although its specific function is still unclear. It has been reported that SHP2 negatively regulates IL-6-induced gene transcription (10Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Further, there is evidence that it acts as an adaptor linking the Jak/STAT pathway to the MAP kinase pathway via Grb2 (12Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).Recently, we have shown that in a number of primary cells and cell lines, hyperosmotic shock results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 and in the activation of mainly STAT1 and/or STAT3. Furthermore, an important role of Jak1 in the activation of STAT by hypertonicity was demonstrated (13Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In this study, we explored the possible interactions between the Jak/STAT and the p38 kinase pathways under hyperosmotic conditions. We show that, apart from Jaks and STAT factors, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 becomes also phosphorylated upon hyperosmotic shock. We could demonstrate that p38 and its upstream activator MKK6 participate in the activation of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 by hyperosmotic shock. Further evidence is given that a protein-tyrosine kinase different from Jak1 is required for hyperosmotic STAT activation.DISCUSSIONActivation of the p38 kinase cascade is known as one of the major events occurring after hyperosmotic shock (4Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that also the Jak/STAT pathway is activated by hyperosmolarity. Studies on Jak1-, Jak2-, and Tyk2-deficient cell lines suggested that Jak1 might be important for the hyperosmotic STAT activation (13Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we give evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 in response to hyperosmotic treatment occurs at least in part via the MKK6/p38 pathway. This was shown by inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase using specific inhibitors and by overexpression of wild type or kinase-deficient mutants of p38 and MKK6. Our data further indicate that the interaction between MKK6/p38 and STAT1 does not involve Jak1, although protein-tyrosine kinase activity is required for hyperosmotic STAT activation.It has been reported that the transactivating capability of STAT1 depends at least partially on the phosphorylation of serine 727, located within a potential MAP kinase consensus motif in the C-terminal transactivation domain (25David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 28Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 29Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after bacterial infection or administration of lipopolysaccharide prior to IFNγ treatment, phosphorylation of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 and at serine 727 occurred independently from each other, leading to an increased transcriptional response (30Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 was found to a larger extent to be also phosphorylated on serine 727 as compared with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, indicating that serine phosphorylation of STAT1 possibly facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation (30Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, one could speculate that p38 modulates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 by phosphorylation of serine 727. However, another group recently presented in vitro and in vivo evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases specifically phosphorylate STAT3 at serine 727 in response to growth factors negatively modulating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Moreover, these authors could show that neither JNK1 nor p38 was able to phosphorylate STAT1 or STAT3 in vitro when immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared after stimulation with 600 mm sorbitol (26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In correspondence to these observations, we found in this study that overexpression of wild type or kinase-deficient forms of p38 or MKK6 did not significantly affect phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727. Therefore, our data support the assumption that STAT1 is not a substrate of p38 in vivoSince p38 is a serine/threonine protein kinase and a direct action of p38 on STAT1 is unlikely, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 after hyperosmotic shock must occur indirectly. This could be either by activation of a tyrosine kinase controlled by serine-threonine phosphorylation or by inhibition of a tyrosine phosphatase negatively regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation. A tyrosine phosphatase that has been frequently associated with the Jak/STAT pathway is SHP2 (also termed as PTP1D, Syp, or SH-PTP2). The functional implications of SHP2 for the signal transduction via the Jak/STAT pathway are largely unknown. It binds with its SH2 domain specifically to phosphorylated tyrosine 759 from the gp130 receptor subunit cytoplasmic domain, thereby linking gp130 via Grb2 to the MAP kinase pathway (12Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Further, previous work by Schaper et al. (10Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Kim et al. (11Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) showed that activation of SHP2 limits acute phase protein expression most likely via dephosphorylation of gp130, Jaks, or STATs. Here we show that upon hyperosmotic shock SHP2 becomes phosphorylated with a time course similar to STAT1 activation and that this phosphorylation is regulated at least partially by MKK6/p38 and a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase. It is currently believed that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 corresponds to its phosphatase activity (27Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ulrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Since we did not observe that the SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation behaves in reverse to the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, we assume that inhibition of phosphatase activity of SHP2 is probably not involved in the activation of STAT1 due to hyperosmotic stress.Another phosphatase that was reported to negatively regulate STAT activation is MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (31Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This phosphatase belongs to a class of dual specific phosphatases inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases and JNK by dephosphorylation (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 33Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphatases are the products of immediate early genes whose mRNA is rapidly induced following such divergent stimuli as serum, epidermal growth factor, neural growth factor (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar,35Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), short wave UV light, and DNA-alkylating agents (34Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, p38 has been suggested to induce transcription of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 upon hyperosmotic stress, since the hyperosmotic induction of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 mRNA can be blocked by p38 MAP kinase inhibition (36Schliess F. Heinrich S. Häussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since MAP kinase phosphatase 1 activity is only regulated on the level of transcription (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), its induction by p38 makes it an unlikely candidate for the hyperosmotic STAT activation via p38.Another possible mechanism for the MKK6/p38-mediated STAT activation by hyperosmolarity is via activation of a protein-tyrosine kinase controlled by serine/threonine phosphorylation by p38. We report here that genistein, an unspecific inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases inhibits activation of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 upon hyperosmotic shock, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 is not affected. This suggests that a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase different from Jak1 is required for hyperosmotic STAT activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. We therefore consider it to be more likely that a tyrosine kinase, not a tyrosine phosphatase, is the regulatory step between MKK6/p38 and STAT1 activation upon hypertonicity. In this respect, it is interesting to note that depending on the stress employed, activation of JNK can be either the result of an increased phosphorylation (anisomycin, UV irradiation, and osmotic stress) or an inhibition of a JNK phosphatase (heat shock, oxidative stress, and ethanol (37Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). If this model of JNK regulation is also valid for the activation of STAT1 upon hyperosmotic shock, it would support our notion that a tyrosine kinase is involved. Identification of this putative tyrosine kinase representing the link between hyperosmotic STAT activation and p38 will be our future goal. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinases are important mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. Regulation by MAP kinases has been implicated in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In mammals, MAP kinases are divided into at least three subfamilies: the “classical” extracellular signal-regulated kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2), the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and the cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein/p38. Whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases are preferentially activated by a variety of cell growth and differentiation stimuli and by hypoosmolarity, JNK and p38 are primarily activated by various environmental stresses (for reviews, see Refs. 1Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Like HOG1, p38 is activated in response to changes in environmental osmolarity. It further appears to be involved in the signal transduction of lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-1 (4Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

Activation of the p38 kinase cascade is known as one of the major events occurring after hyperosmotic shock (4Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that also the Jak/STAT pathway is activated by hyperosmolarity. Studies on Jak1-, Jak2-, and Tyk2-deficient cell lines suggested that Jak1 might be important for the hyperosmotic STAT activation (13Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we give evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 in response to hyperosmotic treatment occurs at least in part via the MKK6/p38 pathway. This was shown by inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase using specific inhibitors and by overexpression of wild type or kinase-deficient mutants of p38 and MKK6. Our data further indicate that the interaction between MKK6/p38 and STAT1 does not involve Jak1, although protein-tyrosine kinase activity is required for hyperosmotic STAT activation. It has been reported that the transactivating capability of STAT1 depends at least partially on the phosphorylation of serine 727, located within a potential MAP kinase consensus motif in the C-terminal transactivation domain (25David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 28Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 29Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after bacterial infection or administration of lipopolysaccharide prior to IFNγ treatment, phosphorylation of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 and at serine 727 occurred independently from each other, leading to an increased transcriptional response (30Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 was found to a larger extent to be also phosphorylated on serine 727 as compared with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, indicating that serine phosphorylation of STAT1 possibly facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation (30Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, one could speculate that p38 modulates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 by phosphorylation of serine 727. However, another group recently presented in vitro and in vivo evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases specifically phosphorylate STAT3 at serine 727 in response to growth factors negatively modulating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Moreover, these authors could show that neither JNK1 nor p38 was able to phosphorylate STAT1 or STAT3 in vitro when immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared after stimulation with 600 mm sorbitol (26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In correspondence to these observations, we found in this study that overexpression of wild type or kinase-deficient forms of p38 or MKK6 did not significantly affect phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727. Therefore, our data support the assumption that STAT1 is not a substrate of p38 in vivo Since p38 is a serine/threonine protein kinase and a direct action of p38 on STAT1 is unlikely, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 after hyperosmotic shock must occur indirectly. This could be either by activation of a tyrosine kinase controlled by serine-threonine phosphorylation or by inhibition of a tyrosine phosphatase negatively regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation. A tyrosine phosphatase that has been frequently associated with the Jak/STAT pathway is SHP2 (also termed as PTP1D, Syp, or SH-PTP2). The functional implications of SHP2 for the signal transduction via the Jak/STAT pathway are largely unknown. It binds with its SH2 domain specifically to phosphorylated tyrosine 759 from the gp130 receptor subunit cytoplasmic domain, thereby linking gp130 via Grb2 to the MAP kinase pathway (12Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Further, previous work by Schaper et al. (10Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Kim et al. (11Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) showed that activation of SHP2 limits acute phase protein expression most likely via dephosphorylation of gp130, Jaks, or STATs. Here we show that upon hyperosmotic shock SHP2 becomes phosphorylated with a time course similar to STAT1 activation and that this phosphorylation is regulated at least partially by MKK6/p38 and a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase. It is currently believed that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 corresponds to its phosphatase activity (27Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ulrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Since we did not observe that the SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation behaves in reverse to the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, we assume that inhibition of phosphatase activity of SHP2 is probably not involved in the activation of STAT1 due to hyperosmotic stress. Another phosphatase that was reported to negatively regulate STAT activation is MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (31Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30795-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This phosphatase belongs to a class of dual specific phosphatases inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase-type MAP kinases and JNK by dephosphorylation (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 33Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphatases are the products of immediate early genes whose mRNA is rapidly induced following such divergent stimuli as serum, epidermal growth factor, neural growth factor (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar,35Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, p38 has been suggested to induce transcription of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 upon hyperosmotic stress, since the hyperosmotic induction of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 mRNA can be blocked by p38 MAP kinase inhibition (36Schliess F. Heinrich S. Häussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since MAP kinase phosphatase 1 activity is only regulated on the level of transcription (32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), its induction by p38 makes it an unlikely candidate for the hyperosmotic STAT activation via p38. Another possible mechanism for the MKK6/p38-mediated STAT activation by hyperosmolarity is via activation of a protein-tyrosine kinase controlled by serine/threonine phosphorylation by p38. We report here that genistein, an unspecific inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases inhibits activation of STAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 upon hyperosmotic shock, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 is not affected. This suggests that a genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase different from Jak1 is required for hyperosmotic STAT activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. We therefore consider it to be more likely that a tyrosine kinase, not a tyrosine phosphatase, is the regulatory step between MKK6/p38 and STAT1 activation upon hypertonicity. In this respect, it is interesting to note that depending on the stress employed, activation of JNK can be either the result of an increased phosphorylation (anisomycin, UV irradiation, and osmotic stress) or an inhibition of a JNK phosphatase (heat shock, oxidative stress, and ethanol (37Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). If this model of JNK regulation is also valid for the activation of STAT1 upon hyperosmotic shock, it would support our notion that a tyrosine kinase is involved. Identification of this putative tyrosine kinase representing the link between hyperosmotic STAT activation and p38 will be our future goal. We thank W. Frisch for technical assistance and L. Terstegen, S. Thiel, and A. Martens for helpful discussion. We also thank A. Ziemiecki for kindly providing anti-Jak1 antibodies."

The site of action of NCS-1 and its biochemical targets that affect exocytosis are unknown. To allow further investigation of NCS-1 function, we have demonstrated that NCS-1 is a substrate forN-myristoyltransferase and generated recombinant myristoylated NCS-1.

The possibility that NCS-1 directly interacts with the exocytotic machinery to enhance exocytosis was tested using digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells.

In addition, exogenous NCS-1 did not regulate cyclic nucleotide levels in this system. These data suggest that the effects of NCS-1 seen in intact cells are likely to be due to an action on the early steps of stimulus-secretion coupling or on Ca2+ homeostasis. Myristoylated NCS-1 bound to membranes in the absence of Ca2+ and endogenous NCS-1 was tightly membrane-associated. Using biotinylated NCS-1, a series of specific binding proteins were detected in cytosol, chromaffin granule membrane, and microsome fractions of adrenal medulla. These included proteins distinct from those detected by biotinylated calmodulin, demonstrating the presence of multiple specific Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent binding proteins as putative targets for NCS-1 action. A model for NCS-1 function, from these data, indicates a constitutive membrane association independent of Ca2+.

Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 295: 1-12Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These small Ca2+-binding proteins include members expressed only in photoreceptor cells such as recoverin (2Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K.A. Philipov P.P.

Recoverin has a well defined function in the control of rhodopsin phosphorylation due to direct inhibition of rhodopsin kinase (3Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M.

Signal Trans. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are highly expressed in neurons and were originally all believed to be neuron-specific implying a key role in Ca2+-regulated events in the nervous system. The cellular function of many of the neuronal proteins of this family remains a mystery, but, in contrast, some insight has been gained into the role of frequenin/NCS-1 in the regulation of presynaptic function. Frequenin is a Drosophila protein that has been demonstrated in molecular genetic and other studies to regulate synaptic neurotransmission. Overexpression of frequenin inDrosophila, in the V7 mutant (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A.

J. Recept. Signal Trans. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and later in rodents (12Olafsson P. Soares H.D. Herzog K.-H. Wang T. Morgan J.I. Lu B. Mol.

Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), appears to be the frequenin orthologue expressed in those species. Recently, it has been shown that NCS-1 is not expressed solely in neurons, since it was detected in glial cells in the central nervous system (12Olafsson P. Soares H.D. Herzog K.-H. Wang T. Morgan J.I. Lu B. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, it is present in adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 neuroendocrine cells, where its overexpression also results in an increase in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis but from dense-core granules (14McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), analogous to the effect reported for frequenin in Drosophila for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is clear, therefore, that frequenin/NCS-1 has an important regulatory role in the steps leading to Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and dense core granules in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The step in the exocytotic sequence at which frequenin/NCS-1 acts is, however, not known. The biochemical processes on which NCS-1 might act in vivoare also unclear. From in vitro experiments, frequenin has been shown to activate membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, but only at low Ca2+ concentration, in rod outer segments (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A.

These in vitro effects on photoreceptor proteins may not be relevant to the function of frequenin/NCS-1 in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. In addition, NCS-1 has been shown to activate various calmodulin targets including cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, calcineurin, and nitric-oxide synthase (15Poulain C. Ferrus A. Mallart A. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 427: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NCS-1 has also been implicated as a direct or indirect (via cGMP) activator of Ca2+-dependent K+channels (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A.

Despite these interactions, the molecular targets for frequenin/NCS-1 action in vivo are not known for certain, and thus the mechanism by which evoked exocytosis is increased remains to be elucidated. From analysis of its biochemical properties (18Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. Mckay D.B. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), recoverin has been described as a calcium-myristoyl switch, and this was initially assumed to typify the behavior of all members of this family of proteins. Ca2+ binding to two of the four EF-hand-like domains of recoverin leads to the exposure of an N-terminal myristoyl group (3Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) believed to allow membrane attachment (19Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The movement of the myristoyl group also exposes a hydrophobic pocket that may then interact with target proteins (3Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). All other members of this family possess consensus myristoylation motifs (20Towler D.A. Gordin J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, another family member, the guanyl cyclase-activating protein 2, shows the distinct property of only binding to membranes and activating its target protein at low Ca2+ concentration and dissociates from membranes at micromolar Ca2+ (24Oleshevskaya E.V.

Frequenin and NCS-1 possess a putative N-myristoylation motif (10Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.-B. Nef P. J. Recept.

Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but their myristoylation and Ca2+dependence of membrane binding have not been examined for either native or recombinant protein. The aims of this study were to examine whether NCS-1 is a substrate for myristoyltransferase by bacterial co-expression with the yeast enzyme (25Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), to characterize myristoylated NCS-1, and to use the recombinant protein to investigate cellular functions of NCS-1. The results show that NCS-1 does indeed act as a substrate forN-myristoyltransferase, and the recombinant protein shows Ca2+-dependent conformational changes but Ca2+-independent interaction with membranes, and thus its behavior differs from recoverin. In addition, we have shown that NCS-1 does not appear to act directly on the exocytotic machinery in adrenal chromaffin cells, nor does it modulate cyclic nucleotide levels in permeabilized cells. Endogenous NCS-1 is tightly associated with cellular membranes in a Ca2+-independent manner, and we have detected multiple putative Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent membrane target proteins using recombinant NCS-1. Total RNA was extracted from whole brain of Wistar rats using an RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Surrey, UK) and cDNA synthesized with a reverse transcription system. cDNA encoding NCS-1 was amplified in polymerase chain reactions usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK), according to the supplier's protocol, and an Omne-E dryblock thermocycler (Hybaid, Middlesex, UK). The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-CATCATATGGGGAAATCCAACAGCAAGTTGA-3′ and 5′-CATGGATCCCTATACCAGCCCGTCGTAGAGG-3′, respectively. These were based on the nucleotide sequence of rat NCS-1 (Ref. 13De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The nucleotide sequence was established by automated sequencing. BL21 (DE3) cells (Promega) were transformed with pBB131 (25Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S.

Expression of both recombinant NCS-1 and NMT was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml myristate. The expression of myristoylated NCS-1 was confirmed by means of fluorography following induction of expression in the presence of 25 μCi/ml [3H]myristate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). For production of labeled purified protein, a 500-ml culture was grown in the presence of 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]myristate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin A) and stored at −80 °C until required. Myristoylated NCS-1 was purified using methods adapted from those of Zozulya et al. (26Zozulya S. Ladant D. Stryer L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for recoverin and neurocalcin. Upon thawing, cells were added to 1 volume of buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm EGTA, incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min, ultrasonicated, and incubated with 2 μg/ml DNase for 15 min, and finally cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The cleared lysate was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) column. The column was washed, and NCS-1 was eluted with buffer A containing 5 mmEGTA. For further purification, pooled eluted fractions containing NCS-1 were diluted with 3 volumes of water and applied to a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm EGTA), and NCS-1 was eluted with a 0–600 mm KCl gradient in a single peak. All chromatography was performed at room temperature (22–25 °C) using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Peak fractions containing recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the pooled fractions were stored at −80 °C until required. Analysis by HPLC used reverse phase chromatography with elution by a 0–50% acetonitrile gradient. Samples for electrophoresis were routinely dissolved in sample buffer (125 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 1.25% SDS (w/v), 2 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose (w/v), 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.001% bromphenol blue), boiled, and separated on a 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For experiments investigating calcium binding to NCS-1, EDTA was omitted and replaced with either 5 mmEGTA or 5 mm CaCl2. For detection of [3H]myristate incorporation, gels were impregnated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed on x-ray film overnight at −70 °C. Purified recombinant NCS-1 (1 μm) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 139 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 5 mmnitrilotriacetic acid, and 5 mm EGTA was excited at room temperature at a wavelength of 280 nm, and the emission spectra from 290 to 410 nm were detected using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 luminescence spectrometer. The free Ca2+ concentration was increased by incremental additions of CaCl2, and the subsequent spectra were similarly recorded. Whole brains of Wistar rats were homogenized in HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mmsucrose, 70 mm potassium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 230 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 1600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min at 4 °C, and the subsequent pellet was resuspended in 125 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.5). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, and 2 mm EDTA; and stored at 4 °C until required. Membranes were washed twice by centrifugation at 13000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 139 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 5 mmnitrilotriacetic acid, and 5 mm EGTA and finally resuspended in the same buffer with added MgCl2 and CaCl2 to give a calculated free Mg2+concentration of 2 mm and free Ca2+concentration of 0 or 10 μm. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min with 3H-labeled NCS-1 in a total volume of 500 μl, the membranes were washed twice in the appropriate calcium buffer, and duplicate aliquots were subjected to scintillation counting. Background values for NCS-1 bound in the absence of brain membrane were subtracted. Bovine chromaffin cell cultures were prepared and maintained as described previously (27Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized in 300 μl/well permeabilization buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 139 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) containing 20 μm digitonin (Novabiochem, Nottingham, UK). After the indicated times, the supernatants were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 3 min to remove cell debris, and then both supernatants and cells were precipitated with an equal volume of methanol at −20 °C to concentrate protein samples before solubilization in 300 μl of SDS dissociation buffer and boiling. Samples were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting as above. For secretion assays, the cells were permeabilized as above for 10 min (step 1). Subsequent incubations were carried out in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 139 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, and 5 mm EGTA in the presence of various amounts of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to give the desired free Ca2+ concentration and a calculated free Mg2+concentration of 2 mm. The cells were then incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of recombinant NCS-1 in the absence of Ca2+ (step 2). Cells were then challenged in step 3 with buffer containing no Ca2+ or up to 10 μm free Ca2+, again in the presence or absence of recombinant NCS-1, and catecholamine released over a 40-min period was determined by means of a fluorometric assay (28Von Euler U.S. Floding I. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1955; 118: 45-56Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and treated as above. For assay of cAMP, the incubation medium was removed after step 3, mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 8 mm EDTA, boiled for 2 min, sonicated for 15 s, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min. Levels of cAMP in the subsequent supernatants were determined using the appropriate enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the assay of cGMP, 110 volume of lysis buffer (5% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide in 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 5.8) was added to the wells at the end of the incubation in step 3, and samples were taken for assay of cGMP after the acetylation of samples using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cytosol, chromaffin granule membrane, and microsome fractions were prepared from bovine adrenal medulla by standard techniques (29Burgoyne R.D. Williams G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For biotinylation of recombinant NCS-1, ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), or purified bovine brain calmodulin (Sigma), the proteins (200 μg/ml) were mixed with 6-(biotinamidocaproylamindo) N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) from a stock solution in Me2SO to give a 100-fold molar excess of biotinylating reagent. Incubation was performed at room temperature for 2 h and stopped by the addition of a final concentration of 100 mm glycine. To remove excess biotin, biotinylated proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 139 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, pH 7.4. The concentration of the biotinylated proteins was determined by takingA 280 and converting to mg/ml based on the predicted molar extinction coefficient. Biotinylated probes were stored at −20 °C until use. Proteins separated on SDS gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for analysis. Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (the above buffer plus 5% milk, 5% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.5% Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h with three changes and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated probes at 3.6–8 μg/ml in blocking solution (with the addition of MgCl2 and CaCl2 to obtain the appropriate free Ca2+ concentration and 2 mmfree Mg2+). Membranes were washed four times in buffer plus the appropriate free Ca2+ concentration and 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at 1:400 in blocking solution for 30 min. The membranes were washed four times as above, and bound biotinylated fragments were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In other experiments, binding of biotinylated proteins to bovine brain calcineurin (Sigma) was assayed using a similar protocol. NCS-1 has a potential N-terminal myristoylation site (10Nef S.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether NCS-1 can be a substrate for N-myristoyltransferase, NCS-1 was co-expressed in bacteria with the yeast enzyme, and [3H]myristic acid was added to the growth medium to allow detection of myristic acid incorporation. Bacterial cultures expressing the enzyme alone revealed no labeled polypeptides following an overnight exposure of the fluorography. In contrast, when both plasmids for N-myristoyltransferase and for NCS-1 were present, an intensively labeled polypeptide of the expected size for NCS-1 was detected by fluorography after induction of protein expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig.1 A), and labeled NCS-1 could be purified (see below), suggesting that NCS-1 is indeed an effective substrate for the NMT enzyme, which is known to show unique specificity for myristate. For bulk expression of myristoylated NCS-1 protein, expression was induced in bacterial cultures grown with the addition of 5 μg/ml myristic acid to the medium. The NCS-1 was expressed in high levels as a soluble protein, and after bacterial cell lysis, the NCS-1 was purified by Ca2+-dependent chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. This single step purification gave a substantial purification of NCS-1 from the bacterial lysate (Fig. 1 B). In some cases, further purification was carried out by ion exchange chromatography, but this was not routinely required and did not markedly improve the purity of the NCS-1. On both phenyl-Sepharose and ion exchange chromatography, NCS-1 resolved as a single but asymmetric peak with a long tail. Since it was possible that not all of the protein would be myristoylated, further analysis was carried out to determine the relative amounts of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated protein in the pool of purified protein. Analysis of purified NCS-1 by reverse-phase HPLC revealed two discrete peaks both of which contained NCS-1 when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C). The first corresponded to the position of [3H]myristate-labeled NCS-1 in other experiments, so the myristoylated pool of NCS-1 from Fig. 1 C amounted to 58% of the total NCS-1. To establish the functional nature of the bacterially expressed myristoylated NCS-1, its ability to bind Ca2+, leading to Ca2+-dependent conformational change, was assessed. First, the effect of Ca2+ on migration of NCS-1 on SDS-PAGE was examined. As shown for other related Ca2+-binding proteins such as Drosophilafrequenin (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), NCS-1 underwent a conformational change in the presence of Ca2+ that resulted in faster migration on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A). In addition, conformational change could be demonstrated due to increasing Ca2+ concentration from the monitoring of tryptophan fluorescence emission. NCS-1 possesses two tryptophans at positions 30 and 103 (10Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.-B. Nef P. J. Recept.

We have previously demonstrated that this unique structural feature is associated with resistance to rapid desensitization of phosphoinositide signaling in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (Heding, A., Vrecl, M., Bogerd, J., McGregor, A., Sellar, R., Taylor, P. L., and Eidne, K. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11472–11477). Using receptors tagged with a nonapeptide of the influenza hemagglutinin protein to enable immunoprecipitation, we now demonstrate that the mammalian GnRH-R is not phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner. In contrast, the mammalian thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor and the African catfish GnRH-R, both of which have a C-terminal tail, are phosphorylated in response to agonist challenge. Furthermore, chimeras of the mammalian GnRH-R with the C-terminal tail of either the mammalian thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor or the catfish GnRH-R are also phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner. Only those receptors having C-terminal tails showed desensitization of phosphoinositide responses within 5–10 min of agonist challenge. We also show that the internalization of all these receptors when expressed transiently in COS-7 cells is similar. This dissociates receptor internalization from rapid desensitization and demonstrates that the lack of a C-terminal tail in the mammalian GnRH-R results in an inability of the receptor to undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation and that this results directly in a resistance to rapid desensitization.

The receptor for GnRH (GnRH-R) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and the binding of GnRH activates phospholipase C (PLC) via G-proteins of the Gαq/11 family. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, and these second messengers are able to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar), thereby mediating, at least in part, the biological effects of GnRH. At present the GnRH-R is unique among those GPCRs that couple preferentially to the activation of PLC, as it does not undergo rapid (seconds to minutes) desensitization following exposure to agonist. This is true of the GnRH-R expressed either as an endogenous protein in an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line (αT3–1) or as a recombinant protein in a number of cell types (2Davidson J.S.

Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that, although GnRH-Rs of αT3–1 cells are not acutely regulated, muscarinic M3 receptors co-expressed as recombinant proteins in these cells are rapidly desensitized (6Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that structural features of the GnRH-R underlie its resistance to acute regulation. The mechanism underlying acute regulation of GPCRs has been extensively investigated for the Gαs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor, and it is accepted that receptor phosphorylation is responsible for receptor-G-protein uncoupling (7Dohlman H.G.

Agonist-dependent phosphorylation has also been demonstrated for a number of PLC-coupled receptors, and this has been implicated in desensitization (13Tobin A.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the transduction pathway to which receptors are linked, these phosphorylation sites are often in the C-terminal tail or in some circumstances within the third intracellular loop (13Tobin A.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is of interest, therefore, that mammalian GnRH-Rs have no C-terminal tail and only a relatively short third intracellular loop with relatively few serine/threonine residues as potential phosphorylation sites (14Tsutsumi M.

We have recently reported that the lack of acute regulation of the GnRH-R is associated with the absence of a C-terminal tail (16Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11472-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the primary aim of the current study was to investigate whether the GnRH-R is resistant to agonist-dependent phosphorylation. In addition, we have explored the consequence of the lack of a C-terminal tail on both receptor phosphorylation and function by using the African catfish GnRH-R (cfGnRH-R) and the rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (rTRH-R) (both of which have C-terminal tails) and chimeras of the rGnRH-R having the C-terminal tail of either the cfGnRH-R or rTRH-R. Given the potential role of phosphorylation and/or the C-terminal tail in receptor internalization (17Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we also compared the kinetics and extent of receptor internalization with that of agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization.

UK), Ro-318220 was from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK), and protein A-Sepharose from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (St. Albans, UK). Molecular biology reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Life Technologies (Paisley UK), or Qiagen Ltd. (Crawley, UK) unless otherwise stated. To examine receptor phosphorylation, we incorporated an epitope tag sequence into that of the receptor to allow immunoprecipitation with a commercially available antibody. A double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment corresponding to a triple repeat of an epitope of the amino acid sequence of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein (YPYDVPDYA) was synthesized and ligated in frame, into the N terminus of the rGnRH-R, rGnRH-R/rTRH-R tail, and rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R tail chimeric receptors in the vector pcDNA3. The cfGnRH-R was constructed to contain a single HA epitope. The epitope-tagged rTRH-R cDNA, which contains a 3HA tag located after the translational initiation codon (ATG), was kindly provided by Dr. G. Milligan (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK). The inclusion of the epitope tag did not influence the ability of these receptors to bind agonist or to undergo agonist-dependent internalization (Ref. 19Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A.

COS-7 or HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with the appropriate cDNA using Transfectam (Promega, Southampton, UK) and clones selected using Geneticin (1 mg/ml). COS-7 cells used for transient receptor expression were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate cDNA constructs using Superfect (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) in either 100-mm dishes (1.5 × 106 cells) or 25-cm2 flasks (0.5 × 106 cells) and used 48–72 h later as stated. This was adapted from a previously described method (20Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were cultured directly in six-well multidishes. For cells that were transiently transfected, cells were removed from 25-cm2 flasks 24 h following transfection and re-plated in six-well multidishes (one flask of cells/well) and left for an additional 24 h. Both stable cell lines and transiently transfected cells were washed with Krebs/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, composition (mm): HEPES 10, NaHCO3 4.2, glucose 11.7, MgSO4 1.2, KCl 4.7, NaCl 118, and CaCl2 1.3) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffer per well containing 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate. Test agents were then added directly to the wells and incubation continued at 37 °C for the required time. When the PKC inhibitor, Ro-318220 (1-[3-(amidinothio)propyl-1H-indoyl-3-yl]-3-(1-methyl-1H-indoyl-3-yl)-maleimide ethane sulfate), was used, this was added 10 min prior to the test agent. After the required time, buffer was aspirated and 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer added (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine). After 30 min on ice, the solubilization buffer was removed and centrifuged (3 min, 10,000 × g). The primary antibody (0.6 μg of a rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against the HA epitope tag; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was then added to 0.8 ml of the cleared supernatant. After 60 min on ice, immune complexes were separated by incubation (15–30 min, 4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose beads (150 μl of 30 mg/ml) under constant agitation. Beads were harvested by centrifugation (10 s, 10,000 ×g) and washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mmTris, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 (pH 7.4), followed by two washes with 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris, 10 mmEDTA (pH 7.4). Samples were then extracted into 20 μl of sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 200 mm dithiothreitol) by standing in boiling water for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gels dried and subjected to autoradiography. All autoradiographs shown are representative examples of at least three independent experiments. In order to examine the phosphorylation state of receptors, we had to ensure that the immunoprecipitations, as described above, were effective. To demonstrate this and to obtain an indication of the relative efficiencies of immunoprecipitation for the different receptors, we carried out immunoprecipitations followed by Western blots. Immunoprecipitations were performed exactly as described above, with the exception that cells were not labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the buffer contained 1.2 mm KH2PO4. Following resolution by 8% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. This was blocked overnight at 4 °C (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% dried milk) and then probed with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope tag (clone 12CA5: Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sussex, UK). This antibody was visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All blots shown are representative examples of at least three independent experiments. Following transfection of COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes, cells were trypsinized and plated into 48-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and the assays performed 48 h after transfection. ELISA for the measurement of surface expressed HA-tagged receptors was based on the method described previously (21Cook J.V.F. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2800-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Following washing (three times in PBS), cells were blocked with 0.1 m NaHCO3 containing 1% nonfat milk (pH 8.6) and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of primary rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 3P10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sussex, UK) in incubation buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS (three times) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a 1:1000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG. After final washes in PBS (three times), the reaction was developed using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) liquid substrate system. The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 n H2SO4, and a 100-μl sample was taken for colorimetric measurement at 450 nm using a Labsystem multiscan MCC/340 reader. Untransfected COS-7 cells were assayed concurrently to determine background. All experiments were done in triplicate and results corrected for the protein content per well using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Herts, UK). Total [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsPx) generation by agonist stimulation of transiently expressed receptors was determined as described previously (16Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11472-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were removed from 100-mm dishes 24 h following transfection and transferred to 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). Cells were incubated with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 μCi/wellmyo-[3H]inositol (approximately 120 Ci/mmol) for 48 h. Medium was then removed and the cell monolayers washed with 10 ml of buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 4 mm KCl, 8 mm glucose, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 10 mm LiCl and then incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 10 mm LiCl and agonist at the required concentration. Reactions were terminated by removal of the agonist and the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold perchloric acid or boiling water. Neutralized supernatants from extracted cells were then transferred to tubes containing AG 1X8 anion exchange resin. [3H]InsPx were then eluted and the associated radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Receptor internalization assays were performed as described previously (16Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11472-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were removed from 100-mm dishes 24 h following transfection and re-plated out at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 48 h, cells were washed once with assay medium (HEPES-modified DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) before being incubated with 125I-labeled GnRH agonist,125I-labeled chicken II GnRH, or [3H]TRH-(3-Me-His2) in 0.5 ml of assay medium for time intervals ranging from 5 min to 2 h at 37 °C. At appropriate times, cells were transferred onto ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, the extracellular receptor-associated ligand was removed by washing once with 1 ml of acid solution (50 mm acetic acid and 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.8) for 12 min. The acid wash was collected to determine the surface-bound radioactivity, and the internalized radioactivity was determined after solubilizing the cells in a 1% solution of SDS in 0.2 mNaOH. Nonspecific binding for each time point was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled agonist. Iodinated radiolabeled GnRH analogue was prepared using the glucose oxidase/lactoperoxidase method and purified by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column in 0.01 m acetic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of the125I-des-Gly10,[d-Trp6]GnRH was approximately 56 μCi/μg and was calculated from self-displacement assays using either rat pituitary homogenates or HEK-293 cells stably expressing the wild type GnRH-R. The specific activity of the 125I-chicken II tracer was approximately 90 μCi/μg and was calculated as described (16Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11472-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, we were able to demonstrate that the HA epitope-tagged rGnRH-R (HA-rGnRH-R), when expressed stably in HEK-293 cells, could be immunoprecipitated effectively by a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the epitope tag. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitate with a monoclonal antibody raised against the epitope tag revealed a band of 70 kDa present only in the transfected cells and not the parental cell line (Fig. 1 A). There was some cross-reactivity between the peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (used as the secondary antibody in the Western blot) and the IgG of the rabbit polyclonal antibody used for the immunoprecipitation. This appeared as a band of approximately 56 kDa irrespective of whether or not the cells were expressing the epitope-tagged receptor. Short term (5 min) treatment of cells with 1 μm GnRH did not affect our ability to detect the HA-rGnRH-R (Fig. 1 A). In studies examining the potential phosphorylation of the HA-rGnRH-R, we were unable to detect any additional phosphorylated bands in transfected compared with non-transfected cells at 70 kDa or at any other point on the autoradiograph either under basal (non-stimulated) conditions or following short term (5–15 min) treatment with 1 μm GnRH or following the activation of PKC with 1 μm phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). We next examined whether the absence of agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the rGnRH-R was a consequence of the lack of a C-terminal tail. Initial experiments were performed using the cfGnRH-R, which, in contrast to the rGnRH-R, does possess a C-terminal tail. In COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either the HA-rGnRH-R or HA-cfGnRH-R, we were able to detect a number of specific bands by Western blotting following immunoprecipitation. Blots of the HA-cfGnRH-R revealed a major band of immunoreactivity at 83 kDa along with other bands at 44, 130, and 190 kDa. Blots of the HA-rGnRH-R revealed an immunoreactive band at 78 kDa. In addition, there was a faint band at 120 kDa and an intense band at 42 kDa (Fig.2 A). Although untransfected cells also have an immunoreactive band at approximately this molecular mass, the high intensity of the band in blots from HA-rGnRH-R-transfected cells and the presence of a similar band at the slightly higher molecular mass of 44 kDa in HA-cfGnRH-R-transfected cells leads us to believe that this is also a form of the HA-rGnRH-R. In phosphorylation studies on the HA-cfGnRH-R, we were able to detect basal phosphorylation of the 83-kDa band. Furthermore, challenge of the cells for 5 min with 1 μm chicken II GnRH (the preferred agonist of the cfGnRH-R; Ref. 22Tensen C. Okuzawa K. Blomenröhr M. Rebers F. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Schulz R. Goos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) resulted in an increase in the level of phosphorylation of this band but no clear evidence of an agonist-dependent phosphorylation of any other bands (Fig.2 B). In addition there was a smaller increase in the level of phosphorylation of the 83-kDa band following challenge of the cells for 5 min with 1 μm PDBu, an activator of PKC (Fig.2 B). In COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the HA-rGnRH-R, we were not, however, able to detect basal phosphorylation nor any increases in the phosphorylation of bands at any molecular size following challenge with either GnRH (1 μm, 5 min) or PDBu (1 μm, 5 min) (Fig. 2 B). Our Western blotting following immunoprecipitation demonstrated that we were able to immunoprecipitate far more of the 83-kDa band of the HA-cfGnRH-R than the 78-kDa band of the HA-rGnRH-R (see above). Given that both of these receptor constructs are recognized by the same HA epitope tag, it is likely that this difference in immunoprecipitation is a consequence of different levels of receptor expression. Indeed, although measuring only cell-surface expression, the ELISA data suggest that the HA-cfGnRH-R is expressed at much higher levels than the HA-rGnRH-R (see below). It was possible, therefore, that our inability to detect phosphorylation of the HA-rGnRH-R was a consequence of a relatively low level of expression and immunoprecipitation compared with that of the HA-cfGnRH-R. We therefore reduced the loading onto the gels of immunoprecipitated HA-cfGnRH-R by 90% to produce an 83-kDa band in the Western blot following immunoprecipitation that was equivalent in intensity to the 78-kDa band of the HA-rGnRH-R (Fig.2 C). Under these circumstances we were still able to see phosphorylation of the 83-kDa band of the HA-cfGnRH-R under basal conditions and an increase in the level of phosphorylation following challenge of the cells with either chicken II GnRH (1 μm, 5 min) or PDBu (1 μm, 5 min) (Fig. 2 D). Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the 83-kDa band of the HA-cfGnRH-R occurred in a time-dependent manner and was maximal by approximately 1 min (Fig. 3). Preincubation of cells with an inhibitor of PKC (Ro-318220; 10 min, 10 μm) did not reduce the agonist-dependent (chicken II GnRH; 1 μm, 5 min) phosphorylation of this 83-kDa band. The efficacy of Ro-318220 was demonstrated by its ability to block phosphorylation mediated by challenge of the cells with PDBu (1 μm, 5 min) (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation experiments were also conducted on the HA-rTRH-R and the chimeric HA-rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R-tail and HA-rGnRH-R/rTRH-R-tail. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting demonstrated bands for the HA-rTRH-R at 85 and 44 kDa with a fainter band at 110 kDa, for the HA-rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R-tail at 83 and 44 kDa with a fainter band at 108 kDa, and for the HA-rGnRH-R/rTRH-R-tail at 83 and 44 kDa with bands also at 108 and 158 kDa (Fig. 4). Although bands were also present in untransfected cells in the region of the lower molecular mass (∼44 kDa) bands of all the receptor types, the greater intensity in transfected cells leads us to believe that this immunoreactivity is indeed associated with the receptor. Although we were able to visualize all of the HA-epitope-tagged receptors when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells in the molecular mass region of the 83-kDa phosphorylated band of the HA-cfGnRH-R (HA-rGnRH-R, 78 kDa; HA-rTRH-R, 85 kDa; HA-rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R-tail, 83 kDa; and HA-rGnRH-R/rTRH-R-tail, 83 kDa), there were marked differences in the band intensities between receptor types. This implies marked differences in our ability to immunoprecipitate the various HA-tagged receptors, which again may be related to the levels of receptor expression (see below). Based on the intensity of the 78–85-kDa bands for each receptor, we could immunoprecipitate the HA-cfGnRH-R > HA-rTRH-R > HA-rGnRH-R > HA-rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R tail > HA-rGnRH-R/rTRH-R tail. The relatively poor detection of the chimeric receptors by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting is emphasized in Fig. 4, in which the cfGnRH-R bands are overexposed (Fig. 4, ii, exposure 1; and iii, exposure 2) in order to allow visualization of the chimeric receptors. Following treatment of cells expressing the HA-rTRH-R with TRH (1 μm, 5 min), there was an increase in the level of phosphorylation associated with the 85-kDa band (Fig.5 i). Furthermore, despite the very low level of immunoprecipitation of the chimeric receptors, we were able to demonstrate agonist-dependent (GnRH; 1 μm, 5 min) phosphorylation of each of them (Fig. 5,ii and iii). This enhanced phosphorylation was associated with bands on the autoradiographs that coincided with the molecular mass bands of 83–85 kDa detected by Western blotting following immunoprecipitation (see above). These phosphorylated bands were broad but enhanced following agonist stimulation, and our ability to detect agonist-dependent phosphorylation of these poorly expressed/immunoprecipitated receptors further supports our argument that the rGnRH-R is not phosphorylated following exposure to agonist. With the possible exception of the rGnRH-R/rTRH-R tail chimera, PDBu had relatively little effect on the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 5), suggesting that agonist-dependent phosphorylation is unlikely to be PKC-mediated. This is in agreement with experiments on the cfGnRH-R (see above). ELISA assays were performed on intact cells to examine the membrane expression of receptors. Based on the absorbance at 450 nm, the extents of expression for the different constructs relative to the rGnRH-R were: cfGnRH-R, 8.55 ± 3.39; rGnRH-R/cfGnRH-R tail, 2.86 ± 0.88; rTRH-R, 6.12 ± 2.73; rGnRH-R/rTRH-R tail, 0.97 ± 0.19 (-fold over rGnRH-R, mean ± S.E., n = 4 for all experiments) (see also Fig. 6). Previous studies have demonstrated that the functional desensitization of PLC-activating GPCRs can be demonstrated experimentally by showing the failure of agonist stimulation to maintain the initial rate of [3H]InsPx accumulation against a Li+ block of inositol monophosphatase (which provides an index of total PLC activity) (6Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the current study we show that challenge of COS-7 cells transiently expressing the rGnRH-R with 1 μm GnRH did, however, result in an accumulation of [3H]InsPx that was approximately linear for at least 45 min (Fig. 7). Thus, the initial rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis was sustained throughout the experimental period, indicating a lack of functional desensitization. In contrast, the accumulation of [3H]InsPx in response to challenge of all other receptors (rTRH-R, cfGnRH-R, rGnRH-"

Growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrate in wounds to stimulate stromal cell function and proliferation. The ability of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) such as IGFBP-3 to reduce the rate of IGF-I clearance from wounds suggests that IGFBP-3 might bind directly to fibrinogen/fibrin. Studies presented here show that IGFBP-3 does indeed bind to fibrinogen and fibrin immobilized on immunocapture plates, withK d values = 0.67 and 0.70 nm, respectively, and competitive binding studies suggest that the IGFBP-3 heparin binding domain may participate in this binding. IGF-I does not compete for IGFBP-3 binding; instead, IGF-I binds immobilized IGFBP-3·fibrinogen and IGFBP-3·fibrin complexes with affinity similar to that of IGF-I for the type I IGF receptor. In the presence of plasminogen, most IGFBP-3 binds directly to fibrinogen, although 35–40% of the IGFBP-3 binds to fibrinogen-bound plasminogen. IGFBP-3 also binds specifically to native fibrin clots, and addition of exogenous IGFBP-3 increases IGF-I binding. These studies suggest that IGF-I can concentrate at wound sites by binding to fibrin-immobilized IGFBP-3, and that the lower IGF affinity of fibrin-bound IGFBP-3 allows IGF-I release to type I IGF receptors of stromal cells migrating into the fibrin clot.

Since IGFBPs such as IGFBP-3 have higher affinity for IGF-I than does the type I IGF receptor, it is not surprising that IGFBP-3 can inhibit IGF action (1Jones J. Clemmons D.R. Endocrin.

However, IGFBPs bound to extracellular matrix may have lower IGF affinity (9Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R J. Biol.

By binding an 18-amino acid heparin binding domain (HBD), which is highly conserved in IGFBP-3 and the closely related protein IGFBP-5, heparin and certain other glycosaminoglycans apparently change the conformation of these IGFBPs, resulting in significantly lower affinity for IGF-I (9Arai T.

In addition, IGFBP-3 proteolysis has been described in many in vivo and in vitro situations, resulting in IGFBP-3 fragments with low affinity for IGFs (1Jones J. Clemmons D.R. Endocrin.

However, another possibility is that the IGFBP-3·IGF-I complex binds directly to fibrin; this would be reminiscent of the ability of fibrinogen/fibrin to bind with high affinity to basic fibroblast growth factor, another mitogen that plays a role in the wound healing process (24Sahni A. Odrljin T. Francis C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7554-7559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This paper describes studies which show that IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3·IGF-I complexes do indeed bind with high affinity to fibrinogen/fibrin and to fibrin clots, and suggest that the IGFBP-3 HBD participates in this binding process. Recombinant human IGF-I and LR3-IGF-I were purchased from GroPep, Ltd (Adelaide, Australia). Recombinant human IGFBP-5 was produced in a baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity chromatography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (25Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most studies used recombinant human IGFBP-3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described previously (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar, 26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some experiments used recombinant human IGFBP-3BV and IGFBP-3hbdBP1BV produced in a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar,26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar); IGFBP-3hbdBP1BV is identical to native IGFBP-3, except that the heparin binding domain has been replaced by the homologous but non-heparin binding sequence of IGFBP-1 (26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1 was purified from human amniotic fluid by affinity chromatography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar); quantitation was by radioimmunoassay using a kit from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc. (Webster, TX). Fibrinogen was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Peptide IGFBP-3hbd (KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR), which encodes the heparin binding domain of IGFBP-3 (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar), was synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Glu-Pg was purified as described previously (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin (Pm) was obtained from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT). Human citrate plasma was obtained from outdated blood bank supplies or from laboratory personnel. Binding of IGFBP-3 to fibrinogen and fibrin was characterized using an immobilized ligand-based assay system adapted from a similar system used to characterize IGFBP interactions with other proteins (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar, 26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm.

Optimal binding conditions, fibrinogen coating concentration, plate type, and incubation parameters were determined and are presented in the following assay protocol. 96-well immunological plates (Polysorb, Nunc, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were coated with 5 μg/ml fibrinogen, unless otherwise stated, in 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 9.8, overnight at 4 °C. The plates were rinsed with 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% NaN3. To convert fibrinogen to fibrin, 100 μl/well of 20 NIH units/ml human thrombin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2% BSA, 0.2% NaN3, 1 mm CaCl2 was added to washed wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Fibrinogen conversion to fibrin was terminated by rinsing the plates three times with 1 m NaCl, 8 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2% NaN3. An additional rinse was performed with 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2% NaN3. Both fibrinogen and fibrin plates were blocked in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% BSA, 10 mm lysine, 0.2% NaN3; tightly sealed in plastic wrap; and stored for up to 1 month. For an assay, plates were rinsed twice with 200 μl of 30 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% NaN3 (assay buffer). IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, were each iodinated by the chloramine-T method to a specific activity of ∼150 μCi/μg protein (13Campbell P.G. Novak J.F. Yanosick T.B. McMaster J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 125I-IGFBP-3 (50,000 cpm) or125I-IGF-I (50,000 cpm) were incubated with various concentrations of IGFBP-3, IGFBP-3BV, IGFBP-3hbdBP1BV, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-3hbd, IGF-I, fibrinogen, Pm, Glu-Pg, ε-aminocaproic acid (εACA), arginine, or heparin in 100 μl of assay buffer; unless stated otherwise, incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound radioactivity was removed by rinsing the wells twice with 200 μl of ice-cold assay buffer. Bound radioactivity was solubilized with 200 μl of 1n NaOH, transferred to 12 × 75-mm glass test tubes, and counted for radioactivity. 96-well immunological plates (MaxiSorb, Nunc) were coated with 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-human fibrinogen antibody (Enzyme Research Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C or for 3 h at 23 °C in 100 μl of 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 9.8. Plates were rinsed with PBS and blocked as described in the solid-phase plate assay protocol. In a separate, uncoated 96-well test plate (Sarstedt) various concentrations of fibrinogen, IGFBP-3BV, 125I-IGFBP-3, and/or human citrate plasma were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl of assay buffer for 1 h at 37 °C; this allows all reactants to associate in the fluid phase. At the end of the incubation period, 100 μl of reactants were transferred to the blocked and rinsed 96-well plates that were coated with the anti-fibrinogen antibody. After 30 min at 23 °C, unbound radioactivity was removed by rinsing wells twice with assay buffer. Bound radioactivity, representing IGFBP-3·fibrinogen complexes, was released by incubating wells with 200 μl of 1 m acetic acid for 10 min at 23 °C. Acid washes were transferred to 12 × 75-mm glass test tubes and counted for radioactivity. Radioactivity bound in the absence of added fibrinogen served as an estimate of nonspecific binding. Fibrin clots were formed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes by mixing citrate plasma with assay buffer containing CaCl2; total reaction volume was 100 μl, final CaCl2 concentration was 5 mm and, unless stated otherwise, 25 μl of citrate plasma were added. After adding ∼100,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGFBP-3, either with or without IGFBP-3, the mixture was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific incorporation of trace into fibrin clots was determined in mixtures not containing CaCl2. To terminate incubations, fibrin clots were carefully suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold assay buffer and then pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 2 min. After this wash step was repeated, the vial tips were cut off and then counted for radioactivity. IGFBP-3BV (13 μg) was diluted in 0.25 m NaHCO3, pH 9.2, to a total volume of 45 μl. After 1.4 mg of NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce ) was dissolved in 40 μl of H2O, 5 μl of this solution were mixed with the IGFBP-3BV solution. The mixture was placed on an orbital shaker for 1 h at 22 °C, after which the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Unincorporated biotin was separated from biotinylated IGFBP-3BV (bn-IGFBP-3) using a Quick-spin column as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). By SDS-PAGE, IGFBP-3BV in bn-IGFBP-3 was the size expected for the intact native protein. Preparations of bn-IGFBP-3 were stored at 4 °C. 10 μg each of pure fibrinogen, Glu-Pg, and IGFBP-1 were electrophoresed on a 7.5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was washed for 30 min with 3% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in 0.5% BSA in TBS, washed for 10 min with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS (TBST), and then incubated overnight with 32 ng/ml bn-IGFBP-3 in TBST. After washing in TBST buffer, the membrane was incubated in streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase diluted in TBST buffer (1:500) for 45 min at 22 °C. After several washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with the chemiluminescent reagants provided in the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak film for 5–30 min at 22 °C. ECL reagants and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Normal human citrate plasma was clotted by addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. After 90 min, the resultant fibrin clot was rinsed and cryosectioned into 5-μm sections. Sequential sections were incubated with normal rabbit serum or with rabbit antisera to plasminogen (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or IGFBP-3 (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc.). Immunofluorescent staining was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). 125I-IGFBP-3 bound specifically to fibrinogen or fibrin immobilized on immunocapture plates. As shown in Fig. 1 A, increasing the amount of fibrinogen/fibrin immobilized on the plates resulted in increased binding of 125I-IGFBP-3. IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-3, but not IGFBP-1, efficiently competed with 125I-IGFBP-3 for binding to fibrinogen (Fig. 1 B) and fibrin (data not shown). Scatchard analysis revealed that: 1) IGFBP-3 bound comparably to fibrinogen (K d = 0.67 ± 0.2 nm; mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments) and fibrin (K d = 0.7 ± 0.2 nm; mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments); 2) 1 mol of fibrinogen bound 0.15 mol of IGFBP-3; and 3) 1 mol of fibrin had 59 ± 15% more125I-IGFBP-3 binding sites than did 1 mol of fibrinogen. As shown in Fig. 1 C, IGFBP-3 binding to immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin was quite stable but was rapidly reversible in the presence of 500 mm arginine. IGFBP-3 also bound fibrinogen by ligand blot. Fibrinogen, Glu-Pg, and IGFBP-1 were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then incubated with bn-IGFBP-3. As shown in Fig. 2, bn-IGFBP-3 bound as expected to the ∼86-kDa Glu-Pg protein but not to IGFBP-1. In addition, bn-IGFBP-3 bound to at least two proteins of mass >200 kDa in the fibrinogen lane; the size of these proteins is consistent with the expected size of the common forms of plasma fibrinogen (24Sahni A. Odrljin T. Francis C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7554-7559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Since the IGFBP-3 HBD participates in binding to plasminogen, prekallikrein, and the IGF·acid-labile subunit binary complex (4Baxter R.C. Firth S.M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar, 26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that the IGFBP-3 HBD participates in fibrinogen binding. To test this hypothesis, heparin and a synthetic 18-amino acid peptide encoding the IGFBP-3 HBD were evaluated for their ability to compete with125I-IGFBP-3 for binding to fibrinogen/fibrin. Both IGFBP-3hbd (Fig. 3 A) and heparin (data not shown) interfered in a dose-dependent manner with binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 to immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin. In addition, IGFBP-3hbdBP1BV, a full-length IGFBP-3 protein mutated to replace the HBD with the homologous but non-heparin binding region of IGFBP-1, had a ∼10-fold lower affinity for fibrin than did native IGFBP-3BV (Fig.3 B). Coincubating 125I-IGF-I and increasing amounts of unlabeled IGFBP-3 in plates coated with fibrinogen or fibrin resulted in a steady increase in125I-IGF-I binding to these plates (Fig.4 A). Similar results were noted when increasing amounts of unlabeled IGFBP-3 were incubated with immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin prior to the addition of 125I-IGF-I (data not shown). In each of these experiments, very little 125I-IGF-I bound to the fibrinogen- or fibrin-coated plates in the absence of IGFBP-3, and coincubating 125I-IGF-I with 100 ng/ml IGFBP-3 did not result in specific 125I-IGF-I binding if plates were not coated with fibrinogen or fibrin; these results suggest that125I-IGF-I was binding to fibrinogen- or fibrin-bound IGFBP-3. To determine the affinity of IGF for IGFBP-3 bound to immobilized fibrinogen/fibrin, increasing amounts of unlabeled IGF-I were coincubated with 125I-IGF-I in the presence of IGFBP-3·fibrinogen complexes (70 fmol/well) or IGFBP-3·fibrin complexes (115 fmol/well). As shown in Fig. 4 B, IGF-I bound the immobilized IGFBP-3·fibrinogen complex with K d= 2.9 ± 0.6 nm (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments) and bound the immobilized IGFBP-3·fibrin complex with K d = 2.3 ± 0.3 nm(mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments); in addition, there was a 63 ± 10% increase in binding of125I-IGF-I to IGFBP-3·fibrin compared with IGFBP-3·fibrinogen (data not shown). Further studies (Fig.4 C) showed that 125I-IGF-I binding to the IGFBP-3·fibrin complex was efficiently competed by IGF-I but not the IGF-I mutant LR3-IGF-I, which has a decreased affinity for IGFBP-3 (29Ballard F.J. Walton P.E. Bastian S. Tomas F.M. Wallace J.C. Francis G.L. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 40-44PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, coincubating unlabeled IGF-I with125I-IGFBP-3 did not affect the ability of125I-IGFBP-3 to bind immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin (Fig.4 D); this suggests that fibrinogen and fibrin bind equally well to IGFBP-3 and the IGFBP-3·IGF-I complex. As shown in Fig.5 A, wells coated with anti-fibrinogen antibodies were able to bind 125I-IGFBP-3 that had been preincubated with purified fibrinogen in the fluid phase; in these studies, the binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 to fibrinogen was dose-dependent and saturable. As shown in Fig.5 B, soluble 125I-IGFBP-3·fibrinogen complexes were also detected when citrate plasma was used as a source for native fibrinogen; binding specificity was demonstrated by the ability of excess unlabeled IGFBP-3 to completely inhibit 125I-IGFBP-3 binding (data not shown). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 5 C, fluid-phase fibrinogen competed only minimally (∼30%) for125I-IGFBP-3 binding to immobilized fibrinogen, suggesting that IGFBP-3 binding to a fibrin clot can occur in the presence of physiologic concentrations (∼3–4 mg/ml) of plasma fibrinogen (30Jobe M.I. Lotspeich-Steininger C.A. Stiene-Martin E.A. Koepke J.A. Clinical Hematology: Principles, Procedures, Correlations. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1992: 579-598Google Scholar). Native fibrin clots, induced using calcium saturation of citrate plasma, specifically bound 125I-IGFBP-3 (10,600 ± 130 cpm specifically bound/100,000 cpm 125I-IGFBP-3 added; mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate). This suggests that IGFBP-3 can be bound during clot formation. Furthermore, the amount of125I-IGF-I specifically bound within these fibrin clots is directly related to the amount of plasma used to generate the clot (data not shown). As IGFBP-3 is the primary circulating IGFBP, it is likely that IGFBP-3 is primarily responsible for immobilizing IGF-I in the fibrin clot. When forming fibrin clots using 25 μl of citrate plasma, 125I-IGF-I was specifically bound (6,200 ± 140 cpm specifically bound/100,000 cpm 125I-IGF-I added), and 125I-IGF-I specific binding increased by 62 ± 11% upon the further addition of 100 ng of IGFBP-3 (mean ± S.E. of two experiments performed in quadruplicate). These data suggest that IGF-I is immobilized in fibrin clots by associating with fibrin-bound IGFBP-3. Immunofluorescent staining was also used to determine whether IGFBP-3 was incorporated into native fibrin clots. As shown in Fig. 6, specific antibodies to IGFBP-3 and Glu-Pg did indeed recognize each protein in cross-sections of fibrin clots. This is consistent with the ability of Glu-Pg to bind fibrin with high affinity (22Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.O. Atkinson J. Bachmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 599-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Rouy D. Koschinsky M.L. Fleury V. Chapman J. Angles-Cano E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6333-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, both fibrin and Glu-Pg bind with high affinity to IGFBP-3, and Fig. 6 does not discriminate which protein binds IGFBP-3 in fibrin clots. As shown in Fig. 7 A, partial proteolysis of immobilized fibrinogen by 5 ng/ml Pm completely inhibits IGFBP-3 binding, presumably by destroying IGFBP-3 binding sites. However, coincubation of IGFBP-3 with Glu-Pg allows IGFBP-3 binding to fibrinogen partially proteolyzed by 5 ng/ml Pm. This increase is likely due to IGFBP-3 binding to fibrin-bound Glu-Pg, since partial digestion of fibrinogen may actually increase Glu-Pg binding by uncovering previously hidden Glu-Pg binding sites (22Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.O. Atkinson J. Bachmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 599-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous studies found that 10 mm εACA completely blocks Glu-Pg binding to fibrinogen (31Adelman B. Quynn P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig.7 B, 25 mm εACA only weakly inhibits fibrinogen binding to IGFBP-3; as expected, arginine is a potent inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to IGFBP-3. This suggests that εACA can be used to discriminate between IGFBP-3 binding to fibrinogen and to fibrinogen-bound Glu-Pg. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7 C, when solid-phase fibrinogen is pre-equilibrated with Glu-Pg, IGFBP-3 binding is inhibited 35–40% in the presence of 10 or 25 mmεACA, suggesting that 35–40% of IGFBP-3 binds to fibrinogen-bound Glu-Pg. IGF-I participates in wound healing by acting as a chemotactic agent supporting the early migration of stromal cells into the fibrin clot at the wound site, and by stimulating proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells (16Skottner A. Arrhenius-Nyberg V. Kanje M. Fryklund L. Acta Paediatr. Scand. Suppl. 1990; 367: 63-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Clark R. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 1996; (ed) pp., Plenum Press, New York: 3-50Google Scholar). Potential sources for IGF-I found at the wound site include plasma, platelets (32Chan K. Spencer E.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), monocytes (33Kirstein M. Aston C. Hintz R. Vlassara H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and macrophages (34Rappolee D.A. Mark D. Banda M.J. Werb Z. Science. 1988; 241: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). As with IGFs in other body fluids, IGF-I in wound fluid is complexed with IGF-binding proteins, primarily IGFBP-3, which is abundant in serum and in platelets (18Robertson J.G. Pickering K.J. Belford D.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Vogt P.M. Lehnhardt M. Wagner D. Jansen V. Krieg M. Steinau H.U. Plast. Reconstr.

Studies presented in this report, which show that IGFBP-3·IGF-I binary complexes bind with high affinity to fibrinogen/fibrin, suggest that direct binding of IGFBP-3·IGF-I complexes to the fibrin clot is an important mechanism by which IGF-I levels may be maintained at the wound site. Complex formation between IGFBP-3 and fibrinogen or fibrin was shown by solid- and fluid-phase plate binding assays and by Western ligand blotting using biotinylated IGFBP-3. Similar techniques have been used to identify other proteins which bind IGFBP-3 (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar, 26Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of IGFBP-3 for immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin wasK d = 0.67 and 0.7 nm, respectively. These values suggest that fibrinogen/fibrin affinity for IGFBP-3 is comparable to or stronger than fibrinogen/fibrin affinity for Glu-Pg, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, apolipoprotein(a), thrombin, factor Xa, factor XIII, fibronectin, thrombospondin and basic fibroblast growth factor (22Tran-Thang C.

The binding affinities of IGFBP-3 for fibrinogen/fibrin are roughly comparable to the affinity of the IGFBP-3·IGF-I binary complex for acid labile subunit (5Leong S.R. Baxter R.C. Camerato T. Dai J. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and to the affinity of IGFBP-3 for Glu-Pg and prekallikrein (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A.

Res. 1999; 31: 16-225Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sequence and location of the IGFBP-3 HBD is conserved in IGFBP-5 (12Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5 (,1995): 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Studies presented here show that IGFBP-5 efficiently competes with IGFBP-3 binding to fibrinogen or fibrin, suggesting that IGFBP-5 also binds fibrinogen and fibrin with high affinity. In contrast, the IGFBP-3 HBD sequence is not conserved in IGFBP-1 (12Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5 (,1995): 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), IGFBP-1 does not bind appreciably to fibrinogen, and replacing the IGFBP-3 HBD sequence with homologous sequence from IGFBP-1 results in a 10-fold loss of affinity for fibrin. The residual ability of IGFBP-3hbdBP1BV to compete with native IGFBP-3 for binding to fibrin suggests that, in addition to the HBD, other IGFBP-3 regions may participate in binding to fibrinogen/fibrin. Polymerization of fibrinogen into fibrin did not alter affinity for IGFBP-3, but it did increase the number of 125I-IGFBP-3 binding sites by 59% and the number of125I-IGF-I·IGFBP-3 binding sites by 63%. These data suggest that cleavage of fibrinogen exposes new binding sites for IGFBP-3, just as it exposes new binding sites for Glu-Pg (22Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.O. Atkinson J. Bachmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 599-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that formation of binary complexes between IGFBP-3 and immobilized fibrin does not prevent the further binding of IGF-I to IGFBP-3, thus forming a ternary complex. Additional studies confirmed that IGF-I binds to IGFBP-3 complexed with immobilized fibrin (K d = 2.3 nm), and also found that IGF-I binds to IGFBP-3 complexed with immobilized fibrinogen (K d = 2.9 nm). TheseK d values are higher than the range of values (0.03–0.5 nm) reported previously for IGF-I binding to IGFBP-3 (42Heding A. Gill R. Ogawa Y. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13948-13952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and are comparable to the affinity of IGF-I for the type I IGF receptor (43Baynes M.L. Applebaum J. Underwood D. Chicci G.G. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 11004-11008Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This suggests that type I IGF receptors on fibroblasts and other cells that are migrating into the fibrin clot can remove IGF-I from fibrin-bound IGFBP-3, resulting in proliferation of these cells at the wound site. In addition to the direct binding of IGFBP-3 to fibrinogen, studies presented here suggest that IGFBP-3 also binds indirectly, to fibrinogen-bound Glu-Pg. It is well known that Glu-Pg binds with high affinity to fibrinogen/fibrin and that, through this interaction, Glu-Pg plays an important role in the wound healing process (21Romer J. Bugge T.H.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6333-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is also known that IGFBP-3 and IGF-I·IGFBP-3 complexes bind Glu-Pg with high affinity, and that IGFBP-3 binds to multiple sites on Glu-Pg (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a complex of fibrin·Glu-Pg·IGFBP-3·IGF-I is likely to form; in one possible arrangement, the kringle 1–3 regions of Glu-Pg bind to lysines in fibrinogen/fibrin, while the kringle 5/catalytic region of Glu-Pg binds to the HBD of IGFBP-3. If formed, this complex would provide another mechanism for releasing IGF-I at the wound site, since tissue plasminogen activator can activate immobilized Glu-Pg that is complexed with IGFBP-3·IGF-I, resulting in IGFBP-3 proteolysis and IGF-I release (20Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in tissue culture, activation of Glu-Pg to Pm results in IGFBP-3 proteolysis and release of bound IGF-I to cultured cells where mitogenic and metabolic pathways are stimulated (44Blat C. Villaudy J. Binoux M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2286-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 45Angelloz-Nicoud P. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1994; 136: 5485-5492Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar); thus, activation of Glu-Pg that is complexed both with fibrinogen and with IGFBP-3·IGF-I should ultimately make IGF-I available to stromal cells present at the wound site. In support of this hypothesis, additional studies show that plasminogen activators can induce proteolysis of IGFBP-3 complexed with fibrin-bound Glu-Pg, resulting in release of IGF-I (manuscript in preparation). The observations that 125I-IGFBP-3 and125I-IGF-I localize to fibrin clots generated from plasmain vitro, and that addition of exogenous IGFBP-3 greatly increases the incorporation of 125I-IGF-I into these clots, suggest that IGF-I·IGFBP-3 complexes bind to fibrin clots in vivo at wound sites. This possibility is supported by immunoblot detection of IGFBP-3 in these fibrin clots. The further detection of Glu-Pg in these fibrin clots by immunoblotting suggests that IGFBP-3 may bind these clots directly through fibrin and indirectly through fibrin-bound Glu-Pg. Thus, data obtained from the study of these fibrin clots support the hypothesis that IGFBP-3·IGF-I complexes bind to fibrin clots formed at wound sites in vivo, and are consistent with the possibility that at least two mechanisms exist for the ready release of bound IGF-I to fibroblasts and endothelial cells migrating into the wound site.

https://openalex.org/W2001724554,"The gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) is up-regulated in many differentiating cells, including maturing chondrocytes. Since strict control of chondrocyte proliferation is essential for proper bone formation and since p21 is likely involved in this control, we initiated analyses of the mechanisms regulating expression of p21 in chondrocytes. p21 expression and promoter activity was strongly increased during the differentiation of chondrogenic MCT cells. We have identified a 68-base pair fragment conferring transcriptional up-regulation of the p21 gene in chondrocytes. The activity of this fragment required active Raf-1 in MCT cells as well as in primary mouse chondrocytes. Inhibition of downstream factors of Raf-1 (MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and Ets2) also repressed the activity of the 68-base pair fragment in MCT cells. The chemical MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 reduced protein levels of p21 in MCTs and primary mouse chondrocytes. These data suggest that signaling through the Raf-1 pathway is necessary for the optimal expression of p21 in chondrocytes and may play an important role in the control of bone formation."

Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal 63-residue region is unique to the 63-kDa gene 4 protein and contains a Cys4 zinc finger essential for recognition of the template sequences that signal the primase domain to synthesize a tetraribonucleotide that can subsequently be used to prime DNA synthesis (22Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues of the primase domain have been aligned with those of other primases from bacteria and phage, leading to the identification of six highly conserved blocks of residues (Fig.1) (21Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A gene encoding the 271 amino-terminal residues of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein has been overexpressed in E. coli, and the purified product has been shown to have the same level of oligoribonucleotide synthesis activity as that of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein in the absence of dTTP, conditions under which there is no helicase activity (23Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Residues that compose the helicase domain have also been aligned with those of helicases from bacteria and phage (21Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), leading to the identification of five conserved blocks of residues (Fig. 1). Considerations of secondary structure suggest that the helicase domain is structurally homologous to the ATP-binding domain of the F1-ATPase (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bird et al. (25Bird L.E. Håkansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) constructed carboxyl-terminal gene 4 protein fragments starting at residues 219 and 241 and showed that they form hexamers, have dTTPase activity, and function as helicases. This observation suggests that the protein interface responsible for oligomerization resides after residue 241, either in the helicase domain or in the linker region joining the primase and helicase domains (Fig. 1). In order to define the role of the linker region in oligomerization, we have constructed three truncated polypeptides that start either immediately before or after this region; we have purified the proteins and have examined their ability to form a functional hexamer.DISCUSSIONT7 gene 4 protein, a single polypeptide, functions as both a helicase and a primase.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) provide evidence for separate domains in the full-length protein responsible for each of the two activities. Expression of truncated genes encoding either the amino- or carboxyl-half of the protein results in peptides that retain primase (23Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or helicase (25Bird L.E. Håkansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) activity, respectively. The tandem placement of the two domains on the same polypeptide may facilitate the regulation of these two activities that play such important roles in leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at a replication fork.Oligomerization of the gene 4 protein plays a critical role in both helicase and primase functions of the protein. Analysis of the native molecular weight of the primase fragment, using a series of gels of different percentages of polyacrylamide, indicates that it migrates on the native gel as a monomer. 4S. Guo and C. C. Richardson, unpublished results.This observation contradicts an earlier report by Frick et al. (23Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that suggested that the primase fragment, although not forming a hexamer, was a dimer. We believe that this discrepancy is due to the use of only one polyacrylamide gel concentration (10%) in the earlier report and the large variability that can be observed in the apparent molecular weights of proteins determined by this method depending on the percentage of the polyacrylamide gel used (39Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 40Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). We find that mobility of the primase fragment on a single 18% gel corresponds to that of a monomer.4 Whereas the primase fragment alone catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides, it binds DNA less tightly than does gp4 and is thus dependent on its association with the helicase domain to transport it along ssDNA to a primase recognition site (23Frick D.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding studies show that only a hexamer of gene 4 protein is capable of binding to ssDNA (41Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies indicate that ssDNA is threaded within the central hole of the hexameric gene 4 protein (43Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, the current model for the helicase activity of gene 4 protein is that a hexamer encircles the DNA and translocates in a 5′ to 3′ direction by passing the DNA from one monomer to the next, using for energy the hydrolysis of dTTP.The purpose of this study is to investigate the region linking the primase and helicase domains of the gene 4 protein (residues 241–271) and the effect that this region has on oligomerization and dTTPase activity. The fact that the primase fragment is monomeric, and that the helicase fragment gp4-C241 retains the ability to form hexamers (25Bird L.E. Håkansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicates that the regions critical for oligomerization reside downstream of residue 241. In the present study we show that the linker between residues 241 and 271 is critical for stable oligomer formation, since deletion of this region results in a peptide that is a monomer during electrophoresis on a native gel and has severely diminished dTTPase activity. On the other hand, our data show that this region alone is not sufficient for oligomer formation. First, the primase fragment that terminates at residue 271 is a monomer based on native gel electrophoresis. Second, gp4-C272 inhibits the ssDNA-dependent dTTPase activity of gp4 and is dominantly lethal in vivo, observations that strongly suggest that this protein retains its ability to interact with the wild-type gp4, albeit transiently. Finally, the fact that k cat for dTTPase activity of gp4-C272 increases with protein concentration indicates that the dTTPase activity is dependent on its ability to oligomerize. Therefore, other regions on the helicase domain must also contribute to the hexamer formation of gene 4 protein.Although previous data have suggested that dTTPase activity of gene 4 protein is dependent on oligomerization (13Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our analysis demonstrates this point definitively. The k catvalues for dTTPase of gp4-C219 and gp4-C241 are less sensitive to protein concentration than is that of gp4, indicating that the oligomers formed by these two proteins are more stable than are those formed by gp4. In contrast, and most impressively, thek cat value for dTTPase of gp4-C272 varies more than 100-fold with protein concentration. This variation indicates that oligomerization of gp4-C272 is essential for dTTPase activity and that the stability of the oligomers formed is greatly diminished compared with that of the other proteins analyzed in this study.Washington et al.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) described the properties of a large number of randomly generated mutations in the gene 4 protein. One, threonine 257 to alanine, lies in the linker that is the focus of this study. This mutant has higher DNA-independent dTTPase activity than wild-type gene 4 protein but lower helicase activity. In addition, native gel electrophoresis carried out in this earlier study (Fig.6 A in Washington et al. (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) showed a significantly lower amount of monomer species formed with this mutant. These results suggest that this mutationally altered protein forms more stable oligomers than does the wild-type gene 4 protein.Both Notarnicola et al. (32Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Washington et al. (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) characterized mutants in motif 4 of the helicase domain (Fig. 1) that had a limited effect on the ability of gene 4 protein to form oligomers. Of particular interest is the mutant protein in which arginine 487 is changed to a cysteine (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This mutant protein forms oligomers more efficiently than does wild-type protein, and its ssDNA-independent dTTPase activity is 7-fold higher than that of the wild-type protein. The three mutant proteins in motif 4 investigated by Notarnicola et al. (32Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (H475A, D485G, and R487A) and the three investigated by Washington et al. (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (R487C, G488D, and S496F) are all impaired in their ability to bind to ssDNA, in particular R487A and S496F. These data suggest that the primary role of this motif is in the binding to ssDNA; the modest effect on oligomerization observed with some of these mutants could be either an indirect one due to the interrelationship of oligomerization, DNA binding, and dTTPase activity or perhaps this region indeed makes a direct although minor contribution to the interaction of subunits.Our results suggest that although the linker region described in this report (residues 242–271) plays a direct role in oligomerization of the gene 4 protein, as an indirect consequence it affects the dTTPase active site by influencing the conformation of the dimer interface. Immediately adjacent to this linker region toward the carboxyl terminus lies the conserved motif 1 of the helicase domain (Fig. 1), also known as the “Walker A motif” (44Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). This motif has been shown to make up part of the NTP hydrolysis active site in F1-ATPase (45Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Mutations in this motif in gene 4 protein reduce or eliminate its dTTPase activity (26Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The juxtaposition of these two regions critical to dTTPase is likely to have important consequences regarding the regulation of this activity.Immediately adjacent to this linker region toward the amino terminus of the gene 4 protein is the conserved motif 6 of the primase domain (Fig.1), a motif shared by the primases of other bacteria and bacteriophage (21Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of motif 6 remains unknown, it is believed that this region in the E. coli primase may be involved in binding of Mg2+ (46Griep M.A. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a proposed tertiary model of the Toprim domain in the DnaG-type primases and type II topoisomerase, motif 6 overlaps the last strand of the Toprim domain of primases (47Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The juxtaposition of motif 6 of the primase domain and the region essential for oligomerization of the helicase is intriguing. As the helicase is translocating 5′ to 3′ on the lagging strand, it must stop when it reaches a primase recognition site to allow the primase domain to synthesize an RNA primer in the opposite direction. It is likely that the linker region described here plays a role in coordinating these two activities.In vivo gp4 functions in a replication complex with the T7 DNA polymerase and T7 DNA-binding protein. In vitro, specific interactions between gp4 and the T7 DNA polymerase have been demonstrated (9Kolodner R. Masamune Y. LeClerc J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 566-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), although there are presently no data regarding the stoichiometry of the two proteins in the complex. In this study we demonstrate that gp4, gp4-C219, and gp4-C241 each bind to the DNA polymerase as a stable dimer. It is interesting that a dimer rather than a hexamer of each of these species forms a stable complex with the T7 DNA polymerase. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of steric restriction being responsible for the inability of hexamer formation, we speculate that the interaction of the polymerase with one subunit of gp4 enables this gp4 subunit to in turn interact stably with one more gp4 subunit. The fact that gp4-C272 binds to T7 DNA polymerase as a monomer is consistent with its diminished ability to form oligomers with itself.It has been suggested that the helicase domain of T7 gene 4 protein beginning at residue 306 has the same secondary structure as the known structures of RecA protein and F1-ATPase (24Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both RecA protein and F1-ATPase bind ATP, and the ATP-binding domains are superimposable with a root mean squared deviation of less than 2 Å (45Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 48Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Besides forming a helical filament on DNA, RecA also forms hexameric rings and may be a structural homologue of ring helicases (49Yu X. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Analogous to gene 4 protein, both RecA protein and F1-ATPase contain a region amino-terminal to the nucleotide-binding domain that plays a critical role in oligomer formation (48Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 50Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This similarity suggests that there may be conservation in the mechanism of oligomerization in these three proteins.Note Added in ProofThe crystal structure of the gene 4 protein fragment gp4-C272 has recently been determined (Sawaya, M. R., Guo, S., Tabor, S., Richardson, C. C., and Ellenberger, T. (1999)Cell 99,in press). The efficient and economical replication system of bacteriophage T7 provides an in vitro model for studying essential protein-protein interactions at a replication fork (1Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the leading and lagging strands is the result of the coordinated action of T7 DNA polymerase (gene 5 protein), its processivity factorEscherichia coli thioredoxin, T7 gene 4 helicase-primase, and T7 gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1-binding protein. A 2.2-Å crystal structure has been determined for the T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex bound to a primer-template and with a nucleoside triphosphate at the polymerase active site (2Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Leading and lagging strand synthesis are coupled, and the lagging strand DNA polymerase recycles from a completed Okazaki fragment to a new primer (3Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C.

Physical and functional interactions have been demonstrated between gene 2.5 protein and both the DNA polymerase (6Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Gene 4 of T7 encodes two co-linear polypeptides of 63 and 56 kDa, the latter arising from an in-frame translation start codon (12Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol.

Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Helicase activity results from the hydrolysis of dTTP that drives 5′- to 3′-unidirectional translocation along ssDNA (18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Cros"

Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The ability of G-proteins to transition between active and inactive forms based on whether GTP or GDP is bound, respectively, allows them to function as a molecular switch (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). This transition is modulated by accessory factors that stimulate either GTP hydrolysis (GTPase-activating proteins) or guanine nucleotide exchange (guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)).1 These factors can regulate the activity of the G-protein in response to molecular and cellular signals. Many mutations have been isolated, particularly in residues important for GTP binding, that affect the ability of the G-protein to interact with GTPase-activating proteins and GEFs or function as a target for the activities of these factors. The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is a member of the G-protein family. The prokaryotic homolog, EF1A, was the first G-protein x-ray crystal structure solved (3Morikawa K. la Cour T.F.M. Nyborg J. Rasmussen K.M. Miller D.L. Clark B.F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). eEF1A is a GTPase whose activity is stimulated by binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, ribosomes, and most importantly the presence of a codon-anticodon match between the aminoacyl-tRNA and the A site codon of the ribosome-bound mRNA. Thus, the ribosome acts as a GTPase-activating protein for eEF1A. Correspondingly, eEF1A requires a GEF, eEF1B (4Carvalho M.G. Carvalho J.F. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Only the eEF1Bα subunit is required for nucleotide exchange, and in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae eEF1Bα, like eEF1A, is an essential gene product (5Hiraga K. Suzuki K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The regulation of eEF1A activity by GTPase-activating proteins and GEFs is critically important in efficient and accurate protein synthesis and consequently cell growth. All G-proteins in the translation factor family share three well conserved motifs, GXXXXGK, DXXG and NKXD (6Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Previous structural and mutational studies of theEscherichia coli EF1A protein have supported the important role of the N135KXD138 motif. Structurally, this motif is important for binding and recognizing the guanine ring (7la Cour T.F.M. Nyborg J. Thirup S. Clark B.F.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2385-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Substitutions of Lys136 result in a dominant negative growth effect that is suppressed by overexpression of the prokaryotic GEF EF1B (8Hwang Y. Sanchez A. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8304-8309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the Lys136 mutant protein indicates that intragenic suppressors of the dominant negative phenotype cluster in the G-domain of EF1A and all result in reduced affinity for EF1B (9Hwang Y.-W. Carter M. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22198-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other dominant negative mutations in Asn135 to Asp and Ile also appear to function in a similar manner. A homologous mutation in S. cerevisiaeeEF1A, N153D, is no longer functional as the only form of the protein (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and also results in a conditional dominant negative growth phenotype. 2A. L. Laitusis and T. G. Kinzy, unpublished observation. Thus, this motif is important in interacting with G-protein-associated factors. Double mutants altering both Asn135 and Asp138 can completely inactivate nucleotide binding by EF1A, consistent with effects on affinity (11Weijland A. Sarfati R. Barzu O. Prmeggiani A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, the importance of these residues of the motif element on nucleotide binding is clear. Mutational analysis of the conserved Asp138 in EF1A results in altered nucleotide specificity, resulting in a protein that now binds XTP with affinities near the GTP binding affinity of the wild-type protein (12Hwang Y.-W. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13081-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Weijland A. Parlato G. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10711-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutant protein does not affect translational fidelity in vitro, because there appears to be no major change in nucleotide affinity. The NKXD GTP-binding element is thus demonstrated to play important roles in both the specificity and affinity of nucleotide binding in G-proteins. We have utilized the basis of knowledge available for the NKXD GTP-binding element to study the effect of GTP binding and hydrolysis by eEF1A on the efficiency and accuracy of translation in the eukaryotic organism S. cerevisiae. Three mutant forms of the protein that alter Asn153, Asp156, and both residues of the N153KMD156 element all result in reduced affinity for GTP, and two correspondingly can suppress the requirement for catalyzed nucleotide exchange utilizing a genetic system deficient in the GEF eEF1Bα (14Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, not all of the phenotypes associated with the loss of the GEF are suppressed, and reduced affinity for guanine nucleotide alone is not sufficient for suppression. We further find that mutations that correspond to changes previously characterized in the prokaryotic homolog EF1A result in significant differences in function. The D156N mutation of yeast eEF1A, unlike the EF1A mutant (13Weijland A. Parlato G. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10711-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), results in a dramatic reduction in translational fidelity. In fact all the yeast NKXD mutant proteins and strains analyzed result in reduced A site fidelity as monitored by misincorporation and nonsense suppression. The NKXD GTP-binding motif provides a valuable resource for understanding two important aspects of regulation of eEF1A activity, translational fidelity and guanine nucleotide exchange. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid preparation. S. cerevisiae strains used in these studies are listed in Table I. Standard yeast genetic methods were employed (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or defined synthetic complete medium (C or C−) supplemented with 2% dextrose as a carbon source. Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate method (16Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains supported for growth by plasmid-borne eEF1A genes (TEF1 or TEF2) are derivatives of MC213 or MC214 prepared by plasmid shuffling (17Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R.

Construction of the tef2 alleles onTRP1-based plasmids are described in Cavallius and Merrick (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The URA3-based plasmids were prepared by digesting theTRP1-based pRS314-JCX plasmids containing the indicated mutation: D156N (JC6, tef2-17), N153T/D156E (JC32,tef2-18), or N153T (JC5, tef2-19) with BamHI and ScaI and cloning the resulting fragment into pRS316 (URA3 CEN) digested withBamHI and ScaI. The resulting plasmids were pTKB293 (tef2-17, D156N), pTKB300 (tef2-18, N153T/D156E), and pTKB299 (tef2-19, N153T). Yeast strains containing wild-type eEF1A (MC214) or one of the three mutant forms of eEF1A: N153T (TKY226), D156N (TKY228), and N153T/D156E (TKY229) were grown in liquid YEPD to an A 600 in mid-log phase (0.4 to 1.0 units) and extracts prepared by glass bead lysis. Approximately 0.5 μg of total protein, as determined by Bradford protein analysis (Bio-Rad) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies to yeast eEF1A (1:5000 dilution) and Rfa1p (1:1000 dilution, kindly provided by Dr. Steven Brill, Rutgers University) and colorometrically detected for multiple time points by a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:10,000 dilution, Bio-Rad) to assure a linear response. Temperature and cold sensitivity were assayed by growing a strain containing wild-type eEF1A (MC213) or a mutant form of eEF1A as the only form of the protein: D156N (TKY278), N153T (TKY280), and N153T/D156E (TKY282) in YEPD to anA 600 of 1.0. Serial 10-fold dilutions (5 μl each) were spotted on YEPD followed by incubation at 13, 23, 30, and 37 °C for 3–7 days. Phenotypic suppression of thelys2-801 (UAG) mutation was determined by spotting 10 μl of the same dilutions onto complete medium or complete medium lacking lysine and incubating for 2–5 days at 30 °C. Paromomycin-induced misreading was similarly assayed on complete medium or medium lacking lysine containing 0.5 mg/ml paromomycin. Strains containing atef5::TRP1 null allele and supported for growth by the plasmid-borne TEF5 (JWY4229), an eEF1Bα-deficient strain suppressed by wild-type eEF1A (TKY283), or an eEF1Bα-deficient strain suppressed one of the three eEF1A mutants D156N (TKY279), N153T/D156E (TKY287), or N153T (TKY302) were assayed for growth and fidelity defects as described above. Doubling times of the eEF1Bα-deficient strains and the eEF1Bα-containing parental strain were determined by measuring the growth in liquid culture of at least two independent isolates of each strain. Cultures grown for 1 day in YEPD at 30 °C were diluted to an A 600 of approximately 0.1 in fresh YEPD and grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. Optical density (A 600) was assayed approximately every 2 h. Cultures were diluted into fresh YEPD when the A 600 reached mid-log phase (0.4–0.6 units) to allow continued monitoring. 2-ml cultures of each strain were grown at 30 °C in YEPD to mid-log phase. At least two independent colonies were assayed for each mutant allele tested. For each culture 0.3 ml was spread plated onto YEPD plates, and 10 μl of each drug were pipetted onto sterile BBL ¼-inch diameter-paper discs. The concentrations of drugs used were 1 mm cycloheximide, 25 mm hygromycin B, and 0.4 mm paromomycin. A maximum of two filters were placed on each plate, and the plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Sensitivity to each drug was measured by the radius of growth inhibition in mm around each disc. Nonsense suppression assays were performed on strains containing wild type (MC214) or one of the mutant forms of eEF1A: N153T (TKY226), D156W (TKY228), and N153T/D156E (TKY229) and the URA3 wild-type lacZ control plasmid pUKC815tail (lacZ under the PGK1 promoter with the PGK1 transcriptional terminator) or URA3plasmids with in-frame nonsense codons in lacZ; pUKC819tail (UGA), pUKC817tail (UAA), and pUKC818tail (UAG). The mutant and wild-type strains containing each plasmid were grown overnight at 30 °C in medium lacking uracil to mid-log phase. At least four samples for each strain, and plasmids were analyzed in duplicate using the 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside assay previously described (19Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 870-881PubMed Google Scholar). Strains containing wild-type eEF1A (MC213) or the mutant forms D156N (TKY278), N153T (TKY280), and N153T/D156E (TKY282) were converted toMET2 by transformation of a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the wild-type MET2 gene and homologous recombination. Liquid cultures (100 ml) were grown in medium lacking methionine at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.5–0.7. At the zero time point, 50 μm cold methionine and [35S]methionine to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml (7.9 mCi/ml, 293.0 MBq/ml, NEN Life Science Products) were added to each culture. At 10-min intervals the optical density (A 600) of the cultures were determined, and 1-ml aliquots were removed to monitor labeled methionine incorporation by cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid (0.2 ml) was added to each aliquot, and aliquots were incubated on ice for 10 min, heated to 70 °C for 20 min, and filtered through Whatman GF/C filters. Filters were washed with 10 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (4 °C) and 10 ml of 95% ethanol, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. All time points were analyzed in triplicate. Mutations were targeted to the N153KMD156GTP-binding consensus element of yeast eEF1A in an attempt to alter the nucleotide specificity (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on homology to other G-proteins that had successfully been modified for their nucleotide specificity (12Hwang Y.-W. Miller D.L. J. Biol.

Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three of the resulting mutants were utilized in a series of in vivostudies to correlate in vitro changes in eEF1A function within vivo growth and translation effects. These mutant alleles alter the first and last residues of the N153KMD156 element from Asp156 to Asn (tef2-17), Asn153 to Thr and Asp156 to Glu (tef2-18), and Asn153 to Thr (tef2-19). The mutant proteins all show increased misincorporation in an in vitrotranslation assay (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By utilizing monitors of altered translation and fidelity, we initiated a study to determine the consequences of these mutants in vivo. Because overexpression of eEF1A can result in changes in cell growth (18Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fidelity, 3N. Durko and T. G. Kinzy, unpublished observation. Western blot analysis was performed to rule out the possibility that the N153KMD156 mutations in eEF1A might result in a enhanced stability or expression. Strains containing chromosomal disruptions of both eEF1A genes (tef1Δtef2Δ) were prepared with either plasmid-borne wild-type TEF2 (MC213) or a mutant form of eEF1A,tef2-17 (D156N, TKY278), tef2-19(N153T, TKY280), or tef2-18 (N153T/D156E, TKY282). Yeast grow at essentially wild-type rates with one copy of an eEF1A gene, and the three mutants are all functional as the only form of the protein and have no dramatic effects on cell growth (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that when equal amounts of protein extract are examined, there is no difference in the level of protein between wild-type eEF1A and any of the mutant forms. Further analysis of the effects of mutations in the NKXD element of yeast eEF1A indicates that these mutations are not favorable for some aspects of translation, although they do support wild-type growth as the only form of the protein. Initial analysis of the sensitivity of strains expressing either wild-type eEF1A or one of the three mutations to translation inhibitors indicates only a slight increase in sensitivity to cycloheximide and little or no increase in sensitivity to hygromycin B (Table II). However, all three strains alter sensitivity to paromomycin, either increasing (D156N) or reducing (N153T and N153T/D156E) sensitivity to the compound. This result indicates that these strains may have altered translational fidelity (23Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis of the purified mutant proteins indicated that all three increase misincorporation of leucine in the poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis assay (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in A site fidelity also occurred in vivo, we utilized quantitative reporter constructs to assay for nonsense suppression. Using in-framelacZ constructs containing one of the three stop codons, nonsense suppression was monitored relative to expression of the wild-type lacZ protein. Fig.2 A shows that all three mutants increase in the level of β-galactosidase activity in a strain containing a nonsense reporter construct. When expressed as the fold wild type read through level for each stop codon (Fig. 2 B), it is clear that all three mutations are omnipotent suppressors.Table IIDrug sensitivities of strains containing mutations in the NKXD GTP-binding element of yeast eEF1AStrainMutationParomomycin (0.4 mm)Cycloheximide (1 mm)Hygromycin (25 mm)TKY101Wild-type eEF1A0.76.33TKY225D156N3.77.73.7TKY229N153T/D156E08.73.3TKY226N153T08.33.3The sensitivity was determined by the radius of inhibition of growth (in mm) surrounding a filter disc containing the indicated drug on a lawn of cells of the indicated strain. The results shown are the averages of three experiments. Open table in a new tab The sensitivity was determined by the radius of inhibition of growth (in mm) surrounding a filter disc containing the indicated drug on a lawn of cells of the indicated strain. The results shown are the averages of three experiments. There are several mechanisms that might cause the reduced fidelity at the A site conferred by these mutations. One mechanism in vivo is an increase in the speed of translation. As shown in Fig.1, this increase would not be due to increased eEF1A protein but would have to result in a change in the activity of the protein. To monitor a general increase in protein synthesis, total methionine incorporation was determined for strains containing either wild-type eEF1A or one of the three NKXD mutant forms of the proteins. Fig.3 (A and B) indicate that no change in total translation occurs in strains containing the D156N or N153T mutations. The N153T/D156E mutant strain, however, shows a statistically significant increase in the rate of incorporation. (Fig. 3 C). Because these three mutants support growth even though they show molecular defects in vitro, we were interested in using these mutations to test the hypothesis that mutant forms of eEF1A with reduced nucleotide affinity could suppress the requirement for guanine nucleotide exchange in vivo. This hypothesis is based on our previous finding that although yeast normally require the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Bα, encoded by the TEF5gene, the presence of a third copy of an eEF1A gene (eitherTEF1 or TEF2) allows viability (14Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, some mutant forms of eEF1A more effectively suppress the requirement for eEF1Bα. Biochemical analysis indicates that all three mutations increase the K m for GTP from 0.14 μmfor wild-type eEF1A compared with 13.1 μm for D156N, 10.3 μm for N153T/D156E, and 6.0 μm for N153T (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that although all three mutant forms of eEF1A show a dramatic increase in the K m for nucleotide, these levels are still below the cellular content of GTP (100 s of μm). Thus, the effect of these mutations to reduce GDP binding would be more dramatic in vivo. This change would reduce the requirement for eEF1Bα and suppress some of the negative growth effects normally seen when the requirement for eEF1Bα is suppressed by an extra copy of a wild-type eEF1A gene (14Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing a wild-type eEF1A gene or one of the three mutants were prepared on a URA3-based low copy plasmid. The plasmids were placed into a strain of yeast with the chromosomal eEF1Bα gene deleted (tef5::TRP1) where viability was maintained by the presence of a TEF5 LEU2 plasmid. Following addition of an eEF1A-encoding plasmid, the TEF5 LEU2 plasmid was spontaneously lost following growth in medium lacking uracil. Alternatively, the plasmids were transformed into a heterozygousTEF5/tef5::TRP1 diploid strain (JWY4229) without any helper plasmid, and only viable Trp+ spores that were also Ura+ were obtained, indicating the eEF1A-containing plasmid supported viability. The resulting tef5::TRP1 strains supported by the tef2-17 allele (D156N, TKY279),tef2-18 allele (N153T/D156E, TKY287),tef2-19 allele (N153T, TKY302), a wild-typeTEF2 gene (TKY283), or the parental strain supported by the eEF1Bα gene (TEF5, JWY4229) were assayed for growth defects. The doubling time at 30 °C for an eEF1Bα-deficient strain containing the D156N or N153T/D156E mutations are 2.20 and 2.25 h, respectively. This growth is near that of a strain containing eEF1Bα (2.04 h). An eEF1Bα-deficient strain containing the N153T mutation showed poor suppression of the eEF1Bα requirement (Fig.4, third panel) and a doubling time of 3.7 h, higher than the 3 h for a strain suppressed by wild-type eEF1A. Thus two mutants with the highestK m values for GTP (13.1 μm for D156N and 10.3 μm for N153T/D156E), as derived from poly(U) assays using 15 pmol of eEF1A and an Eadie-Hofstee plot (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), best suppress the requirement for eEF1Bα. Other characteristics of eEF1Bα-deficient strains suppressed by excess eEF1A are cold- and temperature-sensitive growth and sensitivity to translational inhibitors. The D156N and N153T/D156E mutants very effectively suppress the cold-sensitive defect of a strain lacking eEF1Bα, clearly better than wild-type eEF1A or the N153T mutation, the latter of which is dead at 13 °C (Fig. 4, first panel). eEF1Bα-deficient strains suppressed by wild-type eEF1A show dramatic increases in sensitivity to translation elongation inhibitors, such as paromomycin, from 0 to 6 mm of inhibition of growth in a lawn growth assay (Table III). The D156N and N153T/D156E mutants not only suppress the growth defects at 30 °C but also restore the drug sensitivity of the eEF1Bα-deficient strain to at or near wild-type levels (Table III). Interestingly, all four strains lacking eEF1Bα show a dramatic temperature-sensitive growth defect; in fact little to no difference is seen between mutants that suppress the requirement for eEF1Bα well at 30 °C compared with the N153T mutant that shows very poor suppression (Fig. 4, fourth panel). Thus, of the multiple phenotypes associated with the loss of eEF1Bα activity in the cell, mutations in eEF1A can suppress some but not all of these defects.Table IIIDrug sensitivities of eEF1Bα-deficient strains suppressed by NKXD GTP-binding element mutants of yeast eEF1AStrainMutationParomomycin (0.4 mm)Cycloheximide (1 mm)Hygromycin (25 mm)JWY4229Wild-type eEF1Bα05.02.0TKY283Wild-type eEF1A6.08.05.0TKY279D156N2.05.03.0TKY287N153T/D156E1.06.02.0TKY302N153T7.09.05.0The sensitivity was determined by the radius of inhibition of growth (in mm) surrounding a filter disc containing the indicated drug on a lawn of cells of the indicated strain.

Open table in a new tab The sensitivity was determined by the radius of inhibition of growth (in mm) surrounding a filter disc containing the indicated drug on a lawn of cells of the indicated strain. The results shown are the averages of three experiments. The NKXD GTP-binding consensus element is a hallmark of all G-proteins and a site of much of the nucleotide specificity of G-proteins. The three mutations of N153T, D156N, and N153T/D156E all retained the ability to bind GTP, although with a much higherK m (10Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28752-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mutants allow for the in vivo analysis of the effect of reduced nucleotide binding on the requirement for guanine nucleotide exchange. Additionally, because the cellular concentration of GTP is hundreds of micromolar, theK m for the three mutant forms of eEF1A described are all still an order of magnitude less than the physiological concentration of GTP (25Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16541-16548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these mutants remain functional as the only form of the protein. The function, however, may allow for growth but does not necessarily prevent phenotypes associated with altered translation. These mutants also address the effect of changes in guanine nucleotide binding or GTP-dependent reactions on accurate translation. Strains expressing one of the three mutant alleles show characteristic changes in sensitivity to translation inhibitors consistent with altered elongation, such as a slight increase in sensitivity to cycloheximide and changes in sensitivity to paromomycin. The latter phenotype correlates with altered translational fidelity (19Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 870-881PubMed Google Scholar, 23Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Chernoff Y.O. Vincent A. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of these three mutant forms of yeast eEF1A provided evidence that all three result in codon misreading using thein vitro polyphenylalanine synthesis assay. Additional forms of translational fidelity that are assessable in vivoinclude nonsense suppression and programmed and nonprogrammed ribosomal frameshifting. Previously, mutations in yeast eEF1A have been demonstrated to affect frameshifting at nondirected (17Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R. Genetics. 1988; 120: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and directed signals (19Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 870-881PubMed Google Scholar, 27Farabaugh P.J. Vimaladithan A. RNA. 1998; 4: 16-38Google Scholar). A strain expressing any one of the three mutant alleles shows no change in the ability to retrotranspose the yeast Ty1 element, indicative of no alteration in programmed +1 frameshifting (data not shown). To more closely address misreading at the A site, as is monitored in the leucine misincorporation assay, nonsense suppression was monitored for strains containing a single copy plasmid expressing wild-type eEF1A or one of the three mutations (N153T, D156N, and N153T/D156E). All three mutant strains, while showing normal growth rates, demonstrate increased readthrough of all three stop codons (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate a correlation between changes in translational fidelity in vitro andin vivo. The small differences in the extent of the changes are not surprising because the in vitro system used does not require the exchange factor eEF1Bα and other potential cellular functions for eEF1A are not a complication. Thus, two A site events in translational fidelity are similarly affected in these mutants, both of which require the proper identification of the A site codon. The question arises as to the molecular defect in eEF1A resulting in the misreading. The N153T mutation shows a dramatic increase in the intrinsic GTPase activity of eEF1A (from 0.6 to 2.8 pmol phosphate/pmol protein), an effect consistent with eEF1A failing to wait for the GTPase activation signal from the formation of a codon-anticodon pair. The N153T/D156E double mutation shows a statistically significant increase in total protein synthesis (Fig. 3). This is a 2-fold change, but it should be noted that this change is relative to a strain containing a single copy of the eEF1A gene and not the normal complement of two chromosomal eEF1A genes (TEF1 andTEF2). Thus, when the level of eEF1A is slightly lower than normal, this effect may be more dramatic. Models of translational fidelity and rates would predict that increasing the speed of translation would reduce fidelity (28Dong H. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Kurland C.G. Jorgensen F. Richter A. Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Rojas A.-M. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 513-526Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have also found that an eEF1Bα mutant strain with reduced total translation shows enhanced translational fidelity (18Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cause of the reduced translational fidelity by the D156N mutant is less apparent, although this mutation differs from the previous two in conferring sensitivity and not resistance to paromomycin. One possibility is that this mutant protein, which shows no difference in stimulation of the GTPase activity in the absence or presence of poly(U) with Phe-tRNA and ribosomes (9.0 pmol phosphate/pmol proteinversus 9.3, respectively), is stimulating GTP hydrolysis in a ribosome-dependent manner but without sensing a codon-anticodon interaction. Alternatively, this mutation may affect a function of eEF1A not assayed, such as the affinity for the ribosome or actin binding. Guanine nucleotide binding to DictyosteliumeEF1A decreases the affinity for actin 7–7.5-fold (30Edmonds B.T. Bell A. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Leyh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10288-10295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and thus the D156N mutant may alter the equilibrium between free and actin-bound eEF1A. The altered nucleotide affinity of the three mutants also provides a tool to dissect the requirement for catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange by the eEF1Bα subunit. The D156N and N153T/D156E mutants share an alteration of Asp156 and the highestK m value for GTP. Furthermore, an eEF1Bα-deficient strain containing either mutant grows at essentially the same rate at 30 °C as cells expressing wild-type eEF1Bα. These eEF1A mutations, however, do not restore the temperature-sensitive defect of an eEF1Bα-deficient strain (Fig. 4). Thus, further analysis of mutations, either in eEF1A or other cellular factors, may help illuminate the nature of the temperature-sensitive defect of eEF1Bα-deficient cells. Perhaps the remaining defect indicates that there is another role for eEF1Bα. Alternatively, the level of eEF1A expression or activity required for suppression of the requirement for eEF1Bα may have a negative effect on the cell or one of the other proposed functions of eEF1A such as actin binding (31Condeelis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 169-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Suppression of the requirement for eEF1Bα is not seen for the N153T mutation. This mutant has the lowest K m for GTP (other than the wild-type protein); thus there may be a threshold of affinity required for efficient suppression of the need for catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, this mutant also shows the lowestV max (1.1 pmol of Phe compared with 2.4 pmol for wild-type eEF1A), the highest misincorporation in vitro, and the highest intrinsic GTPase. Thus, perhaps the suppression of the requirement for eEF1Bα requires a form of eEF1A with the ability to release GDP efficiently without compromising eEF1A activity. The ability to dissect the function of a key G-protein such as eEF1A in a strain lacking a key regulatory factor such as the catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Bα is an excellent system to understand G-protein regulation.

Although neurons and endothelial cells express proteins that interact with and inhibit neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS, macrophage proteins that inhibit NOS2 have not been identified. We show that murine macrophages express a 110-kDa protein that interacts with NOS2, which we call NOS-associated protein-110 kDa (NAP110). NAP110 directly interacts with the amino terminus of NOS2, and inhibits NOS catalytic activity by preventing formation of NOS2 homodimers.

However, excessive levels of NO are cytotoxic. For example, NO released by neurons during strokes can kill neurons, and NO produced by macrophages during lung infection can cause pneumonitis (1Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S.

Calcium regulates the activity of the constitutive NOS isoforms, neuronal NOS (nNOS, or NOS1) and the endothelial NOS (eNOS, or NOS3). Both NOS1 and NOS3 are constitutively expressed as inactive monomers. Elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations lead to calcium-calmodulin associating with inactive NOS monomers, followed by formation of active NOS homodimers. In contrast, calcium does not regulate the activity of the inducible NOS (iNOS, or NOS2). NOS2 binds to calmodulin at physiological concentrations of calcium, forms NOS2 homodimers, and is always active (4Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although NOS2 activity is independent of calcium concentrations, many other mechanisms regulate NOS2. NOS2 expression in macrophages is regulated in part at the transcriptional level; resting cells do not express NOS2, but a variety of external stimuli can trigger NOS2 transcription (reviewed in Ref. 5Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar).

NOS2 activity can also be regulated by the availability of its substrates and co-factors in vitro, including arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin; however, it is unclear whether or not intracellular concentrations of arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin actually limit NOS2 activity in vivo (17Vodovotz Y.

Although several proteins have been shown to interact with NOS1 and NOS3, regulating their location and activity, it is unknown whether similar proteins regulate NOS2 in macrophages. Since NOS2 is a high output isoform of NOS that can produce cytotoxic levels of NO, we hypothesized that macrophages express proteins that interact with NOS2 and inhibit its activity. Screening a murine macrophage cDNA library, we found a previously identified protein of unknown function that directly interacts with NOS2 and inhibits NOS2 activity by preventing the formation of NOS2 homodimers. The following antibodies were used: a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of murine NOS2 (AKKGSALEEPKATRL) generated by us (25Lowenstein C.J. Hill S.L. Lafond-Walker A. Wu J. Allen G. Landavere M. Rose N.R. Herskowitz A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1837-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); and a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal residues (CKDDGDSKDKKDDDEDM- SLD) of the NOS2-associated protein-110 (NAP110), which was generated by us. Monoclonal antibody to mouse NOS2 and monoclonal antibody to endothelial NOS (eNOS) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The eukaryotic expression constructs, pCI-mu-NOS2 and pcDNA3.1-NAP110 encoding the full-length NOS2 and NAP110 proteins, respectively, were generated by us. The mouse NOS2 cDNA was cloned by us and introduced into pCI-neo expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) (26Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6711-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the human 110-kDa glycoprotein (566), which is highly homologous to mouse NAP110, was obtained as a gift from Dr. S. Shimada (Department of Surgery, Kumamoto University Medical School, Kumamoto, Japan). Standard cloning methods were used to introduce theEcoRI fragment (1,375 base pairs (bp)) of the 110-kDa glycoprotein cDNA into the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), generating the pcDNA3.1-NAP110 expression cassette. LPS was obtained from Sigma. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was a generous gift from the American Cancer Society. The RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage tumor cells and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Tissue and Cell Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). RAW 264.7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Mouse bone marrow-derived primary macrophages were isolated from female C57BL/6 mice (F2 wild type, from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). After harvest, cells were cultured for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated low LPS FBS, 15% filter-sterilized l-cell conditioned medium, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin/1% glutamine (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) at 37 °C under 8% CO2. Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal primary macrophages were lavaged with cold phosphate-buffered saline from female C57BL6 mice 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of sterile 0.3 mmthioglycolate (Sigma). Peritoneal cells were resuspended in RPMI, 10% FBS and plated into 100-mm Petri dishes. The cells adhered overnight in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% low LPS FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin/1% glutamine before use. To exclude effects of contaminating LPS on experimental conditions, resting cell culture was carried out in the presence of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (Calbiochem). Induction of NOS2 in cultured cells (mouse RAW 264.7 tumor macrophages or mouse primary bone marrow macrophages or mouse thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages) was performed using IFN-γ (20 units/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 16 h. We also used human HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with pCI-mu-NOS2 or pcDNA3.1-NAP110 or combinations thereof. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini, Calabasas, CA), penicillin, and streptomycin. The recombinant DNA was introduced into HeLa cells with aid of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 4 h with 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 5 μg of DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE. The DNA/LipofectAMINE solution was then aspirated, 3 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, then collected and analyzed. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% of Triton X-100, 0.5% Brij-50, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (27Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A. Bao C. Kozlovsky C. Hand T.A. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For determination of NOS2 apparent molecular mass, cell lysates were loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (1.0 × 50.0 cm, Bio-Rad) in lysis buffer without detergents, and fractions were collected, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described above. For the detection of NOS2 and NAP110 complexes in vivo, female C57BL6 mice were injected with IFN-γ (500 units/mice) and LPS (500 μg/mice) intraperitoneally, and after 18 h tissue specimens (spleen and peritoneal primary macrophages) were collected, homogenized, and subsequently analyzed. The NOS assay was performed as described previously (28Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm FMN, and 10 μm FAD. A reaction mix was made of cell lysate containing 50 μg of protein, 50 μl of [U-14C]arginine (50,000 cpm), 5 μl of 5 mm FAD, 5 μl of 100 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μl of 30 μm calmodulin, and the volume was brought up to 250 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl of 10 mm NADPH, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, applied to a Dowex-50W resin (H+ form) column, and the flow-through was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for potential binding partners of NOS2 (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). First, we constructed a cDNA library from mouse bone marrow-derived primary macrophages, which were stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ. Mouse bone marrow-derived primary macrophages were isolated from female C57BL/6 mice (F2 wild type, from Jackson Laboratories) and cultured (11 × 106 cells/dish) for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% low LPS FBS, 15% filter-sterilized L-cell conditioned medium, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% glutamine at 37 °C under 8% CO2. Cells then were stimulated with IFN-γ (20 units/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 16 h. RNA was prepared from stimulated macrophages. cDNA prepared using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer was inserted into the Hybri-Zap-Gal4-AD λ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resultant Gal4-AD library plasmids encoded fusion proteins consisting of the Gal4 activation domain and random macrophage polypeptides. The titer of the primary unamplified two-hybrid cDNA library was estimated as of 1.6 × 106 plaque-forming units. The two-hybrid cDNA library was first excised from λ phage in presence of ExAssist filamentous phage (Stratagene). Then the library was amplified by introduction into XLOLR Escherichia coli cells to a final titer of 3.3 × 109 colony-forming units. The insert size range of cDNA in the library was 400–1,300 bp. The final amplified DNA from the two-hybrid cDNA library was stored at −20 °C, and the original λ phage two-hybrid cDNA library was stored at −86 °C in the presence of 7% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.3% chloroform. To prepare bait plasmids, murine NOS2 cDNA sequences (bp 1–549 or 1–210) were prepared by the PCR and inserted 3′ to the cDNA for the Gal4 binding domain of plasmid pGal4-BD (Stratagene). The resultant pGal4-BD-NOS2 bait plasmids encoded a fusion protein comprised of the Gal4 binding domain and an amino terminus fragment of NOS2 (amino acid residues 1–183 or 1–70). The identity of the cDNA encoding the fusion protein was determined by sequencing. YRG-2 yeast cells were co-transformed with pGal4-BD-NOS2 and the HybriZap-Gal4-AD cDNA library, and grown on a selective medium lacking tryptophan or leucine or histidine or combinations thereof. Colonies that contained cDNA encoding target library proteins interacting with the bait fusion protein were identified by transcription of the HIS3 and lacZ genes. A total of 1.4 × 106 yeast transformants were placed under selection. Plasmids from β-galactosidase-positive yeast colonies were isolated and retransformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. For the quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain SFY526) were co-transformed by the lithium acetate method with various combinations of bait plasmid (pGal4-BD expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 binding domain and portions of NOS2) and target plasmids (pGal4-AD expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 activation domain and portions of NAP110). Transformants were plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. After 3 days at 30 °C, cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as a substrate (nmol of ONPG cleaved/min/mg of protein measured at OD420). To evaluate the effect of glycosylation on NOS2/NAP110 complex formation, RAW 264.7 mouse tumor macrophages or HeLa cells were grown as described above for 20 h in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml tunicamycin, an inhibitor ofN-glycosylation (30Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ as indicated above. Cell lysates were then resolved by a denaturing gel electrophoresis following by immunoblotting with antibody to NOS2 or antibody to NAP110. For co-precipitation, precleared cell lysates from stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody to NAP110 followed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody to NOS2 or with a monoclonal antibody to NOS2 followed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody to NAP110. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins in murine macrophages that associate with NOS2. Yeast expressing a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the amino terminus of NOS2 (amino acid residues 1–183) were transformed with plasmids encoding fusion proteins consisting of the Gal4 activation domain and random polypeptides from mouse primary bone marrow macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ/LPS. The amino-terminal region of NOS2 was selected as a potential target of interacting proteins since it is not homologous to the other NOS isoforms. Screening of 1.4 × 106 yeast transformants revealed 18 candidate proteins that might interact with NOS2, including: NOS2 (7 individual clones), cytochrome c oxidase (2 clones), GATA-3 transcription factor, α2-macroglobulin, γ-actin, Tum-P91A antigen, and SPT-5 transcription initiation factor (one clone each) (TableI). Four positive yeast clones contained overlapping DNA fragments highly homologous to a human 110-kDa glycoprotein, which we now refer to as NOS2-associated protein-110 kDa (NAP110) (31Shimada S.

Yeast were grown on agar plates lacking tryptophan (Trp); leucine (Leu); tryptophan and leucine; or tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (His); and then were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by liquid culture assay method using ONPG as a substrate (nmol ONPG cleaved/min/mg protein measured at OD420) (3Karupiah G.

In order to define more precisely the regions of NOS2 and NAP110 that interact, yeast expressing a NAP110 fusion protein (consisting of amino acid residues 349–401 of NAP110 fused to the Gal4 activation domain) were transformed with various plasmids expressing different domains of NOS2 (residues 1–183, 1–70, and 71–220). Analysis of transformed yeast revealed that residues 1–70 of NOS2 are capable of interacting with NAP110 in yeast (Table I). Moreover, residues 363–401 of NAP110 are sufficient to interact with residues 1–70 of NOS2 (Table I). A search of the GenBank data base revealed that the mouse NAP110 protein is highly homologous to an 110-kDa glycoprotein (70% identity at the amino acid level), which was cloned from an human gastric carcinoma cell line (31Shimada S. Ogawa M. Takahashi M. Schlom J. Greiner J.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar). NAP110 is a glycosylated acidic protein (pI = 4.09), which consists of 407 amino acid residues. Its expression in some human gastric carcinoma cells is increased by IFN-γ (31Shimada S. Ogawa M. Takahashi M. Schlom J. Greiner J.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar). Its function was previously unknown. We next examined the ability of NOS2 and NAP110 to interact in mammalian cells. We generated a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal residues 381–401 of mouse NAP110 (CKDDGDSKDKKDDDEDMSLD), which were identical to the carboxyl-terminal residues of human 110-kDa glycoprotein (31Shimada S. Ogawa M. Takahashi M. Schlom J. Greiner J.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we prepared cell lysates from RAW 264.7 macrophages that were stimulated or not with LPS/IFN-γ. NOS2 is absent from resting cells but is expressed in RAW cells that are treated with LPS and IFN-γ, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). NAP110 is expressed in resting RAW cells at a low level, and its expression is significantly higher in stimulated cells (Fig. 1). NAP110 and NOS2 interact in RAW cells that are stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ but not in resting ones, as shown by co-precipitation (Fig. 1). We then examined the association of NOS2 and NAP110 in primary macrophages isolated from thioglycolate-stimulated mice. These macrophages only express NOS2 after stimulation with LPS/IFN-γ, but in contrast to RAW cells, they express NAP110 in both conditions, resting and stimulated (Fig.2 A). Such NAP expression in resting primary macrophages may be due to the thioglycolate pretreatment of mice during macrophage isolation (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown, NOS2 and NAP110 interact in primary macrophages (Fig. 2 B). Then we analyzed the expression of NOS2 and NAP110 in the spleen and in peritoneal macrophages obtained from untreated mice and mice which were injected with IFN-γ and LPS. NOS2 protein is expressed in spleen and in peritoneal macrophages of mice treated with IFN- γ and LPS; untreated mice normally do not express NOS2 (Fig.3). NAP110 protein is expressed in resting mouse spleen and macrophages, and IFN-γ and LPS increase NAP110 expression in vivo (Fig. 3). Physiological complexes of endogenous NAP110 and endogenous NOS2 were detected by co-precipitation in extracts obtained from the spleen and peritoneal macrophages of treated mice, but were not detected in extracts obtained from the spleen and peritoneal macrophages of untreated mice (Fig. 3). More than 20% of the endogenous NAP110 and NOS2 are involved in complex formation. To test the specificity of the NAP110 interaction with various NOS isoforms, we analyzed NAP110 interaction with eNOS in the spleen of untreated and IFN-γ/LPS-treated mice. eNOS is expressed in the spleen of untreated and treated mice (Fig. 4). These same lysates contain the NAP110 protein (Fig. 3). However, eNOS and NAP110 do not interact in the mouse spleen, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). Thus, NAP110 interacts only with NOS2 and not with the eNOS isoform. Since the protein product of the NAP110 gene is heavily glycosylated (NAP without glycans has a molecular mass of 44 kDa versus110 kDa for the glycoprotein), we evaluated whether or not the glycans of NAP110 play a role in its interaction with NOS2. Tunicamycin was added to stimulated RAW cells to block N-glycosylation (30Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NAP protein produced under these circumstances has a molecular mass of 44 kDa, presumably because it is not glycosylated (Fig.5 A). Deglycosylated NAP is still capable of forming physiological complexes with NOS2 (Fig.5 B). We next examined the effect of NAP110 upon NOS2 activity. NOS activity was measured in HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors for NOS2, NAP110, or with combinations thereof. HeLa cells transfected with NOS2 alone synthesize NO (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). However, co-expression of NAP110 reduces NOS2 activity by more than 90% (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). Since expression of NAP110 does not reduce the amount of NOS2 protein expressed in response to IFN-γ/LPS treatment (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2 and 4), we explored other mechanisms by which NAP110 could inhibit NOS2 activity. We hypothesized that NAP110 inhibits NOS2 activity by interfering with NOS2 homodimerization, which is required for NOS2 activity (32Hevel J.M. White K.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22789-22791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors for NOS2, NAP110, or both, and these lysates were fractionated on a gel filtration column; aliquots were then electrophoresed on a denaturing gel and then immunoblotted. In cells expressing NOS2 alone, about half of the NOS2 exists as homodimers (eluting in fractions 11–18 at approximately 300–400 kDa) and about half as monomers (eluting fractions 23–29 at approximately 140 kDa) (Fig.7 A). No NAP110 protein is detected in cells transfected only with the NOS2 expression vector (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, expression of NAP110 together with NOS2 shifts the elution profile of NOS2 from two peaks at approximately 140 and 300–400 kDa (Fig. 7 A) to one peak at approximately 300–400 kDa (Fig. 7 C). Immunoblotting with antibody to NAP110 detected NAP110 in the same eluted fractions (Fig.7 D). We hypothesized that this new elution profile of NOS2 was due to the formation of NAP110/NOS2 heterodimers. However, it is difficult to distinguish NAP110/NOS2 heterodimers (mass 110 + 135 kDa) from NOS2 homodimers (mass135 + 135 kDa) on the basis of relative mobility since their masses are similar. To solve this problem, we decided to remove the N-glycan component from NAP110 before the size exclusion chromatography. HeLa cells were transfected with both expression vectors for NAP110 and NOS2, and then were cultured for 20 h in presence of tunicamycin (2 μg/ml), which inhibitsN-glycosylation (30Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were subjected to Superdex-200 size exclusion chromatography and immunoblotted. Deglycosylation of NAP shifts the elution profile of NOS2 from approximately 300–400 kDa (Fig. 7 C) to approximately 200 kDa in fractions 18–26 (Fig. 7 E). NAP co-elutes with the NOS2 in fractions 18–25 (Fig. 7 F). Thus, a reduction in the molecular weight of NAP changes the retention time for NOS2/NAP complexes. This shift in the NOS2 elution profile suggests that NOS2 forms heterodimers with NAP110. A small amount of rapidly eluting NOS2 is present in fractions 10–13, and may be NOS2 homodimers (Fig. 7 E). This amount of NOS2 homodimers in cells expressing NOS2 and NAP110 is substantially less than in cells expressing NOS2 alone. Thus, NAP110 reduces the amount of NOS2 homodimer formation. To see if NAP110 only associates with NOS2 monomers, we mixed cell e"

On examining two lines of Tg mice identified by Southern blot, the transgene product was expressed in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissues, and insulin-induced association of insulin receptor substrate 1 with endogenous SHP-2 was inhibited, confirming that ΔPTP has a dominant negative property. The intraperitoneal glucose loading test demonstrated an increase in blood glucose levels in Tg mice. Plasma insulin levels in Tg mice after 4 h fasting were 3 times greater with comparable blood glucose levels. To estimate insulin sensitivity by a constant glucose, insulin, and somatostatin infusion, steady state blood glucose levels were higher, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. Furthermore, we observed the impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and adipocytes in the presence of physiological concentrations of insulin. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt kinase activities by insulin were attenuated in muscle and liver. These results indicate that the inhibition of endogenous SHP-2function by the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant may lead to impaired insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism, and thusSHP-2 may function to modulate insulin signaling in target tissues.

After stimulation by these ligands, SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to Grb2-SOS complex, resulting in activation of p21ras and MAP kinase cascade. On the other hand, in the case of insulin signaling, SHP-2 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation. However, insulin induces the association of IRS-1 with SHP-2(10Kuhne M.R.

(16Kharitonenkov A. Schnekenburger J. Chen Z. Knyazev P. Ali S. Zwick E. White M. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Thus, they speculate that SHP-2potentiates interaction of IRS-1 with insulin receptors as an adapter molecule. In contrast, a recent study reported that in 32D cells expressing a mutant IRS-1 lacking SHP-2-binding sites, the insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation is enhanced and results in the potentiation of insulin-stimulated protein synthesis, suggesting thatSHP-2 attenuates IRS-1 phosphorylation and modulates metabolic response of insulin in 32D cells (17Myers Jr., M.G.

Thus, these different effects of SHP-2 on regulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation are dependent on cell types used for the experiments (CHO, NIH3T3, Rat 1, baby hamster kidney, and 32D cells). Thus, we tried to make transgenic mice expressing our dominant negative mutant SHP-2 (ΔPTP) to clarify the physiological roles of SHP-2 in the in vivo insulin action to regulate glucose utilization, especially in its regulation of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. Purified porcine insulin was a gift from Lilly. Porcine insulin 125I-labeled at TyrA14(125I-insulin; 2200 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP, 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose,l-[14C]glucose, and [U-14C]glucose were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Shiga, Japan) and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). A monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody αPY69 was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Lisle, IL). Monoclonal antibodies against SHP-2 (αPTP1D) and Grb2 (αGrb2) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KT). Polyclonal antibodies against p85 of PI3-kinase (αp85), IRS-2, and Shc were also from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-IRS-1 (αIRS-1) for Western blotting was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Akt1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiserum against a glutathioneS-transferase-IRS-1 fusion protein for the immunoprecipitation study was raised in a rabbit against corresponding glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (11Ugi S. Maegawa H. Olefsky J.M. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein G-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protein kinase inhibitor, histone H2B, and phosphatidylinositol were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade from Nacalai Chemicals (Kyoto, Japan). The eukaryotic expression vector, pCAGGS was a gift from Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University). This vector consists of a strong promoter based upon that of chicken β-actin (18Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). The transgene was under the control of chicken β-actin promoter, CMV-IE enhancer, and rabbit β-globulin poly(A) signal. For the ΔPTP transgene, cDNA encoding a pair of SH2 domains ofSHP-2 (amino acid 1–216) was ligated into theEcoRI sites in the expression vector pCAGGS as described (15Ugi S. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Adachi M. Olefsky J.M. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12595-12602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Linear DNA of ΔPTP vector was made by double digestion ofScaI and BamHI and microinjected into the fertilized eggs from BDF1 female mice by standard procedures (19Saitou M. Sugai S. Tanaka T. Shimouchi K. Fuchs E. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The construct used for transgenic generation is outlined in Fig.1 A. Tail biopsies were taken 4 weeks after birth at weaning for isolation of genomic DNA. To check the integrity of transgene, genomic DNA from tail was digested by 2 sets of restriction enzymes (SalI and ScaI orHincII and ScaI) and hybridized with a vector probe (probe A) or cDNA probe (probe B), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Since probe B interacted with three bands in our Southern blotting, one was transgene (560 bp) and the others were 1200 and 800 bp, there may be endogenous SHP-2 (Syp) gene as shown in Fig. 1 B. Thus, we determined the copy number of each line by calculating the ratio of intensity (560:1200 bp). For Northern blotting, 10 μg of total RNA was used for assay (20Obata T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Pillay T.S. Kikkawa R. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, various organs were homogenized with a motor-driven homogenizer in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmEDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μmaprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant (75 μg of protein) was resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blotted with anti-PTP1D antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All mice used in this study were F2 and F3 siblings. F2 and F3 mice were kept in sterile microisolators and were observed closely throughout the experiment. To avoid the effect of gender, we used male mice for the following studies. For measuring the growth rate, four mice of either genotype were monitored as to their body weight once every week, starting 4 weeks after birth. To confirm whether ΔPTP could reveal a dominant negative property in terms of inhibition of IRS-1 association with endogenousSHP-2 (Syp), we assessed insulin-induced IRS-1 association with SHP-2 as follows. Four units of human insulin was injected by inferior vena cava into anesthetized mice according to the modified method of Araki et al. (21Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Jonson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Two or 5 min after insulin injection, liver and hindlimb muscle were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, respectively. The tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer as described. Homogenate was allowed to be solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C before centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant (3–4 mg of protein) was incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody for 3 h and then with protein G-Sepharose for a further 2 h. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting, and then immunoblotted with anti-PTP1D antibody. Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels of 12–16-week-old mice were measured between 10:00 and 12:00 a.m. after 4 h fasting under anesthetized conditions with sodium pentobarbital. Blood glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidation method, and plasma insulin levels were determined using rat insulin enzyme immunoassay kit (Morinaga, Tokyo, Japan). Glucose loading test was performed as follows. After overnight fasting, mice received 3 mg/g glucose solution intraperitoneally, and blood samples were obtained from the tail vein at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose loading. To assessin vivo insulin sensitivity, we performed the insulin sensitivity test using constant glucose, insulin, and somatostatin infusion (22Maegawa H. Kobayashi M. Ishibashi O. Takata Y. Shigeta Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E616-E623PubMed Google Scholar). This test proposes that endogenous insulin secretion is suppressed with somatostatin coupled with a fixed constant glucose and insulin infusion. At a high concentration of insulin, glucose production of the liver was reported to be negligible, and the insulin-stimulated glucose utilization appeared to be ascribed to glucose disposal in the peripheral tissue, mainly in the skeletal muscle. Briefly, after overnight fasting, male mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital, and the right jugular vein was exposed and cannulated with a polyethylene tube for administration of the infusate. After a 30-min infusion with saline, mice were administered the infusate containing glucose (1.125 g/kg/h), insulin (1.0 units/kg/h), and somatostatin (100 μg/kg/h) at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/h for 120 min. Blood samples were obtained from the tail vein at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the start of the infusion of mixed solution. Plasma insulin levels were measured at 120 min. The mean of the last three samples was used for the estimation of steady state blood glucose (SSBG) and steady state plasma insulin levels at 120 min. At the indicated time points, the hindlimb muscle from the Tg mice was removed, frozen, and kept in liquid nitrogen to be used for assays. The muscle was homogenized in glycylglycine buffer containing 25 mm NaF. The glycogen synthase activity was measured according to the modified Thomas' filter paper method (23McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the data were expressed as percent I − form (Glc-6-P−/Glc-6-P+). Glucose transport activity was assessed by the measurement of 2-deoxyglucose uptake as described (22Maegawa H. Kobayashi M. Ishibashi O. Takata Y. Shigeta Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E616-E623PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, soleus muscle was separated from hindlimb and incubated with insulin (0–10 nm) at 25 °C in 2 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer containing 10 mm HEPES and 11 mm glucose for 120 min. The muscle was washed with glucose-free buffer for 10 min and then incubated with a fresh buffer containingd-2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (1 mm, 1 μCi/2 ml) and l-[14C]glucose (0.5 μCi/2 ml), in the presence or absence of 1 or 10 nm insulin for another 30 min at 25 °C, respectively. Specific 2-deoxyglucose uptake was determined by subtracting l-glucose uptake from total 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads by collagenase digestion with some modification as described previously (24Kashiwagi A Verso M.A. Andrews J . Vasquez B Reven G. Foley J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The fat pads were removed and minced into KRP buffer containing 5 mmd-glucose and 1 mg/ml collagenase (type I, Worthington) and digested (1 h, 37 °C) with gentle shaking (200 cycle/min). The adipocytes were washed three times in KRP buffer (each wash in volume 10 times the cell volume). The adipocyte layer was finally diluted with KRP buffer to 20% (v/v) suspension as estimated by packed cells (lipocrit). Insulin binding to 106 cells was measured at 8.3 nm125I-labeled at TyrA14-insulin (NEN Life Science Products). The number of adipocytes was determined by counting in hemocytometer. Twenty % cell suspension corresponded to 106 cells per ml. The uptake of amount of trace d-[U-14C]glucose by isolated adipocytes was measured as described previously with some modifications (24Kashiwagi A Verso M.A. Andrews J . Vasquez B Reven G. Foley J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were incubated in 400 ml of KRP buffer containing 2% albumin in the presence of various concentrations of insulin and trace (300 nm) amounts of 0.1 mCid-[U-14C]glucose. The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with continuous shaking at 40 cycle/min. The assay was terminated by centrifugation of a 325-ml aliquot on the top of 100 μl of silicon oil in a 500-μl microtube in a centrifuge for 1 min. The adipocytes remain on the top of the oil layer, and the buffer was below the oil. The tube was cut just below the adipocyte layer, which was transferred into 5 ml of nonaqueous scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was measured. Two or 5 min after a bolus injection of insulin, liver and hindlimb muscle were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, respectively. After the standard sample preparation, the resultant supernatant was incubated with a specific antibody for 3 h and then with protein G-Sepharose for a further 2 h. The bound proteins in the immunoprecipitate or aliquot from the soluble fraction of the lysate were analyzed by Western blotting. Effects of bolus injection of insulin on the profile of phosphotyrosine proteins in muscle were analyzed by Western blotting using either phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-IRS-1 antibody. IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity was measured as described previously (15Ugi S. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Adachi M. Olefsky J.M. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12595-12602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After a bolus injection of insulin, liver and muscle were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and then centrifuged. The supernatant (1.5 mg of protein) was incubated with anti-glutathioneS-transferase-IRS-1 antibody for 2 h and then for another 1 h with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, three times with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. The pellets were suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm ATP, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol, incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and terminated with 20 μl of 8 nHCl. After extraction with chloroform/methanol (1:1), the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate. The plate was developed in methanol/chloroform/ammonia/water (100:70:15:25), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity in the phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) was quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager, Bio-Rad). Five or 10 min after a bolus injection of insulin, liver and hindlimb muscle were isolated, and Akt kinase activity was assayed in vitro using histone H2B as a substrate. Briefly, tissue was homogenized and lysed, and a sample for kinase assay was prepared as for the MAP kinase assay. The supernatant (1.5 mg of protein) was incubated with anti-Akt1 antibody for 2 h and then for another 1 h with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C. The assay was conducted in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 50 μm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of histone H2B at 30 °C for 15 min. After stopping the reaction by addition of 10 μl of 8n HCl, a 20-μl aliquot was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper. The paper was washed, and phosphorylation was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Activated MAP was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-MAP kinase and Erk2 antibodies during insulin sensitivity test. We also measured the effects on bolus injection of insulin on MAP kinase activity in vitro using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate in muscle and liver as described (15Ugi S. Maegawa H.

Briefly, the tissue was homogenized and lysed with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 25 mm NaCl, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After brief sonication and centrifugation, 10 μl of the obtained supernatant was assayed for kinase activity. The assay was conducted in a final volume of 40 μl containing 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 50 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of MBP at 30 °C for 15 min. A 25-μl aliquot was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, 2.3 cm in diameter (Whatman). The paper was washed with 180 mm phosphoric acid and rinsed with acetone. Phosphorylation was quantified by Cerenkov counting. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than two groups, and the unpaired Student's t test was used to determine the significance of any differences between two groups.p < 0.05 was considered significant. Sixteen founder transgenic mice were successfully identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. Two lines (S6 and S161), which had high copy number, were selected for further study. The transgene expression was detected by Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 1 C. As expected, transgene was expressed in all tissues examined including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, three key tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, matching precisely the pattern of the chicken β-actin promoter. The expression levels of ΔPTP mutant were 10 times greater than those of endogenous mouse SHP-2(Syp). All studies were performed in heterozygous mice expressing a ΔPTP mutant. In skeletal muscle, the association of IRS-1 with SHP-2 was impaired after a bolus injection of insulin when compared with that in non-Tg mice as shown in Fig.2 B (27.7 ± 0.4% of non-Tg mice, n = 3), indicating that ΔPTP could have a dominant negative property. Similar results were observed in liver (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the insulin-induced association of Shc with Grb2 was not affected in Tg mice as shown in Fig.2 C. Growth rate and body weight of male Tg mice were comparable with those of non-transgenic littermates (non-Tg). When these Tg mice received 3 mg/g glucose load intraperitoneally to evaluate their glucose tolerance, blood glucose levels after glucose loading were significantly higher that those in non-Tg mice at each time point, whereas fasting blood glucose levels were comparable between the two groups as shown in Fig.3 A. Furthermore, as shown in Table I, the plasma insulin levels 4 h after fasting were 3 times greater (p < 0.01) in Tg mice than non-Tg littermates in both lines (S6 and S161), suggesting that these Tg mice are insulin-resistant. To assess further thein vivo insulin sensitivity, we performed the insulin sensitivity test using constant glucose, insulin, and somatostatin infusion. As shown in Fig. 3 B, blood glucose levels plateaued after 60 min infusion and maintained constant values for another 60 min. As summarized in TableII, the steady state of blood glucose (SSBG) levels in Tg mice are 2 times higher than those in non-Tg mice, even though steady state plasma insulin levels were comparable among these groups. Thus, these data indicate that these Tg mice are insulin-resistant mainly in skeletal muscle.Table IBlood glucose and plasma insulin levels in transgenic (Tg) and non-transgenic (non-Tg) miceS6S161TgNon-TgTgNon-TgBlood glucose (mm)9.50 ± 0.88 (8)10.14 ± 0.28 (7)9.80 ± 0.30 (7)9.86 ± 0.32 (8)Serum insulin (nm)0.85 ± 0.18 (8)aBlood samples were obtained between 10:00 and 12:00 a.m. after 4 h fasting from 12- to 16-week old mice under anesthesia.

Previous studies of OG2, one of the two mouse osteocalcin genes, identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements, OSE1 and OSE2, the latter being the binding site of Cbfa1, the only osteoblast-specific transcription factor known to date. Here we show that OSE1 is a cis-acting element as important as OSE2 for the osteoblast-specific expression of OG2 in cell culture and transgenic mice. We also show that OSE1 is present in the promoter of several osteoblast-specific genes including Cbfa1 itself. These biological features demonstrate the importance of OSE1 and led us to further characterize this site and the factor binding to it, provisionally termed Osf1. We first defined the core OSE1 sequence, 5′-TTACATCA-3′, which is necessary and sufficient for Osf1 binding to DNA. This sequence has no strong homology to any known transcription factor-binding sites. As a first step in identifying Osf1, we performed an analytical purification of this protein using nuclear extracts from two different osteoblastic cell lines. We purified Osf1 to homogeneity through a five-step procedure including a renaturation experiment and found that its apparent molecular mass is 40 kDa. In conclusion, this study indicates the existence of multiple osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements of equal importance in controlling OG2promoter activity and provides the first biochemical characterization of Osf1, a novel osteoblast-specific transcription factor.

This underscores the biomedical importance of elucidating the genetic basis of osteoblast-specific gene expression and osteoblast differentiation. It is likely, as it is the case in many cell lineages (8Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol.

In an effort to identify these factors we have embarked on a long-term study of the regulation of OG2, one of the two mouse osteocalcin genes, whose expression is strictly osteoblast-specific. Previously, the analysis of the OG2 promoter defined a 147-bp1 fragment that confers osteoblast-specific expression to a reporter gene in vitro(12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Within this short OG2 promoter fragment we defined two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements, termed OSE1 and OSE2 (originally designated as regions A and C, respectively), that are characterized by two important features. First, multimers of each of these elements confer osteoblast specific activity to a heterologous promoter. Second, OSE1 and OSE2 serve as binding sites for distinct factors that are only detected in nuclear extracts of osteoblasts but of no other cell types or tissues tested (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These osteoblast specific binding activities were named Osf1 and Osf2, respectively. Further analysis of Osf2 revealed that it is the product of the Cbfa1 gene (13Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). We, and others have subsequently demonstrated that Cbfa1 acts as a transcriptional activator of osteoblast differentiation in mouse and human (13Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

To date Cbfa1 remains the only osteoblast-specific transcription factor identified (18Gorski J.P. Olsen B.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that other cell-specific transcription factors are involved in the control of gene expression in osteoblasts. For instance, multiple investigators have identified osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements in the promoter elements of the genes encoding α1(I) collagen, bone sialoprotein, insulin-like growth factor 1, and osteocalcin (19Bedalov A.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Likewise, as mentioned above, we have shown that OSE1 binds an osteoblast-specific factor that is not Cbfa1(12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although OSE1 has been poorly characterized so far, Osf1, the factor binding to it, has one important property. Osf1 is present in nuclear extracts of primary osteoblasts at the earliest stage of cellular differentiation, but is absent in nuclear extracts of differentiated osteoblasts that are surrounded by a mineralized matrix (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Thus, Osf1 is not only an osteoblast-specific but also a stage-specific transcription factor that could conceivably act upstream ofCbfa1, provided that OSE1 has a biologic function. The present study was aimed at defining the functional importance of OSE1 and characterizing Osf1. We first demonstrate that OSE1 is as important as OSE2 for OG2 expression in cell culture and transgenic mice. We identified an 8-bp core OSE1 sequence that is also present in the promoter of other osteocalcin genes and of the mouseCbfa1 gene. The absence of overt homologies between OSE1 and other binding sites of known transcription factors suggests that Osf1 may be a novel factor and led us to perform an analytical purification. This purification showed that Osf1 is a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. This is the first step toward identifying and eventually cloning a cDNA encoding Osf1, a second osteoblast-specific transcription factor. The oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Table I. Construction of the p1316-luc and p147-luc plasmids has been described previously (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell.

A 2-bp mutation in OSE1 within p1316-luc was generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Six copies of the wild-type or mutated OSE1Cbfa1 oligonucleotide were cloned into the SmaI site of the p34-luc construct that has been described previously (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell.

ROS17/2.8 osteoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, F9 teratocarcinoma cells in Eagle's minimal essential medium, C1 mesenchymal cells, and C2 myoblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures of newborn mouse osteoblasts were prepared and maintained as described previously (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). DNA transfection experiments were carried out using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of reporter plasmid constructs and 2 μg of pSV-βGal to quantitate the transfection efficiency. All transfections were repeated at least four times in triplicate with different DNA preparations. The constructs p1314-luc and p1314-mOSE1-luc were digested byBamHI. Inserts were purified by two rounds of agarose gel electrophoresis and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized B6D2F1 mouse oocytes (Charles River Laboratories). The injected oocytes were implanted in the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD1 foster mothers (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for development to term. Animals expressing the transgenes were identified by screening for luciferase activity in tails. Three founder animals carrying the wild-type construct and two founder animals carrying the mutant construct were obtained. The copy number of integrated DNA sequence was determined in F1 generation animals as described previously (26Frendo J.L. Xiao G. Fuchs S. Franceschi R.T. Karsenty G. Ducy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30509-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities in tissues was assessed in F1 generation animals at 10 days of age. Organs were dissected and homogenized in buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein homogenates were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity as described (26Frendo J.L. Xiao G. Fuchs S. Franceschi R.T. Karsenty G. Ducy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30509-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin. Nuclear extracts from isolated tissues of newborn mice were prepared according to the method of Deryckere and Gannon (29Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and purified on a polyacrylamide gel. Approximately 5 fmol of the probe was incubated with 1–5 μg of nuclear extracts or 1 μl of purified Osf1 in 10 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature. 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 250 fmol of single-stranded oligonucleotides were included as nonspecific competitors. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE at 160 V for 90 min. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. The analytical purification of Osf1 was performed from 30 ml of nuclear extract of ROS17/2.8 or C1 cells. The purification was monitored at every stage by EMSA using the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide as a probe. One Osf1 binding unit was defined as the amount of protein required to retard 0.25 fmol of the probe. Total protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The nuclear extract was brought to 25% ammonium sulfate saturation at 4 °C over a 30-min period. Precipitated proteins were spun down at 15,000 × g for 15 min, dissolved in 5 ml of buffer A, and dialyzed against the same buffer for 3 h with two buffer changes. Dialyzed proteins were applied onto a 5-ml phosphocellulose column (Whatman P11). After washing the column with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl, bound proteins were eluted in 1-ml fractions with 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing Osf1 binding activity were pooled, dialyzed as described above, and applied onto a MonoQ column that was run using a fast pressure liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a washing step with 0.2 m NaCl the proteins were eluted by a 0.2–1m NaCl gradient in buffer A over 10 min. Osf1 binding activity was eluted at a NaCl concentration between 0.35 and 0.4m. The corresponding fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and incubated for 10 min with 14 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 200 fmol/μl single-stranded OSE1 oligonucleotide, and 100 fmol/μl double-stranded mutant ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide (ΔOSE1-mut4). This mixture was applied to a 1-ml DNA affinity column containing multimerized ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide that was prepared as described by Kadonaga and Tjian (30Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). After a washing step at 0.2 mNaCl, the Osf1 activity was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl. To verify the purity of the eluted Osf1 the final EMSA was performed with both wild-type and mutant ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide in the absence of nonspecific competitor DNA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by silver staining according the method of Heukeshoven and Dernick (32Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). 5-mm gel slices were cut out from an adjacent lane that was run on the same gel, but not stained. These gel slices were crushed with a pestle and soaked in 500 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 3 h at room temperature. Eluted proteins were precipitated with 80% acetone, dissolved in 50 μl of buffer A containing 6 m guanidine-HCl, and denatured for 30 min. After removal of the guanidine by a 10-desalting gel spin column (Bio-Rad) the proteins were allowed to renature for 2 h at room temperature. 3 μl of renaturated proteins were assayed for Osf1 binding activity by EMSA using the wild-type and mutant ΔOSE1 oligonucleotides as probes. To determine the relative importance of OSE1 compared with OSE2 for OG2 expression we introduced small substitution mutations into either one of these two elements in the context of a p147-luc reporter gene construct that contains the first 147 bp of the mouse OG2 promoter fused to the luciferase gene (luc) (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These mutations abolish the DNA binding activity of Osf1 and Cbfa1 to their respective binding sites (Fig. 8 B and Ref. 12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Using the wild-type and mutated p147-luc constructs we performed DNA transfection experiments in ROS17/2.8 osteoblasts (Fig.1 A). We chose ROS17/2.8 cells to perform these experiments because these cells were used in the initial characterization of OSE1 and OSE2 (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).Figure 1OSE1 is required for OG2 promoter activity in vitro. DNA transfection experiments in ROS17/2.8 osteoblasts were performed with wild-type and mutated p147-luc (A) and p1316-luc (B) reporter gene constructs. Mutated elements are indicated in gray. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection of a pSV-LacZ construct and determination of β-galactosidase activities in the cell extracts (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell.

Likewise, a 2-bp mutation in OSE1 led to a 76% decrease of p147-luc activity (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that OSE1 is virtually as important as OSE2 for OG2 expression. We also introduced the same 2-bp mutation into OSE1 in the context of a longer 1316-bpOG2 promoter fragment and performed DNA transfection experiments in ROS17/2.8 cells with the wild-type and mutated p1316-luc constructs (Fig. 1 B). The OSE1 mutation led to a 51% decrease of p1316-luc activity indicating that even in this larger OG2 promoter fragment the presence of OSE1 is required for maximal activity in cell culture. As a further demonstration of the functional importance of OSE1 forosteocalcin expression, we generated transgenic mice carrying either the wild-type p1316-luc or the mutated p1316-luc chimeric genes. Three founder animals carrying the wild-type and two founder animals carrying the mutant chimeric gene were obtained. Transgenic mice of the F1 generation from these founder animals were analyzed for luciferase expression in various organs at 10 days of age (Fig. 2). In all mice containing the wild-type p1316-luc transgene the relative luciferase activities in bone were between 3000 and 5000 per 100 μg of total protein (Fig. 2 A). In these mice luciferase activities in other tissues were less than 1% compared with the values we measured in bone (2–30/100 μg of protein). This bone-specific luciferase expression was also observed in all mice carrying the mutated p1316-luc transgene (Fig.2 B). However, the luciferase activities in long bones of these latter mice were in average 75% decreased (700–1300/100 μg of protein) compared with what was observed in long bones obtained from mice carrying the wild-type transgene (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that OSE1 is functionally as important as OSE2 for OG2 expression, both in cell culture andin vivo. The functional importance of OSE1 was an incentive to better characterize this element and the factor binding to it, thereafter termed Osf1. The OSE1 oligonucleotide that was used for EMSA in our previous study covered a relatively large region of the OG2 promoter consisting of 35 bp (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Originally, we did not find any motifs within this region sharing similarities to binding sites of known transcription factors. To abolish Osf1 binding to DNA we originally used a large mutation affecting 6 bp (Table I). By definition this mutation of a large number of base pairs did not allow us to determine precisely the nucleotides critical for protein binding. We reasoned that by defining a shorter Osf1-binding site we may be in a better position to identify key nucleotides within OSE1 and to recognize binding sites of known transcription factors. To achieve this goal we first assayed shorter OSE1 oligonucleotides for Osf1 binding activity by EMSA (data not shown). This led us to the definition of a shorter oligonucleotide spanning only 22 bp of theOG2 promoter that we termed ΔOSE1 (Table I). To demonstrate that the same nuclear activity is binding to the OSE1 and the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide, direct binding and DNA competition experiments were performed by EMSA using nuclear extracts of ROS17/2.8 osteoblasts as a source of protein (Fig.3). We previously described the presence of three protein-DNA complexes formed upon incubation of ROS17/2.8 nuclear extracts with the OSE1 oligonucleotide in EMSA (12Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Osf1, defined by its osteoblast-specific presence and its heat lability, is part of the complex of intermediate mobility. Using the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide as a probe in EMSA the same three complexes were detected (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The complex of intermediate mobility was specifically competed by the wild-type, but not by the mutant ΔOSE1 and OSE1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–5). Likewise, when using the OSE1 oligonucleotide as a probe in EMSA the Osf1-DNA complex was specifically competed by the wild-type, but not by the mutant ΔOSE1 and OSE1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–5). These results suggest that the same nuclear protein binds to both the OSE1 and ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide. This was further demonstrated by the osteoblast-specific nature of the factor binding to ΔOSE1 (Fig. 5 A). Thus, we used the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide as a probe for the DNA binding experiments described below.Figure 5Osteoblast-specific nature of Osf1. EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts of various tissues and primary osteoblasts using the ΔOSE1 (A) or the ΔOSE1-mut5 (B) oligonucleotide as a probe. The binding reactions shown in lanes 9–13 of panel B were performed with nuclear extracts that were heated for 5 min at 65 °C. Nuclear extracts used were from skin (sk), heart (he), kidney (ki), brain (br), lung (lu), muscle (mu), liver (li), non-mineralized primary osteoblasts (nmi ob), and mineralized primary osteoblasts (mi ob). The Osf1-DNA complex is indicated by a closed arrowhead. The open arrowhead marks a complex of slower mobility that binds to the ΔOSE1-mut5 oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the critical base pairs within the OSE1 sequence that are required for Osf1 binding to DNA we mutagenized individually 8 bp within the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A). The use of these various ΔOSE1 oligonucleotides in EMSA allowed us to define an 8-bp core OSE1 sequence: 5′-TTACATCA-3′ (Fig. 4 B). Analysis of the core OSE1 sequence failed to show a strong homology to any known transcription factor-binding sites. However, a closer inspection of this 8-bp sequence showed a weak similarity with the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) whose sequence is 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ (33Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). This led us to explore the possibility that Osf1 could be a member of the CREB (CRE-binding proteins) family of transcription factors. The guanosine present in position 5 of the CRE is known to be critical for the binding of CREB proteins to DNA (34Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Importantly, when we used a mutant ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide carrying an A to G mutation in position 5 of the core OSE1 sequence (ΔOSE1-mut5) as a probe in EMSA with ROS17/2.8 nuclear extracts, the Osf1-DNA complex was absent and replaced by a complex of slower mobility (Fig. 4, lane 6). To determine wether the factor binding to the ΔOSE1-mut5 oligonucleotide was osteoblast-specific, EMSA with nuclear extracts of various tissues and of primary osteoblasts was performed (Fig.5). While Osf1, the factor binding to the ΔOSE1 oligonucleotide, was present only in nuclear extracts of non-mineralized primary osteoblasts (Fig. 5 A, lane 8), the factor binding to the ΔOSE1-mut5 oligonu"

Here, we report the identification in human erythroblasts of a novel cDNA, designated HUT11A, which encodes a protein identical to the previously reported erythroid HUT11 urea transporter, except for a Lys44→ Glu substitution and a Val-Gly dipeptide deletion after proline 227, which leads to a polypeptide of 389 residues versus391 in HUT11. Genomic typing by polymerase chain reaction and transcript analysis by ribonuclease protection assay demonstrated that HUT11A encodes the true Kidd blood group/urea transporter protein, which carries only 2 Val-Gly motifs. Upon expression at high levels inXenopus oocytes, the physiological Kidd/urea transporter HUT11A conferred a rapid transfer of urea (which was insensitive top-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate or phloretin), a high water permeability, and a selective uptake of small solutes including amides and diols, but not glycerol and meso-erythritol. However, at plasma membrane expression levels close to the level observed in the red cell membrane, HUT11A-mediated water transport and small solutes uptake were absent and the urea transport was poorly inhibited byp-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, but strongly inhibited by phloretin. These findings show that, at physiological expression levels, the HUT11A transporter confers urea permeability but not water permeability, and that the observed water permeability is a feature of the red cell urea transporter when expressed at unphysiological high levels.

Additionally, urea is a key component in the urinary concentrating mechanism, in which it is essential for renal water retention and prevention of dehydration. In this later process, urea transporters in red cells and the kidney have been shown to play a pivotal role (reviewed in Refs. 1Bankir L. Brenner B.M. Rector Jr., F.C. The Kidney. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 571-606Google Scholar and 2Gillin A.G. Sands J.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 146-154PubMed Google Scholar). In the last 5 years, two types of facilitated urea transporters have been molecularly characterized in different animal species: (i) transporters encoded by the UT-A gene, only present in the kidney, and (ii) more ubiquitous transporters encoded by the UT-B gene, present in red cells, kidney, and brain (3Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hediger M.A. Smith C.P. You G. Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Shayakul C.

The first human erythroid urea transporter (HUT11) was identified by homology cloning and was later shown to be encoded by the Kidd (JK)1 blood group locus (6Olivès B. Neau P. Bailly P.

The HUT11 cDNA encodes a membrane glycoprotein of 391 amino acids, which facilitates urea transport. Expression studies inXenopus oocytes have shown that HUT11 urea transport was inhibitable by phloretin and para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) (6Olivès B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as expected for the transporter of human erythrocytes (8Mayrand R.R. Levitt C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical and in situhybridization studies have shown that HUT11 is also expressed on endothelial cells of the vasa recta in the inner and outer medulla of the kidney, but not on the epithelial cells of the renal tubules, interstitial cells, and glomerular cells (9Xu Y. Olivès B. Bailly P. Fischer E. Ripoche P. Ronco P. Cartron J.-P. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This distribution of expression of HUT11 fully accounted for studies in which a physiological urea transport has been described (10Pallone T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R260-R267PubMed Google Scholar), as well as for the model of experimental hydronephrotic rat kidneys showing a strong staining of the urea transporter on preserved intact vasculature despite a complete loss of the tubular epithelium (11Promeneur D. Rousselet G. Bankir L. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tran M.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that, in the renal circulation, the Kidd/urea transporter is involved in countercurrent exchange between the ascending and descending vasa recta to prevent loss of urea from the medulla and to enhance the cortico-papillary osmolality gradient, which is critical in the urinary concentrating mechanism (12Macey R.I. Yousef L.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the JK gene, which encodes the human urea transporter, is composed of 11 exons extending over 30 kilobase pairs of DNA (13Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Olivès B. Moulds J. Le Pennec P.-Y. Cartron J.-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12973-12980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and we have identified the molecular basis of the JK*A/JK*B polymorphisms (14Olivès B. Merriman M. Bailly P. Bain S. Barnett A. Todd J. Cartron J.-P. Merriman T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We also found that different splice site mutations in two unrelated Jknullindividuals provided a rational explanation for the lack of Kidd/urea transporter protein at the red cell surface (13Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Olivès B. Moulds J. Le Pennec P.-Y. Cartron J.-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12973-12980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus in Jknull individuals, the absence of Kidd/urea transporter protein on red cells and probably on endothelial cells of the vasa recta should alter the urea recycling mechanism, thus explaining the reduced capacity to concentrate urine of these individuals (15Sands J.M. Gargus J.J. Fröhlich O. Gunn R.B. Kokko J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No erythrocyte hemolysis has been reported in Jknullindividuals who do not suffer from a clinical syndrome except for the urine concentrating defect. Interestingly, another urea transporter has been characterized, which is only expressed in human kidney (16Olivès B. Martial S. Mattei M.-G. Matassi G. Rousselet G. Ripoche P. Cartron J.-P. Bailly P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Martial S. Olivès B. Abrami L. Couriaud C. Bailly P. You G. Hediger M. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. Rousselet G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1264-F1268PubMed Google Scholar). This transporter, which is called HUT2 (hUT-A2), is 62% identical to HUT11 (hUT-B2). Both human urea transporters are encoded by genes localized on chromosome 18q12, suggesting that they evolved from duplication of a common ancestor. Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a polypeptide called HUT11A, which is slightly different from HUT11. Genomic and transcript analysis demonstrated that HUT11A, and not HUT11, is the physiological product of the Kidd blood group locus. Additionally, functional studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that HUT11A is only a urea transporter at physiological expression levels, but a water and small solute transport activity at high, unphysiological, expression levels. Blood samples from individuals of common Jk phenotypes were collected from anticoagulated blood and used for total reticulocyte RNA and leukocyte genomic DNA extraction. Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK)). Radiolabeled nucleotides and [14C]urea (1.96 GBq/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Bucks, UK), and [3H]raffinose (188.7 GBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The Expand High Fidelity PCR system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) was used for PCR amplification. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger) with ThermoSequenase fluorescently labeled primer cycle sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech using 5′-(Cy5) primers (Genset, Paris, France). Full-length cDNA encoding the human Kidd blood group/urea transporter protein was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total reticulocyte RNAs extracted by the acid-phenol-ammonium method (18Izraeli S. Pfleiderer C. Lion T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) from blood samples using a sense primer (position −21 to −1) and an antisense primer (position 1234–1211) as described previously (11Promeneur D. Rousselet G. Bankir L. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tran M.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP-1 cDNA (accession no. L07268) was PCR-amplified from a λgt11 human bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH) using sense (position −15 to −1) and antisense (position 829 to 849) primers. All cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRV-digested pT7TS plasmid (kindly provided by P. Krieg, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Austin, TX) and sequenced on both strands, using an automated Alf-Express sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). For primer designation, nucleotide +1 was taken as the first nucleotide of the HUT11 initiation codon (5Berger U.V. Tsukaguchi H. Hediger M.A. Anat. Embryol. 1998; 197: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether the genomic DNA encoded for a transporter with 2 or 3 Val-Gly dipeptide repeats, a hemi-nested PCR amplification was carried out under stringent conditions (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 10 s, for 30 cycles) using 200 ng of leukocyte DNA from 126 independent donors. The first amplification was done between SP-A (sense primer, 5′-gcagTTGTTGAAATCTATACCAG-3′, exonic position 664–682) and AS-B (antisense primer, position 797–774) and the second amplification between the primers SP-A and AS-C (antisense primer, position 728–705), under the same experimental conditions. The PCR products were digested with 5 units of BglII restriction enzyme and electrophoresed on a 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel stained with ethidium bromide. Using a described experimental strategy (19Maillet P. Delaunay J. Baklouti F. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an antisense RNA probe (ASP-1) encompassing 406 nucleotides between positions 426 and 831 of the HUT11 cDNA was constructed, which encodes 3 Val-Gly dipeptide repeats. For this, the corresponding cDNA fragment was amplified between primers SP (sense primer, position 426–447) and AS (antisense primer, position 831–811) and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, SA). FromHindIII-linearized recombinant plasmid, the antisense-RNA probe ASP-1 was in vitro synthesized using the Riboprobe Core System from Promega (Madison, WI) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After purification on a 5% (w/v) acrylamide, 8 m urea gel, the ASP-1 probe (2.0 × 105 cpm) was hybridized overnight at 50 °C with 25 ng of in vitro synthesized sense transcripts (cRNAs) encoding the 2Val-Gly or 3Val-Gly motifs (mCAP mRNA capping kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as controls, 2 μg of human bone marrow poly(A+) RNAs (CLONTECH), and 20 μg of total reticulocyte RNAs from two unrelated individuals, and then digested with a RNase A/T1 mixture, according to the manufacturer's instructions (RPAII; Ambion, Austin, TX). Subsequently, the protected RNA fragments were separated on a 5% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel (8 m urea) and exposed to a Biomax MS film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The pT7TS-cDNA constructs were linearized with SmaI restriction enzyme, and capped sense RNAs were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase from the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). Expression studies were carried out by microinjection of cRNAs in collagenase-treated Xenopus laevis oocytes as described previously (20Martial S. Ripoche P. Ibarra C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V and VI oocytes from mature femaleX. laevis (CNRS, Nantes, France) were removed, defolliculated with 1.4 units/ml collagenase type A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5), and microinjected with 50 nl of water or cRNA solution (0.05–40 ng/oocyte in 50 nl). The microinjected oocytes were then kept at 18 °C for 2 or 3 days in Barth solution (200 mosm) containing 50 μg/ml Geneticin with daily changes of Barth solution until functional tests. Three days after the microinjection, groups of 3–6 oocytes without chorionic membrane were embedded in paraffin as described (21Mc Lean I.W. Nakane P.K. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Sections (7 μm thick) were stained overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-N-terminal (residues 8–22) antibodies of the Kidd/urea transporter protein, described and used previously (7Olivès B.

Knoers N.V.A.M. van Lieburg A.F. Monnens L.A.H. Leumann E. Wuhl E. Schober E. Rijss J.P. L von Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 242-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After injection of 40 ng cRNA/oocyte, urea transport activity was measured by [14C]urea uptake as described previously (6Olivès B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.-P.

In all these experiments, the Barth incubation solution contained 8 μCi/ml [14C] urea (145 μm) and 5 μCi/ml [3H]raffinose as a control of oocyte plasma membrane integrity. Incubation time was 90 s, except for time-course experiments where the incubation time varied from 0 to 60 min. After washing and solubilization, the samples were subjected to liquid scintillation in a counter, and urea permeability (P urea) was calculated from the oocyte-associated amount of [14C]urea at each time point, corrected for the optically determined oocyte surface area. Oocyte water permeability (Pf) was measured by a swelling assay 3 days after the injection (24Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V.A.M. van Essen A.J. Proesmans W. Mallmann R. Monnens L.A.H. von Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Oocyte swelling was performed at 18 °C after the transfer from Barth solution (200 mosm) to 40 mosm at t = 0. Permeability measurements were made by a microscopy technique using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon, Paris, France) (2× objective) coupled to a Biocom computer system of image integration (Biocom, Les Ulis, France). The osmotic water permeability Pf(cm/s) was calculated from the initial osmotic cell volume increase between t = 0 and t = 90 s by the relation Pf =Vo[d(V/Vo)/dt]/[Sνw(Δosm)], where S is the oocyte surface area and νw the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol) (25Abrami L. Tacnet F. Ripoche P. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to determine the influence of small solutes on the water movement across injected oocyte plasma membranes, oocytes were placed at t = 0 in 40 mosmBarth solution adjusted to 200 mosm with the tested solute including formamide, acetamide, propionamide, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, or meso-erythritol, as described previously (17Martial S. Olivès B. Abrami L. Couriaud C. Bailly P. You G. Hediger M. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. Rousselet G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1264-F1268PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte swelling was performed for 240 s. Osmolarity was checked with a Roebling osmometer just before the experiments. In water or urea transport inhibition experiments, oocytes were incubated in 0.5 mm pCMBS (Sigma), 0.5 mmphloretin (Sigma), or 0.3 mm HgCl2 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 20, 10, and 5 min, respectively, before and during the assay at 18 °C. The same batches used to measure the urea permeability were prepared to determine the particle density in the P-face plasma membrane of oocytes. Before fixation, the oocytes were rapidly emptied of their cytoplasm by aspiration with a pipette (diameter >100 μm). H2O- and cRNA-injected oocytes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Barth solution for 2 or 3 h at 18 °C, then washed in Barth solution. Emptied oocytes were incubated in Barth solution supplemented with 30% glycerol for 1 h at room temperature and placed between two copper sample holders and then frozen in melting freon. Samples were fractured in a Balzers 300 apparatus at −150 °C under 10−7 torr vacuum. Fractured surfaces were coated with platinum at 45 °C and carbon at 90 °C under the conditions described by the manufacturer. Replicas were cleaned in bleach, washed in distilled water, and observed in a Philips EM400 microscope at 80 kV. Representative series of images of P-face fractures were enlarged at 95,000× final magnification in order to determine the number of intramembrane particles (IMP) in known areas as described by Zampighi et al. (26Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Lodd D.D. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Some images were amplified by 800,000 to estimate the size of the particles according to Eskandary et al. (27Eskandari S. Wright M.E. Kreman M. Starace M.D. Zampighi A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Using two primers located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the previously reported cDNA clone HUT11 (11Promeneur D. Rousselet G. Bankir L. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tran M.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a RT-PCR reaction, a new cDNA clone called HUT11A was isolated from human reticulocyte RNAs. Comparison of HUT11 and HUT11A cDNA sequences, showed that both clones derived from a JK*A allele (G838) but differed in two ways: (i) an A130G transition resulting in a Lys44 → Glu substitution, and (ii) a hexanucleotide (GTG GGA) deletion in HUT11A that leads to a Val-Gly dipeptide deletion after the Pro-227 (Fig.1). Because of this deletion, HUT11A encoded a polypeptide chain of 389 amino acids versus 391 for HUT11. Sequence alignments of several urea transporters indicated that only HUT11 contained an additional Val-Gly dipeptide (Fig. 1), which is located within the third external loop and is in close proximity of the N-glycosylation site (Asn-211). Since the initially reported HUT11 clone was derived from a human bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH, catalog HL 1058b, lot 1911), constructed from RNAs isolated from a single adult individual, we developed a hemi-nested PCR assay on genomic DNA to determine whether the repeat of 2 or 3 Val-Gly motifs is a common polymorphism in the human population. Accordingly, a hemi-nested PCR was carried out on the genomic DNA from 126 unrelated blood donors of different Jk phenotypes to amplify a 63/69-bp fragment encompassing the sequence encoding the repeated dipeptides, and the PCR product was digested by BglII. Analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel revealed only the 36-bp fragment, which encodes the variant with two Val-Gly dipeptide repeats (Fig.2 A). The 42-bp fragment encoding a 3 Val-Gly repeat was obtained only in the HUT11 cDNA control. These data show that the presence of 2 or 3 Val-Gly motifs is not allelic and that the JK locus only encodes 2 Val-Gly motifs. Allele-specific PCR analysis also indicated that the Lys44 → Glu polymorphism was not allelic to theJK locus (data not shown). To further confirm these results, Kidd/urea transporter transcripts (bone marrow poly(A+) RNA and two total RNA reticulocyte preparations) were analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay using a labeled antisense RNA probe (ASP-1) encoding 3 Val-Gly repeats (Fig.2 B). With cRNA encoding the 3Val-Gly, a protected RNA fragment of 406 bp was obtained. Due to the non-complementary 6-nucleotide stretch, two protected fragments of 261 and 139 bp were obtained with a cRNA encoding the 2Val-Gly repeat as a template. With poly(A+) RNA as well as total RNAs from unrelated individuals, only hybridization signals of 261 and 139 nt were detected, which indicated that the JK transcripts have a nucleotide sequence that encoded a polypeptide carrying only 2 Val-Gly motifs. Our extensive analysis of genomic DNAs and RNAs from several individuals thus indicated that the physiological urea transporter was encoded by the sequence found in clone HUT11A and not, as initially reported (6Olivès B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in clone HUT11. To analyze the functional features of HUT11 (Lys44/3Val-Gly) and HUT11A (Glu44/2Val-Gly), 40 ng of cRNAs encoding these proteins were injected intoXenopus oocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis using affinity-purified anti-N-terminal antibodies (7Olivès B. Mattei M.-G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J.-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15607-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Olives B. Bailly P. Fischer E. Ripoche P. Ronco P. Cartron J.-P. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that both proteins were expressed at the plasma membrane of oocytes, which rendered these cells suitable for functional analysis (Fig.3 A). Nevertheless, for the same amount of cRNA injected, the HUT11A signal at the oocyte plasma membrane was clearly stronger than the HUT11 signal. Water-injected controls were not stained, showing the specificity of the antibody labeling (Fig. 3 A). Next, the time course of urea uptake by HUT11 and HUT11A expressingXenopus oocytes was explored (Fig. 3 B). HUT11 and HUT11A expressing oocytes showed a rapid initial urea uptake that was 15 and 45 times higher than in water-injected oocyte controls, respectively. The urea permeabilities (P urea) of HUT11- and HUT11A-injected oocytes, determined at 90 s, were, respectively, 15.7 ± 0.82 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 56) and 46.6 ± 1.86 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 72) versus1.02 ± 0.11 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 68) for water-injected oocytes (p < 0.001). Consequently, the plateau corresponding to the equilibration of urea was more rapidly reached with oocytes expressing HUT11A than with HUT11. These data suggest that both HUT11 and HUT11A function as efficient urea transporters. In all experiments, the raffinose permeability was not increased, which indicate that the plasma membrane integrity was intact (data not shown). Examination of the [14C]urea uptake also indicated that, for a given level of cRNA injected (40 ng), the urea transport activity was greater for HUT11A-injected oocytes than for HUT11-injected oocytes (Fig. 3 B). This could result from either a faster turnover of HUT11A with comparable levels of expression or a higher level of HUT11A with a comparable turnover. The latter hypothesis was most likely since immunostaining of the same oocytes clearly indicated a higher expression level of HUT11A as compared with HUT11 (Fig.3 A). To test whether HUT11A and HUT11 also confer water permeability, oocytes expressing these proteins were tested in a standard swelling assay. Surprisingly, oocytes expressing HUT11A swelled significantly faster than oocytes expressing AQP1, which was taken as a positive control (Fig. 3 C). As already reported (7Olivès B. Mattei M.-G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J.-P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15607-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), swelling of oocytes expressing HUT11 was not different from water-injected controls in these conditions. Urea transport analysis in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that the HUT11A-mediated urea flux was poorly inhibited by pCMBS, phloretin, and HgCl2 (Fig.4 A). However, as previously reported (6Olivès B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.-P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the HUT11-mediated urea flux was strongly inhibited by pCMBS (74%) and phloretin (85%) but only slightly inhibited by HgCl2 (30%). Incubation with inhibitors showed that the HUT11A-mediated osmotic water permeability (Pf) of about 150 μm/s was strongly inhibited by pCMBS and phloretin, but not by HgCl2 (Fig. 4 B). We speculated that the unusual properties of HUT11A as compared with HUT11 might have resulted from a difference in the expression level of the two transporters in oocytes (see above). To test this hypothesis, the urea and water transport and HUT11A plasma membrane expression levels were determined in oocytes injected with different amounts of HUT11A cRNA. As shown in Fig.5 A, the urea transport rate increased steadily with injections of between 0.005 and 0.05 ng of HUT11A cRNA and sustained at a plateau rate of about 20 pmol/90 s for oocytes injected with 0.05–40 ng of cRNA. Accordingly, the urea uptake between 10 and 360 s of oocytes injected with 0.05, 0.1, or 40 ng/oocyte HUT11A cRNA, was identical (Fig. 5 B). The corresponding urea permeabilities calculated at 10 s were 124 ± 11 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 20), 119 ± 12 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 20), and 133 ± 7 × 10−6 cm/s (n = 20), respectively, versus 1.6 ± 1 × 10−6cm/s (n = 25) for water-injected controls. In contrast, using oocytes from the same batch, a water permeability was detected only when at least 0.5 ng of HUT11A cRNA was injected and steadily increased up to 40 ng of cRNA per oocyte (Fig. 5 A). We next compared the effect of pharmacological inhibitors (pCMBS and phloretin, 1 mm) on the HUT11A-mediated urea transport in oocytes injected with small (0.1 ng) and large (40 ng) amounts of cRNA, since there was no difference in the urea permeability under these conditions (see Fig. 5). As shown from Fig.6 A, the urea flux mediated by oocytes injected with 0.1 ng of HUT11A cRNA was poorly inhibited by pCMBS (18%), but was strongly inhibited by phloretin (79%), thus partly exhibiting the properties of the urea transporter from human red cells (8Mayrand R.R. Levitt C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the amount of HUT11A cRNA injected was increased to 40 ng/oocyte, phloretin no longer inhibited the urea transport. To analyze the influence of small solutes (non-electrolytes) on the water movement across oocytes injected with low and high levels of HUT11A cRNA, the initial rates of swelling, between t = 0 and t = 240 s, were measured in an iso-osmotic solution containing 160 mm small solutes adjusted to 200 mosm with diluted Barth solution (Fig. 6 B). Oocytes injected with 20 ng of HUT11"

In the bacteriumEscherichia coli there are 14 DNA exonucleases including exonucleases I-IX (including the two DNA polymerase I exonucleases), RecJ exonuclease, SbcCD exonuclease, RNase T, and the exonuclease domains of DNA polymerase II and III. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a new E. coli exonuclease, exonuclease X.

Exonuclease X is a potent distributive exonuclease, capable of degrading both single-stranded and duplex DNA with 3′-5′ polarity. Its high affinity for single-strand DNA and its rapid catalytic rate are similar to the processive exonucleases RecJ and exonuclease I. Deletion of the exoX gene exacerbated the UV sensitivity of a strain lacking RecJ, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII. When overexpressed, exonuclease X is capable of substituting for exonuclease I in UV repair.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) have helped define a large family of proteins that share sequence homology with the 3′-5′ exodeoxyribonuclease domain of DNA polymerases. The ε proofreading subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III, encoded by dnaQ, is the archetypal member of this family. Other family members include the bacterial proteins RNase T, RNase D, exonuclease I (ExoI),1 oligoribonuclease (3Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAN2 protein, and the human Werner syndrome protein (WRN) (1Koonin E.V. Curr.

These proteins share a conserved tripartite set of “Exo” motifs containing negatively charged aspartate and glutamate residues (5Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M.

These hallmark residues can be visualized in the crystal structure of the Klenow (proofreading) subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase I to coordinate two divalent cations that catalyze DNA phosphodiester bond cleavage (6Freemont P.S.

Comparison of the crystal structures of the Klenow fragment and bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase suggests that the Exo motifs are diagnostic of functional conservation, since both proteins share the same active site structure despite the lack of sequence identity outside of the Exo motifs (2Moser M.J.

Presumably, other proteins that share these motifs adopt a catalytic site structure and mechanism of action similar to the polymerase exonuclease domain. It has recently been demonstrated that the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) has a 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease activity (11Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat.

WRN possesses a weak exonuclease activity with specificity for the 3′-ending recessed strand of a partial DNA duplex but is unable to degrade single-strand DNA alone (12Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.C.

We recently reported that RNase T of E. coli, previously described as a 3′-5′ ribonuclease (19Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also possessed a potent 3′ to 5′ distributive single-strand (ss) DNA-specific exonuclease activity (22Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, RNase T was capable of complementing DNA repair defects caused by a deficiency in E. coli Exo I. Unlike exonucleases associated with DNA polymerase, which can degrade from the 3′ end of double-strand (ds) DNA molecules, RNase T had no activity on dsDNA substrates (22Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Clearly, the architecture of proteins within the DnaQ superfamily allows for different modalities of function, since the same active site configuration can be used to accommodate various substrates (ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA) while retaining the 3′-5′ polarity of degradation. In addition to the bacterial members of the DnaQ superfamily listed above is an open reading frame of unknown function designatedyobC (also known as o220 and b1844) at 41.5 min on theE. coli chromosome. We have cloned, overexpressed, and characterized the protein product of this gene. Overexpression of this gene concomitantly induces high levels of a DNase activity on both ssDNA and dsDNA. We have renamed this open reading frameexoX and the native 25-kDa protein product exonuclease X (ExoX). We have purified a (His)6-ExoX fusion protein to homogeneity and characterized its nuclease activity on various DNA substrates. ExoX is an extremely potent 3′ to 5′ distributive nuclease capable of degrading 40-kilobase bacteriophage T7 ssDNA and dsDNA to completion. Its affinity for ssDNA ends is greater than for dsDNA, and it appears to have no affinity for RNA. When overexpressed, ExoX, like RNase T (23Viswanathan M. Lanjuin A. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 929-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is capable of substituting for ExoI in vivo, as measured by its ability to increase the UV survival of an ExoI-deficient strain. A mutation in exoX did not by itself cause sensitivity to UV but strongly augmented the UV sensitivity of a strain deficient in ssDNA exonucleases RecJ, ExoI, and ExoVII. The exoX gene was amplified by PCR usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene Inc.) from wild type E. coli strain MG1655 genomic DNA using primers 5′-CGGAATTCTAAGGAGGGATCCATGTTGCGCATTATC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAAGTATTTTCCAG-3′ and buffer conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Primers were annealed to the genomic DNA at 50 °C for 30 s and extended for 2 min at 72 °C; 25 cycles of PCR were performed. The PCR product was subsequently digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XbaI and ligated into the compatible sites of pBSSK− (Stratagene Inc.), producing pExoX. Sequence analysis verified the construct was error-free. The EcoRI-XbaI fragment from pExoX was cloned into compatible sites within pBSKS− (Stratagene Inc.) creating pExoXKS−. Plasmid pExoXfs, a derivative of pExoXKS− with a frameshift mutation 171 base pairs downstream from the initiation codon of exoX, was constructed by cleavage of pExoXKS− DNA with restriction endonuclease NcoI, “fill-in” synthesis with Klenow fragment (DNA polymerase I), and blunt end DNA ligation. AnexoX (His)6-tagged gene fusion was constructed by cloning the 693-base pair BamHI-SacI fragment of pExoX into the same sites within pET28a(+) (Novogen), producing the plasmid pExoX-His. A 2,919-base pair region of the E. coli chromosome containing the exoX gene was amplified by PCR using primers beginning 1,088 base pairs upstream (5′-GGGAATTCGTACCCGTATGCGTGATG-3′) and 1,167 base pairs downstream (5′-GGTCTAGACGAGGATCATCAATTCCGG-3′) ofexoX. The PCR was performed using Turbo Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, Inc.) in buffer conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Primers were annealed to MG1655 E. coligenomic DNA at 60 °C for 30 s and extended for 3 min at 72 °C; 25 cycles of PCR were performed. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and EcoRI and ligated into compatible sites within the Litmus 29 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.), creating the plasmid pExoXFlank. A precise deletion of the exoX open reading frame from the plasmid pExoXFlank was performed by PCR. The primers utilized for the PCR flanked exoX and were oriented to replicate the entire plasmid except for the exoX open reading frame. Both primers; 5′-GGGGGCGGCCGCGGCATGCTCCAGGCCG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGCGGCCGCTCCGCAGGCGTAGCGGG-3′ contained NotI sites at the primer 5′ terminus. The PCR was performed as above except that primer annealing was at 45 °C, and extensions were performed for 6 min. The resulting 5-kb PCR product was treated withDpnI to remove any original methylated template DNA and then digested with NotI and ligated to a 2.1-kb NotI fragment from plasmid pCK155 (24Kristensen C.S.

Flanking npt on both sides are 140-base pair resolution sites from the broad host range plasmid RP4 multimer resolution system, which allows for the precise excision of npt (24Kristensen C.S. Eberl L. Sanchez-Romero J.M. Givskov M. Molin S. De Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 52-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligation was transformed by electroporation into XL1-Blue (Stratagene Inc.) cells selecting kanamycin-resistance. The resulting plasmid pExoXΔ had a complete deletion of exoX and a 2.1-kilobase insertion as verified by restriction analysis. STL2350 (xonA2 recJ284::Tn10 Δ(xseA-guaB) zff-3139::Tn10kan) was used for ExoX protein expression. Plasmid pTJH30 (25Haggerty T.J. Lovett S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6705-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carrying a heat shock-inducible T7 RNA polymerase, was introduced into STL2350 by transformation (26Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) and selection for chloramphenicol resistance. For protein-labeling experiments pExoX or pBSSK− were transformed into STL2350/pTJH30 cells selecting ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance. Strain STL4239 is the pTJH30/pExoX transformant of STL2350. STL2329 (λDE3 sbcB15 recJ284::Tn10 endA Δ(xth-pncA)gal thi) (27Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol.

Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar), were used to express and purify a NH2-(His)6-tagged ExoX fusion protein expressed from plasmid pExoX-His. For protein-labeling experiments, pExoX-His or pET28a(+) were transformed into STL2329, selecting kanamycin resistance. pExoXΔ was transformed into the E. coli strain JC7623 (28Horii Z. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (recB recC sbcB sbcC) by electroporation and grown nonselectively overnight. Kanamycin-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive isolates were analyzed by Southern blot (29Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21462) Google Scholar) and were found to have the appropriate deletion/insertion at the exoX locus. One such isolate, STL4525 (ΔexoX1::npt recB recC sbcB sbcC), was used as a donor for further strain constructions by P1virA-mediated transductions (Ref. 30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1992: 268-274Google Scholar and see below). With the exception of STL2329 and STL4525, all strains designated STL were derived from BT199 and carry additional genetic markers (F− λ− thi-1 Δ(gpt-proA)62thr-1 leuB6 kdgK51 rfbD1 ara-14 lacY1 galK2 xyl-5 mtl-1 tsx-33 supE44 rpsL31 rac −). pExoXKS, pExoXfs, and pBSKS− were transformed (26Chung C.T.

In addition, various isogenic exonuclease-deficient mutants in the BT199 genetic background (listed in Fig. 7) were assayed for UV survival. The mutant alleles used in the construction of the various exonuclease-deficient strains were: ΔexoX1::npt, for ExoX; ΔxonA300::cat, for ExoI;recJ284::Tn10 for RecJ; andxseA18::amp for ExoVII. Details of the construction of these strains will be published elsewhere and are available by request from the authors. Single colonies were grown in LB or LB + ampicillin (for strains containing plasmids) liquid medium to exponential stage (A 600 = 0.4–0.5), serially diluted in 56/2 buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmKH2PO4, 0.02% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.5 μmFeSO4), and plated on LB or LB + ampicillin plates. Plates were immediately irradiated with varying doses of UV (254 nm) irradiation and incubated at 37 °C in the dark overnight. Total viable cells were determined from serial-diluted unirradiated cells. ExoX protein expression was induced from the T7 φ10 promoter of pExoX by 42 °C heat shock induction of the T7 RNA polymerase gene on plasmid pTJH30. T7 promoter-mediated expression of the (His)6-ExoX fusion protein from plasmid pExoX-His was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) to STL4337 (pExoX-His transformant of STL2329). Culture growth, [35S]methionine protein labeling in the presence of rifampicin and crude extract preparations for both proteins were performed as described previously (25Haggerty T.J. Lovett S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6705-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar) with standard reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. All proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie stain and/or autoradiography. All steps were performed at 4 °C using ultrapure reagents. Buffer A contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer B contained 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Buffer C contained 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). STL4533 (pExoX-His transformant of BL21) was cultured at 37 °C in 34 liters of LB + Km to anA 600 of 0.6, then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Cells were harvested and frozen as described previously (33Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) in a volume of 700 ml. A crude extract was prepared by lysing cells in 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h on ice. Three cycles of freeze/thawing (10 min 37 °C, 10 min 0 °C) were performed before a supernatant was obtained by high speed centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 20 min. The crude extract (700 ml, 1.8 g of protein) was adjusted to 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole before adding 15 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in Buffer A. The resin and extract slurry was allowed to mix for 8 h with stirring at 4 °C. The resin was washed by repeated low speed centrifugation and resuspension in 175 ml of Buffer A, 85 ml of Buffer B, and finally with 50 ml of Buffer C + 200 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the resin with 35 ml of Buffer C + 500 mm NaCl + 400 mm imidazole. The resulting fraction (6.0 mg of protein) was concentrated to 10 ml using a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) cartridge and then dialyzed against 2 1-liter changes of Buffer C. This fraction was then applied to a 0.5-ml dsDNA cellulose column equilibrated in Buffer C + 25 mm NaCl and washed with 10 ml of Buffer C. Bound proteins were eluted in a single step to Buffer C + 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing nuclease activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 0.5 liters of 60% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, and then again against 60% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. The purified protein (0.75 mg at 0.41 mg/ml) was stored at −20 °C. Uniformly labeled bacteriophage T7 [3H]DNA with a specific activity of 2.5 × 104 cpm/nmol of nucleotide was prepared as described previously (33Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) using [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products). 3′ end-labeled substrate was generated by Klenow fragment fill-in synthesis ofHindIII-digested pBSSK− DNA with [32P]dATP. 5′ end-labeled substrate was generated fromHindIII-digested pBSSK− DNA, treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Both 3′ and 5′ end-labeled substrates were purified by G-50 Sephadex quick spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Unless otherwise stated, enzyme assays employed 0.5 μg of T7 [3H]DNA (1.5 nmol) or 0.5 μg (0.5 pmol of ends) of 3′ or 5′ end-labeled substrate. For ssDNA assays, substrates were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C then quenched on ice. Standard reactions contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA in 50 μl (for T7 substrates) or 30 μl (for end-labeled substrates). Competition assays were performed with 50 ng (50 fmol) of 3′ end-labeled substrate, varying the amount of either single-strand or double-strand cold competitor DNA. Competition experiments using RNA competitors utilized E. coli tRNA XXI (Sigma) and Torula yeast RNA (molecular mass range 3 × 103–4 × 104 g/mol, Sigma). Both RNAs are used by Sigma as ribonuclease assay substrates. Cold RNA stocks were prepared before each competition experiment in cold sterile water. TheA 260 of the RNA stocks was determined immediately before use to verify the optical density provided by the manufacturer and to ensure that noticeable degradation had not occurred. When required, protein samples were diluted in a buffer containing 60% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Sample incubation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and soluble count determination were performed as described previously (34Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of DNase activity with T7 DNA substrate corresponds to the release of 1 nmol of acid-soluble product in a 20-min reaction at 37 °C. For agarose gel electrophoresis assays, 0.5 μg (0.5 pmol) of either 3′ or 5′ 32P end-labeled ssDNA substrate was incubated with various amounts of (His)6-ExoX protein. Reactions were quenched at various time points on ice by the addition of EDTA to 5.0 mm. Standard assay conditions were employed, except that BSA was omitted to allow DNA electrophoresis without further manipulation of the samples after the reactions were quenched. ssDNA substrate samples were boiled for 5 min and cooled on ice before loading onto a 1.0% agarose-NA gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); double-strand substrates were loaded directly onto the gels. Gels were run at 80 V for 45 min in Tris acetate + EDTA buffer (32Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), dried at 80 °C for 30 min, and exposed to film. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lysozyme was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. The antibiotics ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were used at 100, 60, and 15 μg/ml, respectively. The E. coli open reading frame designated yobC, hereafter known as exoX, was amplified by PCR and cloned directionally into pBSSK−, placing its expression under T7 promoter control. Induction ofexoX expression from the T7 promoter of pExoX led to the production of a single 25-kDa protein, consistent with the expected molecular mass of the protein (Fig.1 A, lane 4). The 25-kDa protein was absent in uninduced extracts (Fig. 1 A,lane 3) and from cells carrying vector only (Fig.1 A, lane 2). Crude extracts prepared from these induced cells were tested for DNase activity using uniformly3H-labeled T7 DNA substrates. Strains induced for expression of exoX exhibited a 150-fold increase in ssDNase activity and a 280-fold increase in dsDNase activity compared with cells carrying vector alone (Table I). Both ssDNase and dsDNase activities were Mg2+-dependent, as no increase in activity was noted in the absence of the divalent cation (data not shown).Table IMg2+-dependent DNase activity associated with ExoX or (His)6-ExoX overexpressionPlasmidSpecific activityssDNAdsDNAUnits/mgpBSSK−5010pExoX76002800pET28a(+)11020pExoX-His52003400Nuclease assays were performed using crude extracts prepared from cells carrying the indicated plasmids. Cells were induced for protein expression 20 min before assay. Assays were performed in the presence of Mg2+ using both single-strand and double-strand T7 [3H]DNA substrates. One unit of DNase corresponds to the release of 1 nmol of acid-soluble product in a 20-min reaction at 37 °C. Results are the average of two determinations. Open table in a new tab Nuclease assays were performed using crude extracts prepared from cells carrying the indicated plasmids. Cells were induced for protein expression 20 min before assay.

One unit of DNase corresponds to the release of 1 nmol of acid-soluble product in a 20-min reaction at 37 °C. Results are the average of two determinations. An N-terminal (His)6-tagged ExoX protein fusion was constructed using the pET28a(+) vector (Novogen). (His)6-ExoX protein was expressed from the T7 promoter on plasmid pExoX-His (Fig. 1 A). Crude extracts prepared from induced cells carrying pExoX-His were tested for DNase activity. Strains induced for expression of (His)6-ExoX exhibited a 47-fold increase in ssDNase activity and a 170-fold increase in dsDNase activity compared with cells carrying vector alone (Table I). Comparison of uninduced levels of expression between the pET28a(+) vector and pExoX-His revealed a basal level of expression of the (His)6 fusion protein without induction of the T7 promoter. Upon induction, increased expression of two [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was noted. The identity of the second band is unknown; however, it did not appear (Fig.1 A, lane 4) when the native protein was expressed in a different strain background. The (His)6-ExoX protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 and was purified using nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1 B). Three high molecular weight contaminants and a lower molecular weight protein were removed by dsDNA cellulose affinity chromatography. The identity of the abundant lower molecular weight band is not known; however, it may be a proteolytic product of the (His)6-ExoX protein, since it bound to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin yet failed to bind dsDNA cellulose affinity column. Furthermore, the protein that bound to the dsDNA cellulose column had significant nuclease activity, whereas the flow-through fraction from the dsDNA cellulose column containing the lower molecular weight protein had nearly none. The purified protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry and was determined to have a molecular mass of 28,552 mass units. The molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry is commensurate with the expected mass of the fusion protein by amino acid sequence. Purified (His)6-ExoX was used to determine optimal conditions for ssDNase activity. ExoX showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig.2 A). Similar to other nucleases, the ssDNase activity of ExoX was dependent upon the presence of the divalent cation Mg2+; no detectable degradation was seen in its absence or in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig.2 B). BSA enhanced the ssDNase activity of ExoX (Fig.2 C). The ssDNase activity of ExoX was enhanced with low salt concentrations, but above 5 mm salt, the activity decreased with increasing concentration (Fig. 2 D). The addition of the sulfhydryl reducing agent, DTT (1–5 mm), did not alter levels of ssDNase activity (data not shown). In reactions with denatured bacteriophage T7 DNA (40 kb in length), 1 ng (34 fmol) of purified (His)6-ExoX linearly degraded 35% of the total DNA (0.5 μg, 1.5 nmol in nucleotides) in 20 min. The addition of 10 ng of protein resulted in 100% of the ssDNA substrate being degraded (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, in reactions with T7 dsDNA, 5 ng (0.17 pmol) of purified (His)6-ExoX linearly degraded 30% of the total DNA in 20 min, and the addition of 40 ng (1.4 pmol) of (His)6-ExoX resulted in 100% of the dsDNA substrate being degraded (Fig.3 B). Using data points in the linear range of T7 DNA degradation from Fig. 3, the calculated rate of nucleotide release/protein monomer is 800 nucleotide/min for ssDNA, and 150 nucleotides/min for dsDNA. From its ability to degrade T7 DNA completely, we conclude that ExoX has little or no specificity for DNA sequence or structure. No endonuclease activity was observed in reactions with φX174 circular ssDNA, supercoiled dsDNA, or relaxed dsDNA, suggesting that"

To investigate the role of phosphorylation at these sites, antibodies were generated against phosphopeptides analogous to the sequences around Ser759 and Ser789. Affinity-purified antibodies were phosho- and sequence-specific. The major site of phosphorylation in h-CaD in porcine carotid arterial muscle strips was at Ser789; however, the amount of phosphate did not vary appreciably with either KCl or phorbol ester stimulation. Phosphorylation at Ser759 of h-CaD was almost undetectable (<0.005 mol of phosphate/mol of protein). Moreover, phosphorylation of the low molecular mass isoform of the protein (l-CaD) at the site analogous to Ser789 was greater in serum-stimulated cultured smooth muscle cells than in serum-starved cells. Serum-stimulated l-CaD phosphorylation was attenuated by the protein kinase inhibitor PD98059. These data 1) identify Ser789 of h-CaD as the major site of ERK-dependent phosphorylation in carotid arteries; 2) show that the level of phosphorylation at Ser789 is relatively constant following carotid arterial muscle stimulation, despite an increase in total protein phosphate content; and 3) suggest a functional role for ERK-dependent l-CaD phosphorylation in cell division.

Yano H. Hashida T. Takeuchi R. Takeda O. Asada K. Takahashi E. Kato I. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12122-12126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Marston S.B.

In an attempt to identify a switch that may regulate caldesmon function in tissue, we previously showed that the protein is phosphorylated in resting smooth muscle and that the level of phosphorylation increases with muscle stimulation by many chemical agents, including phorbol esters, endothelin-1, histamine, and okadaic acid, and by depolarization with KCl (4Adam L.P. Haeberle J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of phosphopeptides generated from h-CaD purified from32P-labeled arterial smooth muscle led to the identification of at least two sites of phosphorylation, Ser759 and Ser789 (5Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), based on the numbering of the mammalian sequence (6Humphrey M. Herrera-Sosa H. Gonzalez G. Lee R. Bryan J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 112: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), both in the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The site at Ser759 is conserved in gizzard h-CaD (equivalent to Ser702); however, the site at Ser789 is absent from the gizzard protein. Although not all of the phosphate in h-CaD could be accounted for by these two serine residues, it was later found that the both sites were capable of being phosphorylated in vitro by the 44- and 42-kDa isoforms of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1 and ERK2, respectively) (7Adam L.P. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both sites are phosphorylated to the same extent by ERK1 in vitro; however, the relative amounts of phosphate in the two sites in intact tissue and the modulation of phosphate content in the two sites during muscle contraction are unknown. l-CaD lacks a central helical domain present in h-CaD, but nevertheless possesses phosphorylation sites equivalent to Ser759 and Ser789 in its carboxyl terminus. l-CaD is known to be phosphorylated in cultured cells during mitosis (8Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), where the responsible kinase is thought to be the 34-kDa protein p34cdc2. Although phosphorylated during mitosis, l-CaD may be phosphorylated at other transition checkpoints in the cell cycle. There are no studies that have reported on this possibility. In addition, the specific sites of l-CaD phosphorylation in cells are unknown. To better assess the relative phosphorylation of h-CaD at these two ERK sites in intact tissue and to address the question of l-CaD phosphorylation in cultured cells during cell cycle progression, antibodies were generated that specifically recognize the two ERK-dependent phosphopeptide sequences in mammalian h-CaD. The usefulness of these antibodies is demonstrated by monitoring phosphorylation (immunoreactivity) during muscle stimulation and cultured smooth muscle cell proliferation. We find that the major site of phosphorylation in resting smooth muscle is at Ser789, the site unique to mammalian CaD. Phosphorylation at this site is not significantly altered during muscle stimulation, suggesting that ERK-dependent h-CaD phosphorylation does not play a significant role in contractile regulation, in contrast to earlier suggestions by our laboratory (17Adam L.P. Franklin M.T. Raff G.J. Hathaway D.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 183-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation at the equivalent site in l-CaD is dynamically regulated by ERKs during proliferation of cultured smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role in cell division. Most chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and 125I-protein A were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Phosphocellulose (P-81) paper was from Whatman, and nitrocellulose was from Hoefer Scientific Instruments. Porcine carotid arteries were transported from the slaughterhouse in an ice-cold physiological saline solution (PSS) that consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.6 mmCaCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 5.6 mmglucose, and 2 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Arteries were dissected free of fat and connective tissue and either used immediately or stored overnight at 4 °C in fresh PSS before use. Strips of artery 5 mm in width were dissected; the endothelium was gently rubbed off; and the muscle strip was attached to a force transducer (Grass Instrument Co.) for the measurement of tension at 37 °C in PSS. Experimental solutions consisted of either PSS with (i) the addition of either phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; 1 μm) or okadaic acid (50 μm) or (ii) the replacement of KCl for NaCl to give a final KCl concentration of 110 mm (KPSS). Contractile responses were terminated by quick-freezing the tissue with liquid N2-cooled tongs after either 60 min (PDBu and okadaic acid) or 30 min (KPSS) of stimulation. Porcine carotid arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured from explants taken from the medial sections of the arteries. The cells were maintained in culture for <10 passages in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics penicillin G, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three types of polyclonal antibodies were used in the study. First, rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against full-length porcine stomach h-CaD (α-CaD). Second, affinity-purified antibodies generated against the phosphopeptide PDGNKS(PO4)PAPKPGC, a sequence based on Ser759 of mammalian h-CaD (equivalent to Ser702of gizzard h-CaD), were prepared as described previously (10Franklin M.T. Wang C.-L.A. Adam L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1819-C1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, antibodies were generated against the phosphopeptide CQSVDKVTS(PO4)PTKV, a sequence that is analogous to Ser789 of mammalian h-CaD (6Humphrey M. Herrera-Sosa H. Gonzalez G. Lee R. Bryan J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 112: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and absent from avian h-CaD. Briefly, the phosphopeptide was synthesized, coupled via the cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemacyanin usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce), and injected into rabbits, and at appropriate times, serum was collected. Antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the peptide/protein were purified by a combination of (i) ammonium sulfate precipitation, (ii) passage over a column of the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide, and (iii) passage of the flow-through from Step ii over a column of the phosphopeptide. Frozen arterial muscle strips were ground to a fine powder under liquid N2, and proteins were extracted into sample buffer containing 3% SDS and heated for 10 min in a boiling water bath. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were incubated overnight with an appropriate dilution (empirically derived) of antibody, washed, incubated with 125I-protein A, and then washed again. Antibody binding was detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a γ-counter. For all experiments, tissue samples were run in triplicate under identical loading conditions for each replicate to permit a comparison of anti-phosphopeptide antibody binding, either at Ser759 or Ser789, with α-CaD antibody binding. Because of the possibility of caldesmon dephosphorylation during protein extraction and gel electrophoresis, additional confirmatory studies were performed as follows. Proteins in the finely ground tissue powder were denatured by the addition of dry ice-cooled acetone containing 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mmdithiothreitol. The tissue homogenate was then allowed to come to room temperature, washed with acetone/dithiothreitol to remove the acid, and lyophilized. SDS-containing sample buffer was added to the lyophilized tissue, and immunoblotting procedures were continued as described above. Results obtained using this alternative procedure were not different from those using the procedure described above. Recombinant ERK1 was prepared using a baculovirus expression system (10Franklin M.T. Wang C.-L.A. Adam L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1819-C1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was activated by incubation with a recombinant, constitutively active mutant of GST-MEK1 (an isoform ofMAP kinase and ERK kinase). h-CaD was purified from either porcine stomach or chicken gizzard smooth muscle according to Bretscher (11Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant catalytic subunit of PP1 was generously donated by Dr. Anna DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University). Purified myosin regulatory light chains (LC20), used in determining ATP-specific activity, were generously supplied by Dr. Renne Lu (Boston Biomedical Research Institute) and were phosphorylated by gizzard myosin light chain kinase in the presence of calcium and calmodulin (purified from bovine testicles). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Actin and tropomyosin were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and chicken gizzards, respectively, according to methods we have used previously (12Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified h-CaD was phosphorylatedin vitro using empirically derived amounts of recombinant ERK1 and GST-MEK1. Two phosphorylation reactions were run in parallel: one contained [γ-32P]ATP, and the other contained nonradioactive ATP. The reaction mixture containing radioactivity was used to determine the level of h-CaD phosphorylation by dividing the specific activity of the protein (cpm/mol h-CaD) by the ATP-specific activity (determined as described in Ref. 4Adam L.P. Haeberle J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were terminated either by boiling or by the addition of gel loading buffer containing 3% SDS. Heat-denatured proteins were sedimented by centrifugation, and CaD was separated from reaction constituents and concentrated by a combination of P-11 or DEAE column chromatography and dialysis against a storage buffer consisting of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the “back-phosphorylation” experiments, proteins were extracted from frozen ground porcine carotid arteries into a buffer consisting of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was rapidly heated to denature most proteins and clarified by centrifugation. ERK1, GST-MEK1, and ATP (0.25 mm) were added to half of the extract, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. As a control, the other half of the tissue extract was incubated under the same conditions in the presence of added ATP, but without the addition of ERK1 and GST-MEK1. Acid-denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and lyophilized. Gel sample buffer containing 3% SDS was added, and Western blots were generated, in triplicate, for the subsequent assessment of antibody binding to caldesmon. The carboxyl-terminal h-CaD sequences containing the two ERK-dependent phosphorylation sites at Ser759and Ser789 are shown in Fig.1. Whereas the peptide sequence surrounding Ser759 (Ser(P)759) is common to both avian and mammalian CaD, the sequence surrounding Ser789 (Ser(P)789) is unique to mammalian CaD. In mammals, Ser(P)759 and Ser(P)789 are identical in human, porcine, canine, and rat CaD. Antibodies against Ser(P)759 and Ser(P)789 were generated in rabbits and affinity-purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2 A, anti-phospho-Ser759 (α-Ser(P)759) antibodies did not bind to purified porcine stomach h-CaD on Western blots, but did bind to h-CaD that was phosphorylated with ERK1. Conversely, anti-phospho-Ser789 (α-Ser(P)789) antibodies exhibited some binding to purified h-CaD, and this binding was markedly enhanced with ERK1-dependent phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). The addition of alkaline phosphatase to purified h-CaD resulted in a loss of basal α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that some phosphate is contained in Ser789. These data are consistent with previously reported observations that purified h-CaD contains covalently bound phosphate (7Adam L.P. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Treatment with alkaline phosphatase was not found to artifactually destroy the α-Ser(P)789 antibody-binding epitope since antibody binding was recovered after subsequent phosphorylation with ERK1. Collectively, these data show that the two sets of polyclonal antibodies are specific for the phosphorylated form of CaD.Figure 2Anti-phosphopeptide antibody binding to purified caldesmon in vitro. In A, immunoblots are shown depicting the binding of affinity-purified antibodies generated against Ser(P)759(α-PSer 759) to either purified porcine stomach h-CaD (CaD) or h-CaD that was phosphorylated with recombinant ERK1 (P-CaD). B shows immunoblots of α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding to purified porcine stomach h-CaD (CaD), h-CaD treated with alkaline phosphatase (dephos-CaD), or dephosphorylated h-Cad subsequently phosphorylated with ERK1 (P-CaD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the data of Fig. 2 show specificity for phosphorylatedversus unphosphorylated h-CaD, the utility of the antibodies requires that they also be site-specific. To determine site specificity of antibody binding, two different approaches were chosen. First, we took advantage of the differences in the sequences at the carboxyl terminus of mammalian and avian caldesmon. α-Ser(P)789antibodies did not bind to ERK1-phosphorylated avian h-CaD since it does not contain the sequence analogous to the Ser(P)789peptide (Fig. 3), thus demonstrating that the α-Ser(P)789 antibodies do not recognize the alternate ERK1 phosphorylation site or any other site in avian h-CaD that may be phosphorylated by ERK1. Because α-Ser(P)759 antibodies did not bind to purified gizzard h-CaD, the data also demonstrate that the purified protein does not contain phosphate in Ser702, the site analogous to mammalian Ser759 after purification. Second, we used the two phosphopeptides against which the antibodies were generated to competitively antagonize antibody binding to ERK1-phosphorylated h-CaD on Western blots. Antibody binding to phosphorylated h-CaD was completely inhibited only with the phosphopeptide (0.5 mg/ml) against which the antibody was generated (Fig. 4). Although not shown, α-Ser(P)759 and α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding was not inhibited by the unphosphorylated peptides.Figure 4Phosphopeptide competition of antibody binding to ERK1-phosphorylated caldesmon. Purified porcine stomach h-CaD was phosphorylated with ERK1, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Antibody binding using either α-Ser(P)759(α-PSer 759) or α-Ser(P)789(α-PSer 789) was then performed in the presence or absence of a 0.5 mg/ml concentration of the phosphopeptide Ser(P)759 or Ser(P)789. Only the phosphopeptide against which a given antibody was generated completely inhibited the binding of that antibody to recombinant ERK1-phosphorylated h-CaD (P-CaD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously reported results from sequencing experiments showed that both Ser759 and Ser789 of h-CaD contained phosphate when the protein was extracted from arterial muscle (5Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These experiments did not seek to determine the amount of phosphate incorporated into each of the two sites and at which site, if either, there was a modulation of phosphate content during muscle stimulation. We addressed these questions using the phosphopeptide antibodies characterized above. The binding of α-Ser(P)789antibodies to h-CaD on Western blots generated from whole tissue extracts was easily detectable, whereas the binding of α-Ser(P)759 antibodies was very difficult to detect (Fig.5). By comparing the ratio of anti-phosphopeptide antibody binding in one set of Western blots to caldesmon content (α-CaD antibody binding) in a duplicate set of Western blots, we did not detect a change in the amount of phosphate in Ser789 of h-CaD with KCl stimulation of the muscle for 30 min. To maximize the possibility of detecting phosphate in Ser759, we incubated the arteries in a bathing solution containing the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (50 μm, 60 min). Inexplicably, there were reductions in α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding to h-CaD of 42 and 61% in two muscles stimulated for 60 min with okadaic acid. However, it was only with muscle stimulation using okadaic acid that we were able to detect α-Ser(P)759 antibody binding to h-CaD in whole tissue extracts (Fig. 5). Although the α-Ser(P)759 antibodies are site- and phosphorylation-specific, it is apparent from the data of Fig. 5 that they bind to proteins other than CaD migrating near the 116- and 97-kDa molecular mass markers. Because the polyclonal antibodies generated against full-length CaD do not bind in this molecular mass region, these proteins are not proteolytic fragments of CaD. The identities of the proteins are unknown; however, α-Ser(P)759 antibody binding increased upon muscle stimulation with okadaic acid (Fig.5 C), suggesting the possibility that they may be phosphoproteins containing phosphopeptide sequences similar to those present in h-CaD. To determine if the phosphorylation levels in Ser759 or Ser789 are of a magnitude suggestive of a physiological role, we used the phospho-specific antibodies to quantitate the absolute level of phosphate in the two sites. This assessment was made by first determining the antibody binding ratios of α-Ser(P)789 or α-Ser(P)759 to α-CaD for h-CaD from control or PDBu-stimulated muscles. These ratios were compared with the antibody binding ratios for h-CaD phosphorylated by ERK1 in vitro, for which the level of phosphate in the two sites could be explicitly determined. In the experiment of Fig.6, purified h-CaD was phosphorylated to a level of 1.8 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in vitro. Approximately 50% of the phosphate incorporated into h-CaD was in each of the two sites, based on phosphopeptide map analyses of ERK1-phosphorylated h-CaD (data not shown). Therefore, ∼0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of protein was incorporated into each of the two sites (Ser759 and Ser789) in vitro. Using these values, for the specific experiment depicted in Fig. 6, the amount of phosphate in Ser789 was calculated to increase with PDBu stimulation from 0.27 to 0.32 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. In four separate experiments analyzed in this manner, the phosphate content in Ser789 was, on average, 0.24 ± 0.03 and 0.28 ± 0.04 mol of phosphate/mol of protein for h-CaD from control and PDBu-stimulated muscles, respectively. The phosphate content in Ser759 was always calculated to be <0.005 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Collectively, these data show that significant levels of phosphate are present in Ser789 of h-CaD and that these levels do not vary much with muscle stimulation by KCl or PDBu. Two possibilities could explain a lack of α-Ser(P)759antibody binding to caldesmon from tissue. The first is that the binding epitope for the antibody is destroyed during some phase in the manipulation of the tissue and the subsequent handling of the protein extracts. The second, more likely explanation is that there is a genuine differential in phosphorylation at the two sites in tissue. To address the first possibility, we performed a back-phosphorylation experiment in which caldesmon and other proteins were extracted from carotid arterial muscle tissue and subsequently phosphorylated with ERK1 in vitro (Fig. 7). As before, little to no binding was observed with α-Ser(P)759 antibodies in Western blots generated from control tissue extracts; however, binding was easily detectable in Western blots generated from the tissue extracts incubated with exogenous ERK1 and GST-MEK1. Phosphorylation at Ser789 also increased with ERK1 phosphorylation, demonstrating that caldesmon was not stoichiometrically phosphorylated in the original protein extract. These data provide more convincing evidence that the second possibility stated above is true, i.e. that phosphate levels in Ser759 are very low in tissue. To provide an explanation for the low level of phosphorylation at Ser759 in comparison with Ser789, we investigated the possibility that these sites may be subject to differential phosphatase or kinase regulation. The purified catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase type 1 catalyzed the dephosphorylation of Ser759, but not Ser789 (Fig.8 A). These data are consistent with the results of Fig. 5 since okadaic acid is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a. In addition, because CaD is bound to thin filaments in tissue, the possibility exists that one of the ERK phosphorylation sites is inaccessible to the kinase. In support of this possibility, actin and tropomyosin were found to inhibit ERK1-dependent phosphorylation of h-CaD at Ser759 more so than at Ser789 (Fig.8 B). There was no effect of tropomyosin alone on h-CaD phosphorylation, and there was no apparent difference between F- and G-actin in blocking ERK1-dependent phosphorylation at Ser789 (data not shown); however, tropomyosin did enhance the inhibition of ERK1-dependent h-CaD phosphorylation by either F- or G-actin. These results suggest the possibility of differential phosphatase and/or kinase regulation as a means for differential phosphate content in the two ERK1 phosphorylation sites of CaD in intact tissue. Although phosphorylation of l-CaD in cultured cells is known to occur in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (8Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the specific sites phosphorylated, the extent of phosphorylation, and the precise timing of phosphorylation in the cell cycle are unknown. To begin to address these questions, the phospho-specific antibodies were used to assess l-CaD phosphorylation at the sites analogous to Ser759 and Ser789 of h-CaD. Similar to results obtained with carotid arteries, there was little to no detectable α-Ser(P)759antibody binding to l-CaD from cultured porcine carotid arterial smooth muscle or A10 cells (data not shown); however, α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding was relatively easy to detect. The level of phosphate in the position analogous to Ser789 was much lower in l-CaD from serum-starved cells compared with l-CaD from cells in the exponential growth phase (Fig.9). This effect was also observed with cultured A10 cells (data not shown). Although l-CaD was first described as a phosphoprotein during mitosis, the level of phosphate in the Ser789-analogous sequence was not elevated in nocodazole-treated cells, known to arrest cells in mitosis, in comparison with exponentially growing cells (in which the majority of cells are not in mitosis) (Fig. 9 A). Furthermore, if cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then serum was added back for 1 h, there was an increase in α-Ser(P)789 antibody binding to a level greater than that with exponentially growing cells (Fig. 9 B). The relatively rapid increase in phosphorylation at this site upon serum stimulation was markedly inhibited (59%) by preincubation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm;n = 3). Although not shown, the addition of PD98059 (50 μm for 2 h) to exponentially growing cells inhibited phosphorylation by 30 and 41% in two additional experiments. There was no affect of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (25 μm) on l-CaD phosphorylation levels using the α-Ser(P)789 antibody. These results show that l-CaD is rapidly phosphorylated as cultured smooth muscle cells progress from serum-starved conditions into the cell cycle and not only during mitosis. h-CaD is hypothesized to be a contractile regulatory protein because of its abilities to bind to actin, tropomyosin, myosin, and calmodulin in vitro and to inhibit actin-activated myosin ATPase activity and its localization to thin filaments (2Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 3Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a mechanism for the potential regulation of contraction by h-CaD is unknown, and a definitive role for the protein in this functional process has been a point of debate. l-CaD is present in most cells, where it is hypothesized to regulate the dynamics of actin filament organization (8Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, the possibility remains that the function of both l-CaD and h-CaD is similar and may involve the regulation of some process other than cell shortening. Because both isoforms of CaD are phosphorylated in cells (4Adam L.P. Haeberle J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Adam L.P.

Physiol. 1997; 272: L244-L252PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the covalent addition and removal of phosphate serve to regulate its function in a reversible manner. A better understanding of the phosphorylation process should help to determine the physiological role of the protein in tissue. h-CaD is phosphorylated in arterial smooth muscle, and totalphosphate content in the protein increases with muscle stimulation by a variety of agents. Although the identities of allphosphorylation sites in h-CaD have not been elucidated, phosphopeptide sequencing of the protein isolated from 32P-loaded muscle shows that phosphate is contained in Ser759 and Ser789, based on the numbering of the human CaD sequence (6Humphrey M. Herrera-Sosa H. Gonzalez G. Lee R. Bryan J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 112: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Approximately two-thirds of the total amount of phosphate in h-CaD is incorporated into these two ERK-dependent sites, whereas the site(s) of the remaining one-third are unknown (5Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using the newly developed phosphopeptide-specific antibodies designed to monitor the phosphorylation levels in Ser759 and Ser789, the major site of ERK-dependent phosphorylation in h-CaD was determined to be at Ser789. Binding of α-Ser(P)759 antibodies was detectable only with a significant purification of h-CaD from muscle tissue. In a previous study, we found that binding of the α-Ser(P)759antibodies to h-CaD increased with various manipulations of muscle tissue (10Franklin M.T. Wang C.-L.A. Adam L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1819-C1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this study, we show that the level of phosphate in Ser759 is <0.005 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Because of the low level of phosphorylation at this site, it is unlikely that reversible addition of phosphate at Ser759is a means through which h-CaD function is altered in smooth muscle tissue. Ser759 phosphorylation may be relevant only in circumstances where phosphatase activity is dramatically altered, as we observed with okadaic acid stimulation. On the other hand, we estimate that the level of phosphate in Ser789 of h-CaD is significant in muscle, but that the level of phosphorylation is not rapidly modified with muscle stimulation. These data suggest that ERK phosphorylation of h-CaD does not play a role in the series of rapidly occurring events that culminate in the generation of force. This conclusion is in agreement with the results of Nixon et al. (18Nixon G.F. Iizuka K. Haystead C.M.M. Haystead T.A.J. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol . ( Lond. ). 1995; 487: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), who showed that the phosphorylation of h-CaD following the addition of ERK to permeabilized smooth muscle does not induce the generation of force. The observation that Ser789 phosphorylation is relatively constant during muscle stimulation contrasts with our previously published observations that total h-CaD phosphate content increases with muscle stimulation (4Adam L.P. Haeberle J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the site of phosphorylation in h-CaD modulated during contraction is in a sequence different from those monitored with our site-specific antibodies, suggesting that ERK-dependent phosphorylation at Ser789contributes only to the basal level of h-CaD phosphorylation. Although all of the phosphate incorporated into h-CaD by the ERKs is in either Ser759 or Ser789, not all of the phosphate in h-CaD purified from tissue is accounted for by these two sites (5Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The location of the additional phosphorylation site(s) and the responsible kinase(s) are unknown. The observation that Ser789 phosphorylation levels are not significantly altered with muscle stimulation by phorbol esters and KCl is surprising because of the known increase in ERK activity (15Gerthoffer W.T. Yamboliev I.A. Shearer M. Pohl J. Haynes R. Dang S. Sato K. Sellers J.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 495: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Adam L.P. Franklin M.T. Raff G.J. Hathaway D.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 183-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation for this apparent discrepancy is provided by the results of ERK immunolocalization studies in smooth muscle (19Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C406-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK can be found at the cell membrane or more centrally within the cytosol, in some circumstances appearing to have a filamentous distribution. The population of ERK exhibiting the more dynamic change in activity after tissue stimulation may not necessarily be the one responsible for modifying h-CaD. Relatively static, low levels of active ERK may be contained in filamentous structures such as those to which h-CaD binds. Of course, a second possibility for this apparent discrepancy is that a kinase other than ERK is responsible for h-CaD modification at Ser789. Clearly, however, our data show that the major site of h-CaD phosphorylation in tissue is at the mammal-specific site (Ser789) and that the level of phosphate contained in this site is not rapidly altered following muscle stimulation with either KCl or phorbol esters. Purified ERK phosphorylates Ser759 and Ser789of mammalian h-CaD at roughly the same rate in vitro. 2G. D'Angelo, P. Graceffa, C.-L. A. Wang, J. Wrangle, and L. P. Adam, unpublished observations. To explain how it is that h-CaD is more extensively phosphorylated in tissue at Ser789 compared with Ser759, several experiments were performed. In agreement with the observation by Childset al. (20Childs T.J. Watson M.H. Sanghera J.S. Campbell D.L. Pelech S.L. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22853-22859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that actin and tropomyosin inhibit gizzard h-CaD phosphorylation by ERK1, we found that actin and tropomyosin inhibit h-CaD phosphorylation and that this inhibition is greater at the site common among all caldesmons (Ser759) than at Ser789. Therefore, one explanation for the differential level of phosphate in the two sites is that Ser759 is sterically inhibited by thin filament proteins in the cell, resulting in the low level of phosphorylation at this site. The possibility also remains that there are mechanisms in place to remove any phosphate in Ser759 by the enzymatic actions of a specific intracellular protein phosphatase. Consistent with this concept, an increase in Ser759 phosphorylation was observed with okadaic acid stimulation of the muscle strips. In addition, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase type 1, similar in class to the catalytic subunit of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase (21Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 22Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), already known to be present in the actomyosin domain along with h-CaD, removes phosphate from Ser759 selectively versusSer789. Therefore, two mechanisms may account for differential phosphorylation at the two ERK sites: steric inhibition of the kinase by actin/tropomyosin and differential susceptibility to phosphatases. l-CaD is phosphorylated during mitosis at sites modified by the proline-directed protein kinase p34cdc2 in vitro (8Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,9Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the ERK phosphorylation sites in CaD are a subset of the p34cdc2 sites (24Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility exists that phosphorylation in cells may be by either or both of these classes of protein kinases (25Watson M.H. Venance S.L. Pang S.C. Mak A.S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An evaluation of our data demonstrates that l-CaD phosphorylation levels are low in cells withdrawn from the cell cycle, but that the addition of serum to initiate cell proliferation results in the relatively rapid addition of phosphate to l-CaD. l-CaD phosphorylation levels 1 h after serum stimulation are not significantly different from the levels in exponential growing cells or in nocodazole-treated mitotic cells. Because cells are in a cycle that is not associated with elevated levels of p34cdc2 after 1 h of serum stimulation (i.e. they are not in G2 or mitosis) (25Watson M.H. Venance S.L. Pang S.C. Mak A.S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and because much of the increase in phosphate is prevented by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, it appears that l-CaD is modified early during the initiation of cell proliferation by MAP kinases. MAP kinases are required for certain transitions of the cell cycle, including G0/G1, G1/S, and G2/M (25Watson M.H. Venance S.L. Pang S.C. Mak A.S. Circ.

Interestingly, the ERK-dependent phosphorylation site in mammalian caldesmons is at a point of sequence diversity in comparison with avian CaD. It is striking that such a prominent phosphorylation event is species-specific. Until the precise physiological function of CaD and what role phosphorylation has in altering this function are known, it will not be possible to determine if 1) the sequence difference in avian CaD acts to confer the functional equivalent of phosphorylation of mammalian CaD, or 2) the function of ERK-dependent CaD phosphorylation in mammalian smooth muscle is unnecessary or redundant to some other process in avian smooth muscle. In sum, we have generated unique phospho- and site-specific antibodies to analyze CaD phosphorylation in tissue. The major ERK-dependent phosphorylation site in h-CaD is at Ser789, a site unique to mammalian versus avian CaD. Based on the observation that the level of h-CaD phosphorylation at Ser789 is not significantly elevated after prolonged muscle contraction, it is unlikely that phosphorylation at this site is involved in regulating cell shortening, as previously hypothesized by our laboratory (17Adam L.P. Franklin M.T. Raff G.J. Hathaway D.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 183-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results do not rule out a role for phosphorylation of h-CaD at unknown sites (other than Ser759 and Ser789) in this regulatory process. The equivalent position in l-CaD of cultured smooth muscle cells is phosphorylated rapidly during the initiation of cell proliferation, suggesting a role in cell division. The methods we have developed to directly assess the level of phosphate incorporated into the two specific ERK-dependent CaD phosphorylation sites will help to uncover the role of CaD phosphorylation by MAP kinases in the regulation of smooth muscle function.

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of CrkL enhances the erythropoietin (Epo)- or interleukin (IL)-3-induced activation of Elk-1 and the c-fos gene promoter activity in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells. Moreover, the Epo-induced activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was augmented and prolonged in cells inducibly overexpressing CrkL. A moderate increase in Epo-induced activation of JNK was also observed in cells overexpressing CrkL. Overexpression of C3G enhanced the Elk-1 activation synergistically with CrkL, while a C3G mutant lacking the guanine nucleotide exchange domain showed an inhibitory effect. Studies using a dominant negative Ha-Ras mutant demonstrated that the Elk-1 and ERK2 activation enhanced by CrkL and C3G was dependent on Ras. Consistent with this, the Epo-induced activation of Ras was augmented in cells inducibly overexpressing CrkL. Most importantly, a CrkL mutant defective in the SH2 or N-terminal SH3 domain showed an inhibitory effect on the Epo-induced activation of ERK2. These data indicate that the CrkL-C3G complex plays a role in Epo- or IL-3-induced, Ras-dependent activation of the Raf/ERK pathway leading to the activation of Elk-1 and the c-fos gene transcription.

Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The hematopoietic cytokine receptors mainly couple with Jak2, a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, to transduce a growth signal in hematopoietic cells (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Through activation of Jak2 and other tyrosine kinases, the cytokine receptors become tyrosine-phosphorylated and thereby recruit various Src homology domain 2 (SH)-containing signaling molecules, such as Shc, Shp-2, and Stat5, to activate downstream signaling pathways. One of the main signaling pathways from the cytokine receptors is the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation cascade involving the small GTP-binding protein Ras and the downstream serine/threonine kinases Raf-1, mitogen-activated/extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2, and ERK1/2 (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 4Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the activated hematopoietic receptors induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and thereby recruit the preformed complex of the adaptor protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos1 to the vicinity of Ras at the plasma membrane to activate this small GTP-binding protein. Activated Ras then recruits, by direct interaction, Raf-1 to the plasma membrane where the catalytic activity of the kinase becomes activated. Subsequently, Raf-1 stimulates the MEK1 and MEK2 kinases by phosphorylation, which then phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 on both serine and tyrosine residues to activate their kinase activity (5Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The activated ERKs shuttle into the nucleus and induce the activity of various transcription factors including Elk-1. As a member of the transcription factor family of ternary complex factors, Elk-1, when activated by phosphorylation, binds to the c-fosserum response element to induce the transcription of this proto-oncogene (6Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar).CrkL is a member of the Crk family of adaptor proteins originally identified as homologues of the product of the v-crkoncogene (7Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Three forms of cellular Crk proteins, composed mostly of SH2 and SH3 domains, have been found: both Crk II and CrkL have the domain structure SH2-SH3-SH3, while Crk I, the alternatively spliced form of Crk II, lacks the C-terminal SH3 domain (8Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 9ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL has been shown to bind Sos1 and C3G, two guanine nucleotide exchange proteins for the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins (10Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, recent studies have established that CrkL, which is most abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells (12de Jong R. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1469-1474PubMed Google Scholar), also binds through its N-terminal SH3 domain to the BCR-ABL fusion protein expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and becomes phosphorylated at Tyr-207 (13Oda T.

It has been, thus, implied that CrkL may play a role in leukemic transformation. We have previously demonstrated that CrkL also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in hematopoietic cells in response to stimulation with Epo or IL-3 and forms complexes with several tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, such as Cbl, Shc, and Shp-2 (17Chin H. Saito T. Arai A. Yamamoto K. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL and its association with Cbl have also been reported in hematopoietic cells stimulated with stem cell factor (18Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E. Prasad K.V.S. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10248-10253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), thrombopoietin (19Oda A. Miyakawa Y. Druker B.J. Ishida A. Ozaki K. Ohashi H. Wakui M. Handa M. Watanabe K. Okamoto S. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 4304-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-2 (20Gesbert F. Garbay C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3986-3993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that CrkL plays a role in cytokine receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells. Previously, overexpression of CrkL was shown to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (21Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Koval A.P. Karas M. Zick Y. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14780-14787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to transform fibroblasts in a Ras-dependent manner (21Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of CrkL was demonstrated to activate adhesion of cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells (23Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without showing any effects on the cytokine dependence (23Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is thus speculated that CrkL plays a signaling role in hematopoietic cells that is different from that in fibroblasts. However, the role of CrkL in hematopoietic cytokine receptor signaling and its downstream signaling events have remained largely unknown. Therefore, in the present study we have examined the involvement of CrkL in signaling from the Epo and IL-3 receptors in hematopoietic cells and found that CrkL is involved through its interaction with C3G in activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway leading to the induction of c-fos gene expression in response to Epo or IL-3.DISCUSSIONThe present studies have demonstrated that the adaptor protein CrkL mediates activation of the Raf/ERK signaling pathway leading to activation of Elk-1 and the c-fos promoter activity in hematopoietic cells stimulated with Epo or IL-3. The activation of this pathway by CrkL was dependent on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G and the Ras GTP-binding protein, as demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of dominant negative mutants of C3G and Ha-Ras. In agreement with this, the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL, which mediates binding with C3G, was shown to play a crucial role in activation of this pathway. Also indispensable was the CrkL SH2 domain, which mediates binding with various tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules in cytokine-stimulated hematopoietic cells. It is thus hypothesized that, through interaction with the activated cytokine receptor complex containing various tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, the CrkL-C3G complex is recruited to the vicinity of Ras at the plasma membrane to activate this GTP-binding protein, which is in parallel with the Ras activation by the Grb2-Sos1 complex recruited through the interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc.Previously, the Crk adaptor proteins, including CrkL (21Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), have been implicated in activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway in fibroblastic cells (21Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Kizaka K.S. Matsuda M. Okayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schlessinger J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (44Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,45Teng K.K. Lander H. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20677-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, unlike in hematopoietic cells, the Crk proteins have been shown to bind Sos1 as well as C3G in these cells. It is thus implied that the Crk-mediated activation of Ras in these cells is through Sos1. In fact, the association of Sos1 with CrkL was also observed in 32DE/Tet-CrkL cells when CrkL was overexpressed (Fig. 5 C). It is thus likely that the enhancement of Ras activation induced by overexpression of CrkL is partly mediated through the recruitment of Sos1 by CrkL to the plasma membrane. However, because overexpression of C3G or its mutant defective in the guanine nucleotide exchange domain synergistically increased or significantly inhibited, respectively, the CrkL-mediated enhancement of Elk-1 activation pathway, C3G should also account for the increased activation of Ras observed in CrkL-overexpressing cells. Previously, C3G was shown to activate, although weakly, Ras in vitro (46Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as well as in transfected COS cells (47Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). C3G has also been implicated in Ras activation by yeast complementation studies (10Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very recent study has shown that Drosophila C3G can trigger activation of Ras as well as Rap1/K-Rev1 during Drosophila development (48Ishimaru S. Williams R. Clark E. Hanafusa H. Gaul U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is thus speculated that C3G directly activates Ras when efficiently recruited to its vicinity by CrkL in hematopoietic cells. In accordance with this idea, C3G was shown to interact with Ras when co-expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 6 D).It should be noted that C3G has been characterized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Rap1/K-Rev1 most efficiently and R-Ras moderately (46Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Originally isolated as a suppressor of K-Ras transformation (49Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), Rap1/K-Rev1 has been hypothesized to antagonize Ras signaling. In accordance with this, the activated Rap1-12V mutant was shown to inhibit Ras-dependent activation of ERKs in Rat-1 fibroblast (50Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which agrees with our result that Rap1-12V inhibited the Epo-induced Elk-1 activation in CrkL-C3G overexpressing cells (Fig. 6 A). However, it has been recently reported that Rap1/K-Rev1 mediates, through specific activation of B-Raf, sustained activation of ERKs induced by cAMP (51Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) or by nerve growth factor (52York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) in PC12 cells, which was significantly inhibited by Rap1-17N. We therefore examined the effect of Rap1-17N on the CrkL/C3G-enhanced activation of Elk-1 in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells, although the dominant negative effect of Rap1-17N on C3G has been disputed recently (53van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory effect observed in PC12 cells (51Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 52York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), Rap1-17N did not show any inhibitory effect but rather augmented the Elk-1 activation in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells (Fig. 6 A). In this regard, it should be noted that activation of ERKs by Rap1/K-Rev1 in PC12 cells has also been disputed very recently (54Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Taken together with the inhibitory effect of Rap1-V12, it was thus concluded that the Elk-1 activation mediated by CrkL/C3G does not depend on Rap1/K-Rev1. Similarly, R-Ras43N, the dominant negative mutant of R-Ras that was previously shown to inhibit the CrkL/C3G-induced activation of integrin in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells (24Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not show any inhibitory effect on the Elk-1 activation (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, it was concluded that neither Rap1/K-Rev1 nor R-Ras is responsible for the CrkL/C3G-mediated activation of Elk-1, although both of these small GTP-binding proteins might be activated by C3G in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells.Importantly, the dSH2 and dSH3N CrkL mutants inhibited the Epo-induced ERK activation in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells (Fig. 7 D). The dominant negative effects of these mutants indicate that, without overexpression, CrkL mediates the activation of ERK by the EpoR, at least partly, in these cells. However, because of the redundancy with the activation mechanism involving the Grb2-Sos1 complex, the biological significance of the CrkL-mediated activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway by the EpoR remains to be determined. In this regard, it should be noted that the CrkL overexpression not only augmented but also prolonged the activation of Ras as well as ERK1/2 (Figs. 3,6 C, and 7 D). It is thus suggested that the CrkL/C3G complex activates the Ras/ERK pathway with a different time course as compared with the Grb2-Sos1 complex does. It has been well established that the time course of ERK activation has a physiological significance in regulation of cell growth and differentiation; in PC12 cells, whereas epidermal growth factor transiently activates ERK to induce cellular proliferation, nerve growth factor induces sustained activation of ERK, which plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation (55Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Crk adaptor proteins (44Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S.

Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) involve the activation of Rap1/K-Rev1 by the CrkL-C3G complex. In hematopoietic cells, the sustained activation of ERK by thrombopoietin has been shown to play a crucial role in megakaryocytic differentiation (56Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23366-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 57Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the activation mechanism remains to be determined. It is thus tempting to speculate that, in addition to the putative roles in regulation of proliferation and apoptosis, the CrkL-mediated sustained activation of ERK may play a role in regulation of differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Further studies are in progress in our laboratory to examine the possible involvement of CrkL-mediated signaling in erythroid differentiation using cells susceptible for Epo-induced differentiation.Previous studies in fibroblasts have shown that overexpression of the Crk proteins (21Senechal K.

Moreover, Epo as well as IL-3 has been shown to induce the JNK activation in hematopoietic cells (34Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, we examined the effect of CrkL on Epo-induced activation of JNK in 32D cells and found that the JNK activity stimulated by Epo was moderately augmented in cells overexpressing CrkL (Fig. 4). Because the JNK activation in hematopoietic cells has been shown to be dependent on Ras (34Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is speculated that CrkL may enhance the JNK activation through the augmentation of Ras activation. In fibroblastic cells, however, C3G has been shown to activate JNK by a Ras-independent mechanism through a pathway involving the mixed lineage kinase family of proteins (59Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, very recent studies (60Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,61Dolfi F. Garcia G.M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further studies are thus required to determine the mechanisms by which CrkL may mediate the JNK activation pathway from the cytokine receptors in hematopoietic cells.Overexpression of CrkL in hematopoietic cells activates cellular adhesion to fibronectin (23Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies have further demonstrated that CrkL activates through C3G a signaling pathway leading to activation of the VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrins, which mediate the cell adhesion with fibronectin (24Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is most likely mediated through R-Ras or other Ras family small GTP-binding proteins, such as Rap1/K-rev, but is independent from the Ras/ERK pathway investigated in the present study, because the dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras or Raf-1 actually enhanced the cell adhesion (24Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The opposing effects of R-Ras and Ha-Ras on cell adhesion have also been reported previously (28Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 63Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, CrkL may activate through C3G different small GTP-binding proteins to regulate different events in hematopoietic cells. The growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells are regulated by several cytokines, such as erythropoietin (Epo)1 and interleukin (IL)-3, which act through the type I cytokine receptors (1Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The hematopoietic cytokine receptors mainly couple with Jak2, a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, to transduce a growth signal in hematopoietic cells (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Through activation of Jak2 and other tyrosine kinases, the cytokine receptors become tyrosine-phosphorylated and thereby recruit various Src homology domain 2 (SH)-containing signaling molecules, such as Shc, Shp-2, and Stat5, to activate downstream signaling pathways. One of the main signaling pathways from the cytokine receptors is the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation cascade involving the small GTP-binding protein Ras and the downstream serine/threonine kinases Raf-1, mitogen-activated/extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2, and ERK1/2 (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 4Miura Y. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29962-29969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the activated hematopoietic receptors induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and thereby recruit the preformed complex of the adaptor protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos1 to the vicinity of Ras at the plasma membrane to activate this small GTP-binding protein. Activated Ras then recruits, by direct interaction, Raf-1 to the plasma membrane where the catalytic activity of the kinase becomes activated. Subsequently, Raf-1 stimulates the MEK1 and MEK2 kinases by phosphorylation, which then phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 on both serine and tyrosine residues to activate their kinase activity (5Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The activated ERKs shuttle into the nucleus and induce the activity of various transcription factors including Elk-1. As a member of the transcription factor family of ternary complex factors, Elk-1, when activated by phosphorylation, bin"

Several publications have supported a structural and functional relationship between ATP and the sHSPs. Equilibrium binding studies, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated an interaction between ATP and total bovine α-crystallin (36Reddy M.C.

Although numerous published reports support a functional interaction between ATP and sHSPs, the structural basis for the effects of ATP on the functions of sHSPs remains unknown.In the current study, ATP protected human αB-crystallin against proteolysis by the serine proteases, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. ESI-LC/MS and LC-MS/MS determined that specific amino acid sequences containing the cleavage sites shielded from proteolysis in the presence of ATP were located near or within the C-terminal core α-crystallin domain, spanning residues Glu67-Ile161 (6de Jong W.W.

Human αB-crystallin contains 14 Arg residues and 10 Lys residues that are cleavage sites for trypsin and are distributed throughout its primary sequence of 175 amino acids. SDS-PAGE analysis of tryptic fragments of αB-crystallin demonstrated that many Lys and Arg residues on αB-crystallin were exposed to trypsin in the absence of added nucleotides and the majority of the native ∼20-kDa protein was degraded to small proteolytic fragments. ESI-LC/MS analysis of the tryptic digestion products of αB-crystallin identified four residues, Lys82, Lys103, Arg116, and Arg123, that were shielded from the proteolysis in the presence of ATP. Chemically similar ATP analogs were less effective than ATP in protecting against proteolytic cleavage at the sites located inside the core α-crystallin domain of αB-crystallin. This finding suggested that the protected trypsin cleavage sites in the core α-crystallin domain were less accessible in the presence of ATP than in the presence of ATP analogs. A structural modification involving the core peptides, Glu67 to Ile161, may be associated with the effect of ATP on the molecular chaperone activity of the sHSP protein, human αB-crystallin.Structural domains involved with ATP functions have been characterized in several molecular chaperones using trypsin proteolysis (42Baneyx F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin is a serine protease having a well known chemical mechanism. Formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate is followed by hydrolysis to release a peptide fragment (67Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, New York1999Google Scholar, 68Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman, New York1993Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in this study, it is extremely unlikely that ATP participates in this chemical reaction as an inhibitor. The possibility that the protective effect of ATP was limited to Arg and Lys cleavage sites was evaluated in control experiments using chymotrypsin, a serine protease that cleaves at aromatic peptides, Phe, Trp, and Tyr (50Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar, 68Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman, New York1993Google Scholar,69Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using LC-MS/MS analysis of chymotrypsin fragments of αB-crystallin, seven protected chymotryptic cleavage sites, Trp60, Phe61, Phe75, Phe84, Phe113, Phe118, and Tyr122, were identified that were near or within the core α-crystallin domain of αB-crystallin. Although the cleavage sites are different for chymotrypsin and trypsin, analysis of the proteolytic fragments determined that nearly all the protected peptides were located in the same conserved core α-crystallin domain of human αB-crystallin.In control experiments, chemically similar ATP analogs were substituted for ATP in the proteolysis reactions. ADP had a modest protective effect against trypsin and chymotrypsin proteolysis and the protective effects of AMP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP were not as pronounced. While it may be important that the protective effect of ATP analogs was strongest with the nucleotide triphosphate, less with the diphosphate and least with the monophosphate the possibility of conversion of ADP to ATP during the assay cannot be excluded. Autophosphorylation of αB-crystallin has been reported and the protective action of phosphonucleotides may be related to phosphorylation at the serine 19, 45, and 59 sites near the core α-crystallin domain (39Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Int. J. Biol.

In separate experiments, a weak ATPase activity was observed (data not shown) that resembled the weak ATPase activity reported for other molecular chaperones (54Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B.

In the absence of Mg2+, the effect of ATP on proteolysis was decreased and the nucleotides, NADPH, NADH, GTP, and cyclic AMP had no effect on proteolysis or on chaperone activity of human αB-crystallin (data not shown). In the absence of an ATP-binding site, a novel interaction between ATP and human αB-crystallin must be considered. Preliminary results demonstrated that the effect of ATP on proteolysis of HSP27 resembled the effect of ATP on human αB-crystallin (data not shown) and additional studies on the effect of ATP and other nucleotides are needed to understand the specificity and significance of an interaction between nucleotides and sHSPs. It will be of interest to pursue the nature of the interaction between ATP and human αB-crystallin in more detail.The possibility that the observed protective effect of ATP was due to an action of ATP as an inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of trypsin was investigated in a kinetic study using the BANA assay in the presence and absence of ATP. BANA is a synthetic arginine substrate that releases a chromogenic product following cleavage by trypsin. No effect of ATP on trypsin activity was observed under conditions that were identical to the conditions used for proteolysis of human αB-crystallin. In a separate study the enzymatic activity of trypsin on the digestion of bovine serum albumin, was unaffected in the presence of ATP (51Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP does not fit the structural constraints required for inhibitors of serine proteases (66Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 68Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. W. H.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and it would have been a startling discovery to find that the action of ATP was on the enzymatic activity of trypsin. Rather than an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of trypsin, the protective effect of ATP involved a structural modification of αB-crystallin that resulted in inaccessible cleavage sites in the core α-crystallin domain.Having confirmed that ATP had no effect on the enzymatic activity of trypsin, the structural basis for the protective effect of ATP on proteolyis of human αB-crystallin needs to be considered. The results in this report suggested that the effect of ATP on proteolysis of human αB-crystallin resembled the effect of ATP on other molecular chaperones and may be associated with structural modifications having functional significance (54Kassenbrock C.K.

Alternatively, the protective effect of ATP could be due to direct binding and steric blockage at the site of proteolytic cleavage in the core domain. Two clusters of positively charged amino acids are present in the core α-crystallin domain and they could interact with the triphosphate moiety on ATP ((Lys82, His83, Lys90, and Lys92) and (Arg116, His119, Arg120, Lys121, Arg123)). Four of these residues, Lys82, Lys92, Arg116, and Arg123, were accessible to trypsin in the absence of added nucleotide, suggesting that they are exposed on the surface of αB-crystallin. Both charged clusters are flanked by numerous hydrophobic residues that are potential sites of interaction with the adenine moiety on ATP. Separate kinetic studies will be necessary to determine whether or not binding of ATP is required for the protection of core residues against proteolysis. Under the conditions used in this study, it is reasonable to suggest that the protective effect of ATP against proteolytic degradation of human αB-crystallin involved structural modification of α-crystallin domain that decreased the accessibility of the cleavage sites between Gly67 and Ile161. Trypsin proteolysis has been used previously in studies of nucleotide-induced conformational changes in GroEL, DnaK, HSP70, HSP90, and BiP, where structural modifications have been demonstrated (42Baneyx F.

To our knowledge, this is the first report using trypsin proteolysis in the analysis of human αB-crystallin, a sHSP, in the presence and absence of ATP. The protection of trypsin cleavage sites in the core α-crystallin domain in the presence of ATP may indicate that the core domain is involved with the effect of ATP on the function of human αB-crystallin and other sHSPs as molecular chaperones. α-Crystallin is a protein that is expressed at high levels in all vertebrate eye lenses and is composed of twoM r 20,000 subunits, αA and αB, which associate to form high molecular mass complexes with an average molecular mass of 800 kDa (1Wistow G.J.

In 1992 it was demonstrated that αA- and αB-crystallin function as molecular chaperones by suppressing the aggregation of other polypeptides in vitro(4Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). A large body of experimental evidence confirmed that αB-crystallin is a prototype for the small heat-shock protein (sHSP)1 superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved core “α-crystallin” domain that spans 80–100 amino acids in the C-terminal domain (2de Jong W.W.

Whereas wild type hpVHL represses levels of TH mRNA and protein 5-fold, a truncated pVHL mutant, pVHL(1–115), induces accumulation of TH mRNA and protein 3-fold. hpVHL-induced inhibition of TH gene expression does not involve either a decrease in TH mRNA stability or repression of TH promoter activity.

The results show that a pause site exists on the TH gene at or just downstream from exon 8. The localization of the pause site may be sequence-specific. In that respect, exon 8 of the TH gene has several short stretches of T residues in the DNA sense strand, which have been shown to lead to transcription pausing or termination in other genes (29Baek K.-H. Sato K. Agrawal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Sato K. Ito R. Back K.-H. Agrawal K. Mol. Cell.

We are presently mapping more precisely the block site within the TH gene as well as the 3′-ends of the shorter arrested transcripts. The role of the TH gene proximal region in mediating gene specific regulation of TH transcript elongation by the SIII factor is also being evaluated.Hypoxia, a physiological stimulus of TH gene transcription in PC12 cells, overcomes the pVHL-induced elongation block and thus promotes efficient elongation of the full-length transcripts. Hypoxia did not stimulate hybridization of TH transcripts at the level of exons 1–2 of the TH gene, indicating failure to activate TH promoter activity in the presence of the overexpressed hpVHL. This demonstrates that hypoxia regulates transcript elongation specifically and independently from promoter activity. Although regulation of gene expression by hypoxia has been studied intensely at the level of transcription initiation and mRNA stability, transcript elongation has not been considered previously as an important regulatory step in this process.The molecular mechanism by which hypoxia abolishes the elongation block of TH transcript synthesis is currently under investigation. Hypoxia might stimulate activity of the SIII factor (elongins A/B/C), because augmented interaction of elongins A and B occurs during hypoxia. It is also possible that, other than SIII, elongation/transcription factors become involved in regulation of processive TH gene elongation during hypoxia. We have observed that rat pVHL, similar to human pVHL(33Schoenfeld A. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8817-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 34Ilopoulos O. Ohh M. Kaelin W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1529-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), is expressed in multiple isoforms. Immunoprecipitation of the predominant lower molecular weight VHL isoform by anti-VHL monoclonal antibody is significantly decreased during hypoxia, suggesting that the epitope recognized by this antibody may be occluded and/or modified during hypoxia. The role of these isoforms in pVHL activities during normoxia and hypoxia remains to be determined.Using PC12 cells that express endogenous pVHL, we discovered a dominant negative activity of the pVHL deletion mutant that relieves endogenous pVHL repression of TH transcript elongation. In this study we focused only on the truncated mutant of pVHL. The activity of other mutants with point mutations at individual amino acids specifically associated with pheochromocytomas remains to be determined. The molecular mechanism of this dominant-negative activity is not understood at present, but it is not likely to depend on changes in the absolute levels of elongins in the nucleus. Dominant-negative activity of other tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, has been reported previously (36Harvey M. Vogel H. Morris D. Bradley A. Bernstein A. Donehower L.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Based on genetic studies, dominant-negative activity of mutant pVHL may be predicted in pheochromocytomas (37Maher E.R.

Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Pheochromocytoma tumors arise from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The primary phenotype of these tumors is the ability to synthesize and release large amounts of catecholamines. This activity is directly attributable to augmented activity and increased gene expression for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis (1Isobe K. Nakai T. Yukimasa N. Nanmoku T. Takekoshi K. Nomura F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Feldman J. Blalock J.A. Zern R.T. Wells S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1979; 49: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The increase in catecholamine levels is clinically significant, resulting in elevated blood pressure and leading to life-threatening hypertensive crises (3Kenady D.E. McGrath P.C. Sloan D.A.

We chose to examine the effects of pVHL on TH gene expression because pheochromocytomas can be the predominant or only tumor arising in some individuals with VHL disease, thus suggesting a specific role for the VHL tumor suppressor protein in the pathogenesis of this tumor (10Crossey P.A.

The results show that a pause site exists on the TH gene at or just downstream from exon 8. The localization of the pause site may be sequence-specific. In that respect, exon 8 of the TH gene has several short stretches of T residues in the DNA sense strand, which have been shown to lead to transcription pausing or termination in other genes (29Baek K.-H.

We are presently mapping more precisely the block site within the TH gene as well as the 3′-ends of the shorter arrested transcripts. The role of the TH gene proximal region in mediating gene specific regulation of TH transcript elongation by the SIII factor is also being evaluated.Hypoxia, a physiological stimulus of TH gene transcription in PC12 cells, overcomes the pVHL-induced elongation block and thus promotes efficient elongation of the full-length transcripts. Hypoxia did not stimulate hybridization of TH transcripts at the level of exons 1–2 of the TH gene, indicating failure to activate TH promoter activity in the presence of the overexpressed hpVHL. This demonstrates that hypoxia regulates transcript elongation specifically and independently from promoter activity. Although regulation of gene expression by hypoxia has been studied intensely at the level of transcription initiation and mRNA stability, transcript elongation has not been considered previously as an important regulatory step in this process.The molecular mechanism by which hypoxia abolishes the elongation block of TH transcript synthesis is currently under investigation. Hypoxia might stimulate activity of the SIII factor (elongins A/B/C), because augmented interaction of elongins A and B occurs during hypoxia. It is also possible that, other than SIII, elongation/transcription factors become involved in regulation of processive TH gene elongation during hypoxia.

Immunoprecipitation of the predominant lower molecular weight VHL isoform by anti-VHL monoclonal antibody is significantly decreased during hypoxia, suggesting that the epitope recognized by this antibody may be occluded and/or modified during hypoxia. The role of these isoforms in pVHL activities during normoxia and hypoxia remains to be determined.Using PC12 cells that express endogenous pVHL, we discovered a dominant negative activity of the pVHL deletion mutant that relieves endogenous pVHL repression of TH transcript elongation. In this study we focused only on the truncated mutant of pVHL. The activity of other mutants with point mutations at individual amino acids specifically associated with pheochromocytomas remains to be determined. The molecular mechanism of this dominant-negative activity is not understood at present, but it is not likely to depend on changes in the absolute levels of elongins in the nucleus.

In this study we show that in PC12 cells, pVHL(wt) represses expression of TH gene at the level of transcript elongation in a gene-specific manner. The elongation-inhibitory activity of pVHL results, most likely, from sequestering of the elongation regulatory factors, elongins C and B. This is the first, and to date the only, physiological evidence that a specific gene is regulated by pVHL and elongins at the level of transcript elongation as predicted from the biochemical studies.

They are expressed on immune cells such as mast cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. Two subtypes of PIR have been classified according to the difference in the primary structure of the PIR transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. These subtypes are designated as PIR-A and PIR-B. In this study, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the PIR-A subtype were shown to mediate activation signal events such as cytoplasmic calcium mobilization, protein tyrosine phosphorylations, and degranulation in rat mast cell line RBL-2H3. The association of the Fc receptor γ and β subunits with PIR-A was shown to be responsible for PIR-A function but not required for membrane expression of PIR-A on COS-7 cells. We further revealed the role of two charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane region, namely arginine and glutamic acid, in PIR-A function and its association with the above subunits. In contrast to the inhibitory nature of the PIR-B subtype, present findings reveal that PIR-A potentially acts as a stimulatory receptor in mast cells, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of mast cell functions by the PIR family.

The inhibitory nature of PIR-B led us to postulate a role of PIR signaling in regulation of immune responses involving mast cells, B cells, and macrophages.PIR-A is defined as a group of noninhibitory type of PIR family receptors characterized by a short cytoplasmic region that is free of any consensus amino acid sequence for activation. Instead, the transmembrane region of PIR-A harbors positively and negatively charged amino acid residues (see Fig. 7). Transmembrane-charged residues can typically be seen in stimulatory receptors mediating a variety of immune responses, such as T cell receptor, the ligand binding α chains of type I and type III Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRIα and FcγRIIIα, respectively), FcαR, killer cell inhibitory receptor-2DS/3DS (alternatively called KAR), and NKR-P1 (CD161). All of these themselves have no amino acid motif for activation but associate with signaling subunits such as CD3 complex, γ and β chains (FcRγ and FcRβ, respectively) of type I FcR for IgE (FcεRI), and DAP12 (24Ravetch J.V.

Previous studies on T cell receptor α chain and FcαR have demonstrated the requirement of a positively charged amino acid residue in the transmembrane region for their function and subunit association (29Manolios N.

The presence of charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane region of PIR-A suggests the possibility that PIR-A associates with activation subunits to deliver an activation signal into the cell. Our recent observations have suggested that one of the PIR-A isotypes, previously denoted by p91D, mediates the activation signal revealed by cytoplasmic calcium mobilization and degranulation in mast cell line (13Yamashita Y. Ono M. Takai T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4042-4047PubMed Google Scholar).The present study focuses on the following two points. The first point is the mechanism of PIR-A function, and the second point is the evaluation of the role in PIR-A function of two charged amino acid residues present in the PIR-A transmembrane region. We have shown that the association of homodimeric FcRγ chains and FcRβ enable PIR-A to generate an activation signal in a mast cell line and that the charged amino acid residues contribute to the subunit association and stimulatory function of PIR-A.DISCUSSIONThe present results demonstrate the potent stimulatory function of PIR-A in mast cell line RBL-2H3, and the association of FcRβ as well as homodimeric FcRγ with PIR-A to activate the signaling pathway shared with FcεRI and FcγRIII. Our results also confirmed the recently reported FcRγ association with PIR-A (39Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Kubagawa H. Chen C.-C. Ho L.H. Shimada T. Gartland L. Mashburn C. Uehara T. Ravetch J.V. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previous studies on FcRγ-deficient mice have demonstrated that mast cells were affected in effector functions but not in ontogeny (40Kubagawa H. Chen C.-C. Ho L.H. Shimada T. Gartland L. Mashburn C. Uehara T. Ravetch J.V. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 42Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), suggesting that PIR-A may not be involved in a developmental signal to support the differentiation of mast cells. Thus, physiological PIR-A functions are discussed in relation to effector functions of mast cells. Several lines of evidence based on recent experiments in vivo have indicated that FcεRI and FcγRIII on mast cells play an important role in triggering distinct types of inflammatory responses such as anaphylaxis and Arthus reaction (42Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 43Martin T.R. Galli S.J. Katona I.M. Drazen J.M. J. Clin.

Mast cell activation by these FcRs may also contribute to the development of chronic allergic syndromes in humans, examples of which include atopic syndrome and bronchial hypersensitivity, by means of activating other cell types with mast cell-derived inflammatory cytokines (48Gordon J.R. Burd P.R. Galli S.J. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These allergic manifestations can presently be attributed, at least in part, to the result of up-regulation of signals by FcεRI and/or FcγRIII in mast cells. The present findings lead to the tempting possibility that PIR-A aggregation exerts an additive effect on the signal by FcRs and, consequently, that PIR-A functions as an accelerator in developing mast cell-related pathological manifestations.ILT/LIRs are thought to be the human homologue of PIR, and its mRNA expression in human lung mast cells has been reported by Arm et al. (9Arm J.P. Nwankwo C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2342-2349PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembranes of their noninhibitory types, ILT1/LIR7, and PIR-A express strikingly conserved primary structures (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that noninhibitory types ILT1/LIR7 associate with FcRγ and FcRβ. In fact, FcRγ association with ILT1 has been reported very recently (49Nakajima H. Samaridis J. Angman L. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the insight from our findings may be allowed to extend to human physiology.We have shown that PIR-A potentially acts as a stimulatory receptor, and its function relates to the association of FcRγ and FcRβ subunits in RBL-2H3 cells. Not all cell types bearing PIR-A express FcRβ subunits, i.e. monocytes and granulocytes. As in the case of Fc receptors (50Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 51Dombrowicz D. Lin S. Flamand V. Brini A.T. Koller B.H. Kinet J.-P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), FcRβ may not be necessary but may act as an accelerator for signal transduction. The role of FcRβ in PIR-A-derived signal transduction should be addressed by further investigation. The mRNA for PIR-A and PIR-B were also detected in mature B cells that are known to express neither FcRγ nor FcRβ. Based on current information, PIR-A cannot exert any stimulatory function, so that PIR-B has a dominant function over PIR-A in mature B cells. To further understand the mechanism of positive and negative regulations by PIR-A and PIR-B receptors, we also examined whether PIR-A requires subunits for its membrane expression. In contrast to FcγRIII, FcγRII-PIR-A did not require FcRγ for its membrane expression in COS-7 cells as well as human FcαR (26Saito K. Suzuki K. Matsuda H. Okumura K. Ra C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 1152-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Morton H.C. van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Vossebeld P. Snijders A. Verhoeven A.J. Capel P.J. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29781-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our results for PIR-A expression using COS-7 cells are similar to the results in transfected 293T cells (39Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but different from the results in transfected LTK fibroblasts or splenocytes from FcRγ deficient mice (40Kubagawa H. Chen C.-C. Ho L.H. Shimada T. Gartland L. Mashburn C. Uehara T. Ravetch J.V. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because the two cell lines permissive to expression of PIR-A in the absence of FcRγ were those transformed with the gene encoding SV40 large T antigen, a high level of PIR-A translation could cause redundant accumulation of the receptor protein in these cells, resulting in membrane expression without FcRγ association. It is also possible that the FcRγ requirement for PIR-A expression might differ by cell type, although the mature cell population present in the spleen requires FcRγ for PIR-A expression (40Kubagawa H. Chen C.-C. Ho L.H. Shimada T. Gartland L. Mashburn C. Uehara T. Ravetch J.V. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this sense, the physiological requirement of FcRγ for PIR-A membrane expression still needs to be investigated using a highly sorted cell species.The results from mutation analyses on FcγRII-PIR-A demonstrate the role of transmembrane-charged amino acids of PIR-A, Arg626and Glu643, in subunit association and PIR-A-mediated signal transduction. Charged amino acids of the transmembrane region are commonly found in stimulatory receptors (Fig. 7). The hydrophobic nature of α helix structure is thought to be a basic requirement for membrane integration by the transmembrane region (52Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16996) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the presence of charged amino acids is unfavorable for stable membrane expression. However, membrane expression of these stimulatory receptors is presently rationalized by association of a subunit bearing counter-charged transmembrane region to achieve hydrophobicity by neutralizing transmembrane charges. As shown Fig. 7 B, FcRγ distributes two charged amino acids, aspartic acid and arginine, in the transmembrane region at seemingly parallel positions to those of PIR-A with the opposite charges. Our results indicate that both Arg626 and Glu643 of PIR-A each have an effect on the binding affinity of FcRγ and FcRβ to PIR-A, supporting the existence of a mechanism for subunit assembly and specificity based on electrostatic protein interaction at a membrane site. We unexpectedly observed that the requirement of Arg626 and Glu643 for PIR-A-derived signal transduction does not parallel that for subunit association. The loss of the negative charge of Glu643 does result in a decrease of subunit association but does not affect the capacity for FcRγ phosphorylation and its downstream PIR-A-mediated function. These findings brought us to assume the following two mechanisms for AEQ2-derived signal transduction. The first was that an increase in subunit association with AEQ2 receptor took place along with receptor aggregation, and the second was that efficient phosphorylation of FcRγ was undertaken by the minor fraction of AEQ2 receptor where the subunit association was resistant to mutation. Stimulation of AEQ2 receptor was found to induce FcRγ phosphorylation in both total and AEQ2-associated FcRγ fractions to the same extent as the intact receptor, despite the fact that the amount of subunit associated with AEQ2 receptor remained much smaller than the amount of intact receptor. These findings may support the latter mechanism mentioned above and suggest the presence of a functionally competent fraction of the receptor-subunit complex in the membrane. It is important to note that our discussions were based on experiments using detergent-soluble cell fractions. Recent findings have shown the importance of detergent-insoluble fractions in signal transduction for some receptors. We did not examine whether or not AEQ2 receptor functioned in detergent-insoluble fractions. Further investigation is therefore required to understand the mechanism of receptor function and its subunit association. Paired Ig-like receptor (PIR)1 (1Hayami K. Fukuta D. Nishikawa Y.

Analyses of a number of cDNA sequences and genomic clones for PIR revealed a gene family consisting of at least three isotypic genes (3Yamashita Y. Fukuta D. Tsuji A. Nagabukuro A. Matsuda Y.

Its structural features have been determined to consist of type I transmembrane glycoprotein with six conserved Ig-like domains followed by two distinct amino acid sequences encompassing the transmembrane to cytoplasmic region. These amino acid sequences serve as the basis for classification of PIR into two subtypes, PIR-A and PIR-B (2Kubagawa H. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the recognition that these receptors may have distinct biologic functions suggests that additional signaling elements may contribute to functional diversity. We hypothesized that the cytoplasmic domain (CY) of the ligand binding α-chain alters the biological properties of the receptor complex. Using macrophage FcγRIa as a model system, we created stable transfectants expressing a full-length or a CY deletion mutant of human FcγRIa. Both receptors functionally associate with the endogenous murine γ-chain. However, we have established that the CY of FcγRIa directly contributes to the functional properties of the receptor complex. Deletion of the FcγRIa CY leads to slower kinetics of receptor-specific phagocytosis and endocytosis as well as lower total phagocytosis despite identical levels of receptor expression. Deletion of the CY also converts the phenotype of calcium independent FcγRIa-specific phagocytosis to a calcium-dependent phenotype. Finally, deletion of the CY abrogates FcγRIa-specific secretion of interleukin-6 but does not affect production of interleukin-1β.

Common to each of these functions is the initiation of tyrosine phosphorylation following receptor cross-linking (5Daeron M. Annu. Rev.

However, recent evidence suggests that these receptors are not redundant. For example, FcγRIIIa appears necessary for initiating the Arthus inflammatory reaction (6Hazenbos W.L. Gessner J.E.

Immunol. 1996; 105: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The basis for these differences are unknown. FcγRI is expressed on the cell surface in association with the γ-chain (9Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8847-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This association is not a prerequisite for transient receptor expression but is necessary for stable expression (11Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 12van Vugt M.J. Heijnen A.F. Capel P.J. Park S.Y. Ra C. Saito T. Verbeek J.S. van de Winkel J.G. Blood. 1996; 87: 3593-3599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-chain cytoplasmic domain contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) and current data suggest that the γ-chain cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for FcγRIa induced functions (13Indik Z.K.

Biochemical studies have shown that cross-linking of the FcγRIa·γ-chain complex results in activation of a Src family kinase(s) and the tyrosine kinase p72Syk(2McKenzie S.E. Schreiber A.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain and the initiation of a signaling cascade that can culminate in the induction of degranulation, phagocytosis, an oxidative burst, ADCC activity and the induction of gene transcription. The association between FcγRIa and γ-chain may also be important in the formation of a higher affinity receptor complex through the recruitment of two ligand binding chains to the γ homodimer (16Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unlike the γ-chain, the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRI does not contain an ITAM or other tyrosine containing signaling motifs. Nonetheless, murine FcγRI on J774 cells is constitutively phosphorylated on serine and after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation the level of phosphorylation increases (17Quilliam A.L. Osman N. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. Immunology. 1993; 78: 358-363PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of FcγRI may also associate with actin-binding protein-280 (ABP-280, also known as non-muscle filamin) in the absence of ligand (18Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 275-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Receptor engagement by ligand apparently abrogates this association, although its functional significance is not clear. Both of these observations suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIa may be actively involved in the biologic phenotype of FcγRI. Furthermore, FcγRIa in the absence of the γ-chain can signal for calcium in COS-1 cells and the transmission of this calcium signal requires the FcγRIa cytoplasmic domain (19Indik Z. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. Immunobiology. 1992; 185: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, and the observations that several γ-chain associated Fc receptors initiate functionally distinct cell programs, we hypothesized that the FcγRIa cytoplasmic domain may serve to modify the signaling of the FcγRI·γ-chain receptor complex. By directly comparing wild type human FcγRIa with a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of FcγRIa expressed at comparable levels in stable transfectants of the murine macrophage cell line P388D1, we have established that the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIa alters the functional properties of the receptor complex. These observations provide a general framework for understanding the unique properties of the family of Fcγ receptors which associate with the γ-chain. The murine macrophage cell line P388D1 stably transfected with a cDNA encoding human FcγRIa or a mutant form of FcγRIa containing a stop codon after the first amino acid of the cytoplasmic domain (Lys315 → Stop 315) were prepared as described previously (13Indik Z.K. Hunter S. Huang M.M. Pan X.Q. Chien P. Kelly C. Levinson A.I. Kimberly R.P. Schreiber A.D. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 599-606PubMed Google Scholar). P388D1 cells transfected with human FcγRIIa were previously described (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained as adherent cultures (Corning Tissue Culture Dishes) in RPMI 1640 as described previously (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Human and mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma. Mouse F(ab′)2fragments and F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (GαM) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). F(ab′)2 fragments of the anti-FcγRIa mAbs 22.2 and 32.2 were obtained from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). IgM anti-H-2Dd(clone 3-25.4) was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The hybridoma line expressing the rat anti-murine FcγRII/FcγRIII mAb 2.4G2 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Quantitative huFcγRI expression was matched for cells expressing the wild type (WT) and the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant (MUT) by fluorescence activated cell sorting using anti-FcγRI mAb 22.2-FITC (Medarex). A polyclonal anti-γ-chain Ab (666) was kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Pierre Kinet (21Letourneur O. Kennedy I.C. Brini A.T. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Kinet J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2652-2656PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, polyclonal anti-γ-chain Abs were prepared in rabbits immunized with a C-terminal peptide sequence that is shared by both human and murine γ-chain exactly as described (21Letourneur O. Kennedy I.C. Brini A.T. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Kinet J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2652-2656PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of the polyclonal antibodies, γ-chain from U937 cells was immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose bound anti-γ-chain mAb (mAb 4D8) (kindly provided by Dr. J. Kochan) (22Schoneich J.T. Wilkinson V.L. Kado-Fong H. Presky D.H. Kochan J.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2181-2185PubMed Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting with the polyclonal Abs (see below). FcγRI was immunoprecipitated from the transfected lines using either mAb 22.2 or mAb 197 (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Guyre, Dartmouth University Medical School) (23Guyre P.M. Graziano R.F. Vance B.A. Morganelli P.M. Fanger M.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1650-1655PubMed Google Scholar) pre-bound to protein G-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). γ-Chain from transfected cells was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal rabbit anti-γ-chain Abs bound to protein G-agarose (or from U937 cells with protein G-bound mAb 4D8). Cells (10–20 × 106/ml) were lysed in PBS containing either 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) or 1% digitonin (Wako Biochemicals, Waco, TX) and inhibitors (EDTA/pepstatin/aprotinin/sodium orthovanadate/pefabloc). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. For immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (24Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5826-5835PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 10% non-fat milk followed by incubation with either polyclonal anti-γ-chain Ab or anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (UBI). Blots were washed 3 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and bound mAb or Ab was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Jackson ImmunoResearch). Following 3 more washes, bound Ab was detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. Membranes were stripped by incubation with Tris-HCl, pH 2.3, for 30 min at room temperature and then re-probed as described above. Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent dye with spectral properties that change with the binding of free Ca2+, was used to measure changes in intracellular calcium concentrations as we have described (25Edberg J.C. Moon J.J. Chang D.J. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8071-8079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). P388D1 cells, adhered to 25-mm diameter round glass coverslips at 5 × 105 cells/ml, were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 2 μm fura-2 AM. During the last 5 min, anti-FcγRIa mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2 was added. After incubation, the cells were washed once with modified PBS (PBS prepared with 5 mm KCl and 5 mm glucose) and then re-warmed to 37 °C for 5 min in modified PBS plus 1.1 mmCa2+ and 1.6 mm Mg2+ prior to analysis. The coverslips were transferred to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot and the ratio of fluorescence emission of fura-2 was monitored. After establishment of a baseline, F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG was added at a final concentration of 35 μg/ml. Analysis was continued for an additional 5 min. Quantitation of intracellular [Ca2+] before and after treatment of cells with BAPTA-AM was performed using Indo-1 (Molecular Probes) in an SLM Spectrofluorometer (Spectronics Instruments, Rochester, NY) exactly as we have previously described (20Edberg J.C.

Endocytosis of transfected huFcγRIa was determined by monitoring the disappearance of cell surface-associated anti-FcγRI mAb 32.2 F(ab′)2 (Medarex) upon cross-linking with F(ab′)2 GαM (26Odin J.A. Edberg J.C. Painter C.J. Kimberly R.P. Unkeless J.C. Science. 1991; 254: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similarly, endocytosis of murine FcγRIa on non-transfected cells was determined using mIgG2a (Sigma) and F(ab′)2 GαM. Cells (50 μl, 5 × 106/ml) were incubated with a saturating concentration of mAb for 15 min at 4 °C. Following two washes in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, F(ab′)2 GαM was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then placed at 37 °C for varying periods of time, rapidly pelleted, and washed with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin containing azide at 4 °C. Remaining cell surface-associated receptor was quantitated with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-goat IgG by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis by transfected P388D1 cells was determined in an adherent assay system (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biotinylated mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2 and biotinylated bovine erythrocytes were prepared as we have previously described (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biotinylated erythrocytes were saturated with streptavidin and washed. The resulting erythrocytes were coated with biotinylated mAb and the level of mAb binding was verified by flow cytometry. P388D1 cells, adhered to round glass coverslips at 5 × 105 cells/ml, were incubated with anti-FcγRIa mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2-coated erythrocytes (E-22.2) in RPMI, 20% fetal calf serum (50 μl at 5 × 107 E/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, erythrocytes coated with an IgM anti-H2Dd (Pharmingen) were used. Non-internalized erythrocytes were lysed by brief immersion of the coverslip in dH2O followed by immersion in buffer. Phagocytosis was quantitated by light microscopy and expressed as a phagocytic index (number of erythrocytes internalized per 100 P388D1 cells). Treatment of cells with BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes) to quench intracellular Ca2+ levels was performed as described previously (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslip adherent cells were incubated with varying concentrations of BAPTA-AM in RPMI, 20% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C followed by two washes. E-22.2 in RPMI, 20% fetal calf serum were then added and handled as described above. Controls included loading cells with the BAPTA-AM solvent (1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for the same period of time. The kinetics of transfected FcγRIa-specific phagocytosis was performed using a flow cytometric based assay (27Pricop L. Salmon J.E. Edberg J.C. Beavis A.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this assay, the E-22.2 were labeled with the PKH26 Red Fluorescence Cell linker Kit (Sigma). Transfected P388D1 cells were mixed in suspension with labeled E-22.2 at a ratio of 50:1 (E:P388D1)(both in RPMI, 20% fetal calf serum), pelleted, and incubated at 37 °C for varying periods of time. At each time point, the supernatant was removed and non-internalized erythrocytes were rapidly lysed in hypotonic saline for 30 s followed by 3 washes in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as a phagocytic capacity (mean fluorescence intensity of phagocytic cells with one or more internalized erythrocytes × % of cells with one or more internalized erythrocytes) as we have described (27Pricop L. Salmon J.E. Edberg J.C. Beavis A.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, surface absorbed rabbit IgG, or surface absorbed F(ab′)2 GαM IgG + mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2. Wells were coated with absorbed protein (20 μg/ml rabbit IgG or F(ab′)2 GαM) for 2 h at 37 °C. For anti-FcγRI mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2 stimulation, mAb at 20 μg/ml was added to F(ab′)2 GαM-coated wells for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (1–2.5 × 105cells/ml) were added to the wells and cultured for varying periods of time. Levels of murine cytokines in diluted culture supernatants were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For IL-1β determination, recombinant standard, capture ab (polyclonal rabbit Ab), and biotinylated detection and neutralization mAb (clone 1400.24.17) were obtained from Endogen (Woburn, MA). For IL-6 determination, recombinant standard, capture mAb (clone MP5–2-F3), and biotinylated detection mAb (clone MP5–32C11) were obtained from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson) and then TMB substrate were added and the A 450 nm was determined. Aliquots of cells at 5 × 106 cell/ml were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mAb for 30 min at 4 °C followed by two washes. For indirect immunofluorescence, the cells were then incubated with saturating concentrations of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 at 4 °C for another 30 min. After washing, the cells were analyzed immediately for immunofluorescence using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Analysis of flow cytometry listmode data was done using CellQuest (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry). Statistical comparisons were performed with the paired ttest. A probability of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the samples. To investigate the functional significance of the cytoplasmic domain of human FcγRIa, P388D1 cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding the full-length wild type FcγRIa (WT) or a cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant form of FcγRIa (MUT) were studied. Transfected cell lines were sorted to generate clones with identical levels of receptor expression (Fig. 1) that were used in all subsequent studies. Human FcγRIa expressed on monocytes and the myelomonocytic cell line U937 noncovalently associates with the γ-chain of the FcεRI receptor complex (9Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8847-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The transmembrane regions of FcγRIa and the γ-chain mediate receptor complex assembly and 20 of the 21 amino acids in the transmembrane region are identical in murine and human γ-chain with one conservative difference (I → V). As predicted, comparable amounts of γ-chain was co-immunoprecipitated from the WT and MUT lines after cell lysis in buffer containing 1% digitonin (Fig.2). As a positive control, we co-immunoprecipitated γ-chain with endogenously expressed murine FcγRII and FcγRIIIa using mAb 2.4G2. In accordance with the γ-chain association data, cross-linking of the transfected WT and MUT huFcγRIa with mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2 + F(ab′)2GαM resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain (results not shown) demonstrating that both WT and MUT huFcγRIa associate with the endogenous murine γ-chain and initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of the γ-chain. While devoid of tyrosine residues, the α-chain of murine FcγRIa has been shown to be phosphorylated on serine and/or threonine residues (17Quilliam A.L. Osman N. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. Immunology. 1993; 78: 358-363PubMed Google Scholar) and human FcγRIa has been shown to bind to ABP under some conditions (18Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 275-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FcγRIa in the absence of the γ-chain can signal for calcium in COS-1 cells and the transmission of this calcium signal requires the FcγRIa cytoplasmic domain (19Indik Z. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. Immunobiology. 1992; 185: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we considered the possibility that the CY domain of huFcγRIa may contribute to the functional properties of the receptor complex. Using erythrocytes coated with the anti-human FcγRIa mAb 22.2 F(ab′)2, both WT and MUT huFcγRIa mediated receptor-specific phagocytosis (Fig.3). However, the WT construct consistently displayed a higher phagocytic index despite identical levels of receptor expression (Fig. 3). There was no internalization of E-22.2 by parental non-transfected P388D1 cells and no phagocytosis of erythrocytes coated with an IgM anti-H-2Dd mAb (clone 3–25.4) by any cell type (Fig. 3 A), despite comparable binding of the E-3–25.4 probe to the transfected cells when compared with E-22.2. We considered the possibility that engagement of the ligand-binding site of FcγRIa, which can augment receptor function (28Pfefferkorn L.C. van de Winkel J.G. Swink S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8164-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), might alter the difference in phagocytic capacity between the WT and MUT FcγRI. However, saturation of FcγRIa with mIgG2a did not alter the magnitude of FcγRIa-specific phagocytosis and did not abrogate the quantitative difference in phagocytosis between WT and MUT FcγRIa (TableI).Table IFcγRIa-specific phagocytosisPhagocytic indexControl+20 μg/ml mIgG2aWT hFcγRIa transfectants176.1 ± 41.6aCoverslip adherent cells were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Murine IgG2a (20 μg/ml) was added to appropriate coverslips, incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of E-22.2 F(ab′)2 to all of the coverslips.

Similarly, while both WT and MUT huFcγRIa were capable of endocytosis, endocytosis by the WT receptor was more rapid than that mediated by the MUT receptor (Fig.4). Endocytosis of endogenous murine FcγRIa, assessed on non-transfected P388D1 cells, was indistinguishable from the transfected huFcγRIa. Since we have matched the WT and MUT cell lines for receptor expression, the differences in phagocytic capacity and the more rapid kinetics of phagocytosis and endocytosis by WT FcγRI provide the first evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIa, in association with the γ-chain, can affect receptor function. Through the use of chimeric and mutant receptors, the ITAM has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for FcγR phagocytosis and the FcγR Ca2+transient (14Davis W. Harrison P.T.

Schreiber A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7381-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the Ca2+ transient has been demonstrated with huFcγRIIa which incorporates an ITAM directly in the CY domain and requires elevations in intracellular Ca2+ to mediate phagocytosis (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, FcγRIa/γ-chain specific phagocytosis is independent of the receptor-induced Ca2+ transient (20Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we considered the possibility that the CY domain of FcγRIa confers a Ca2+-independent phenotype on FcγRIa-specific phagocytosis. When intracellular Ca2+ levels were quenched with BAPTA (resulting in [Ca2+] = 57 ± 9.3 nm with 20 μm BAPTA treatment), receptor-specific phagocytosis induced by the WT huFcγRIa was unaltered (Fig. 5 A), as we have previously shown for FcγRI on human monocytes. In contrast, receptor-specific phagocytosis induced by the MUT huFcγRIa was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). Since the absolute level of MUT huFcγRIa phagocytosis is lower than WT huFcγRIa, we considered the possibility that the BAPTA sensitivity might be related to the quantitative level of phagocytosis. Accordingly, phagocytosis by the WT huFcγRIa was performed with E-22.2 prepared with a lower mAb conjugation level resulting in a phagocytic index of 65.1 ± 13.2 compared with a phagocytic index of 70.4 ± 6.2 for MUT huFcγRIa and E-22.2 prepared at the maximal conjugation level. WT huFcγRI insensitivity to BAPTA was maintained under these reduced phagocytic conditions (Fig.5 A) indicating that the Ca2+ insensitivity is a property of the CY domain of huFcγRIa. As an additional control, FcγRIIa-specific phagocytosis by P388D1 cells expressing full-length huFcγRIIa (with a phagocytic index of 167 ± 32.6) was also shown to be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA (Fig.5 B), as we have previously reported (20Edberg J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2039120505,"Previous research suggested the possibility that contraction of floating collagen matrices by human fibroblasts required increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. In the current studies, we show that increased MLC phosphorylation was neither necessary for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent matrix contraction nor sufficient for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-dependent contraction. In contrast, increased MLC phosphorylation did appear to be coupled to the formation of stress fibers by cells spreading in monolayer culture. Signal transduction pathways required for PDGF- and LPA-dependent matrix contraction involved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins, respectively. Our results indicate that PDGF- and LPA-dependent contraction of floating collagen matrices can be uncoupled from an increase in MLC phosphorylation.

Studies on wound repair in vivo suggest that two fundamentally different mechanisms of matrix reorganization might result in wound contraction. One depends on migration of cells into the wound region at the wound margins (1Gross J. Farinelli W. Sadow P. Anderson R. Bruns R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); the other depends on smooth muscle-like contraction of cells after they have formed the new wound tissue (i.e. granulation tissue) (2Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). To learn more about the mechanisms of matrix reorganization involved in wound contraction, we and others have been studying model systems in which fibroblasts contract collagen matrices in vitro (3Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Depending upon whether the matrices are mechanically unloaded or loaded, contraction occurs, respectively, as a consequence of cell migration (4Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 5Ehrlich H.P. Rajaratnam J.B. Tissue Cell. 1990; 22: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) or smooth muscle-like contraction (6Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp.

The signal transduction mechanisms that regulate matrix contraction are only beginning to be understood. Recently, we showed that in the case of mechanically unloaded (i.e. “floating”) collagen matrices, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)1 and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulate contraction by different signaling pathways. LPA-dependent contraction was selectively inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTx), whereas PDGF-dependent contraction was selectively inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor KT5926 (8Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). KT5926 has been reported to block myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (9Nakanishi S. Yamada K. Iwahashi K. Kuroda K. Kase H. Mol.

One interpretation of our previous observations, therefore, was that PDGF (but not LPA) stimulated contraction by activating MLC kinase leading to MLC phosphorylation. A role for MLC kinase and MLC phosphorylation also was suggested based on the ability of cyclic AMP to inhibit collagen matrix contraction and the assumption that the mechanism of inhibition involved negative regulation of MLC kinase by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (16Ehrlich H.P.

In the present studies, we examined more directly the relationship between MLC phosphorylation and the contraction of floating collagen matrices. Contrary to the above hypothesis, our data suggest that PDGF and LPA stimulation of contraction can be uncoupled from an increase in MLC phosphorylation. PDGF (BB isotype) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, LPA, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and trypsin/EDTA solution were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from Intergen Co., Purchase, NY. Vitrogen “100” collagen was obtained from Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (goat), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (goat), ultrapure glycerol, and ultrapure urea were obtained from ICN, Aurora, OH. Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagent was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PTx, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Fluoromount G was obtained from Southern Biotechology Associates, Birmingham, AL. Fibronectin was obtained from the New York Blood Center. Smooth muscle anti-MLC monoclonal antibody (19Lau K.S. Grange R.W. Chang W.J. Kamm K.E. Sarelius I. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Kristine E. Kamm (University of Texas Southwestern). Fibroblasts from human foreskin specimens (<10th passage) were maintained in Falcon 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fibroblasts were harvested from monolayer culture with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA. Trypsin was neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor (3.3 mg/ml). For contraction experiments, collagen matrices containing cells were polymerized as described below. For monolayer culture experiments, harvested cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in Falcon T-75 flasks (5 ml, 105 cells/ml) or on 22-mm2 glass coverslips (0.5 ml, 105 cells/ml). The culture flasks and coverslips were previously coated for 20 min with 20 μg/ml fibronectin or 50 μg/ml collagen and then rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 6 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2). To load fibroblasts in monolayer culture with PTx, the cells were incubated overnight in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum containing PTx at the concentrations indicated. Contraction of floating collagen matrices was carried out as described previously (8Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Neutralized solutions of Vitrogen “100” collagen (1.5 mg/ml) were prepared containing fibroblasts (106 cells/ml) in DMEM without serum. The cell/collagen mixture was prewarmed to 37 °C for 3–4 min, and 0.2-ml aliquots were placed in Corning 24-well culture plates. Each aliquot occupied an area outlined by an 11-mm diameter circular score within a well. Polymerization of collagen matrices required 60 min at 37 °C. To initiate matrix contraction, matrices were released gently from the underlying culture dish with a spatula into 0.5–1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with growth factors and inhibitors added as indicated, after which the matrices were incubated at 37 °C. To determine the extent of floating matrix contraction, samples were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 6 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) for 20 min at 22 °C. The matrices were washed, placed on a flat surface, and measured with a ruler. For quantitative purposes, contraction data are presented as the change in diameter (starting − final) measured in mm. All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and every experiment was repeated two or more times. Data points and error bars in the figures represent averages and standard deviations. Where error bars cannot be seen, the data points overlapped. MLC phosphorylation was determined using the urea/glycerol-PAGE method (20Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Word R.A. Casey M.L. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C861-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in T-75 flasks were treated with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, scraped off the dishes, and homogenized on ice using ∼100 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, tight pestle). After centrifugation at 8,000 rpm (Beckman Microfuge) for 1 min at 4 °C, the pellets were washed three times with diethylether, dissolved in urea-sample buffer (10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, and 23 mm glycine, pH 8.6), and resuspended using a water bath sonicator (Branson 2210) for 10 min. Samples were subjected to urea/glycerol-PAGE using 10% gels. Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride was carried out for 2 h at 50 V. Blots were fixed with 0.4% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 22 °C and washed three times in PBS, blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and then incubated with anti-MLC monoclonal antibody in blocking solution at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing in TTBS, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 3% bovine serum albumin and TTBS at 22 °C for 2 h and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantitative evaluation of the nonphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated MLC was performed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image. Cells on coverslips were fixed for 20 min at 22 °C with 3% paraformaldehyde in DPBS, blocked with 1% glycine and 1% bovine serum albumin in DPBS for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in DPBS for 10 min. To stain for actin, samples were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (8 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing in DPBS, slides were mounted with Fluoromount G. Images were observed and captured using a Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C5985-02 cooled CCD camera. Fig. 1 shows the results of a typical floating matrix contraction experiment. With no growth factors added (basal contraction), the matrix diameter decreased ∼1–2 mm (initially ∼10.5 mm). With growth factors LPA or PDGF, the diameter decreased 4–6 mm. When cells in polymerized matrices were treated with increasing concentrations of forskolin for 10 min before the addition of growth factors, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of PDGF-dependent matrix contraction but little effect on LPA-dependent contraction. Forskolin also inhibited basal contraction. Fig. 2 shows that a similar pattern of inhibition was observed when the cells were treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP rather than forskolin. It should be noted that incubation of fibroblasts in collagen matrices with 10 μm forskolin for 10 min results in a 3-fold activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (22He Y. Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Figure 2Effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on matrix contraction promoted by LPA and PDGF . Collagen matrices polymerized for 1 h were incubated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 10 min at the concentrations indicated, released, and incubated for 4 h with 100 ng/ml PDGF or 10 μm LPA added where shown. At the end of the incubations, matrix contraction was measured as the decrease in matrix diameter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experiments were then carried out to learn if cyclic AMP blocked PDGF-dependent contraction through an effect on MLC phosphorylation. Preliminary experiments with cells in collagen matrices failed for technical reasons. The MLC phosphorylation assays required ∼3 × 106 cells/sample, whereas each collagen matrix contains only 2 × 105 cells, and the presence of collagen extracted from the matrix was found to interfere with the urea/glycerol gels. Subsequently, MLC phosphorylation assays were carried out using cells attached to culture dishes. Essentially identical results were observed with cells on fibronectin-coated or collagen-coated dishes (not shown). To mimic the timing of collagen matrix contraction, freshly harvested fibroblasts were allowed to attach to the culture dishes for 1 h, treated with or without forskolin for 15 min, and then with LPA or PDGF. Fig. 3 A shows that after 15 min of growth factor treatment, the monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms of MLC were readily distinguished based on the faster molecular mobility in urea gels of the phosphorylated molecules (20Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Word R.A. Casey M.L. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C861-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B presents quantitative evaluation of the results. In the absence of growth factors, the basal level of MLC phosphorylation was 10–20%. In response to PDGF stimulation, MLC phosphorylation typically decreased slightly. Even if MLC phosphorylation was measured 5 min after the addition of PDGF, no increase was detected (not shown). Therefore, the PDGF signaling pathway in human fibroblasts did not appear to be linked to MLC phosphorylation, which argued against a role for MLC kinase in PDGF-dependent stimulation of collagen matrix contraction. In marked contrast, incubation of cells with LPA resulted in a stimulation of MLC phosphorylation with increased levels of both monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms of the molecule. In this case, prior forskolin treatment decreased the stimulatory effect of LPA (Fig. 3, A and B), even though forskolin had little effect on LPA-stimulated contraction (Fig. 1). Therefore, although LPA stimulated MLC phosphorylation, the relationship of this stimulation to collagen matrix contraction was questionable (see below). We also measured the pattern of MLC phosphorylation in cells that were stimulated 1 h or 4 h with or without growth factors. Fig.4 shows that by 1 h, the extent of MLC phosphorylation had increased even in the absence of growth factor addition. LPA-treated samples still, however, showed a higher degree of phosphorylation than the untreated or PDGF-treated cultures. By 4 h, the LPA-stimulated increase had begun to decline, and similar levels of MLC phosphorylation were apparent at this time under all incubation conditions. To correlate the changes in MLC phosphorylation with organization of the cells' actin cytoskeleton, observations also were made on fibroblasts that were fixed and stained with phalloidin. Cells behaved similarly on fibronectin or collagen-coated coverslips (not shown). Fig.5 shows that in the absence of added growth factors, fibroblasts were able to attach, spread, and form some stress fibers over 2 h. PDGF increased membrane ruffling. LPA increased actin stress fiber formation. Treatment of the cells with forskolin caused the actin cytoskeleton to develop an arborized appearance. This change in the cytoskeleton occurred within 10–15 min after the addition of forskolin and was evident before growth factors were added (not shown). Incubation of forskolin-treated cells with LPA but not PDGF was able to reverse the arborized morphology, although the density of actin stress fibers was less than that observed in cells treated with LPA alone. The ability of LPA to promote MLC phosphorylation and assembly of stress fibers is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated an LPA-activated, Rho-dependent mechanism of contraction (13Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K.

Rho-dependent contraction has been shown to be PTx-insensitive (26Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar, 27Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), however, whereas LPA-dependent contraction of floating collagen matrices was PTx-sensitive (8Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were carried out to compare the effects of PTx treatment on matrix contraction and MLC phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6, prior treatment of fibroblasts with PTx selectively inhibited LPA-dependent contraction but had little effect on PDGF-dependent contraction. Similar results were found using concentrations of PTx ranging from 25 to 100 ng/ml (not shown). Fig.7, on the other hand, shows that unlike forskolin, PTx did not alter the ability of LPA to stimulate MLC phosphorylation. Other experiments demonstrated that PTx treatment did not alter the ability of cells to spread and form stress fibers (not shown). These findings suggested that LPA stimulated two sets of receptors, one of which was part of a PTx-sensitive pathway required for matrix contraction, and the other part of a PTx-insensitive pathway leading to MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation.Figure 7Effect of PTx , forskolin, and LPA on MLC phosphorylation. Fibroblasts were incubated overnight with 50 ng/ml PTx as indicated. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and incubated for 1 h in fibronectin-coated T-75 flasks, treated with 15 μm forskolin as indicated for 15 min, and then with LPA (10 μm) for 15 min as shown. At the end of the incubations, cells were harvested, subjected to urea/glycerol-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to MLC. Positions of nonphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated MLC were determined relative to a smooth muscle MLC standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The foregoing results suggested that PDGF and LPA stimulation of contraction could be uncoupled from increased MLC phosphorylation. Consequently, we began to examine the role of other signaling pathways in contraction. As was shown in Fig. 5, cell membrane ruffling increased in response to PDGF. Because PDGF-dependent ruffling requires activation of the enzyme PI3-kinase (28Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that PI3-kinase stimulation might be required for contraction. Fig. 8 shows that the concentrations of wortmannin and LY294002 which blocked PI3-kinase activity blocked PDGF-dependent collagen matrix contraction. In marked contrast, as shown in Fig.9, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 interfered with LPA-dependent collagen matrix contraction. These results suggested a role for PI3-kinase in PDGF- but not LPA-dependent contraction.Figure 9Effect of wortmannin and LY294002 on matrix contraction promoted by LPA . Collagen matrices polymerized for 1 h were incubated with 1 μm wortmannin or 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h as indicated, released, and incubated 4 h with 10 μm LPA. At the end of the incubations, matrix contraction was measured as the decrease in matrix diameter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our studies were carried out to investigate the relationship between PDGF- and LPA-dependent matrix contraction and the ability of these growth factors to stimulate MLC phosphorylation. As discussed in more detail below, increased MLC phosphorylation is neither necessary for PDGF-dependent matrix contraction nor sufficient for LPA-dependent contraction. On the other hand, increased MLC phosphorylation appears to be correlated with formation of stress fibers by cells spreading in monolayer culture. Our findings suggest that the signal transduction pathways required for PDGF- and LPA-dependent matrix contraction involve PI3-kinase and the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins, respectively, whereas LPA-dependent stress fiber formation and MLC phosphorylation involve the small G protein Rho. Overall, the results suggest that growth factor-dependent contraction of floating collagen matrices is uncoupled from an increase in MLC phosphorylation. They do not exclude the possibility, however, that MLC phosphorylation plays a permissive role in contraction. A role for MLC phosphorylation in collagen matrix contraction was suggested previously based on inhibition of contraction by cyclic AMP (16Ehrlich H.P. Griswold T.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1984; 83: 230-233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Ehrlich H.P. Rockwell W.B. Cornwell T.L. Rajaratnam J.B.M. J. Cell.

The current studies confirm that cyclic AMP can regulate contraction, at least contraction dependent on PDGF, but the mechanism of regulation does not appear to require MLC phosphorylation, because an increase in MLC phosphorylation did not occur when the cells were treated with PDGF. In fact, PDGF treatment caused a slight decrease in MLC phosphorylation, at least transiently. It should be noted that fibroblasts in collagen matrices can be stimulated to increase their level of MLC phosphorylation when they exert increased isometric force (29Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10252-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and under these conditions the cells form prominent stress fibers (6Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B.

In marked contrast, fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices remain mechanically unloaded throughout contraction, unable to form stress fibers or fibronexus junctions (32Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell membrane ruffling stimulated by PDGF may play an important role in the migratory activity required for floating matrix contraction. PDGF-induced membrane ruffling depends on PI3-kinase (28Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and blocking PI3-kinase also prevented matrix contraction. At high concentrations of PDGF, the inhibition by PI3-kinase inhibitors appeared to be overcome, at least partially. Interestingly, smooth muscle contraction that is independent of MLC phosphorylation has been reported to involve the protein kinase PAK (33Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y.K. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol.

While our studies were in progress, two other laboratories also showed that blocking PI3-kinase inhibits PDGF-dependent collagen matrix contraction (37Zent R. Ailenberg M. Silverman M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Ahlen K. Berg A. Stiger F. Tengholm A. Siegbahn A. Gylfe E. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unlike PDGF, LPA stimulated both matrix contraction and MLC phosphorylation. The evidence suggests that different signaling pathways were involved, however. LPA activates receptors linked to PTx-sensitive (Gi) and -insensitive (Gq and G12/13) heterotrimeric G proteins (27Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Matrix contraction appeared to require the former; MLC phosphorylation the latter. LPA-dependent, PTx-insensitive, MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation have been shown to depend on activation of the small G protein Rho (12Kreisberg J.I. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J.

In agreement with these previous findings, we observed a correlation between MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation; that is, LPA stimulated both MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation. Moreover, both the basal level of MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation were decreased when cells were treated with forskolin, presumably a result of negative regulation of Rho (42Lang P.

As in the case of smooth muscle, where agonist-stimulated MLC phosphorylation is transient although contractile force is sustained (45Tang D.C. Stull J.T. Kubota Y. Kamm K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11839-11845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LPA stimulation of MLC phosphorylation in fibroblasts appeared to decline by 4 h after stimulation. In marked contrast to the above pathway, little is known about the LPA-dependent, PTx-sensitive mechanism of floating matrix contraction (8 and current studies) other than the presumed involvement of the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Whatever the precise mechanism, the pathway also is likely to be important in other aspects of fibroblast migration and chemotaxis (47Lummen G. Virchow S. Rumenapp U. Schmidt M. Wieland T. Otto T. Rubben H. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 48Pietruck F. Busch S. Virchow S. Brockmeyer N. Siffert W. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This pathway clearly differs from routine cell spreading and stress fiber formation, however, because fibroblasts were able to spread and form stress fibers on protein-coated surfaces under conditions that matrix contraction did not occur (e.g. in the absence of added growth factors or with the combination of LPA and PTx). Cyclic AMP inhibition of PDGF but not LPA-dependent matrix contraction provided further evidence that these growth factors regulate collagen matrix contraction by different signaling mechanisms. The site at which cyclic AMP regulates PDGF-dependent contraction is likely downstream of PI3-kinase. We cannot exclude, however, the possibility that cyclic AMP regulation of PDGF-dependent contraction also occurs at the level of Rho because PDGF-dependent contraction was inhibited by C3 exotransferase (8Grinnell F. Ho C.-H. Lin Y.-C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In summary, our studies suggest that extracellular matrix reorganization leading to contraction of floating collagen matrices occurs by a cell migratory mechanism that can be uncoupled from MLC phosphorylation. Although much is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control cell migration (49Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar, 50Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), most of our understanding comes from monolayer experiments in which there is a competition between adhesion and migration (51Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar).

Serine/threonine protein phosphatases can be classified into several types based upon their substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors, and the requirement of divalent cations for their activation (10Cohen P.

A number of myosin phosphatases have been prepared from various smooth muscle tissues. Pato and co-workers (13Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

SMP-III and SMP-IV dephosphorylated intact myosin, and the characterization of these enzymes indicates that they are similar to type I phosphatases (14Pato M.D. Kerc E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar).It has been shown that myosin preparations contain significant myosin phosphatase activity, suggesting that MLCP associates with myosin. MLCP purified from a smooth muscle myosin preparation (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a type I phosphatase based upon biochemical characterization. MLCP prepared from the actomyosin fraction of gizzard smooth muscle is composed of three subunits, 130, 37, and 20 kDa, of which the 37 kDa is the catalytic subunit (17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Similar phosphatases were subsequently purified by other groups (18Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shirazi A.

Because these smooth muscle MLCPs show an affinity to myosin, it is thought that these phosphatases are responsible for the dephosphorylation of myosin in situ. Consistent with this notion, it was shown that the major myosin phosphatase in skinned smooth muscle is the type I phosphatase.Whereas the isolated RLC can be dephosphorylated by several types of protein phosphatases, only the myosin-associated phosphatase efficiently dephosphorylates intact myosin (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7047-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) phosphatases do not. This suggests that there may be a specific substrate recognition mechanism for dephosphorylation of myosin by MLCP. In the present paper, we studied the role of the N-terminal residues of RLC in dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin. The site specificity of the myosin-associated MLCP was also studied using RLC phosphorylated at various sites.DISCUSSIONWhile isolated RLC can be dephosphorylated by various serine/threonine protein phosphatases (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), not many protein phosphatases dephosphorylate RLC incorporated into the myosin molecule. A type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase has been identified as the physiological myosin light chain phosphatase in smooth muscle (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shirazi A. Lizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we studied the nature of myosin dephosphorylation catalyzed by this myosin light chain phosphatase as presented in this paper. It was shown that the dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19/threonine 18 of RLC is significantly influenced by the presence of the N-terminal amino acid residues of RLC. The critical residues are Ala5-Lys6-Ala7 because the deletion of seven N-terminal amino acid residues markedly attenuates smooth muscle MLCP-induced dephosphorylation while the deletion of four N-terminal amino acid residues does not. An interesting result is that the decrease in smooth muscle MLCP-dependent dephosphorylation is found only when RLC associates with myosin heavy chain. A possible scenario to account for this finding would be that the N-terminal region of RLC is involved in the interaction of RLC with smooth muscle MLCP and that the serine 19/threonine 18 of RLC are somewhat occluded from the smooth muscle MLCP catalytic site in the presence of the heavy chain. It is plausible that the interaction of smooth muscle MLCP with the N-terminal region of RLC increases the accessibility of the MLCP catalytic site to the phosphate moieties of phosphorylated RLC.Previously, it was found that the dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP is significantly affected by the conformation of myosin, i.e. a folded conformation of myosin is highly resistant to dephosphorylation by MLCP (33Ikebe M. Inagaki M. Naka M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10698-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the myosin tail interacts with the N-terminal region of RLC, thus stabilizing the folded conformation, because the mutation of the basic residues at the N-terminal region of RLC abolishes the folded conformation (25Ikebe M. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That result is consistent with the present finding that the N-terminal region of RLC plays a role in the substrate recognition of smooth muscle MLCP. It is plausible that in the folded conformation smooth muscle MLCP cannot access the substrate site because of obstruction by the myosin tail binding to the N-terminal region of RLC.It is known that the rates of phosphorylation of serine 19 and threonine 18 by MLCK are significantly different from each other. In contrast, the rate of dephosphorylation of these sites by smooth muscle MLCP is practically the same. The results suggest that the difference in the phosphorylation level at serine 19 and threonine 18 in cells reflects the difference in the phosphorylation rate of these sites but not by the dephosphorylation process. On the other hand, the dephosphorylation of PKC/cdc 2 kinase sites showed a marked difference in their susceptibility to smooth muscle MLCP. It has been known that PKC phosphorylates threonine 9 several times faster than the serine site in vitro (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phorbol ester, an activator of PKC, induces only serine phosphorylation but not threonine phosphorylation in cells (34Kawamoto S. Bengur A.R. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2258-2265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present result provides a clear answer to this apparent discrepancy. The phosphorylation at threonine 9 would be rapidly dephosphorylated by MLCP in cells but the phosphorylated serine 1/serine 2 would be resistant to dephosphorylation by MLCP. Other protein phosphatases may slowly dephosphorylate the serine 1/serine2 sites in cells because a spontaneously active aorta phosphatase was shown to dephosphorylate both threonine and serine sites with the same rate constant (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that serine 1/serine 2 sites remained phosphorylated in cells after phorbol ester stimulation provides further evidence that MLCP is the physiological myosin light chain phosphatase. The slow dephosphorylation of the serine 1/serine 2 sites was previously shown with crude gizzard phosphatase (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so the present results are consistent with the earlier results.The time course of dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP is explained by a single rate constant. Furthermore, the rate of dephosphorylation of serine 19 is virtually the same for HMM and S1 (not shown). These results indicate that the dephosphorylation process of RLC at serine 19 is random and independent relative to the other head of myosin. In phosphorylation reactions, it has been reported that myosin is phosphorylated sequentially by MLCK,i.e. phosphorylation of the first head is faster than that of the second head (35Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Science. 1981; 213: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 23: 4144-4150Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ikebe M. Ogihara S. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 91: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although this is still controversial. If one accepts the sequential phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK, it would be expected that significantly higher MLCK activity would be required for phosphorylation of the second head and that the majority of phosphorylated myosin population at lower overall levels of RLC phosphorylation in cells would be singly phosphorylated myosin. To date, it is controversial whether or not the motor activity of phosphorylated myosin head is dependent on the phosphorylation of the other head of myosin, but the actomyosin contractile activity as a function of overall myosin phosphorylation in cells could be complex.While the N-terminal region of RLC is important for determining the dephosphorylation rate of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP, phosphorylation at this region, i.e. serine 1/serine2 and threonine 9, failed to influence the dephosphorylation rate of myosin at serine 19. This is in contrast to the MLCK reaction in which the rate of phosphorylation at serine 19 is decreased by phosphorylation at serine1/serine 2 and threonine 9 (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bengur A.R. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7613-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference might be because of a difference in the manner of substrate recognition between the two enzymes because MLCK requires basic residues at the N-terminal side of the phosphorylation sites. This charge interaction may not be critical for the MLCP reaction. The motor function of conventional myosins expressed in smooth muscle as well as nonmuscle cells is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R.

SMP-III and SMP-IV dephosphorylated intact myosin, and the characterization of these enzymes indicates that they are similar to type I phosphatases (14Pato M.D. Kerc E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tulloch A.G. Pato M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they are not inhibited by protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 (14Pato M.D. Kerc E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tulloch A.G. Pato M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is one of the characteristics of type I phosphatase (10Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). It has been shown that myosin preparations contain significant myosin phosphatase activity, suggesting that MLCP associates with myosin. MLCP purified from a smooth muscle myosin preparation (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a type I phosphatase based upon biochemical characterization. MLCP prepared from the actomyosin fraction of gizzard smooth muscle is composed of three subunits, 130, 37, and 20 kDa, of which the 37 kDa is the catalytic subunit (17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Similar phosphatases were subsequently purified by other groups (18Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shirazi A.

Because these smooth muscle MLCPs show an affinity to myosin, it is thought that these phosphatases are responsible for the dephosphorylation of myosin in situ. Consistent with this notion, it was shown that the major myosin phosphatase in skinned smooth muscle is the type I phosphatase. Whereas the isolated RLC can be dephosphorylated by several types of protein phosphatases, only the myosin-associated phosphatase efficiently dephosphorylates intact myosin (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7047-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) phosphatases do not. This suggests that there may be a specific substrate recognition mechanism for dephosphorylation of myosin by MLCP. In the present paper, we studied the role of the N-terminal residues of RLC in dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin. The site specificity of the myosin-associated MLCP was also studied using RLC phosphorylated at various sites. DISCUSSIONWhile isolated RLC can be dephosphorylated by various serine/threonine protein phosphatases (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1987: 381-418Google Scholar, 3Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu.

Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), not many protein phosphatases dephosphorylate RLC incorporated into the myosin molecule. A type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase has been identified as the physiological myosin light chain phosphatase in smooth muscle (16Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Allessi D. MacDougall L.D. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shirazi A. Lizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we studied the nature of myosin dephosphorylation catalyzed by this myosin light chain phosphatase as presented in this paper. It was shown that the dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19/threonine 18 of RLC is significantly influenced by the presence of the N-terminal amino acid residues of RLC. The critical residues are Ala5-Lys6-Ala7 because the deletion of seven N-terminal amino acid residues markedly attenuates smooth muscle MLCP-induced dephosphorylation while the deletion of four N-terminal amino acid residues does not. An interesting result is that the decrease in smooth muscle MLCP-dependent dephosphorylation is found only when RLC associates with myosin heavy chain. A possible scenario to account for this finding would be that the N-terminal region of RLC is involved in the interaction of RLC with smooth muscle MLCP and that the serine 19/threonine 18 of RLC are somewhat occluded from the smooth muscle MLCP catalytic site in the presence of the heavy chain. It is plausible that the interaction of smooth muscle MLCP with the N-terminal region of RLC increases the accessibility of the MLCP catalytic site to the phosphate moieties of phosphorylated RLC.Previously, it was found that the dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP is significantly affected by the conformation of myosin, i.e. a folded conformation of myosin is highly resistant to dephosphorylation by MLCP (33Ikebe M. Inagaki M. Naka M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10698-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the myosin tail interacts with the N-terminal region of RLC, thus stabilizing the folded conformation, because the mutation of the basic residues at the N-terminal region of RLC abolishes the folded conformation (25Ikebe M. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R., II Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That result is consistent with the present finding that the N-terminal region of RLC plays a role in the substrate recognition of smooth muscle MLCP. It is plausible that in the folded conformation smooth muscle MLCP cannot access the substrate site because of obstruction by the myosin tail binding to the N-terminal region of RLC.It is known that the rates of phosphorylation of serine 19 and threonine 18 by MLCK are significantly different from each other. In contrast, the rate of dephosphorylation of these sites by smooth muscle MLCP is practically the same. The results suggest that the difference in the phosphorylation level at serine 19 and threonine 18 in cells reflects the difference in the phosphorylation rate of these sites but not by the dephosphorylation process. On the other hand, the dephosphorylation of PKC/cdc 2 kinase sites showed a marked difference in their susceptibility to smooth muscle MLCP. It has been known that PKC phosphorylates threonine 9 several times faster than the serine site in vitro (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phorbol ester, an activator of PKC, induces only serine phosphorylation but not threonine phosphorylation in cells (34Kawamoto S. Bengur A.R. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2258-2265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present result provides a clear answer to this apparent discrepancy. The phosphorylation at threonine 9 would be rapidly dephosphorylated by MLCP in cells but the phosphorylated serine 1/serine 2 would be resistant to dephosphorylation by MLCP. Other protein phosphatases may slowly dephosphorylate the serine 1/serine2 sites in cells because a spontaneously active aorta phosphatase was shown to dephosphorylate both threonine and serine sites with the same rate constant (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that serine 1/serine 2 sites remained phosphorylated in cells after phorbol ester stimulation provides further evidence that MLCP is the physiological myosin light chain phosphatase. The slow dephosphorylation of the serine 1/serine 2 sites was previously shown with crude gizzard phosphatase (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so the present results are consistent with the earlier results.The time course of dephosphorylation of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP is explained by a single rate constant. Furthermore, the rate of dephosphorylation of serine 19 is virtually the same for HMM and S1 (not shown). These results indicate that the dephosphorylation process of RLC at serine 19 is random and independent relative to the other head of myosin. In phosphorylation reactions, it has been reported that myosin is phosphorylated sequentially by MLCK,i.e. phosphorylation of the first head is faster than that of the second head (35Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Science. 1981; 213: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ikebe M. Ogihara S. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 91: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although this is still controversial. If one accepts the sequential phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK, it would be expected that significantly higher MLCK activity would be required for phosphorylation of the second head and that the majority of phosphorylated myosin population at lower overall levels of RLC phosphorylation in cells would be singly phosphorylated myosin. To date, it is controversial whether or not the motor activity of phosphorylated myosin head is dependent on the phosphorylation of the other head of myosin, but the actomyosin contractile activity as a function of overall myosin phosphorylation in cells could be complex.While the N-terminal region of RLC is important for determining the dephosphorylation rate of myosin at serine 19 by smooth muscle MLCP, phosphorylation at this region, i.e. serine 1/serine2 and threonine 9, failed to influence the dephosphorylation rate of myosin at serine 19. This is in contrast to the MLCK reaction in which the rate of phosphorylation at serine 19 is decreased by phosphorylation at serine1/serine 2 and threonine 9 (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bengur A.R. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7613-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference might be because of a difference in the manner of substrate recognition between the two enzymes because MLCK requires basic residues at the N-terminal side of the phosphorylation sites. This charge interaction may not be critical for the MLCP reaction. While isolated RLC can be dephosphorylated by various serine/threonine protein phosphatases (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R.

https://openalex.org/W2009455337,"We have previously shown that the expression of α5β1 integrin on the cell surface is dependent upon cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and we report here that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) overcomes this requirement in normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts. Thus, suspended NRK cells treated with TGF-β show levels of surface α5β1 integrin that are equivalent to those seen in adherent cells. Moreover, several experiments showed that this effect is necessary for the induction of anchorage-independent growth by TGF-β. First, a kinetic analysis showed that surface expression of α5β1 integrin was restored in TGF-β-treated NRK cells prior to the induction of anchorage-independent growth. Second, NRK cell mutants that have lost their TGF-β requirement for surface expression of α5β1 integrin were anchorage-independent in the absence of TGF-β. Third, an antisense oligonucleotide to the β1 integrin subunit or, fourth, stable expression of an α5-antisense cDNA blocked the ability of TGF-β to stimulate anchorage-independent growth. Thus, TGF-β overrides the adhesion requirement for surface expression of α5β1 integrin in NRK cells, and this effect is necessary for the induction of anchorage-independent growth."

However, the half-life of the chimeric transcript was markedly prolonged after PMA treatment. A cytosolic protein factor from THP-1 cells was found to specifically bind to H-ferritin 3′-UTR.

In mammals, each ferritin molecule consists of 24 subunits of two types, heavy (H)1 and light (L), which are derived from distinct genes and share only about 50% homology in amino acid sequences. It is generally believed that H-ferritin, which contains a ferroxidase activity (3Levi S. Luzzago A. Lesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plays a key role in the intracellular flux of iron, whereas L-ferritin is primarily responsible for the iron storage. H- and L-ferritin combine in variable ratios in different cells or tissues depending on the cellular requirement for iron as well as the differentiation or pathological states. The synthesis of H- and L-ferritin can be regulated by iron at the translational level (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M.

When the intracellular iron concentration is low, a repressor protein would bind to a conserved iron regulatory element located in the 5′-untranslated regions of H- and L-ferritin mRNAs to inhibit the translation of both genes (4Hentze M.W.

Increased iron concentration will lead to the dissociation of the repressor from the iron regulatory element and result in the increase of ferritin synthesis.

It has been shown that differentiation of human leukemia cells leads to an increase in the H/L ratio of ferritin expression (14Chou C.-C. Gatti R.A. Fuller M.F. Concannon P. Wong A. Chada A.

Using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line as a model system, we have demonstrated that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells toward macrophages markedly up-regulates the expression of H-ferritin mRNA, but not L-ferritin mRNA, in a cell-type specific manner (16Pang J.-H.S. Wu C.-J. Chau L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene induction appears to be the result of stabilization of the H-ferritin transcript (16Pang J.-H.S. Wu C.-J. Chau L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since the stability of most mRNAs has been shown to be regulated by sequences in their 3′-UTRs (17Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that an unique cis-regulatory element within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of H-ferritin mRNA is likely involved in regulating the stability of the H-ferritin message in PMA-treated THP-1 cells. In the present study, we identified a pyrimidine-rich sequence within the 3′-UTR of the H-ferritin mRNA to be associated with the message turnover in THP-1 cells. Gel-mobility shift assay demonstrated the existence of a RNA-binding protein in the cytosolic fraction of THP-1 cells to interact with this sequence. PMA treatment down-regulated the binding of the protein factor to H-ferritin 3′-UTR, suggesting that the interaction between the cytosolic protein and the cis element serves as a destabilizing signal to facilitate the degradation of H-ferritin mRNA in THP-1 cells. Human monocytic THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HeLa and hepatoma PLC cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For PMA treatment, THP-1 cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and treated with 100 ng/ml PMA for indicated times. A cDNA fragment spanning the full-length 3′-UTR of the H-ferritin gene (nucleotides −3 to +150, +1 is the first nucleotide after the stop codon) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the human H-ferritin cDNA as the template (18Pang J.-H.S. Jiang M.-J. Chen Y.-L. Wang F.-W. Wang D.L. Chu S.-H. Chau L.-Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2204-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites were created in sense and antisense primers, respectively. The sequences of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides are as follows: sense, 5′-GACAGTGATAATGAATTCTAAGCCTCGGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGGACCAAGCTTCTTTATTTGAAGGAATGG-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of the pGEM11Zf+ vector (Promega). To prepare the constructs containing the mutated nucleotides within the sequence located at nuucleotides +72 to +88 of the 3′-UTR, the sense primers containing mutated nucleotides and theSphI restriction site at the 5′-end were used for PCR. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: M1, 5′-GGCAGTGCATGCATGTTGGGGATACCTT-3′; M2, 5′-GGCAGTGCATGCATGTTGGGGATACCATAACCATATCTAT-3′. The PCR was performed with M1 or M2 sense primer and the antisense primer containing theHindIII restriction site described above. The PCR fragment was digested with SphI and HindIII restriction enzymes and subcloned into the SphI-HindIII site of digested pGEM11Zf+ plasmid containing the wild type 3′-UTR. To construct the luciferase/3′-UTR chimeric plasmid, a cDNA fragment containing luciferase coding sequence was prepared by PCR using pGL2-Basic plasmid DNA as the template. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: sense, 5′-GATCTAAGTAAGCTTGGCATTCCGGTACTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGCTGGATCCAGTTACATTTTACAATTTGG-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the HindIII-BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, to generate pcDNA3-Luc. The cDNA fragment of wild type or mutant 3′-UTR withXhoI and ApaI restriction sites created at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was prepared by PCR and subcloned into the XhoI-ApaI site of pcDNA3-Luc to generate wild type or mutant pLuc-HF-3′UTR. THP-1 cells (2 × 107) were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-Luc or pLuc-HF-3′UTR plasmid DNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation in culture medium for 24 h, cells were divided into 4 dishes and each dish was treated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D for indicated times. Total RNA was then isolated and the expression level of luciferase mRNA was quantified by RT-PCR. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by incubation with 200 units of Maloney leukemia transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 units of RNasin, 0.2 μg of random hexamers, and 0.8 mm dNTPs at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min and the mixture was diluted to 500 μl with deionized H2O. An aliquot (2.5 μl) was taken for PCR amplification with the primers described above for the preparation of luciferase cDNA. The PCR was performed in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 μm of each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction proceeded for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The cDNA was visualized under UV light and the images were analyzed by UVP's Gel Base Windows Software. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 200 ×g for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged again. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After placing on ice for 5 min, cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. To prepare the radiolabeled transcript of the H-ferritin 3′-UTR, the pGEM 11Zf+ plasmid containing wild type or mutant 3′-UTR was linearized byHindIII restriction enzyme digestion. In vitrotranscription was performed with T7 polymerase in a reaction containing 0.4 mm unlabeled ATP, GTP, CTP, 0.04 mm UTP, and 30 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, >3000 Ci/mmol). The 32P-labeled transcript was filtered through a TE-100 Chroma spin column (CLONTECH) to remove free [32P]UTP. For the RNA binding reaction, 10–40 μg of cytosolic proteins were incubated with32P-labeled transcript (30,000–50,000 cpm) in 20 μl of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA for 30 min at room temperature. Twenty units of RNase T1 were added and incubation continued for an additional 30 min, followed by addition of heparin to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml for an additional 10 min. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis performed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel using 0.25 × TBE as electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films overnight at −70 °C. Following electrophoresis of the binding reaction, gel was exposed to x-ray film at 4 °C overnight. The region of specific RNA-protein complex was identified and excised. The protected RNA fragment was eluted from gels by electrophoresis through a NA45 membrane and then recovered from membrane by extraction with high salt buffer. After ethanol precipitation, the recovered RNA was digested with or without RNase T1 (20 units) at 37 °C for 30 min. The 32P-labeled 3′-UTR transcript was also subjected to RNase T1 digestion. The digested products were analyzed by a 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. Following gel-mobility shift assay, the radiolabeled RNA-protein complex band was excised from the wet gel as described above. The gel slice was placed on ice and irradiated under a 254-nm UV lamp at a distance of 4 cm for 20 min. The gel slice was then treated with 50 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A solution at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 6 × SDS sample buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for an additional 30 min, the entire gel slice was loaded into a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. To explore the possibility that the 3′-UTR of H-ferritin mRNA contains a regulatory element affecting mRNA stability, a chimeric luciferase reporter gene construct carrying the entire H-ferritin 3′-UTR at the 3′-end of the luciferase coding sequence was prepared. After transient transfection into THP-1 cells, the expression of chimeric luciferase mRNA was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, insertion of H-ferritin 3′-UTR led to the decrease in the half-life of luciferase mRNA from 8.0 ± 0.5 to 4.5 ± 0.3 h as measured in the presence of actinomycin D. PMA treatment markedly prolonged the half-life of the chimeric transcript to greater than 9 h. In contrast, the half-life of the parental transcript was not significantly altered by PMA treatment. This result supports the idea that the H-ferritin 3′-UTR contains a regulatory sequence mediating the effect of PMA. When the 32P-labeled transcript of H-ferritin 3′-UTR was incubated with the cytosolic extracts prepared from monocytic THP-1 cells, followed by digestion with RNase T1, and analyzed by a native polyacrylamide gel, a RNase-resistant band was observed (Fig. 2). This band was abolished by the addition of proteinase K or SDS in the binding reaction, indicating that it was formed by the interaction of a protein factor with the radiolabeled RNA probe. The RNA binding activity was proportional to the increments of the cytosolic proteins (Fig.3 A). When the radiolabeled antisense RNA probe was used, there was virtually no binding activity detected with the same amounts of proteins. The sequence specificity of the RNA- protein complex was further revealed by the competition experiment showing that the complex formation was inhibited by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled 3′-UTR (Fig. 3 C). Further experiments demonstrated that the RNA binding activity was barely detectable in the cytosolic extracts prepared from HeLa or hepatoma PLC cells, indicating that the protein factor binding to the H-ferritin 3′-UTR is predominantly present in myeloid cells (Fig.3 B). The effect of PMA treatment on the RNA-protein complex formation was examined. As shown in Fig.4 A, the RNA binding activity in PMA-treated THP-1 cells was substantially less than that in control cells. Time course experiments further revealed that down-regulation in RNA binding is evident at 3 h, reaches a maximum at 12 h, and is prolonged to 36 h following PMA treatment (Fig.4 B).Figure 2Formation of RNA-protein complex between the 3′-UTR of the H-ferritin mRNA and the cytosolic extracts from THP-1 cells.

B, the radiolabeled 3′-UTR was incubated with 20 μg of cytosolic proteins from THP-1 cells in the absence or presence of proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) or SDS (0.1%), followed by RNase T1 digestion and electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bovine serum albumin (20 μg) was used as a negative control for the binding reaction.

BSA, bovine serum albumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To locate the sequence interacting with the cytosolic protein factor, the 3′-deletion RNA probes were prepared and used for the binding assay. As shown in Fig. 5, when the RNA probe prepared from the AflII-digested 3′-UTR cDNA template was used for binding assay, the RNA-protein complex was still observed. This complex, however, was not detected by using shorter RNA probes prepared from the SphI-digested DNA template. This result indicates that the sequence responsible for the interaction with the protein factor is located in the region between SphI andAflII restriction sites in H-ferritin 3′-UTR. This sequence was further identified by RNase T1 mapping assay. As shown in Fig.6, digestion of the entire32P-labeled 3′-UTR with RNase T1, which cleaves after each G residue, results in oligonucleotides varying from 22 through 2 bases. When the protected 32P-labeled RNA fragment isolated from the RNA-protein complex was electrophoresed, it migrated as a 22-base oligonucleotide. Further digestion of the protected RNA fragment with RNase T1 did not yield smaller fragments, indicating that the protected RNA is a G-free sequence located at 72–92 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of H-ferritin gene. It was noted that this sequence is rich in pyrimidines, particularly the uridines. To test whether the U residues are important for binding with the protein factor, a competition experiment with various homopolymers of ribunucleotides was performed. As shown in Fig. 7, the formation of the RNA-protein complex could be completely inhibited by excess amounts of poly(U) homopolymers but not by poly(C) or poly(A), supporting that the poly(U) tract is essential for the binding activity.Figure 6RNase T1 mapping of the sequence on 3′-UTR of H-ferritin mRNA interacting with the protein factor.Radiolabeled 3′-UTR or protected RNA fragment eluted from the RNA-protein complex was digested with or without RNase T1 and analyzed by sequencing gel.

After RNase T1 digestion and addition of heparin, the formation of the RNA-protein complex was analyzed by gel mobility shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the role of the U-rich sequence on mRNA stability, the effects of point mutations within the poly(U) tract of the H-ferritin 3′-UTR on the RNA-protein complex formation and the stability of chimeric transcript were examined. As shown in Fig.8 B, substitution of uridines at positions +72 and +74 by adenines (M1) reduced the binding of the cytosolic protein factor to 3′-UTR by ∼50%. Further substitution of uridines at positions +77, +79, +83, and +85 by adenines (M2) completely abolished the binding. When the chimeric luciferase constructs carrying the mutant 3′-UTRs were transfected into THP-1 cells and the stability of their transcripts was assessed, it was shown that the mutant Luc/M1 mRNA has a calculated half-life of 7.4 ± 1.4 h, and mutant Luc/M2 mRNA has a half-life of >9 h. Apparently, both mutant transcripts are more stable than the chimeric transcript carrying the wild type 3′-UTR shown in Fig. 1. As revealed by the transient transfection experiment, the 3′-UTR of the human H-ferritin gene placed at the 3′-end of luciferase gene destabilized the reporter transcript by decreasing its half-life from 8.0 ± 0.5 to 4.5 ± 0.3 h in monocytic THP-1 cells. Nevertheless, PMA treatment significantly prolonged the half-life of the chimeric mRNA to greater than 9 h, indicating that the 3′-UTR contains a sequence determinant mediating the PMA-induced message stabilization in these cells. Identification and sequence analysis of this regulatory element revealed that it is pyrimidine-rich and interacts with a novel protein factor which is present in cytoplasm of THP-1 cells but not HeLa or hepatoma PLC cells. The restriction in cell-type distribution is consistent with the early finding that induction of H-ferritin gene expression by PMA is myeloid cell-specific (16Pang J.-H.S. Wu C.-J. Chau L.-Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When we examined the 3′-UTRs of H-ferritin mRNAs from different species, it is clearly shown that the homologous pyrimidine-rich sequence is present in all of them (Fig.9), indicating that this sequence is highly conserved and may have an important role in H-ferritin gene expression. PMA treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in the decrease of the protein binding to the H-ferritin 3′-UTR, suggesting that the binding protein acts as a destabilizer. A similar phenomenon has been reported in 3T3 cells, in which the induction of ribonucleotide reductase R1 and R2 genes by PMA is associated with the decrease in the binding activities of the RNA-binding proteins to their 3′-UTRs (19Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,20Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, a recent study on human pleural mesothelioma cells has shown that stabilization of the urokinase receptor mRNA by PMA is correlated with the down-regulation of the formation of a urokinase receptor RNA-protein complex (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The competition experiment with homoribopolymers demonstrated the importance of poly(U) within the pyrimidine-rich sequence for the interaction with the protein factor. The correlation between protein binding to the U-rich sequence and message stability was further supported by the observation that mutations in some of the uridines led to the reduction in RNA binding, but increase in the stability of mutant chimeric luciferase mRNA. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of U-rich regions in 3′-UTRs to regulate the message stability in many mRNAs. Accumulative evidence has revealed that the AUUUA pentamer and U-rich sequence present in 3′-UTRs of unstable mRNAs encoding cytokines, lymphokines, oncogenes, and growth factors plays an important role in facilitating the degradation of their transcripts (17Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 23Brawerman G.

The identification of U-rich sequences in 3′-UTRs to control the stability of mRNAs encoding amyloid precursor and GAP-43 proteins has also been reported (25Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J.

Furthermore, the expression of some RNA-binding proteins with preferential binding activity to the U-rich region in RNA has been shown to be implicated in neuronal development inDrosophila, Xenopus, and mouse embryo (29Haynes S.R. Cooper M.T. Pype S. Stolow D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2708-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B.

Whether the protein factor binding to the H-ferritin 3′-UTR would also interact with the U-rich region located in the 3′-UTRs of other genes remains to be clarified. UV cross-linking experiments revealed that the H-ferritin 3′-UTR-binding protein has a molecular size of ∼43 kDa (data not shown). Recently, a number of pyrimidine tract-binding proteins which participate in RNA splicing or belong to a family of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins have been cloned and characterized (24Morris D.R. Kakegawa T. Kaspar R.L. White M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2931-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,32Garcia-Blanco M.A. Jamison S.F. Sharp P.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6910-6914Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These nuclear proteins have apparent size in the ranges of 56–70 kDa and some of them exhibit preferential binding activity to the sequence rich in U. Based on the differences in subcellular localization, molecular size, and the restriction in cell-type origin, the H-ferritin 3′-UTR-binding protein appears to be distinct from these identified pyrimidine-binding proteins. Nevertheless, a recent study has showed that a protein factor which binds to a U-rich sequence in the 3′-UTR of GAP-43 mRNA shares sequence homology with PTB, an identified pyrimidine tract-binding protein implicated in RNA splicing (28Irwin N. Baekelandt V. Goritchenko L. Benowitz L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whether the 43-kDa protein binding to the H-ferritin 3′-UTR is a PTB-like protein is an intriguing question awaiting to be further investigated. It is apparent that disclosure of the molecular nature of this RNA-binding protein should provide insight into the mechanism underlying the differential regulation of H-ferritin gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in myeloid cells."

These include locating an initiation site, overcoming the inhibitory effect of the chromatin structure, assembling a multiprotein complex at the initiation site, and unwinding the duplex DNA. Thus, it perhaps is not coincidental that origins of replication identified to date share striking architectural similarities with transcriptional promoters. Analogous to the TATA box of a transcription promoter, the core sequence of an origin of replication serves as the binding site for an initiator protein which, in turn, nucleates the assembly of a large preinitiation complex. Auxiliary elements, which are located in the vicinity of the core sequence of an origin and contribute to the high efficiency of origin function, usually contain binding sites for those factors that also bind to transcriptional promoters and stimulate transcription (1Heintz N.H.

From a mechanistic perspective, it may be parsimonious for eukaryotic organisms to employ transcription factors to accelerate certain rate-limiting steps that are common to replication and transcription. From a regulatory point of view, these bifunctional transcription factors may play a pivotal role in coordinating gene expression with genome duplication during proliferation and differentiation. A majority of transcription factors have a bipartite structure that contains a DNA-binding domain and transcriptional activation domain. The latter is generally classified with respect to its amino acid composition. These include the acidic (e.g. the herpes simplex virus VP16), the glutamine-rich (e.g. the mammalian Sp1), and the proline-rich domains (e.g. the mammalian CTF1). Similar to transcriptional activation, viral DNA replication can be stimulated by various types of transcription factors. For example, the flanking auxiliary sequences of simian virus 40 (SV40) origin contain binding sites for multiple cellular transcription factors; and the viral DNA replication can be significantly stimulated by transcription factors such as Sp1, CTF1, AP1, and GAL4-VP16 (3Van der Vliet P.C. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 87-118Google Scholar). Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that transcription factors play a similar role in activation of chromosomal replication; and at least in the case of acidic activation domain, the same activator can stimulate cellular replication in yeast as well as viral DNA replication in mammalian cells. For instance, the extensively characterized ARS1 origin of replication contains four genetic elements (A, B1, B2, and B3). The A element is the binding site for the origin recognition complex (ORC)1 (4Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), whereas B1 provides additional ORC contact sites and other functions in activation of replication (5Rao H. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The exact function of B2 remains to be established. The B3 element is a binding site for an acidic transcription factor Abf1p (6Campbell J.L. Newlon C.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 41-146Google Scholar). While the A element is absolutely required for the ARS activity, the three B elements are collectively important for origin function (7Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Abf1p function at ARS1can be replaced by various acidic activation domains tethered to the origin via a heterologous DNA-binding domain. These include those from GAL4, p53, BRCA1, as well as the acidic activation domain of Abf1p itself (7Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chromatin remodeling appears to be an important mechanism used by these acidic-type activators to stimulate chromosomal replication in budding yeast (9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The species-independent activation of replication by the acidic activators is reminiscent of their universal ability to activate transcription in a variety of eukaryotic organisms (10Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 11Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In the current study, two non-acidic activation domains, glutamine-rich Sp1 and proline-rich CTF1, are examined for their ability to stimulateARS1-dependent DNA replication in yeast. While both activation domains are capable of stimulating DNA replication from a plasmid-borne origin, only CTF1 can alter the chromatin structure and stimulate DNA replication at a chromosomally embedded origin. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate DNA fragments that encode the activation domains from Sp1 (aa 149–344 and 263–542), CTF1 (aa 399–499, 399–486, and 486–499), Abf1p (aa 608–731), and BRCA1 (aa 1560–1863). These fragments were subsequently cloned immediately after the region encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–94) in a CUP1expression vector (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All fusion proteins were tagged at the NH2 termini with the hemagglutinin peptide. All yeast cultures were grown in the presence of 100 μm copper sulfate for induction of the fusion proteins. The test plasmids containing a single copy of either mutant or wild-type GAL4-binding sites were described previously (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The test plasmid with five tandem repeats of the GAL4-binding sites was generated by inserting anXbaI-HindIII fragment from the vector G5BCAT (12Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pARS1-B2-B3 (7Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid contains five GAL4-binding sites next to the mutant B3 element. Mutations at the four genetic elements of ARS1 were described previously (13Marahrens Y. Stillman B. EMBO. 1994; 13: 3395-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in the plasmid stability assay (BP1ΔH), two-dimensional gel assay, and MNase digestion experiments (RL1 and RL5) were described previously (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These assays were performed following previously described procedures (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This assay was performed as described previously (9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast nuclei were incubated with a limited amount of MNase for various periods of time. The reactions were terminated and genomic DNA was isolated. For the indirect end-labeling experiment, DNA was digested with EcoRI, resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+ from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membrane was probed with a radioactive RsaI-EcoRI fragment 3′ to theARS1 sequence. For the nucleosome array experiment, the MNase-treated genomic DNA was resolved by electrophoresis without prior restriction digestion and the membrane was probed with a radioactive fragment corresponding to either ARS1 or a genomic region 6 kilobases upstream of ARS1. To synchronize the yeast cells at G1 and G2/M, α-factor and nocodazole were used at final concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. Cells were harvested after 3 h growth in the presence of the arresting agents. It has been shown that several mammalian acidic activation domains can stimulate chromosomal replication in yeast (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether non-acidic activation domains were also capable of stimulating cellular DNA replication, the glutamine-rich domain of Sp1 and proline-rich domain of CTF1 were tethered to ARS1 via the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. These domains were chosen because: 1) they have served as paradigms for the two non-acidic types of activation domains in numerous transcriptional studies; and 2) both proteins have been shown to stimulate viral DNA replication in mammalian cells. Also included in the study as positive controls were GAL4 derivatives containing the acidic activation domains of Abf1p and the breast cancer protein BRCA1, both of which stimulate origin function in yeast (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). First, a plasmid stability assay was used to measure the effects of the various activation domains on DNA replication (7Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The test plasmids contained a functional centromere (CEN4), a selectable marker gene (URA3), and a modified ARS1 with either 0, 1, or 5 GAL4-binding sites replacing the B2 and B3 elements (diagram in Fig.1). Yeast cells containing the test plasmids and GAL4 derivatives were grown for approximately 14 generations in uracil-containing medium, which allowed the cells to lose the test plasmids. The percentage of yeast cells that still retained the plasmid was measured. As expected, GAL4-DBD alone resulted in extremely low plasmid stability, whereas GAL4-ABF1 and GAL4-BRCA1 greatly stimulated plasmid stability in a GAL4-binding site-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The activation domain of Sp1 contains two glutamine-rich subdomains (A and B), each of which is capable of stimulating transcription in higher eukaryotes (14Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, both subdomains of Sp1 and the proline-rich domain of CTF1 significantly enhanced origin function when tethered to the plasmid-borne ARS1. Based upon the strength of activity in relation to the number of the GAL4-binding sites engineered at the origin, these activation domains can be divided into two categories: those that reach maximal levels of stimulation in the presence of a single GAL4-binding site (Sp1A and BRCA1), and those that do so only when five GAL4-binding sites are provided (Abf1p, Sp1B, and CTF1). Taken together with previous work on viral DNA replication, this result suggests that Sp1 and CTF1 can stimulate DNA replication from cellular origin in yeast cells as well as viral origin in mammalian cells. The effect of the Sp1 domain on DNA replication of the ARS/CEN plasmids is in contrast to its behavior in transcriptional activation in budding yeast. Unlike the acidic and proline-rich activation domains that activate transcription in a variety of eukaryotic cells including budding yeast, the glutamine-rich domain of Sp1 has been reported to be transcriptionally inert in S. cerevisiae, at least in the case of a chromosomally embedded promoter (15Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 18Xiao H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This raised the issue whether the Sp1 activation domain used the same amino acid residues for activation of transcription in higher eukaryotes and plasmid DNA replication in budding yeast. To test this possibility, the effects of several known mutations in the Sp1B domain on activation of replication were analyzed in the plasmid stability assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A, wild-type and mutant GAL4 fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels. All mutations are clustered in a glutamine-rich hydrophobic patch (VSWQTLQLQNL), which is critical for the Sp1B domain to activate transcription in higher eukaryotes (19Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). M37 contains a linker substitution mutation (GAAGIRWKIP) that significantly reduces transcriptional activation of Sp1B in Drosophila and human cells. W/A and L/A contain alanine substitutions of either the single tryptophan (VSAQTLQLQNL) or three leucine residues in this patch (VSWQTAQAQNA), and both mutations diminish transcriptional activation (19Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, none of the three GAL4-Sp1B mutants could support plasmid DNA replication in yeast. In contrast, alanine substitutions of two glutamines and an asparagine (Q/A: VSWQTLALAAL) actually resulted in a moderate increase in transcriptional activation compared with the wild-type protein (19Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and interestingly, the same mutant also stimulated ARS function to a greater extent than the wild type GAL4-Sp1B fusion protein (Q/A in Fig. 2 A). In light of the evolutionary distance between human, fly, and yeast, it is remarkable that the Sp1B domain uses the same set of amino acid residues to activate transcription in higher eukaryotes and DNA replication in yeast. In addition to the Sp1 study, the proline-rich activation domain of CTF1 was also dissected in the yeast plasmid stability assay. Previous characterization of the CTF1 activation domain (aa 399–499) reveals a hydrophobic region containing the last 14 residues (DPAGIYQAQSWYLG; aa 486–499) that are critical for CTF1-mediated transcriptional activation (21Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A GAL4-CTF1 fusion protein lacking the last 14 amino acid residues of CTF1 was expressed at the same level as the wild-type protein (data not shown), but it did not stimulate either transcription or plasmid DNA replication in budding yeast (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, a GAL4 derivative containing the 14-aa hydrophobic patch alone was as potent as the full-length CTF1 activation domain in activating yeast transcription and replication (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the minimal carboxyl-terminal domain of CTF1 is both important and sufficient for stimulating transcription and replication from a plasmid-borne cellular origin in yeast. It is known that not every ARS identified in the plasmid-based assay acts as an active origin of replication at its native chromosomal locus (22Newlon C.S. Theis J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By the same token, a GAL4 derived activator that stimulates replication in a plasmid context may not have the corresponding effect on a chromosomally embedded origin. To examine the ability of GAL4-Sp1 and GAL4-CTF1 to stimulate chromosomal replication, the native chromosomal ARS1 was replaced by a modified ARS1 in which all three B elements were abolished and five GAL4-binding sites were engineered (9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (see diagram in Fig.3). Replication intermediates encompassing the ARS1 region were analyzed by a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay, which separated replication intermediates initiated at ARS1 (bubble arc) from those initiated at an origin outside the genomic region being analyzed (Y arc). Using this technique, it has been shown that acidic GAL4 activators such as GAL4-p53 and GAL4-BRCA1 can stimulate chromosomal replication at the native ARS1 locus (8Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in panel A of Fig. 3, GAL4-DBD alone resulted in a very weak bubble signal (indicated by an arrow). In contrast, GAL4-CTF1 (panel B) and GAL4-ABF1 (panel D) gave rise to much stronger bubble signals. A point mutation in the ARS consensus element that destroys function of the nativeARS1 (13Marahrens Y. Stillman B. EMBO. 1994; 13: 3395-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also obliterated the CTF1-enhanced initiation of replication at the modified ARS1 (panel C). This demonstrates that the increased bubble signal in the presence of GAL4-CTF1 indeed resulted from activation of ARS1 rather than a cryptic origin of replication in the nearby region. Curiously, neither GAL4-Sp1A (panel E) nor GAL4-Sp1B (panel F) could stimulate initiation of replication from the chromosomal ARS1 to an appreciable level. This is reminiscent of the behavior of the glutamine-rich activation domains in yeast transcriptional activation (18Xiao H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (see below for more detailed discussion). Thus, while all three major types of mammalian activation domains stimulate plasmid DNA replication in yeast, only acidic activators and GAL4-CTF can stimulate initiation of replication from a chromosomally embedded origin. A recent study suggests that chromatin remodeling is an important mechanism used by acidic activators to enhance origin function in yeast (9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether the non-acidic domains could cause a similar effect on chromatin, nuclei of the yeast cells that expressed various GAL4 derivatives were treated with limited amounts of micrococcal nuclease (MNase), and the nuclease digestion pattern around the modified chromosomal ARS1 was examined by an indirect end-labeling assay (23Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1998; 92: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In keeping with the previous observation (9Hu Y.-H. Hao Z.-L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), acidic activators GAL4-ABF1 and GAL4-BRCA1 caused significant changes in the nuclease digestion pattern at the B region of ARS1 (indicated by asterisks, compare lanes 1and 2 with 5, 6, 9, and 10 in Fig.4). GAL4-CTF1 also induced similar alterations in chromatin structure as the acidic activators (lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, these changes in nuclease sensitivity were not detected in the presence of the glutamine-rich GAL4-Sp1A (lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the effects of the GAL4 derivatives on chromosomal replication correlate with their ability to induce chromatin reconfiguration. The chromatin remodeling could be a cause or an effect of the enhanced initiation of replication at the chromosomal ARS1. To distinguish these two possibilities, GAL4-CTF1 expressing cells were arrested at a non-S phase period of the cell cycle: either G1 with the yeast mating pheromone α-factor or G2/M with the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis showed that more than 95% cells were blocked at the corresponding stages of the cell cycle (data not shown). The asynchronous, G1- and G2/M-arrested cultures were compared for the MNase digestion pattern around the chromosomal ARS1 by the indirect end labeling method. As indicated in Fig. 5, the CTF1-induced changes observed in the asynchronous population (lanes 3 and 4) were also present in both G1- (lanes 5 and 6) and G2/M-arrested cells (lanes 7 and 8). This result suggests that chromatin remodeling is not merely a result of the CTF1-enhanced initiation of replication at ARS1. Rather, it may represent an important pathway through which the activator stimulates chromosomal DNA replication. While the CTF1-induced chromatin remodeling at ARS1 does not depend upon active DNA replication, it may still require the yeast initiator protein ORC, which binds to the origin of replication throughout the cell cycle and serves as a landing pad for loading of other replication proteins (24Dutta A. Bell S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the point mutation at the A element used in the two-dimensional gel analysis (panel C of Fig. 3) was incorporated into the MNase sensitivity assay. This mutation abolishes ORC binding and origin function (13Marahrens Y. Stillman B. EMBO. 1994; 13: 3395-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 26Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig.6 A, the CTF1-induced changes in nuclease sensitivity persisted even in the mutant background (compare lanes 4–6 with 7–9), suggesting that chromatin remodeling by GAL4-CTF1 does not depend upon ORC binding. To confirm the results from the indirect end-labeling assay, the same MNase-digested genomic DNA samples as shown in Fig. 6 A were also analyzed by a nucleosome array assay. In this case, the bulk genomic DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis without prior restriction digestion, and staining with ethidium bromide revealed distinct DNA ladders derived from mono- and oligonucleosomes (data not shown). The MNase digestion pattern around the chromosomal ARS1 was identified with a short radioactive DNA fragment encompassing theARS1 region (Fig. 6 B, top panel). GAL4-DBD alone gave rise to a regular DNA ladder (lanes 1–3, top panel), indicating a canonical chromatin structure at the origin of replication in the absence of a GAL4-derived activator. In contrast, GAL4-CTF1 caused a DNA smear irrespective of ORC binding at ARS1(lanes 4–9, top panel). This is in keeping with the results from the indirect end labeling experiment shown above. In addition, chromatin remodeling by GAL4-CTF1 was restricted to the region around the GAL4-binding sites, as no obvious disruption of the nucleosome structure could be detected at a genomic region 6 kilobases upstream ofARS1 (bottom panel in Fig. 6 B). Both Sp1 and CTF1 are known to stimulate viral DNA replication in mammalian cells. In the current study, it is shown that the activation domains of both proteins are capable of enhancing function of a plasmid-borne cellular origin of replication. Interestingly, both activation domains appear to employ common hydrophobic patches to stimulate transcription and DNA replication. Together with previous studies of acidic activators, this work clearly indicates a high degree of conservation in the mechanisms used by transcription factors to stimulate eukaryotic DNA replication. Furthermore, it supports the notion that activation of replication and transcription may share similar mechanistic pathways. The study also reveals some intriguing differences among the three different types of transcriptional activation domains. In particular, the glutamine-rich domains of Sp1 can only stimulate DNA replication in a plasmid, but not in a chromosomal context. In contrast, the acidic activators and the minimal activation domain of CTF1 can function in both contexts. Furthermore, acidic activators and GAL4-CTF1, but not GAL4-Sp1, can induce changes of the local chromatin structure around the chromosomal origin of replication. These differences may reflect distinct mechanisms used by these activators to stimulate replication. Alternatively, it could merely be due to different affinities of these domains for a common target(s). In the case of acidic activators and GAL4-CTF1, chromatin remodeling appears to be an important mechanism for activation of chromosomal DNA replication. How does the glutamine-rich Sp1 stimulate plasmid DNA replication in yeast remains to be understood. Likewise, it is not known why GAL4-Sp1 fails to induce chromatin remodeling and stimulate replication in the chromosomal context. In light of the differences in chromatin structure between plasmid and chromosome, it is conceivable that the interaction between Sp1 and its putative target, which suffices in activation of plasmid DNA replication, may not be strong enough to withstand the negative effect imposed by the more compacted chromatin structure on chromosome. The behavior of the Sp1 glutamine-rich domains in activation of yeast DNA replication bears obvious similarity to that in yeast transcriptional activation. In contrast to acidic activators and GAL4-CTF that can activate transcription in both budding yeast and higher eukaryotes, glutamine-rich domains are known to be transcriptionally inactive in budding yeast (15Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Georgiev O. Seipel K. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, a recent study by Xiao and Jeang (18Xiao H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggests that, while glutamine-rich domains do not function in a chromosomally embedded promoter in budding yeast, they can significantly stimulate transcription in a plasmid such as a 2-micron based vector. It is reasonable to propose that the lack of Sp1-mediated activation of transcription and replication on the chromosome can be attributed to the same cause, namely, the inability of the glutamine-rich domain to overcome the chromosomal repression. It remains to be determined whether glutamine-rich activators such as Sp1 could stimulate yeast replication or transcription on chromosomes when other transcription factors are present in the same origin/promoter region. The minimal region in CTF1 that mediates chromatin remodeling and activation of DNA replication is mapped to the last 14 amino acid residues of the activation domain of the protein. Interestingly, the same domain has been shown to be responsible for the transforming growth factor-β responsive transcriptional activation by CTF1 in mammalian cells (21Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this domain of CTF1 is also important for the physical interaction between CTF1 and histone H3 (21Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). While the exact target for CTF1-dependent chromatin remodeling and activation of replication in yeast remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to speculate that the histone H3-CTF1 interaction may cause alteration of the local nucleosome positioning, which in turn may facilitate assembly of a preinitiation complex at the origin of replication. The powerful genetic tools offered by the yeast system should allow us to test this hypothesis and to identify other potential targets that mediate CTF1 function in activation of DNA replication.
