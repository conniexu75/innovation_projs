https://openalex.org/W3028711203,"Early detection and effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients remain major challenges. Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model was validated using 10 independent patients, 7 of which were correctly classified. Targeted proteomics and metabolomics assays were employed to further validate this molecular classifier in a second test cohort of 19 COVID-19 patients, leading to 16 correct assignments. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients compared to other groups implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation, complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This study revealed characteristic protein and metabolite changes in the sera of severe COVID-19 patients, which might be used in selection of potential blood biomarkers for severity evaluation."

Methylation of adenosine in mRNA to form N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has important roles in cellular physiology. Initial studies in Arabidopsis and yeast showed defective seed development and sporulation, respectively, upon genomic deletion of the m6A-forming methyltransferase (Clancy et al., 2002Clancy M.J.

Together, these studies show that m6A affects cellular physiology and that these effects likely reflect modulation of mRNA fate by m6A. The effects of m6A in cytosolic transcripts are thought to be mediated by a poorly understood and complex network of interactions between specific m6A sites and specific members of the YT521-B homology Domain-containing Family (YTHDF) family of m6A-binding proteins (Shi et al., 2017Shi H.

The YTHDF family includes three paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3; also called DF1, DF2, and DF3, respectively), each of which has different reported functions; DF1 enhances mRNA translation, DF2 promotes mRNA degradation, and DF3 enhances translation and degradation (Li et al., 2017Li A.

According to the prevailing model (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C.

Based on these studies, each DF paralog mediates the effects of m6A by targeting specific cohorts of m6A-mRNAs, which has led to the major concept that different DF paralogs control distinct physiologic processes (Anders et al., 2018Anders M.

Although the ability of the DF paralogs to bind different m6A sites is fundamental to explain the different biology of the DF paralogs, it remains unclear how they achieve selective binding to different m6A sites. Additionally, the mechanistic basis of the different functions of DF proteins remains unknown, especially in light of their high sequence identity (Patil et al., 2018Patil D.P. Pickering B.F. Jaffrey S.R. Reading m6A in the Transcriptome: m6A-Binding Proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Wang and He, 2014Wang X. He C. Reading RNA methylation codes through methyl-specific binding proteins.RNA Biol. 2014; 11: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we present a fundamentally different model to explain the effects of m6A on mRNA and how DF proteins mediate these effects. In contrast to the prevailing view that different m6A sites bind largely different DF paralogs, we find that all m6A sites bind all three DF paralogs in an essentially similar manner. Thus, all DF paralogs regulate the same mRNAs based on the presence of m6A sites. We also find that DF paralogs are not translation enhancers, as currently thought for DF1 and DF3. Instead, we show that the major effect of the three DF paralogs is to promote mRNA degradation in a largely redundant manner. The redundant effect of DF depletion has not been detected previously because these proteins are typically depleted separately rather than simultaneously. Depletion of only one protein allows for varying degrees of compensation by the other paralogs. Our finding that DF paralogs have similar functions rather than different functions is supported by their essentially identical m6A-binding properties, their similar set of associated binding proteins, and their shared subcellular localizations. Furthermore, we show that the effects of m6A on cellular differentiation can be explained by the combined action of the three DF proteins rather than individual DF proteins. Overall, these studies reveal a new unified model of m6A function in which m6A predominantly influences mRNA degradation via the combined action of the three largely redundant DF proteins. An important concept in m6A-mediated gene regulation is that the different DF proteins bind distinct subsets of m6A residues in the transcriptome (Han et al., 2019Han D. Liu J. Chen C. Dong L. Liu Y.

As a result, m6A is thought to influence mRNAs in different ways, depending on which DF paralog it binds. Based on this, a set of DF1, DF2, or DF3 “unique” m6A sites is commonly used for analysis of the function of each DF paralog (Han et al., 2019Han D. Liu J. Chen C. Dong L. Liu Y. Chang R. Huang X.

Because this m6A-specific binding behavior of the DF paralogs ultimately determines how m6A regulates cellular processes, a major goal is to understand the basis of selective m6A recognition by the DF paralogs. To address this, we first asked whether differences in the YT521-B homology (YTH) domains might account for the different binding preferences of the DF proteins. The YTH domain comprises ~134 amino acids and mediates selective binding to m6A (Li et al., 2014Li F. Zhao D. Wu J. Shi Y. Structure of the YTH domain of human YTHDF2 in complex with an m(6)A mononucleotide reveals an aromatic cage for m(6)A recognition.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 1490-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Patil et al., 2018Patil D.P.

We used the crystal structures of the DF1 and DF2 YTH domains bound to m6A-containing RNA (Li et al., 2014Li F. Zhao D. Wu J. Shi Y.

In the case of DF3, an RNA-bound structure has not yet been reported; however, each of the amino acids that bind m6A and the adjacent nucleotides in DF1 and DF2 is conserved in DF3 (Figure S1A), suggesting that the structural mechanism of m6A binding is the same for all three DF proteins. It remains possible that the few amino acids that differ between the YTH domains (Figure S1A) could affect RNA binding. However, these amino acids map on the surface opposite the RNA-binding pocket (Figure 1A), suggesting that they might not affect YTH-RNA interactions. Furthermore, each full-length DF protein shows a similar binding affinity for an m6A-containing RNA oligonucleotide (Figure S1B), consistent with previous studies (Arguello et al., 2019Arguello A.E.

The different transcriptome-wide binding properties reported for the DF paralogs (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C. YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) could reflect the ability of the different DF paralogs to bind different m6A sequence motifs. m6A residues are almost exclusively found in a single highly conserved sequence motif: DR-m6A-CH (D = A, G, U; R = A, G; H = A, C, U) (Canaani et al., 1979Canaani D.

Moss B. 5′-Terminal and internal methylated nucleotide sequences in HeLa cell mRNA.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the differential association of DF paralogs with distinct sets of m6A sites could be explained by their preferences for certain DR-m6A-CH submotifs, such as GG-m6A-CU versus AG-m6A-CU. To determine the binding preference for each DF paralog, we examined our recently generated transcriptome-wide iCLIP (individual-nucleotide-resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) maps of the binding sites of endogenously expressed DF1, DF2, and DF3 in HEK293T cells (Patil et al., 2016Patil D.P. Chen C.-K. Pickering B.F. Chow A. Jackson C. Guttman M. Jaffrey S.R. m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.Nature. 2016; 537: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We calculated the percentage of each DR-m6A-CH sequence submotif at each DF-binding site identified by iCLIP and ranked the most common sequence submotifs bound by each DF paralog. These analyses showed a nearly identical frequency of each DR-m6A-CH submotif bound by each DF paralog (Figure 1B). The rank order of the prevalence of the submotifs recognized by the DF paralogs was similar to the overall prevalence of each m6A submotif in the transcriptome (Linder et al., 2015Linder B. Grozhik A.V. Olarerin-George A.O. Meydan C. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). Thus, each DF paralog shows the same binding preferences, which largely correlate with the prevalence of m6A motifs, rather than a paralog-specific sequence preference. Although the DF paralogs seem to bind m6A in proportion to the prevalence of the m6A motif, each paralog may be targeted to a different set of m6A sites, as suggested by previous studies (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C. YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2019Shi H. Wei J. He C.

Cell. 2019; 74: 640-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar; Figure S1C). Thus, we sought to identify the m6A sites uniquely bound by each DF paralog. To do this, we quantified the number of DF1, DF2, and DF3 reads from the iCLIP datasets performed in HEK293T cells (Patil et al., 2016Patil D.P. Chen C.-K. Pickering B.F. Chow A. Jackson C.

We could not use the FLAG-DF3 PAR-CLIP dataset (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C. YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) because it contained a low number of reads mappable to cytosolic mRNAs (Figure S1D). Using this m6A-centric approach, we found a strong linear correlation in pairwise comparisons between DF1, DF2, and DF3 reads at each m6A site. This correlation was seen in the PAR-CLIP datasets in HeLa cells mapped onto HeLa m6A sites (Figures S1E–S1F), as well as the iCLIP datasets in HEK293T cells mapped onto HEK293T m6A sites (Figure 1C). Notably, in contrast to the previous model where many m6A sites show DF paralog-specific binding, we found no preferential enrichment of iCLIP or PAR-CLIP reads for any paralog at any m6A site. Overall, these results suggest that each m6A site is bound by DF1, DF2, and DF3 in similar proportions. Because we were surprised by the lack of m6A sites uniquely bound by each of the DF proteins, we reexamined the previously reported DF1 and DF2 unique RNA-binding sites (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C. YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We asked whether DF1 binding, as measured by PAR-CLIP signal, was missing at DF2 unique sites and vice versa. To test this, we plotted DF2 binding at each DF1 unique site and vice versa. This analysis shows that there is a comparable level of DF1 and DF2 binding at each DF1 unique site and a comparable level of DF1 and DF2 binding at each DF2 unique site (Figures S1G and S1H). Thus, the previously described unique sites instead appear to be indistinguishable in terms of their DF1 and DF2 binding. Next, we directly examined the PAR-CLIP reads on individual transcripts proposed to be DF1 unique or DF2 unique. After extensive visual inspection, we found essentially no differences in the distribution of DF1 and DF2 PAR-CLIP reads for any of these transcripts (Figure S1J). Notably, the PAR-CLIP reads correlated with the location of m6A-called sites, supporting the idea that DF binding is due to m6A. A similar effect was seen when using the iCLIP datasets for DF1, DF2, and DF3 (Figure 1D). These data further suggest that the sites that were previously described as being DF paralog unique are not, in fact, unique. Our reexamination of the iCLIP and PAR-CLIP studies contrast with previous reports showing that each DF paralog has only partial overlap with m6A sites and with each other (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Wang X. Lu Z. Zhao B.S. Ma H. Hsu P.J. Liu C. He C.

In the PAR-CLIP studies, DF paralog-binding sites were determined based on a threshold number of misincorporation-containing reads at any individual site in the transcriptome. However, using a threshold approach in independent experiments can often produce false negative sites. These arise because of the arbitrary nature of a threshold, which can cause some sites to be missed when they fall just beneath that threshold. For this reason, the threshold approach is not generally used for comparative analysis of datasets (Chakrabarti et al., 2018Chakrabarti A.M. Haberman N. Praznik A. Luscombe N.M. Ule J.

Short-term memory, a form of memory that covers a timescale of tens of seconds to minutes, is an essential component of several brain functions, from the level of simple reflexes to the level of consciousness and intelligent behavior (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991Squire L.R. Zola-Morgan S. The medial temporal lobe memory system.Science. 1991; 253: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar, Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar).

Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies proposed that short-term memory is held in synapses, suggesting synaptic facilitation as a possible mechanism (Mongillo et al., 2008Mongillo G. Barak O. Tsodyks M. Synaptic theory of working memory.Science. 2008; 319: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, Zenke et al., 2015Zenke F. Agnes E.J. Gerstner W.

The mechanisms and functions of synaptic facilitation.Neuron. 2017; 94: 447-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the idea that synaptic facilitation underlies short-term memory is appealing, the time course of facilitation is fast, decaying within tens to hundreds of milliseconds, whereas short-term memory extends over a much longer timescale. In the hippocampus, a brain region that contributes to short-term memory, information can be held in the circuit for several minutes during delayed match- or nonmatch-to-sample tasks (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991Squire L.R. Zola-Morgan S. The medial temporal lobe memory system.Science. 1991; 253: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar, Deadwyler et al., 1996Deadwyler S.A. Bunn T. Hampson R.E. Hippocampal ensemble activity during spatial delayed-nonmatch-to-sample performance in rats.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 354-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, other forms of synaptic plasticity must be involved. A possible candidate might be post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of short-term plasticity that decays within tens to hundreds of seconds (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Within the hippocampus, PTP shows a unique magnitude at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse, where PTP regulates synaptic strength by nearly an order of magnitude (Griffith, 1990Griffith W.H.

However, the physiological significance and the biophysical mechanisms of mossy fiber PTP are largely unknown. Although previous attempts were made to test whether physiological activity patterns induce mossy fiber plasticity (Gundlfinger et al., 2010Gundlfinger A. Breustedt J. Sullivan D. Schmitz D. Natural spike trains trigger short- and long-lasting dynamics at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in rodents.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Mistry et al., 2011Mistry R.

Dentate gyrus granule cell firing patterns can induce mossy fiber long-term potentiation in vitro.Hippocampus. 2011; 21: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the results remained inconclusive, because the applied patterns were likely recorded from non-granule cells (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, whether mossy fiber PTP forms the basis of short-term memory in the hippocampus remains unclear. To address the functional significance, mechanisms, and possible structural correlates of PTP at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, we combined in vivo recordings from hippocampal granule cells (GCs) in behaving animals, in vitro paired recordings from mossy fiber terminals and postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons (Vyleta et al., 2016Vyleta N.P. Borges-Merjane C. Jonas P. Plasticity-dependent, full detonation at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses.eLife. 2016; 5: e17977Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and functional electron microscopy (EM) analysis of mossy fiber synapses (“flash and freeze”; Watanabe et al., 2013aWatanabe S.

Our results indicate that PTP is induced by physiological GC activity, generated by an increase in the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP), and associated with formation of structural “pool engrams.” To address whether hippocampal mossy fiber PTP is induced by natural activity patterns, we examined the activity of presynaptic dentate gyrus GCs in head-fixed behaving rodents (X.Z., A. Schlögl, and P.J., unpublished data; Figure 1). Simultaneous whole-cell current-clamp and local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed from GCs in the dorsal hippocampus during quiet and running periods (Figure 1A). Analysis of a total population of 43 morphologically identified active GCs revealed that, on average, GCs fired at low frequency (average firing frequency, 0.029 ± 0.011 Hz; mean ± SEM; X.Z., A. Schlögl, and P.J., unpublished data), consistent with previous immediate-early gene expression and Ca2+ imaging studies (Alme et al., 2010Alme C.B. Buzzetti R.A. Marrone D.F. Leutgeb J.K. Chawla M.K. Schaner M.J. Bohanick J.D. Khoboko T. Leutgeb S.

Jessberger S. Helmchen F. Functional imaging of dentate granule cells in the adult mouse hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 7407-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, interspike intervals (ISIs) were widely distributed, indicating that activity was highly patterned (Figures 1B and 1C). ISI distributions were significantly better fit with the sum of three rather than two log-normal components, suggesting that activity was comprised of single spikes, bursts, and bursts of bursts (“superbursts” [SBs]) (p = 0.047; Figure 1C). On average, SBs contained 9.2 ± 0.5 spikes (Figure 1D) and had a mean duration of 603 ± 41 ms (Figure 1E). SBs were significantly more frequent during running than quiet periods (velocity >2 cm s−1, 0.0197 ± 0.0086 Hz versus 0.0073 ± 0.0053 Hz, p = 0.004; Figure 1F). However, the SB frequency was not significantly different between theta and non-theta epochs (theta-to-delta power ratio in the LFP signal >4, 0.0149 ± 0.0069 Hz versus 0.0101 ± 0.0071 Hz, p = 0.309; Figure 1F). Thus, differences in SB frequency may be explained by direct effects of running rather than indirect effects of increased theta activity. The occurrence of SBs was independent of the location of the GC soma (Figure 1G). SBs occurred in 20 of 43 active GCs (Figure 1H, left). Event-based analysis showed that the majority of events (70.7%) were single spikes, whereas 19.1% were bursts, and 10.1% were SBs (Figure 1H, center). However, spike-based analysis revealed that only 16.4% of spikes occurred in isolation, whereas 38.3% and 45.3% occurred in bursts and SBs, respectively (Figure 1H, right). Thus, our results identify SBs as a prominent form of activity in the dentate gyrus. High-frequency extracellular stimulation of multiple mossy fiber inputs, typically by trains of 100 pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz (HFS100APs), is a widely used paradigm for induction of mossy fiber PTP (Griffith, 1990Griffith W.H.

Suares G. Lawrence J.J. Philips-Tansey E. McBain C.J. Differential mechanisms of transmission at three types of mossy fiber synapse.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8279-8289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that the natural activity of GCs is substantially more restricted. First, the low spiking frequency of GCs implies that, among the mossy fiber inputs converging on a single CA3 pyramidal neuron (∼50; Amaral et al., 1990Amaral D.G. Ishizuka N. Claiborne B. Neurons, numbers and the hippocampal network.Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 83: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), only a single mossy fiber synapse will be active at any point in time. Second, the number of APs per SB is significantly smaller than in the HFS100APs protocol. To test whether in vivo-like activity in a single presynaptic terminal is sufficient to induce PTP, we made paired recordings between mossy fiber terminals and postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2). Single presynaptic terminals were minimally invasively stimulated in the tight-seal, cell-attached voltage-clamp configuration (Bischofberger et al., 2006Bischofberger J. Engel D. Li L. Geiger J.R.P.

Borges-Merjane C. Jonas P. Plasticity-dependent, full detonation at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses.eLife. 2016; 5: e17977Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration (Brown and Johnston, 1983Brown T.H. Johnston D. Voltage-clamp analysis of mossy fiber synaptic input to hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 50: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). To determine the threshold for PTP induction, we applied trains of 3, 9, 18, 36, and 72 stimuli to single presynaptic terminals, all at a frequency of 100 Hz (Figures 2B and 2C). Although trains of three stimuli (HFS3APs) did not significantly change the EPSC amplitude, and trains of nine stimuli (HFS9APs) had only subtle effects, trains of 18, 36, and 72 stimuli (HFS18APs, HFS36APs, and HFS72APs, respectively) induced robust PTP (300.1% ± 58.1%, 258.9% ± 62.7%, and 668.5% ± 462%, respectively; 9 mossy fiber terminal-CA3 pyramidal neuron paired recordings; p = 0.007, 0.0117, and 0.0171, respectively; Figure 2D). PTP induced by HFS72APs was only slightly different from that induced by HFS100APs in isolation (432.5% ± 73.9%; 12 pairs; p = 0.025), arguing against cumulative effects in the paradigm. Similarly, trains of 18 stimuli induced robust PTP at near-physiological temperature (Figures S1A –S1C). To quantify the overlap between PTP induction and natural action potential (AP) activity, we plotted the magnitude of PTP against the number of stimuli during induction. We fit the dependence of PTP on AP number with a Hill equation (Figure 2E) and compared the resulting curve with the distribution of the number of APs per SB in vivo (Figure 2F). Consistent with the physiological significance of PTP, the two curves showed marked overlap. Furthermore, quantitative analysis indicated that SBs recorded in vivo in identified GCs induced PTP with an average magnitude of 129% (range, 113%–176%; Figure 2G). To corroborate this conclusion, we directly applied experimentally recorded SB patterns as stimuli in paired mossy fiber terminal-CA3 pyramidal neuron recordings at near-physiological temperature (Figures 2H and 2I). Although SBs with 10 APs induced small but significant PTP, SBs with 24 APs induced marked PTP (9 pairs, p = 0.02 and 0.007, respectively; Figures 2H and 2I). Similarly, SBs with 24 APs induced robust PTP at near-physiological temperature with a near-physiological extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Rancz et al., 2007Rancz E.A. Ishikawa T. Duguid I.

Taken together, natural activity patterns of identified GCs are sufficient to induce PTP at single hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Next we addressed the biophysical mechanisms underlying PTP at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. In the calyx of Held, a synapse in the auditory brain stem in which PTP has been well characterized, PTP is mainly caused by a rise in the release probability (Pr) for each vesicle (Habets and Borst, 2005Habets R.L.

To determine the biophysical mechanisms underlying PTP, we analyzed cumulative EPSC peak amplitudes during 50-Hz test trains of 10 stimuli applied every 20 s (Schneggenburger et al., 1999Schneggenburger R.

Cumulative EPSC peak amplitude was plotted against stimulus number, and data were analyzed by linear regression of the last 3–5 data points (Schneggenburger et al., 1999Schneggenburger R. Meyer A.C.

The size of the RRP was determined as the intersection of the regression line with the ordinate, Pr was measured as the ratio of the first EPSC amplitude over RRP size, and the refilling rate was obtained from the slope of the regression line (Figure S2A). We then measured RRP and Pr before and after PTP induction (Figures 3D–3H). In contrast to our expectations (Habets and Borst, 2005Habets R.L. Borst J.G.G. Post-tetanic potentiation in the rat calyx of Held synapse.J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Korogod et al., 2005Korogod N. Lou X. Schneggenburger R. Presynaptic Ca2+ requirements and developmental regulation of posttetanic potentiation at the calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5127-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we found that PTP was largely mediated by an increase in RRP size. At a time point 20 s after HFS100APs, the RRP markedly increased from 1048.7 ± 204.4 pA during pre-HFS periods to 2541.4 ± 355.6 pA during post-HFS periods (12 pairs, p = 0.002; Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast Pr increased only slightly, from 0.19 ± 0.03 pre-HFS to 0.24 ± 0.03 post-HFS (p = 0.015; Figures 3D and 3F). Furthermore, the refilling rate during the test train was unchanged (10.9 ± 1.8 pA × ms−1 pre-HFS versus 10.3 ± 1.8 pA × ms−1 post-HFS, p = 0.38; Figures 3D and 3G). Consistent with the hypothesis that PTP was generated by a change in RRP rather than Pr, PTP was associated with only a nonsignificant decline in the paired-pulse ratio (p = 0.158; Figure 3C). Additionally, in plots of RRP, Pr, and refilling rate against experimental time, only the change in RRP closely followed the time course characteristic for PTP (Figure 3H). To test whether changes in quantal size (Q) contributed to PTP, we measured miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) before and after PTP induction (Figure 4). After PTP had been induced by HFS100APs in the presynaptic tight-seal, cell-attached stimulation, 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 10 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) were applied to the bath. After transition into the presynaptic whole-cell configuration, low-amplitude pulses were applied to the presynaptic terminal to induce mEPSCs (Figures 4A and 4B). In a time interval 20–60 s after HFS100APs, the mean EPSC peak amplitude was slightly but significantly increased in comparison with later periods (59.9 ± 4.2 pA versus 52.9 ± 3.2 pA, 7 pairs, p = 0.017; Figures 4C and 4D). However, the median EPSC peak amplitude was not significantly changed, indicating an increase in the proportion of larger events (45.7 ± 3.6 pA versus 41.8 ± 3.3 pA, p = 0.12; Figure 4D). Thus, an increase in Q contributes only minimally to hippocampal mossy fiber PTP. The validity of our analysis was confirmed by several additional tests. First, estimates of RRP were largely independent of the fitting range used for linear regression in the cumulative EPSC analysis (Figures S2B–S2G). Second, similar conclusions were reached in the presence of 1 mM of the low-affinity competitive antagonist kynurenic acid, excluding that saturation or desensitization of postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors confounded our measurements (Habets and Borst, 2005Habets R.L. Borst J.G.G. Post-tetanic potentiation in the rat calyx of Held synapse.J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; Figure S3). Third, analysis with an alternative method that assumes that the refilling rate depends on prior release of synaptic vesicles (Thanawala and Regehr, 2013Thanawala M.S. Regehr W.G. Presynaptic calcium influx controls neurotransmitter release in part by regulating the effective size of the readily releasable pool.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) gave similar conclusions (Figures S4A–S4C). Fourth, similar conclusions were obtained at reduced and increased extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (1.2 mM and 4 mM, respectively; Figure S5). Additionally, these results directly demonstrate that PTP-induced changes in RRP are largely independent of Ca2+ concentration-related changes in Pr. Finally, analysis with a model containing three vesicle pools (docked, primed, and superprimed pool; Lee et al., 2013Lee J.S. Ho W.K. Neher E. Lee S.H. Superpriming of synaptic vesicles after their recruitment to the readily releasable pool.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 15079-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Taschenberger et al., 2016Taschenberger H. Woehler A. Neher E.

USA. 2016; 113: E4548-E4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) confirmed that the size of the RRP was increased after PTP (Figures S4D–S4F). Taken together, these results converge on the conclusion that PTP at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapse was primarily mediated by an increase in the size of the RRP. According to our results, PTP was generated by an increase in RRP size. Such an increase may arise from changes in vesicle docking, priming, or both (Imig et al., 2014Imig C. Min S.W. Krinner S.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed functional EM (“flash and freeze”) experiments at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (Watanabe et al., 2013aWatanabe S. Liu Q. Davis M.W.

To mimic the HFS induction protocol used in the electrophysiological experiments, 100 stimuli were applied at the highest possible frequency at which reliable channelrhodopsin stimulation could be achieved (20 Hz). At defined time points after optical stimulation, acute slices were subjected to high-pressure freezing and subsequently processed for EM analysis (Figures 5A and S6).

https://openalex.org/W3032853849,"After injury, the coordinated balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in the microenvironment contribute to skeletal muscle regeneration. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating this balance remain incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in inflammation and muscle regeneration. miRNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of mouse skeletal muscle revealed that miR-223-3p is upregulated in the early stage of muscle regeneration after injury. miR-223-3p knockout resulted in increased inflammation, impaired muscle regeneration, and increased interstitial fibrosis. Mechanistically, we found that myeloid-derived miR-223-3p suppresses the target gene interleukin-6 (<i>Il6</i>), associated with the maintenance of the proinflammatory macrophage phenotype during injury. Administration of IL-6-neutralizing antibody in miR-223-3p-knockout muscle could rescue the impaired regeneration ability and reduce the fibrosis. Together, our results reveal that miR-223-3p improves muscle regeneration by regulating inflammation, indicating that miRNAs can participate in skeletal muscle regeneration by controlling the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in the skeletal muscle microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3028905947,"Homeostasis of neural firing properties is important in stabilizing neuronal circuitry, but how such plasticity might depend on alternative splicing is not known. Here we report that chronic inactivity homeostatically increases action potential duration by changing alternative splicing of BK channels; this requires nuclear export of the splicing factor Nova-2. Inactivity and Nova-2 relocation were connected by a novel synapto-nuclear signaling pathway that surprisingly invoked mechanisms akin to Hebbian plasticity: Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor upregulation, L-type Ca2+ channel activation, enhanced spine Ca2+ transients, nuclear translocation of a CaM shuttle, and nuclear CaMKIV activation. These findings not only uncover commonalities between homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity but also connect homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. The signaling cascade provides a full-loop mechanism for a classic autoregulatory feedback loop proposed ∼25 years ago. Each element of the loop has been implicated previously in neuropsychiatric disease."

Patients and methods A 5-year, prospective, observational, open-label, global study which recruited 30,138 patients across all approved indications. Consenting patients (≥18 years) who were treatment-naïve or previously treated with ranibizumab or other ocular treatments were treated as per the local ranibizumab label. Here, we present the change in visual acuity (VA) (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter score; primary treated eye) at Year 1, as well as the change in VA based on injection frequencies (≤4 and ≥5), treatment exposure, and the overall adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) in treatment-naïve DME patients. Results Of the 4,710 DME patients enrolled in the study, 1,063 were treatment-naïve. At baseline, mean age was 64.5 years, 54.7% were male, and 69.2% were white. At 1 year, mean VA letter score improved by +3.5 (n = 502) from a baseline of 57.7 with a mean of 4.5 injections. Presented by injection frequencies ≤4 and ≥5, VA letter score gains were 0.5 (n = 264) and 6.9 (n = 238) from baseline letter scores of 56.6 and 59.0, respectively. Over 5 years, the incidence of ocular/non-ocular AEs and SAEs was 7.2%/10.1% and 0.3%/5.8%, respectively. No endophthalmitis cases were reported. Conclusions The LUMINOUS study included patients with DME with more diverse baseline characteristics than those in randomized clinical trials. The 1-year data showed improvement in VA with low number of injections in treatment- naïve patients with DME. Greater VA gains were observed in patients who received ≥5 injections. No new safety findings were identified. LUMINOUS confirms the effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab for the treatment of patients with DME in a real-world clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3030440221,"Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) released by damaged cells, and its purinergic receptors, comprise a crucial signaling network after injury. Purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2RX7), a major driver of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and IL-1β processing, has been shown to play a role in liver injury in murine diet- and chemically-induced liver injury models. It is unclear, however, whether P2RX7 plays a role in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and which cell type is the main target of P2RX7 pharmacological inhibition. Here, we report that P2RX7 is expressed by infiltrating monocytes and resident Kupffer cells in livers from NASH-affected individuals. Using primary isolated human cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 expression in CD14+ monocytes and Kupffer cells primarily mediates IL-1β release. In addition, we show that pharmacological inhibition of P2RX7 in monocytes and Kupffer cells, blocks IL-1β release, reducing hepatocyte caspase 3/7 activity, IL-1β-mediated CCL2 and CCL5 chemokine gene expression and secretion, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) procollagen secretion. Consequently, in a chemically-induced nonhuman primate model of liver fibrosis, treatment with a P2RX7 inhibitor improved histological characteristics of NASH, protecting from liver inflammation and fibrosis. Taken together, these findings underscore the critical role of P2RX7 in the pathogenesis of NASH and implicate P2RX7 as a promising therapeutic target for the management of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3028954187,"The development of noninvasive approaches for brain tumor diagnosis and monitoring continues to be a major medical challenge. Although blood-based liquid biopsy has received considerable attention in various cancers, limited progress has been made for brain tumors, at least partly due to the hindrance of tumor biomarker release into the peripheral circulation by the blood-brain barrier. Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles induced BBB disruption has been established as a promising technique for noninvasive and localized brain drug delivery. Building on this established technique, we propose to develop FUS-enabled liquid biopsy technique (FUS-LBx) to enhance the release of brain tumor biomarkers (e.g., DNA, RNA, and proteins) into the circulation. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that FUS-LBx could sufficiently increase plasma levels of brain tumor biomarkers without causing hemorrhage in the brain. Mice with orthotopic implantation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-transfected murine glioma cells were treated using magnetic resonance (MR)-guided FUS system in the presence of systemically injected microbubbles at three peak negative pressure levels (0.59, 1.29, and 1.58 MPa). Plasma eGFP mRNA levels were quantified with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Contrast-enhanced MR images were acquired before and after the FUS sonication. FUS at 0.59 MPa resulted in an increased plasma eGFP mRNA level, comparable to those at higher acoustic pressures (1.29 MPa and 1.58 MPa). Microhemorrhage density associated with FUS at 0.59 MPa was significantly lower than that at higher acoustic pressures and not significantly different from the control group. MRI analysis revealed that post-sonication intratumoral and peritumoral hyperenhancement had strong correlations with the level of FUS-induced biomarker release and the extent of hemorrhage. This study suggests that FUS-LBx could be a safe and effective brain-tumor biomarker release technique, and MRI could be used to develop image-guided FUS-LBx."

In spite of accusations of bias and invalidity, student evaluations of teaching have dominated teaching evaluation at U.S. universities. However, studies on the topic have tended to be limited to particular institutional and disciplinary contexts. Moreover, in spite of the idealistic assumption that research and teaching are mutually beneficial, few studies have examined the link between research performance and student evaluations of teaching. In this study, we conduct a large scale exploratory analysis of the factors associated with student evaluations of teachers, controlling for heterogeneous institutional and disciplinary contexts. We source public student evaluations of teaching from RateMyProfessor.com and information regarding career and contemporary research performance indicators from the company Academic Analytics. The factors most associated with higher student ratings were the attractiveness of the faculty and the student's interest in the class; the factors most associated with lower student ratings were course difficulty and whether student comments mentioned an accent or a teaching assistant. Moreover, faculty tended to be rated more highly when they were young, male, White, in the Humanities, and held a rank of full professor. We observed little to no evidence of any relationship, positive or negative, between student evaluations of teaching and research performance. These results shed light on what factors relate to student evaluations of teaching across diverse contexts and contribute to the continuing discussion teaching evaluation and faculty assessment."

This study aimed to determine the influence of different probiotic formulations on the taxonomic and metabolic profiling of cecal microbial communities, as well as to define associations between cecal microbiota and growth parameters in 21 and 42-day-old broilers. Probiotics investigated included a synbiotic (SYNBIO), a yeast-based probiotic (YEAST), and three single-strain formulations of spore-forming Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (SINGLE1), B. subtilis (SINGLE2) and B. licheniformis (SINGLE3). Dietary inclusion of SYNBIO, YEAST, SINGLE2, and SINGLE3 into the diets supported a significant stimulation of BW and BWG by 7 days of age. Besides, SYNBIO reduced the overall mortality rate by 42d (p<0.05). No significant variation was observed among different probiotic-based formulations for cecal microbiota composition. However, there was a treatment-specific effect on the metabolic profiles, with a particular beneficial metabolic adaptation by the microbiota when supplemented by SYNBIO and SINGLE2. Furthermore, the population of Lactobacillales was identified to be strongly associated with lower Enterobacteriales colonization, higher BW means, and lower mortality rate of growing broilers. Overall, the results emphasize that probiotic supplementation may enhance the microbial energy metabolism in the ceca of young broilers."
https://openalex.org/W3030859506,"According to life history theory, natural selection has shaped trade-offs for allocating energy among growth, reproduction and maintenance to maximize individual fitness. In social mammals body size and dominance rank are two key variables believed to influence female reproductive success. However, few studies have examined these variables together, particularly in long-lived species. Previous studies found that female dominance rank correlates with reproductive success in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which is surprising given they have weak dominance relationships and experience seemingly low levels of feeding competition. It is not currently known whether this relationship is primarily driven by a positive correlation between rank and body size. We used the non-invasive parallel laser method to measure two body size variables (back breadth and body length) of 34 wild adult female mountain gorillas, together with long-term dominance and demography data to investigate the interrelationships among body size, dominance rank and two measures of female reproductive success (inter-birth interval N = 29 and infant mortality N = 64). Using linear mixed models, we found no support for body size to be significantly correlated with dominance rank or female reproductive success. Higher-ranking females had significantly shorter inter-birth intervals than lower-ranking ones, but dominance rank was not significantly correlated with infant mortality. Our results suggest that female dominance rank is primarily determined by factors other than linear body dimensions and that high rank provides benefits even in species with weak dominance relationships and abundant year-round food resources. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms behind heterogeneity in female body size in relation to trade-offs in allocating energy to growth, maintenance and lifetime reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W3031220972,"Metal contamination of food and water resources is a known public health issue in Arctic and sub-Arctic communities due to the proximity of many communities to mining and drilling sites. In addition, permafrost thaw may release heavy metals sequestered in previously frozen soils, potentially contaminating food and water resources by increasing the concentration of metals in freshwater, plants, and wildlife. Here we assess the enrichment of selected heavy metals in Alaskan soils by synthesizing publicly available data of soil metal concentrations. We analyzed data of soil concentrations of arsenic, chromium, mercury, nickel, and lead from over 1,000 samples available through the USGS Alaskan Geochemical Database to evaluate 1) the spatial distribution of sampling locations for soil metal analysis, 2) metal concentrations in soils from different land cover types and depths, and 3) the occurrence of soils in Alaska with elevated metal concentrations relative to other soils. We found substantial clustering of sample sites in the southwestern portion of Alaska in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost, while the continuous permafrost zone in Northern Alaska and the more populous Interior are severely understudied. Metal concentration varied by land cover type but lacked consistent patterns. Concentrations of chromium, mercury, and lead were higher in soils below 10 cm depth, however these deeper soils are under-sampled. Arsenic, chromium, mercury, nickel and lead concentrations exceeded average values for US soils by one standard deviation or more in 3.7% to 18.7% of the samples in this dataset. Our analysis highlights critical gaps that impede understanding of how heavy metals in thawing permafrost soils may become mobilized and increase exposure risk for Arctic communities."

However, studies addressing the variability of root exudates involved in phosphorus solubilization across plant developmental stages remain scarce. Here, we grew Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in sterile liquid culture with a low, medium, or high concentration of phosphate and measured the composition of the root exudate at seedling, vegetative, and bolting stages. The exudates changed in response to the incremental addition of phosphorus, starting from the vegetative stage. Specific metabolites decreased in relation to phosphate concentration supplementation at specific stages of development. Some of those metabolites were tested for their phosphate solubilizing activity, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, malic acid, and nicotinic acid were able to solubilize calcium phosphate from both solid and liquid media. In summary, our data suggest that plants can release distinct compounds to deal with phosphorus deficiency needs influenced by the phosphorus nutritional status at varying developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W3028969943,"Several studies have shown the ubiquitous presence of bacteria in hospital surfaces, staff, and patients. Frequently, these bacteria are related to HAI (healthcare-associated infections) and carry antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These HAI-related bacteria contribute to a major public health issue by increasing patient morbidity and mortality during or after hospital stay. Bacterial high-throughput amplicon gene sequencing along with identification of AMR genes, as well as whole genome sequencing (WGS), are biotechnological tools that allow multiple-sample screening for a diversity of bacteria. In this paper, we used these methods to perform a one-year cross sectional profiling of bacteria and AMR genes in adult and neonatal intensive care units (ICU and NICU) in a Brazilian public, tertiary hospital. Our results showed high abundances of HAI-related bacteria such as S. epidermidis, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii complex, E. coli, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa in patients and hospital surfaces. Most abundant AMR genes detected throughout ICU and NICU were mecA, blaCTX-M-1 group, blaSHV-like, and blaKPC-like. We found that NICU environment and patients were more widely contaminated with pathogenic bacteria than ICU. Patient samples, despite the higher bacterial load, have lower bacterial diversity than environmental samples in both units. Finally, we also identified contamination hotspots in the hospital environment showing constant frequencies of bacterial and AMR contamination throughout the year. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), 16S rRNA oligotypes, and AMR identification allowed a high-resolution characterization of the hospital microbiome profile."
https://openalex.org/W3031084608,"CYP51 enzymes (sterol 14α-demethylases) are cytochromes P450 that catalyze multistep reactions. The CYP51 reaction occurs in all biological kingdoms and is essential in sterol biosynthesis. It removes the 14α-methyl group from cyclized sterol precursors by first forming an alcohol, then an aldehyde, and finally eliminating formic acid with the introduction of a Δ14–15 double bond in the sterol core. The first two steps are typical hydroxylations, mediated by an electrophilic compound I mechanism. The third step, C–C bond cleavage, has been proposed to involve either compound I (i.e. FeO3+) or, alternatively, a proton transfer-independent nucleophilic ferric peroxo anion (compound 0, i.e. Fe3+O2–). Here, using comparative crystallographic and biochemical analyses of WT human CYP51 (CYP51A1) and its D231A/H314A mutant, whose proton delivery network is destroyed (as evidenced in a 1.98-A X-ray structure in complex with lanosterol), we demonstrate that deformylation of the 14α-carboxaldehyde intermediate requires an active proton relay network to drive the catalysis. These results indicate a unified, compound I-based mechanism for all three steps of the CYP51 reaction, as previously established for CYP11A1 and CYP19A1. We anticipate that our approach can be applied to mechanistic studies of other P450s that catalyze multistep reactions, such as C–C bond cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W3029799061,"Cell morphology of filamentous microorganisms is highly interesting during cultivations as it is often linked to productivity and can be influenced by process conditions. Hence, the characterization of cell morphology is of major importance to improve the understanding of industrial processes with filamentous microorganisms. For this purpose, reliable and robust methods are necessary. In this study, pellet morphology and physiology of the rebeccamycin producing filamentous actinomycete Lentzea aerocolonigenes were investigated by microscopy and flow cytometry. Both methods were compared regarding their applicability. To achieve different morphologies, a cultivation with glass bead addition (Ø = 969 μm, 100 g L-1) was compared to an unsupplemented cultivation. This led to two different macro-morphologies. Furthermore, glass bead addition increased rebeccamycin titers after 10 days of cultivation (95 mg L-1 with glass beads, 38 mg L-1 without glass beads). Macro-morphology and viability were investigated through microscopy and flow cytometry. For viability assessment fluorescent staining was used additionally. Smaller, more regular pellets were found for glass bead addition. Pellet diameters resulting from microscopy followed by image analysis were 172 μm without and 106 μm with glass beads, diameters from flow cytometry were 170 and 100 μm, respectively. These results show excellent agreement of both methods, each considering several thousand pellets. Furthermore, the pellet viability obtained from both methods suggested an enhanced metabolic activity in glass bead treated pellets during the exponential production phase. However, total viability values differ for flow cytometry (0.32 without and 0.41 with glass beads) and confocal laser scanning microscopy of single stained pellet slices (life ratio in production phase of 0.10 without and 0.22 with glass beads), which is probably caused by the different numbers of investigated pellets. In confocal laser scanning microscopy only one pellet per sample could be investigated while flow cytometry considered at least 50 pellets per sample, resulting in an increased statistical reliability."
https://openalex.org/W3030748629,"To reach WHO End tuberculosis (TB) targets, countries need a quality-assured laboratory network equipped with rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing. Diagnostic network analysis aims to inform instrument placement, sample referral, staffing, geographical prioritization, integration of testing enabling targeted investments and programming to meet priority needs.Supply chain modelling and optimization software was used to map Lesotho's TB diagnostic network using available data sources, including laboratory and programme reports and health and demographic surveys. Various scenarios were analysed, including current network configuration and inclusion of additional GeneXpert and/or point of care instruments. Different levels of estimated demand for testing services were modelled (current [30,000 tests/year], intermediate [41,000 tests/year] and total demand needed to find all TB cases [88,000 tests/year]).Lesotho's GeneXpert capacity is largely well-located but under-utilized (19/24 sites use under 50% capacity). The network has sufficient capacity to meet current and near-future demand and 70% of estimated total demand. Relocation of 13 existing instruments would deliver equivalent access to services, maintain turnaround time and reduce costs compared with planned procurement of 7 more instruments. Gaps exist in linking people with positive symptom screens to testing; closing this gap would require extra 11,000 tests per year and result in 1000 additional TB patients being treated. Closing the gap in linking diagnosed patients to treatment would result in a further 629 patients being treated. Scale up of capacity to meet total demand will be best achieved using a point-of-care platform in addition to the existing GeneXpert footprint.Analysis of TB diagnostic networks highlighted key gaps and opportunities to optimize services. Network mapping and optimization should be considered an integral part of strategic planning. By building efficient and patient-centred diagnostic networks, countries will be better equipped to meet End TB targets."

So, we attempted to find out mutations at one of the driver genes, CASP8, in cancer and adjacent leukoplakia tissues. Patients (n = 27), affected by both of cancer and adjacent leukoplakia, were recruited for the study. Blood and tissue DNA samples were used to identify somatic mutations at CASP8 by next generation sequencing method. In total, 56% (15 out of 27) cancer and 30% (8 out of 27) leukoplakia tissues had CASP8 somatic mutations. In 8 patients, both cancer and adjacent leukoplakia tissues, located within 2–5 cm of tumor sites, had identical somatic mutations. But, in 7 patients, cancer samples had somatic mutations but none of the leukoplakia tissues, located beyond 5cm of tumor sites, had somatic mutations. Mutated allele frequencies at CASP8 were found to be more in cancer compared to adjacent leukoplakia tissues. This study provides mutational evidence that oral cancer might have progressed from previously grown leukoplakia lesion. Leukoplakia tissues, located beyond 5cm of cancer sites, were free from mutation. The study implies that CASP8 mutation could be one of the signatures for some of the leukoplakia to progress to oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3030572332,"Background To elucidate the possible effect of various systemic factors on intraocular pressure (IOP) using a dataset from a health examination program database in Japan. Methods This cross-sectional study included 1569 subjects selected from the 2287 subjects who comprised the database. Various systemic parameters including age, sex, height, body weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, body mass index, 28 blood examination values, intimal medial thicknesses of both carotid arteries, and intraocular pressure (IOP) values measured by non-contact tonometry in both eyes were collected. The possible correlation between the IOP and other parameters was assessed initially by univariate analyses followed by multivariate analyses. Results Stepwise multivariate analyses, which included all parameters extracted by the univariate analyses (p<0.1) and sex, identified the same six parameters as indicators of the IOP values for each right and left IOP model. Among the parameters, age (r = -0.05 and -0.04/year for right and left IOPs, respectively) was associated negatively and the percent body fat (r = 0.06 and 0.05/%), systolic BP (r = 0.02 and 0.03/mmHg), pulse rate (r = 0.03 and 0.03/counts/minutes), albumin (r = 1.12 and 1.00/g/dL), and hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.38 and 0.44/%) were associated positively with the IOP in each eye. Conclusions Older age was associated with low IOP, while factors reflecting the metabolic syndrome were associated with high IOP in our study population."
https://openalex.org/W3031691214,"Background Severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) are currently treated with different food products in separate treatment programs. The development of a unified and simplified treatment protocol using a single food product aims to increase treatment program efficiency and effectiveness. This study, the first stage of the ComPAS trial, sought to assess rate of growth and energy requirements among children recovering from acute malnutrition in order to design a simplified, MUAC-based dosage protocol. Methods We obtained secondary data from patient cards of children aged 6–59 months recovering from SAM in outpatient therapeutic feeding programs (TFPs) and from MAM in supplementary feeding programs (SFPs) in five countries in Africa and Asia. We used local polynomial smoothing to assess changes in MUAC and proportional weight gain between clinic visits and assessed their normalized differences for a non-zero linear trend. We estimated energy needs to meet or exceed the growth observed in 95% of visits. Results This analysis used data from 5518 patients representing 33942 visits. Growth trends in MUAC and proportional weight gain were not significantly different, each lower at higher MUAC values: MUAC growth averaged 2mm/week at lower MUACs (100 to <110mm) and 1mm/week at higher MUACs (120mm to <125mm); and proportional weight gain declined from 3.9g/kg/day to 2.4g/kg/day across the same MUAC values. In 95% of visits by children with a MUAC 100mm to <125mm who were successfully treated, energy needs could be met or exceeded with 1,000 kilocalories a day. Conclusion Two 92g sachets of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) (1,000kcal total) is proposed to meet the estimated total energy requirements of children with a MUAC 100mm to <115mm, and one 92g sachet of RUTF (500kcal) is proposed to meet half the energy requirements of children with a MUAC of 115 to <125mm. A simplified, combined protocol may enable a more holistic continuum of care, potentially contributing to increased coverage for children suffering from acute malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3029706773,"The hydrophobicity of nanoparticles (NPs) is a key property determining environmental fate, biological partitioning and toxicity. However, methods to characterize surface hydrophobicity are not uniformly applied to NPs and cannot quantify surface changes in complex environments. Existing methods designed to evaluate the hydrophobicity of bulk solids, chemicals, and proteins have significant limitations when applied to NPs. In this study, we modified and evaluated two methods to determine the hydrophobicity of NPs, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and dye adsorption, and compared them to the standard octanol-water partitioning protocol for chemicals. Gold, copper oxide, silica, and amine-functionalized silica NPs were used to evaluate methods based on their applicability to NPs that agglomerate and have surface coatings. The octanol water partitioning and HIC methods both measured Au NPs as hydrophilic, but despite having a small size and stable suspension, NPs could not be fully recovered from the HIC column. For the dye adsorption method, hydrophobic (Rose Bengal) and hydrophilic (Nile Blue) dyes were adsorbed to the NP surface, and linear isotherm parameters were used as a metric for hydrophobicity. CuO was determined to be slightly hydrophilic, while SiO2 was hydrophilic and Ami-SiO2 was hydrophobic. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed, and the dye adsorption method is recommended as the most suitable for application across broad classes of nanomaterials. The dye assay method was further used to measure changes in the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2 NPs after being suspended in natural water collected from the Alsea Rivers watershed in Oregon. TiO2 NPs adsorbed Rose Bengal when suspended in ultrapure water, but adsorbed Nile Blue after being incubated in natural water samples, demonstrating a shift from hydrophobic to hydrophilic properties on the outer surface. The dye adsorption method can be applied to characterize surface hydrophobicity of NPs and quantify environmental transformations, potentially improving environmental fate models."
https://openalex.org/W3028661271,"Smaller hippocampal volumes are among the most consistently reported neuroimaging findings in schizophrenia. However, little is known about hippocampal volumes in people who report psychotic experiences. This study investigated differences in hippocampal volume between young people without formal diagnoses who report psychotic experiences (PEs) and those who do not report such experiences. This study also investigated if any differences persisted over two years.A nested case-control study of 25 adolescents (mean age 13.5 years) with reported PEs and 25 matched controls (mean age 13.36 years) without PEs were drawn from a sample of 100 local schoolchildren. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical imaging and subsequent automated cortical segmentation (Freesurfer 6.0) was undertaken to determine total hippocampal volumes. Comprehensive semi-structured clinical interviews were also performed including information on PEs, mental diagnoses and early life stress (bullying). Participants were invited for a second scan at two years.19 adolescents with PEs and 19 controls completed both scans. Hippocampal volumes were bilaterally lower in the PE group compared to the controls with moderate effects sizes both at baseline [left hippocampus p = 0.024 d = 0.736, right hippocampus p = 0.018, d = 0.738] and at 2 year follow up [left hippocampus p = 0.027 d = 0.702, right = 0.048 d = 0.659] throughout. These differences survived adjustment for co-morbid mental disorders and early life stress.Psychotic experiences are associated with total hippocampal volume loss in young people and this volume loss appears to be independent of possible confounders such as co-morbid disorders and early life stress."
https://openalex.org/W3029567294,"Diminished somatosensory function is a critical age-related change which is related to postural instability in the older population. Footwear is a cost-effective way to modulate the postural stability by altering sensorimotor inputs via mechanoreceptors on the plantar surface of the feet. Compared to insoles with indentions in the entire surface, we innovatively developed a textured insole with site-specific nodulous protrudous. This study thus aimed to investigate the immediate effect of the nodulous insole and supporting surface condition on static postural stability and lower limb muscle activation for healthy older women.This is a single-session study with repeated measurements. Twenty-three healthy older women stood on the firm (i.e., concrete floor) and foam surfaces with their eyes open in the three footwear conditions, namely barefoot, plain shoes and shoes with an innovative textured insole, for 30 seconds. Static postural sway and muscle activation of biceps femoris (BF), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) of the dominant leg were measured during each testing condition.Compared to a firm surface, standing on the foam could significantly increase the body sway and lower limb muscle activation (p<0.05). When standing on the foam, compared to barefoot, wearing footwear significantly decreased the VL and TA muscle activation and minimize the postural sway in medial-lateral and anterior-posterior direction, while the influence is larger for the shoes with nodulous insloe compared to the plain shoes. No significant differences between the footwear conditions for static stability and muscle activation were observed on firm surface condition.For older women, footwear could improve the postural stability in the unstable surface, particularly the footwear with nodulous insole, with the underlying mechanism as enhancing the mechanoreceptors on the plantar surface of the feet."
https://openalex.org/W3029651785,"Breast cancer survivors (BCS) are often characterized by decreased pressure pain thresholds (PPT), range of motion (ROM) and strength in and around the shoulder affected by the treatment. This intra-rater reliability study was to establish the relative and absolute reliability of PPT's, active ROM and maximal isokinetic muscle strength (MIMS) of the affected shoulder in BCS with persistent pain after treatment.Twenty-one BCS participated in the study. The PPTs of 17 locations and pain intensity were assessed using a pressure algometer and a numeric rating scale. The ROM was measured using a universal goniometer and MIMS was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Relative reliability was estimated using intra class correlation coefficient (ICC), and absolute reliability using standard error of measurement (SEM). Minimum detectable change (MDC) was calculated from SEM.The ICCs for PPTs ranged from 0.88-0.97, with SEM values ranging from 12.0 to 28.2 kPa and MDC ranging from 33.2 to 78.2 kPa. The ICCs for ROM ranged from 0.66-0.97, with SEM values ranging from 3.0 to 7.5° and MDC ranging from 8.4 to 20.8°. Finally, ICCs for MIMS ranged from 0.62-0.92, with SEM values ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 Nm/Kg FFM and MDC ranging from 0.09 to 0.19 Nm/kg FFM.The results of this study indicate that PPTs, ROM and MIMS can be measured reliably on the affected shoulder in BCS with pain after treatment. This offer the possibility of using these measures to assess the effectiveness of interventions in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3031153615,"Food insecurity is a looming threat for the burgeoning world population. Phosphorus (P), which is absorbed from soil as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential macronutrient for the growth of all agricultural crops. This study reports phenotype analysis for P responses in natural field and greenhouse conditions, using 54 genotypes of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) representing wide geographic origins. The genotype responses were assessed in natural field conditions in two different seasons (monsoon and summer) under Pi-fertilized (P+) and unfertilized (P-) soil for eight above-ground traits. Enormous variations were seen among the genotypes in phenotypic responses for all the measured parameters under low P stress conditions. Variations were significant for plant height, leaf number and length, tillering ability and seed yield traits. Genotypes ISe 1234 and ISe 1541 were P+ responders, and the genotypes ISe 1181, ISe 1655, ISe 783 and ISe 1892 showed tolerance to low P for total seed yield. Genotypes that performed well under P- conditions were almost as productive as genotypes that performed well under P+ conditions suggesting some genotypes are well adapted to nutrient-poor soils. In the greenhouse, most of the genotypes produced changes in root architecture that are characteristic of P- stress, but to differing degrees. Significant variation was seen in root hair density and root hair number and in fresh and dry weight of shoot and root under P- stress. However, there was not much difference in the shoot and root total P and Pi levels of five selected high and low responding genotypes. We noticed contrasting responses in the greenhouse and natural field experiments for most of these genotypes. The leads from the study form the basis for breeding and improvement of foxtail millet for better Pi-use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3028604291,"Background Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death after trauma and childbirth. In response to severe hemorrhage, bleeding patients often receive transfusions of red blood cells, plasma, platelets, or other blood components. We examined risk factors for transfusion in acute severe bleeding in two trials of over 20,000 patients to better understand factors associated with transfusion likelihood. Study design and methods We conducted a cohort analysis of data from the CRASH-2 and WOMAN trials, two multinational trials that recruited patients with traumatic and postpartum hemorrhage, respectively. For each trial, we examined the effect of 10 factors on blood transfusion likelihood. Univariate and multivariate Poisson regressions were used to analyze the relationship between risk factors and blood transfusion. Results Of the 20,207 traumatic hemorrhage patients, 10,232 (51%) received blood components. Of the 20,060 women with postpartum hemorrhage, 10,958 (55%) received blood components. For patients who suffered from traumatic hemorrhage, those greater than three hours from injury to hospitalization were more likely to be transfused (ARR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.20–1.56). Postpartum hemorrhage patients had an increased likelihood of transfusion if they gave birth outside the hospital (ARR 1.30; 95% CI 1.22–1.39), gave birth more than three hours before hospitalization (ARR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01–1.17), had a Caesarean section (ARR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08–1.25), and if they had any identifiable causes of hemorrhage other than uterine atony. Conclusion Several risk factors are associated with an increased likelihood of transfusion in traumatic and postpartum hemorrhage patients. Altering modifiable factors, by reducing time from injury or childbirth to hospitalization, for example, might be able to reduce transfusions and their complications.

https://openalex.org/W3032833570,"Walking stability is achieved by adjusting the medio-lateral and anterior-posterior dimensions of the base of support (step length and step width, respectively) to contain an extrapolated center of mass. We aimed to calculate total recovery time after different types of perturbations during walking, and use it to compare young and older adults following different types of perturbations. Walking trials were performed in 12 young (age 26.92 ± 3.40 years) and 12 older (age 66.83 ± 1.60 years) adults. Perturbations were introduced at different phases of the gait cycle, on both legs and in anterior-posterior or medio-lateral directions, in random order. A novel algorithm was developed to determine total recovery time values for regaining stable step length and step width parameters following the different perturbations, and compared between the two participant groups under low and high cognitive load conditions, using principal component analysis (PCA). We analyzed 829 perturbations each for step length and step width. The algorithm successfully estimated total recovery time in 91.07% of the runs. PCA and statistical comparisons showed significant differences in step length and step width recovery times between anterior-posterior and medio-lateral perturbations, but no age-related differences. Initial analyses demonstrated the feasibility of comparisons based on total recovery time calculated using our algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3028997526,"Introduction Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a very sensitive technique that often depicts prominent focal veins (PFV) in patients with acute migraine with aura (MwA). Interpretation of visual venous asymmetry (VVA) between brain hemispheres on SWI may help support the clinical diagnosis of MwA. Our goal was to develop an automated algorithm for segmentation and quantification of cerebral veins using SWI. Materials and methods Expert readers visually evaluated SWI of patients with acute MwA for VVA. Subsequently a fully automated algorithm based on 3D normalization and 2D imaging processing using SPM and MATLAB image processing software including top-hat transform was used to quantify cerebral veins and to calculate volumetric differences between hemispheres. Results Fifty patients with MwA were examined with SWI. VVA was present in 20 of 50 patients (40%). In 95% of patients with VVA, the fully automated calculation agreed with the side that visually harboured more PFV. Our algorithm showed a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 90% and accuracy of 92% for detecting VVA. Patients with VVA had significantly larger vein volume on the hemisphere with more PFV compared to patients without (15.90 ± 5.38 ml vs 11.93 ± 5.31 ml; p = 0.013). The mean difference in venous volume between hemispheres in patients with VVA was larger compared to patients without VVA (16.34 ± 7.76% vs 4.31 ± 3.26% p < 1E-10). The average time between aura onset and SWI correlated negatively with venous volume of the dominant brain hemisphere (r = -0.348; p = 0.038). Conclusion A fully automated algorithm can accurately identify and quantify cerebral venous distribution on SWI. Absolute quantification may be useful for the future assessment of patients with suspected diseases, which may be associated with a unilateral abnormal degree of venous oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W3031719654,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), together with its subtype muscle dysmorphia (MD), has been relocated from the Somatoform Disorders category in the DSM-IV to the newly created Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders category in the DSM-5. Both categorizations have been criticized, and an empirically derived classification of BDD is lacking. A community sample of N = 736 participants completed an online survey assessing different psychopathologies. Using a structural equation modeling approach, six theoretically derived models, which differed in their allocation of BDD symptoms to various factors (i.e. general psychopathology, somatoform, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, affective, body image, and BDD model) were tested in the full sample and in a restricted sample (n = 465) which indicated primary concerns other than shape and weight. Furthermore, measurement invariance across gender was examined. Of the six models, only the body image model showed a good fit (CFI = 0.972, RMSEA = 0.049, SRMR = 0.027, TLI = 0.959), and yielded better AIC and BIC indices than the competing models. Analyses in the restricted sample replicated these findings. Analyses of measurement invariance of the body image model showed partial metric invariance across gender. The findings suggest that a body image model provides the best fit for the classification of BDD and MD. This is in line with previous studies showing strong similarities between eating disorders and BDD, including MD. Measurement invariance across gender indicates a comparable presentation and comorbid structure of BDD in males and females, which also corresponds to the equal prevalence rates of BDD across gender."
https://openalex.org/W3032010362,"Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is the most economically important citrus pest which is the primary vector of Candidatus Liberibacter spp. causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB) disease. To better understand the developmental and structural changes of antennae and antennal sensilla in D. citri nymphs, we investigated the antennal morphology, structure and sensilla distribution of the five nymphal stages of D. citri using scanning electron microscopy. The antennae of the five different nymphal stages of D. citri were filiform in shape, which consisted of two segments in the first-, second- and third-instar nymphs; three segments in the fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs. The length of their antennae was significantly increased with the increase of the nymphal instar, as well as the total number of antennal sensilla. Ten morphological sensilla types were recorded altogether. They were the long terminal hair (TH1), short terminal hair (TH2), sensilla trichoidea (ST), cavity sensillum 1 (CvS1), cavity sensillum 2 (CvS2), sensilla basiconica 1-3 (SB1-3), sensilla campaniform (SCA) and partitioned sensory organ (PSO). Also, the distribution of antennal sensilla in each nymphal stage of D. citri was asymmetrical. The SBs only occurred on the antennae of the third-, fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs. Only one CvS2 was found in the third- and fifth-instar nymphs, and one SCA in the fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs, respectively. The possible roles of the nymphal antennal sensilla in D. citri were discussed. The results could contribute to a better understanding of the development of the sensory system, and facilitate future studies on the antennal functions in D. citri nymphs."
https://openalex.org/W3029285435,"Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is an abundant metabolite synthesized from inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5) by the single IP5 2-kinase (IP5K). Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that IP6 usually functions as a structural cofactor in protein(s) mediating mRNA export, DNA repair, necroptosis, 3D genome organization, HIV infection, and cullin–RING ligase (CRL) deneddylation. However, it remains unknown whether pharmacological perturbation of cellular IP6 levels affects any of these processes. Here, we performed screening for small molecules that regulate human IP5K activity, revealing that the antiparasitic drug and polysulfonic compound suramin efficiently inhibits IP5K in vitro and in vivo. The results from docking experiments and biochemical validations suggested that the suramin targets IP5K in a distinct bidentate manner by concurrently binding to the ATP- and IP5-binding pockets, thereby inhibiting both IP5 phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. NF449, a suramin analog with additional sulfonate moieties, more potently inhibited IP5K. Both suramin and NF449 disrupted IP6-dependent sequestration of CRL by the deneddylase COP9 signalosome, thereby affecting CRL activity cycle and component dynamics in an IP5K-dependent manner. Finally, nontoxic doses of suramin, NF449, or NF110 exacerbate the loss of cell viability elicited by the neddylation inhibitor and clinical trial drug MLN4924/pevonedistat, suggesting synergistic ef-fects. Suramin and its analogs provide structural templates for designing potent and specific IP5K inhibitors, which could be used in combination therapy along with MLN4924/pevonedistat. IP5K is a potential mechanistic target of suramin, accounting for suramin's therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3030197527,"Background Exposure to maternal stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the fetus, which has potential long-term effects on offspring´s development and health. We investigated the kinetics and metabolism of the hormones and amino acids: cortisol, cortisone, tryptophan and serotonin in the term placenta in an ex vivo human placental perfusion model. The placentas used in the experiments were donated from families participating in the Maternal Stress and Placental Function project with a known maternal stress background. Method Cortisol, cortisone, tryptophan and serotonin were added simultaneously to the maternal side in the 6 hour ex vivo term human recirculating placental perfusion model, in four experimental set-ups: without inhibitors, with carbenoxolone -that inhibits cortisol metabolism into cortisone, with fluoxetine that inhibits the serotonin transporter, and with PCPA that inhibits metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin. The concentration of cortisol and cortisone, and tryptophan and serotonin were quantified using UPLC and HPLC-MS respectively. Results Cortisol was rapidly metabolized into cortisone in the placenta, to a somewhat lesser degree when adding the inhibitor carbenoxolone, resulting in higher fetal exposure to cortisol. Serotonin was also rapidly metabolized in the placenta. When adding fluoxetine a peak of fetal serotonin levels was seen in the first hour of the perfusion. No effect was seen of the maternal stress levels on placental transport kinetics in this study. Conclusion Inhibiting the metabolism of cortisol in the placenta increased fetal exposure to cortisol as expected. Unexpectedly we saw an increased fetal exposure to serotonin when inhibiting the serotonin transporter, which may be related to the increased serotonin concentration on the maternal side of the placenta. No effect on placental kinetics were evident on maternal stress levels during the pregnancy as the majority of participating mothers had normal stress levels."

Results suggest that use of primary healthcare centers outpatient service is positively associated with being in the proximity of a provincial capital, but negatively correlated with the percentage of the urban population and the availability of public transportation. Higher likelihood of seeking care in major hospitals instead of primary healthcare centers is associated with urbanization, justifying a need for primary care physicians as gatekeepers in China's healthcare delivery system."
https://openalex.org/W3032362141,"This study evaluated 53 primiparous cows (36.8±1.23 months old and 484±40.9 kg of body weight) performance tested (GrowSafe® System) from 22±5 to 190±13 days of lactation in order to obtain daily dry matter intake (DMI). The animals received a high-forage diet (forage-to-concentrate ratio of 90:10). Milk production of the cows was evaluated three times by mechanical milking and the energy-corrected milk yield (ECMY) was calculated. Energy status (through the indicators glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and β-hydroxybutyrate), protein status (indicators albumin, urea, and creatinine), mineral status (indicators calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium), and hormonal status (indicators insulin and cortisol) were estimated four times throughout lactation. The residual feed intake (RFI) of cows was calculated considering DMI, average daily gain (ADG) and mid-test metabolic weight (BW0.75) obtained in early lactation (from 22±5 to 102±7 days), and the animals were classified as negative (most efficient) or positive RFI (least efficient). The RFI model explained 53% of the variation in DMI. The mean DMI, ADG, ECMY, and calf weight as a percentage of cow weight were 12.47±2.70 kg DM/day, 0.632±0.323 kg/day, 10.47±3.23 kg/day, and 36.6±5.39%, respectively. Negative RFI cows consumed 11.5% less DM than positive RFI cows, with performance and metabolic profile being similar to those of positive RFI cows, except for a lower milk protein content and higher blood cholesterol concentration. In conclusion, negative (most efficient) and positive RFI (least efficient) Nellore cows, fed an ad libitum high-forage diet, produced similar amounts of milk, fat and lactose and had similar subcutaneous fat thickness, weight, calf weight as a percentage of cow weight, and blood metabolite concentrations (except for cholesterol). Therefore, there are economic benefits to utilizing RFI in a cow herd since cattle had decreased DMI with similar overall performance, making them more profitable due to lower input costs."
https://openalex.org/W3032598832,"Objectives To prospectively examine the health and health-related behaviors of Army Special Forces personnel in comparison with two distinct, but functionally similar Army groups. Methods Special Forces, Ranger Qualified, and General Purposes Forces enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Study were identified using data from the Defense Manpower Data Center. Using prospective survey data (2001–2014), we estimated the association of Army specialization with mental health, social support, physical health, and health-related behaviors with multivariable regression models. Results Among the 5,392 eligible participants (84.4% General Purposes Forces, 10.0% Special Forces, 5.6% Ranger Qualified), Special Forces personnel reported the lowest prevalence of mental disorders, physical health problems, and unhealthy behaviors. In the multivariable models, Special Forces personnel were less likely to report mental health problems, multiple somatic symptoms, and unhealthy behaviors compared with General Purpose Forces infantrymen (odds ratios [OR]: 0.20–0.54, p-values < .01). Overall, Special Forces personnel were similar in terms of mental and physical health compared with Ranger Qualified infantrymen, but were less likely to sleep < 5 hours/night (OR: 0.60, 95% confidence intervals: 0.40, 0.92) and have 5 or more multiple somatic symptoms (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.98). Both Special Forces personnel and Ranger Qualified infantrymen engaged in more healthy behaviors compared with General Purpose Forces infantrymen (OR: 2.57–6.22, p-values<0.05). Engagement in more healthy behaviors reduced the odds of subsequent adverse health outcomes, regardless of specialization. Conclusions Army Special Forces personnel were found to be mentally and physically healthier than General Purpose Forces infantrymen, which may in part be due to their tendency to engage in healthy behaviors. Findings indicate that engagement in a greater number of healthy behaviors may reduce odds for subsequent adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3032805279,"Increased cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) and elevated AKT/mTOR signaling are characteristics of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent lipid mitogen generated via autotaxin (elevated in ccRCC), can modulate tumor progression but its role in altering chemotherapeutic sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors is unclear and thus is the focus of the studies presented herein. Using malignant (A-498, 769-P and 786-O) and normal immortalized kidney (HK-2) cell lines, we investigated their cellular responsiveness to Temsirolimus (TEMS, mTOR inhibitor) in the absence or presence of LPA by monitoring alterations in AKT/mTOR pathway mediators (via western blotting), LDs (using LipidTOX and real-time PCR to assess transcript changes in modulators of LD biogenesis/turnover), mitochondrial networks (via immunofluorescence staining for TOM20 and TOM70), as well as cellular viability. We identified that TEMS reduced cellular viability in all renal cell lines, with increased sensitivity in the presence of an autophagy inhibitor. TEMS also altered activation of AKT/mTOR pathway mediators, abundance of LDs, and fragmentation of mitochondrial networks. We observed that these effects were antagonized by LPA. In HK-2 cells, LPA markedly increased LD size and abundance, coinciding with phospho-MAPK and phospho-S6 activation, increased diacylglycerol O-acetyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) mRNA (which produces triacylglycerides), and survival. Inhibiting MAPK partially antagonized LPA-induced LD changes. Collectively, we have identified that LPA can reverse the effects of TEMS by increasing LDs in a MAPK-dependent manner; these results suggest that LPA may contribute to the pathogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance of ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W3029072514,"The enzyme β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2) is clinically relevant because it is targeted by the drug miglustat (Zavesca®) and because it is involved in inherited diseases. Mutations in the GBA2 gene are associated with two neurological diseases on the ataxia-spasticity spectrum, hereditary spastic paraplegia 46 (SPG46) and Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndrome (MSS). To establish how GBA2 mutations give rise to neurological pathology, we have begun to investigate mutant forms of GBA2 encoded by disease-associated GBA2 alleles. Previously, we found that five GBA2 missense mutants and five C-terminally truncated mutants lacked enzyme activity. Here we have examined the cellular locations of wild-type (WT) and mutant forms of GBA2 by confocal and electron microscopy, using transfected cells. Similar to GBA2-WT, the D594H and M510Vfs*17 GBA2 mutants were located at the plasma membrane, whereas the C-terminally truncated mutants terminating after amino acids 233 and 339 (GBA2-233 and -339) were present in the mitochondrial matrix, induced mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Deletional mutagenesis indicated that residues 161-200 are critical for the mitochondrial fragmentation of GBA2-233 and -339. Considering that the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by GBA2-233 and -339 is consistently accompanied by their localization to the mitochondrial matrix, our deletional analysis raises the possibility that that GBA2 residues 161-200 harbor an internal targeting sequence for transport to the mitochondrial matrix.

We evaluated whether disbudding with a heated iron at 3 (n = 12), 35 (n = 9), or 56 (n = 20) d of age affected heifers' pain responses to vaccine injections at 11 mo of age. Heifers responded to the injection procedure with struggling and changes in eye temperature and heart rate variability compared to a sham procedure the day before, and still had a heightened response 6 d later, regardless of disbudding age. However, some heart rate variability indices suggested increased sympathetic dominance in heifers disbudded at 35 d, compared to the other 2 age groups, independent of the injection procedure. We also found that heifers disbudded at 3 or 35 d had a higher mean heart rate after the injection procedure compared to those disbudded at 56 d. We conclude that: (1) heifers find injections aversive; and (2) there is some evidence that disbudding age influences autonomic nervous system activity later in life."
https://openalex.org/W3029679608,"Background One-year mortality after hip-fracture is a widely used outcome measure when comparing hospital care performance. However, traditional analyses do not explicitly consider the referral of patients to municipality care after just a few days of hospitalization. Furthermore, traditional analyses investigates hospital (or municipality) variation in patient outcomes in isolation rather than as a component of the underlying patient variation. We therefore aimed to extend the traditional approach to simultaneously estimate both case-mix adjusted hospital and municipality comparisons in order to disentangle the amount of the total patient variation in clinical outcomes that was attributable to the hospital and municipality level, respectively. Methods We determined 1-year mortality risk in patients aged 65 or above with hip fractures registered in Sweden between 2011 and 2014. We performed cross-classified multilevel analysis with 54,999 patients nested within 54 hospitals and 290 municipalities. We adjusted for individual demographic, socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. To quantify the size of the hospital and municipality variation we calculated the variance partition coefficient (VPC) and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results The overall 1-year mortality rate was 25.1%. The case-mix adjusted rates varied from 21.7% to 26.5% for the 54 hospitals, and from 18.9% to 29.5% for the 290 municipalities. The VPC was just 0.2% for the hospital and just 0.1% for the municipality level. Patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were strong predictors of 1-year mortality (AUC = 0.716), but adding the hospital and municipality levels in the cross-classified model had a minor influence (AUC = 0.718). Conclusions Overall in Sweden, one-year mortality after hip-fracture is rather high. However, only a minor part of the patient variation is explained by the hospital and municipality levels. Therefore, a possible intervention should be nation-wide rather than directed to specific hospitals or municipalities."
https://openalex.org/W3030151916,"Recent advances in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in canines facilitate the production of canine transgenic models. Owing to the importance of stable and strong promoter activity in transgenic animals, we tested human elongation factor 1α (hEF1α) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter sequences in SCNT transgenic dogs. After transfection, transgenic donor fibroblasts with the hEF1α-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) transgene were successfully isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We obtained four puppies, after SCNT, and identified three puppies as being transgenic using PCR analysis. Unexpectedly, EGFP regulated by hEF1α promoter was not observed at the organismal and cellular levels in these transgenic dogs. EGFP expression was rescued by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, implying that the hEF1α promoter is silenced by DNA methylation. Next, donor cells with CMV-EGFP transgene were successfully established and SCNT was performed. Three puppies of six born puppies were confirmed to be transgenic. Unlike hEF1α-regulated EGFP, CMV-regulated EGFP was strongly detectable at both the organismal and cellular levels in all transgenic dogs, even after 19 months. In conclusion, our study suggests that the CMV promoter is more suitable, than the hEF1α promoter, for stable transgene expression in SCNT-derived transgenic canine model."

Our aim was to investigate the relationships between oral health literacy and oral health-related factors in a sample of Indigenous Australian adults using a network analysis approach.Data from 400 Indigenous Australian adults was used to estimate four regularised partial correlation networks. Initially, a network with the 14 items of the Health Literacy in Dentistry scale (HeLD-14) was estimated. In a second step, psychosocial, sociodemographic and oral health-related factors were included in the network. Finally, two networks were estimated for participants with high and low oral health literacy. Participants were categorised into 'high' or 'low' OHL networks based on a median split. Centrality measures, clustering coefficients, network stability, and edge accuracy were evaluated. A permutation-based test was used to test differences between networks.Solid connections among HeLD-14 items followed the structure of theoretical domains across all networks. Oral health-related self-efficacy, sporting activities, and self-rated oral health status were the strongest positively associated nodes with items of the HeLD-14 scale. HeLD-14 items were the four most central nodes in both HeLD-14 + covariates network and high OHL network, but not in the low OHL network. Differences between high and low OHL models were observed in terms of overall network structure, edge weight, and clustering coefficient.Network models captured the dynamic relationships between oral health literacy and psychosocial, sociodemographic and oral health-related factors. Discussion on the implications of these findings for informing the development of targeted interventions to improve oral health literacy is presented."
https://openalex.org/W3028597163,"Bike share schemes are increasing in popularity. During 2013, New York City (NYC) launched a bike sharing scheme, Citi Bike, to provide users with the ability to cycle around the city. How these bikes are used is useful for understanding sustainability and infrastructure needs in urban cities. In this study spatial analysis methods were used to analyze space and time usage patterns during a 12 month period. We found that bike usage varied over the months with the lowest number of rentals occurring during the winter months (N = 200,000) and highest during the summer months (N > 1 million trips). Bike use varied spatially and temporally by user type (customer vs subscriber) and gender (male vs female). Over 100,000 unique routes (origin-destinations) were identified with the top five most popular routes starting and ending at the same station location. When comparison of existing bike distributions were made with bike use patterns, supply gaps were identified. The findings are useful for enhancing infrastructure needs and provide a basis for future comparisons to be made as the system changes over time."
https://openalex.org/W3028786311,"Increasing pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is considered strategic by WHO. Adjuvant use is key in this strategy in order to spare the vaccine doses and by increasing immune protection. We describe here the production and stability studies of a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion, adjuvant IB160, and the immune response of the H7N9 vaccine combined with IB160. To qualify the production of IB160 we produced 10 consistency lots of IB160 and the average results were: pH 6.4±0.05; squalene 48.8±.0.03 mg/ml; osmolality 47.6±6.9 mmol/kg; Z-average 157±2 nm, with polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.085±0.024 and endotoxin levels <0.5 EU/mL. The emulsion particle size was stable for at least six months at 25°C and 24 months at 4-8°C. Two doses of H7N9 vaccine formulated at 7.5 μg/dose or 15 μg/dose with adjuvant IB160 showed a significant increase of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in sera of immunized BALB/c mice when compared to control sera from animals immunized with the H7N9 antigens without adjuvant. Thus the antigen-sparing capacity of IB160 can potentially increase the production of the H7N9 pandemic vaccine and represents an important achievement for preparedness against pandemic influenza and a successful North (IDRI) to South (Butantan Institute) technology transfer for the production of the adjuvant emulsion IB160."
https://openalex.org/W3029444354,"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone (MFH-B) is an extremely rare and aggressive malignancy. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with MFH-B have not been defined. We conducted a retrospective study using the data of all MFH-B patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 1975 and 2016. Initially, the clinicopathological characteristics were described. The difference in prognosis between patients with MFH-B and those with osteosarcoma was compared using propensity score matching analysis. Then, the features affecting the prognosis of patients with MFH-B were further determined using Cox regression analysis. A total of 318 patients with MFH-B were identified. The median overall survival (mOS) of all 318 patients with MFH-B was 29.0 months. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10- year survival rates were 67.4%, 53.6%, 38.7%, and 28.7%, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that older age, distant metastases, and flat bone lesion were independent factors for worse prognosis, whereas surgery was an independent factor for favorable survival, and this intervention could decrease risk of death by 61% (HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.28–0.54). Apart from this, the prognosis of patients with MFH-B was significantly worse than that of patients with osteosarcoma in both unmatched and matched cohorts. In conclusion, MFH-B is a rare malignant bone cancer, with relatively worse prognosis than osteosarcoma. Older age, distant metastases, flat bone lesion, and surgery were independently associated with prognosis. In order to understand this disease more thoroughly and accurately, more cases with adequate information are required in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3030930841,"Introduction In sub-Saharan Mozambique, high adolescent fertility rates are a significant public health problem. Understanding the consequences of teenage pregnancies facilitates effective strategies for improving the quality of care of both mother and the newborn. Aims To identify the factors associated with adolescent motherhood in Tete (Mozambique). Methods This was a cross-sectional study including 821 pregnant women (255 teenagers) admitted to the general maternity ward of the Provincial Hospital between March and October 2016. The survey included clinical data of the mother and newborn. Results The overall prevalence of adolescent deliveries was 31.8% (95% CI 27.9% - 34.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that independent factors associated with teenage motherhood were: number of pregnancies (OR 0.066; 95% CI 0.040–0.110), pregnancy follow-up (OR 0.29; CI 0.173–0.488) and previous abortions (OR 4.419; 95% CI 1.931–10.112). When the age of the mother was analysed as a continuous variable, positively associated factors were body mass index, arterial hypertension, HIV infection, previous abortions, pregnancy follow-up, and the weight of the newborn. Negatively associated factors were episiotomy and respiratory distress in the newborn. Conclusion Teenage motherhood is a serious public health problem in Mozambique. Intensive sexual and reproductive health planning for adolescents is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3032022388,"Picornaviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) have low replication fidelity that is essential for viral fitness and evolution. Their global fold consists of the classical ""cupped right hand"" structure with palm, fingers, and thumb domains, and these RdRPs also possess a unique contact between the fingers and thumb domains. This interaction restricts movements of the fingers, and RdRPs use a subtle conformational change within the palm domain to close their active sites for catalysis. We have previously shown that this core RdRP structure and mechanism provide a platform for polymerases to fine-tune replication rates and fidelity to optimize virus fitness. Here, we further elucidated the structural basis for differences in replication rates and fidelity among different viruses by generating chimeric RdRPs from poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3. We designed these chimeric polymerases by exchanging the fingers, pinky finger, or thumb domains. The results of biochemical, rapid-quench, and stopped-flow assays revealed that differences in biochemical activity map to individual modular domains of this polymerase. We found that the pinky finger subdomain is a major regulator of initiation and that the palm domain is the major determinant of catalytic rate and nucleotide discrimination. We further noted that thumb domain interactions with product RNA regulate translocation and that the palm and thumb domains coordinately control elongation complex stability. Several RdRP chimeras supported the growth of infectious poliovirus, providing insights into enterovirus species-specific protein-protein interactions required for virus replication."

Although, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of the disease, the pathogenesis of POAG and the genetic factors contributing to disease development remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphisms rs76481776 in miR182 gene and rs3217992 in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2B (CDKN2B) gene are risk factors for POAG in a series of patients of Greek origin. A case-control study was conducted including 120 patients with POAG and 113 unaffected healthy controls of Greek origin, surveyed for polymorphisms with potential correlation to POAG. DNA from each individual was tested for the miR182 rs76481776 and CDKN2B rs3217992 polymorphisms. Regarding the miR182 rs76481776 polymorphism, the T allele occurred with significantly higher frequency in POAG patients compared to controls (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.56-4.39; p = 0.0002). The CDKN2B rs3217992 A allele frequency was found significantly increased in POAG patients compared to healthy individuals (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.18-2.49; p = 0.005). Therefore, both rs76481776 polymorphism in miR182 gene and rs3217992 polymorphism in CDKN2B gene seem to be associated with the development of POAG in a Greek population. The carriers of the T allele of rs76481776 in miR182 and the carriers of the A allele of rs3217992 in CDKN2B have an increased risk of developing POAG."
https://openalex.org/W3024559419,"Background In humans, stillbirth describes the death of a fetus before birth after 28 weeks gestation, and accounts for approximately 2.6 million deaths worldwide annually. In high-income countries, up to half of stillbirths have an unknown cause and are described as “unexplained stillbirths”; this lack of understanding impairs efforts to prevent stillbirth. There are also few animal models of stillbirth, but those that have been described usually have significant placental abnormalities. This study describes a novel mutant murine model of fetal death with atrial conduction block due to an ErbB2 missense mutation which is not associated with abnormal placental morphology. Methods Phenotypic characterisation and histological analysis of the mutant mouse model was conducted. The mRNA distribution of the early cardiomyocyte marker Nkx2-5 was assessed via in situ hybridisation. Cardiac structure was quantified and cellular morphology evaluated by electron microscopy. Immunostaining was employed to quantify placental structure and cell characteristics on matched heterozygous and homozygous mutant placental samples. Results There were no structural abnormalities observed in hearts of mutant embryos. Comparable Nkx2-5 expression was observed in hearts of mutants and controls, suggesting normal cardiac specification. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the weight, placenta dimensions, giant cell characteristics, labyrinth tissue composition, levels of apoptosis, proliferation or vascularisation between placentas of homozygous mutant mice and controls. Conclusion Embryonic lethality in the ErbB2 homozygous mutant mouse cannot be attributed to placental pathology. As such, we conclude the ErbB2M802R mutant is a model of stillbirth with a non-placental cause of death. The mechanism of the atrial block resulting from ErbB2 mutation and its role in embryonic death is still unclear. Studying this mutant mouse model could identify candidate genes involved in stillbirth associated with structural or functional cardiac defects."

These systems have been studied extensively in strains T-1 and T-6, representing microbial models for the utilization of soil polysaccharides, and many of their components have been characterized both biochemically and structurally. Here, we characterized routes by which G. stearothermophilus utilizes mono- and disaccharides such as galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and galactosyl-glycerol. The G. stearothermophilus genome encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) for cellobiose. We found that the cellobiose-PTS system is induced by cellobiose and characterized the corresponding GH1 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, Cel1A. The bacterium also possesses two transport systems for galactose, a galactose-PTS system and an ABC galactose transporter. The ABC galactose transport system is regulated by a three-component sensing system. We observed that both systems, the sensor and the transporter, utilize galactose-binding proteins that also bind glucose with the same affinity. We hypothesize that this allows the cell to control the flux of galactose into the cell in the presence of glucose. Unexpectedly, we discovered that G. stearothermophilus T-1 can also utilize lactose and galactosyl-glycerol via the cellobiose-PTS system together with a bifunctional 6-phospho-β-gal/glucosidase, Gan1D. Growth curves of strain T-1 growing in the presence of cellobiose, with either lactose or galactosyl-glycerol, revealed initially logarithmic growth on cellobiose and then linear growth supported by the additional sugars.

A major challenge for soil bacteria in the natural environment is to sense the scarce carbon sources and compete for these sources with nearby microorganisms. Indeed, we have demonstrated that G. stearothermophilus employs a unique strategy for the efficient utilization of polysaccharides in its immediate environment. First, it utilizes two- or three-component systems to sense minute amounts of mono- or disaccharides in the surroundings, which signal the presence of the corresponding polysaccharides (2Shulami S.

The two- or three-component sensing systems then activate dedicated ABC sugar transporters that transfer the sugars into the cell and induce the corresponding systems for expressing extracellular endo-type glycoside hydrolases that partially degrade the high-molecular-weight polysaccharides into short (usually decorated) oligosaccharides. Additional ABC transporters for oligosaccharides transfer the large oligosaccharides into the cell, and those are further hydrolyzed into sugar monomers by a battery of specific intracellular glycoside hydrolases (10Teplitsky A.

This utilization strategy allows the bacterium to (a) react rapidly to presence of potential polysaccharides such as xylan, arabinan, and galactan in the immediate environment; (b) transfer efficiently the degradation products into the bacterium cell; and (c) almost exclusively utilize the degraded decorated oligosaccharides because these are rarely imported by other organisms. Essentially the same strategy was recently demonstrated for the utilization of yeast mannan by the human gut Bacteroidetes and was coined a “selfish mechanism” (17Cuskin F. Lowe E.C. Temple M.J. Zhu Y. Cameron E. Pudlo N.A. Porter N.T. Urs K. Thompson A.J. Cartmell A. Rogowski A. Hamilton B.S. Chen R. Tolbert T.J. Piens K. et al.Human gut Bacteroidetes can utilize yeast mannan through a selfish mechanism.Nature. 2015; 517 (25567280): 165-16910.1038/nature13995Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition to the complete utilization machinery for xylan, arabinan, and galactan, G. stearothermophilus also possesses scavenging mechanisms for the utilization of mono- or disaccharides that are often found in the surroundings, resulting from the extensive degradation of the corresponding polysaccharides by other soil microorganisms. In this case, the sugars are imported by the bacterium into the cell via a different type of transporters, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS). The PTS systems usually use phosphoenolpyruvate as the phosphoryl donor for sugar phosphorylation, together with three essential catalytic entities, termed enzyme I, enzyme II, and HPr (heat-stable, histidine-phosphorylatable protein) (18Saier Jr., M.H. The bacterial phosphotransferase system: new frontiers 50 years after its discovery.J. Mol. Microbiol.

During their import via the PTS systems, sugars are simultaneously phosphorylated at the C6 hydroxyl group of the terminal sugar unit at the nonreducing end and are further cleaved (inside the cell) by dedicated 6-phospho-β-glycosidases/galactosidases (19Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified in G. stearothermophilus strain T-1 such PTS systems for cellobiose and galactose and biochemically characterized the corresponding enzymes involved. These are the 6-phospho-β-gal Gan1D, belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family GH1, and the 6-phospho-β-glycosidase Cel1A, belonging also to family GH1. In addition, we demonstrate that the bacterium can utilize the β-galactosides lactose and galactosyl-glycerol, using the cellobiose-PTS system together with the bifunctional 6-phospho-β-gal, Gan1D. As part of a systematic search for hemicellulolytic utilization systems in G. stearothermophilus, we identified in strain T-1 a 4.3-kb gene cluster, which appears to be involved in the utilization of cellobiose (Fig. 1A). The cluster was identified via bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of strains T-1 and includes an operon of four genes and a transcriptional regulator gene. Based on sequence homology, the celBCD genes encode for a complete PTS system. The CelD protein is homologous to proteins from the lactose/cellobiose EIIC family that bind cellobiose or lactose. CelC and CelB are the EIIA and EIIB domains, respectively, which transfer the phosphoryl group from HPr to the transported sugar. The fourth gene in this operon, celA, encodes for a 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, Cel1A, which shows sequence homology to a number of GH1 6-phospho-glucosidases, including those from Streptococcus pyogenes (51% sequence identity), Lactobacillus plantarum (32%), and Streptococcus mutans (32%). Adjacent to the operon lies the celR gene encoding for a transcriptional regulator belonging to the GntR family. The genes for the EI and HPr proteins are located elsewhere on the chromosome. G. stearothermophilus T-1 is unable to grow on cellulose but grows very well on cellobiose. To test whether the celBCD, celA and celR genes are involved in cellobiose utilization, we measured the corresponding mRNA levels in cultures grown on cellobiose, xylose, or glucose. Total mRNA was extracted from mid-exponential phase cultures, and the cDNA was amplified with primers specific to celA, celB, celC, celD, and celR as well as for the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene, ict, that was used for normalization. Relative expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR, as presented in Fig. 1B. The expression levels of the corresponding genes were 7–15-fold higher in the cellobiose-grown culture, as compared with cultures grown on xylose or glucose. The relatively high levels of celA mRNA compared with the celBCD genes may reflect differences in mRNA stability. These results suggest that the celBCDA operon is induced by cellobiose and thus highly likely to be involved in cellobiose utilization. The biochemical activity of Cel1A was determined using different chromogenic and natural substrates (Table 1). Cel1A exhibited a significant catalytic activity on substrates with glucose 6-phosphate at the glycon moiety and had no detectable activity toward unphosphorylated substrates. These results suggest that Cel1A is a 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, with high specificity toward glucose 6-phosphate as the glycon moiety. The effect of temperature on Cel1A activity was determined at pH 7.0, using the chromogenic substrate oNP-β-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (oNPβGlc6P). The optimal temperature in a 20-min reaction was 65 °C (Fig. 2A). The thermal stability was determined after incubating Cel1A at temperatures between 30 and 85 °C for 10 min The enzyme was stable at temperatures below 65 °C and lost over 90% of its activity at 75 °C (Fig. 2B). The activity of Cel1A was determined at different pH values in the range of 3.5–9.5 (Fig. 2C). The pH profile is a typical bell-shaped curve, which may reflect the ionization of the two catalytic carboxylates. The enzyme was most active at the pH range of 6.5–8 and lost about 90% of its activity at pH 3.5 and 9.5. Based on sequence alignment of Cel1A with other retaining GH1 enzymes, the putative acid/base and nucleophile catalytic residues are Glu-174 and Glu-373, respectively. These residues were substituted with alanine, and the effect of the mutations on the activity of the enzyme was determined using oNPβGlc6P as the substrate. The Michaelis–Menten catalytic constants of the Cel1A-E174A catalytic mutant toward oNPβGlc6P were 0.01 mm, 2.1 s−1, and 2.1 × 105 s−1m−1 for Km, kcat, and kcat/Km, respectively. The kcat value was about 50-fold lower, compared with the WT, and the Km was 10-fold lower, compared with the WT, suggesting the accumulation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Such results are expected for an acid-base mutant because the relatively high reactivity of the o-nitrophenol leaving group (pKa 7.22) elevates the rate of the first glycosylation step even without a proton assistant. The second deglycosylation step remains considerably slow due to the loss of the base required for the activation of the catalytic water molecule (20Yu W.L. Jiang Y.L. Pikis A. Cheng W. Bai X.H. Ren Y.M. Thompson J. Zhou C.Z. Chen Y. Structural insights into the substrate specificity of a 6-phospho-β-glucosidase BglA-2 from Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4.J. Biol.

The alanine replacement of the Glu-373 nucleophile resulted in a nondetectable activity toward oNPβGlc6P, reflecting the inability of this mutant to bind the substrate and stabilize the first transition state. In similar retaining glycoside hydrolases, the nucleophile is usually involved in a strong interaction with the C2 hydroxyl group of the glycone sugar (21Shallom D. Leon M. Bravman T. Ben-David A.

Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated previously that G. stearothermophilus T-1 consumes galactan efficiently, utilizing the galactan utilization gene cluster, ganREFGBA (3Tabachnikov O. Shoham Y. Functional characterization of the galactan utilization system of Geobacillus stearothermophilus.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23216604): 950-96410.1111/febs.12089PubMed Google Scholar). Following bioinformatics analysis of the bacterium genome sequence, we identified a new cluster that appears to be involved in galactose utilization. This new 12.5-kb cluster is composed of genes encoding for a putative three-component regulatory sensing system (GalPST2), an ABC sugar transport system (GalE2F2G2), a regulatory protein (GanR2), and two 6-phospho-glycosidases (Gan4C and Gan1D) (Fig. 3). GalP exhibits significant sequence similarity to periplasmic sugar-binding proteins with a 27-amino acid signal peptide at its N terminus. GalS exhibits characteristic features of bacterial histidine kinase proteins, including two transmembrane (TM) helices (TM1, residues 7–25; TM2, residues 177–197) flanking an extracellular domain (residues 26–176) and a conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic region containing the ATP-binding kinase domain. Downstream from the galS gene lies the galT2 gene, which encodes for a protein with high sequence similarity to response regulators. As in the case for many response regulators, GalT2 has a predicted two-domain architecture, with an N terminus signal receiver domain (REC), linked to a C terminus effector domain (22West A.H. Stock A.M. Histidine kinases and response regulator proteins in two-component signaling systems.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26 (11406410): 369-37610.1016/S0968-0004(01)01852-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal receiver domain (positioned at residues 5–118) shares a significant homology with the Rec superfamily of the REC domains, whereas the C-terminal domain (residues 157–225) contains a putative helix-turn-helix motif, resembling the AraC-type DNA-binding domain (23Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Arac/XylS family of transcriptional regulators.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61 (9409145): 393-41010.1128/.61.4.393-410.1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the galPST2 and galE2F2G2 clusters encode for a three-component sensing system and an ABC galactose transport system, respectively. Based on genome sequence analysis, strain T-1 encodes for four sugar-specific PTS systems, two for the disaccharides, cellobiose and trehalose, and two for the monosugars, mannitol and galactose (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the galPST2 and galE2F2G2 gene clusters are involved in galactose utilization and to identify the PTS system for galactose, the mRNA levels of the galPST2, galE2F2G2, and the four sugar-PTS systems were measured in cultures grown in the presence of galactose and related sugars (Fig. 4). The expression of galE2 was 5-fold higher on galactose-grown cultures, compared with cultures grown on either glucose, xylose, or galactan (Fig. 4B). These results support our original suggestion that the galE2F2G2 operon constitutes an ABC galactose transporter. The expression of the galP gene, which is part of a three-component sensing system, appears to be relatively low and constant, regardless of the carbon source used (Fig. 4B). Although these results cannot correlate the system to galactose, it is expected that the sensing systems will be expressed constitutively. The mRNA levels of the four PTS systems were also measured in cultures grown on either galactose or glucose (Fig. 4C). The expression level of the ptsA gene in galactose-grown culture was about 9-fold higher than for a culture grown on glucose, suggesting that ptsA is part of the galactose-PTS transporter, dedicated to galactose import. Taken together, these results suggest that G. stearothermophilus T-1 has two transport systems for galactose. The putative three-component system for galactose, GalPST2, and the galactose ABC transport system, GalE2F2G2, both have dedicated sugar-binding proteins (GalP and GalE2, respectively) that are tethered to the local membrane. The ability of these proteins to bind galactose was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The calorimetric titration curves are shown in Fig. 5, and the thermodynamic binding parameters are summarized in Table 2. These results demonstrate that GalE2 and GalP are able to bind galactose quite tightly, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range, KD = 1.4 µm and KD = 6.1 µm, respectively. Similar titrations of GalP with cellobiose and lactose did not result in a significant enthalpy change. Surprisingly, however, both proteins bind glucose in similar affinities to galactose. Nevertheless, although glucose seems to bind these proteins quite tightly, it is rather unlikely that it can activate the corresponding sensing systems, because the expression of the operons of these systems is practically unaffected by glucose (Fig. 4B).Table 2Thermodynamic parameters for the binding of galactose or glucose to GalE2 and GalPProteinLigandnKD (µm)ΔHB (kcal mol−1)TΔSB (kcal mol−1)ΔGB (kcal mol−1)GalE2Galactose1.121.4−5.8 ± 0.30.3−6.1Glucose1.043.1−7.0 ± 0.40.8−7.8GalPGalactose0.656.1−10 ± 0.6−2.6−12.6Glucose0.714.2−9.0 ± 0.2−1.3−10.2 Open table in a new tab The fact that the potential three-component sensing system for galactose (galPST2) is located adjacent to a putative ABC transport system (galE2F2G2) suggests that the sensing system is functionally linked to this transport system and that GalT2 is therefore a response regulator that regulates the expression of the transporter. This type of adjacent arrangement of gene clusters was found in G. stearothermophilus also for the arabinose and xylotriose utilization systems (2Shulami S. Raz-Pasteur A. Tabachnikov O. Gilead-Gropper S. Shner I. Shoham Y. The l-arabinan utilization system of Geobacillus stearothermophilus.J.

Microbiol. 2007; 73 (17142383): 874-88410.1128/AEM.02367-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the promoter region of galE2 revealed a putative −35 sequence (TTGATA), which is a relatively close match to the σA consensus sequence, TTGACA. This −35 sequence is separated by 18 bp from the potential −10 region (CAACAT), which differs from the Bacillus subtilis consensus, TATAAT, by three nucleotides (24Jarmer H. Larsen T.S. Krogh A. Saxild H.H. Brunak S. Knudsen S. Sigma A recognition sites in the Bacillus subtilis genome.Microbiology. 2001; 147 (11535782): 2417-242410.1099/00221287-147-9-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The upstream region of the −35 of the galE2 promoter contains two direct repeats, CAAAAAAGT, separated by 11 bp, which may function as the recognition sequences for the response regulator GanlT2 (Fig. 6A). This putative binding site, upstream of the –35 region, can allow direct interaction of the activator with the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase (25Rhodius V.A. Busby S.J. Positive activation of gene expression.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1 (10066477): 152-15910.1016/S1369-5274(98)80005-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Barnard A. Wolfe A. Busby S.

To test whether GalT2 can bind the galE2 promoter region, we utilized gel mobility shift assays. These studies indicated that the GalT2 protein (using N-His6-GalT2) can bind significantly to a 113-bp DNA fragment containing the two direct repeats discussed above, and a nearly complete shift was obtained in the presence of 0.3 µm GalT2 (Fig. 6B). This relatively high concentration of GalT2 (reflecting a relatively weak protein-DNA binding) may originate from the fact that the protein was not fully phosphorylated, as often observed for other response regulators (27Buschiazzo A. Trajtenberg F. Two-component sensing and regulation: how do histidine kinases talk with response regulators at the molecular level?.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 (31226026): 507-52810.1146/annurev-micro-091018-054627Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test whether the phosphorylation of GalT2 increases significantly its binding to DNA, we phosphorylated GalT2 in vitro, using Mg2+ and acetyl phosphate as the phosphate donor. As shown by size-exclusion chromatography, such phosphorylation changed the oligomeric state of GalT2 in solution, transforming it from a monomer (not phosphorylated) to a dimer (phosphorylated) (Fig. 6C), as usually observed for related response regulators. Indeed, the fully phosphorylated GalT2 protein (in its dimeric form) gave a complete shift at 0.07 µm (Fig. 6D), demonstrating a significant increase in its DNA-binding capabilities. These results further support the identification of GalT2 as a response regulator, as such regulators usually change their conformation upon phosphorylation, allowing them to enhance their binding to their target DNA segments (28Kenney L.J. Response-regulator phosphorylation and activation: a two-way street?
