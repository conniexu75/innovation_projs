Nonetheless, the common elements that link these widely distributed entities remain unknown. A major culprit might be chitin. Chitin is the second most abundant polymer in nature, providing the osmotic stability and tensile strength to countless cell walls and rigid exoskeletons. Reese et al. have now found that mice treated with chitin develop an allergic response, characterized by a build-up of interleukin-4 expressing innate immune cells. Treatment with a chitinase enzyme abolishes the response. Occupations associated with high environmental chitin levels, such as shellfish processors, are prone to high incidences of asthma, suggesting that this pathway may play a role in human allergic disease. The biopolymer chitin is one of the main components in the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans and the bodies of some parasitic worms. This paper describes how chitin elicits an innate allergic response in mice, which is controlled by a host chitinase. Allergic and parasitic worm immunity is characterized by infiltration of tissues with interleukin (IL)-4- and IL-13-expressing cells, including T-helper-2 cells, eosinophils and basophils1. Tissue macrophages assume a distinct phenotype, designated alternatively activated macrophages2. Relatively little is known about the factors that trigger these host responses. Chitin, a widespread environmental biopolymer of N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosamine, provides structural rigidity to fungi, crustaceans, helminths and insects3. Here, we show that chitin induces the accumulation in tissue of IL-4-expressing innate immune cells, including eosinophils and basophils, when given to mice. Tissue infiltration was unaffected by the absence of Toll-like-receptor-mediated lipopolysaccharide recognition but did not occur if the injected chitin was pre-treated with the IL-4- and IL-13-inducible mammalian chitinase, AMCase4, or if the chitin was injected into mice that overexpressed AMCase. Chitin mediated alternative macrophage activation in vivo and the production of leukotriene B4, which was required for optimal immune cell recruitment. Chitin is a recognition element for tissue infiltration by innate cells implicated in allergic and helminth immunity and this process can be negatively regulated by a vertebrate chitinase."

Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis, whereas loss-of-function mutations result in hypocholesterolemia and protection from heart disease. Recombinant human PCSK9 binds the LDLR on the surface of cultured hepatocytes and promotes degradation of the receptor after internalization. Here we localized the site of binding of PCSK9 within the extracellular domain of the LDLR and determined the fate of the receptor after PCSK9 binding. Recombinant human PCSK9 interacted in a sequence-specific manner with the first epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGF-A) in the EGF homology domain of the human LDLR. Similar binding specificity was observed between PCSK9 and purified EGF-A. Binding to EGF-A was calcium-dependent and increased dramatically with reduction in pH from 7 to 5.2. The addition of PCSK9, but not heat-inactivated PCSK9, to the medium of cultured hepatocytes resulted in redistribution of the receptor from the plasma membrane to lysosomes. These data are consistent with a model in which PCSK9 binding to EGF-A interferes with an acid-dependent conformational change required for receptor recycling. As a consequence, the LDLR is rerouted from the endosome to the lysosome where it is degraded.

Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although the exact mecnism responsible for PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation is not known, it requires internalization of the LDLR (14Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B.

Co-imnoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that PCSK9 can interact directly with the LDLR (14Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K.

The two physiological ligands of the LDLR, apopoprotein E of VLDL and apolipoprotein B-100 of LDL, bind the ligand-binding domain of the LDLR (17Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which consists of seven â¼40-amino acid cysteine-rich tandem repeats. The ligand-binding domain located at the N terminus of the protein is followed by the so-called epidermal growth factor (EGF) pcursor homology domain (18Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L.

Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The EGF precursor domain contains two cysteine-rich EGF-like domains (EGF-A and EGF-B) separated from a third EGF repeat (EGF-C) by a Î²-propeller domain (21Springer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Jeon H. Meng W. Takagi J. Eck M.J. Springer T.A. Blacklow S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The EGF precursor homology domain is required for the LDLR to dissociate from lipoproteins in the endosome after the complex is internalized (23Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. SuÌdhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Immediately downstream of the EGF precursor homology domain is a threonine- and serine-rich region, to which multiple O-linked sugars are attached, which is followed by the transmembrane domain and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail that contains all the sequences required for receptor clustering in clathrincoated pits and for internalization of the receptor (24Davis C.G.

Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In 2002, Rudenko et al. (26Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) crystallized the extracellular domain of the receptor at an acidic pH, providing new insights into the mechanism by which the LDLR delivers cholesterol to cells without being degraded in the process. At neutral pH, the ligand-binding repeats are predicted to be extended away from the EGF precursor homology domain and accessible to lipoproteins. When the pH falls, as occurs in the endosome, the ligand-binding domain forms a physical association with the EGF precursor homology domain. The acid-dependent conformational change in the LDLR releases the lipoprotein from the ligandbinding domain and signals the receptor to return to the cell surface.As a first step in determining how PCSK9 binding to the extracellular domain of the LDLR results in receptor degradation, we mapped the site in the LDLR that interacts with PCSK9. We provide evidence that a direct interaction between PCSK9 and the EGF-A repeat in the LDLR interferes with the recycling of the receptor protein from the endosome to the cell surface, resulting in the receptors being rerouted to the lysosome for degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsâThe culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Meditech, Inc.

The VLDL receptor (VLDLR) expression construct (pVLDLR) contained one copy of a hemagglutinin epitope tag (CYPYDVPDTAG) (29Tokiwa G. Tyers M. Volpe T. Futcher B. Nature. 1994; 371: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) at the C terminus. Mutations in EGF-A were generated using pLDLR17 or pVLDLR and the QuikChangeâ¢ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the oligonucleotides containing the residues to be mutated (underlined) were synthesized by IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and are provided in supplemental Table S1. The presence of the desired mutation and the integrity of each construct were verified by DNA sequencing.Binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR or VLDLRâSimian COS-M cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes (1.5 Ã 106 cells/dish) in 4 ml of DMEM (glucose, 1 g/liter) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with expression plasmids for wild-type or mutant LDLR or VLDLR (8 Î¼g/dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 (20 Î¼l of Lipofectamine/dish) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Meditech, Inc.) and then incubated in 2 ml of DMEM (glucose, 1 g/liter) containing 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-poor serum (NCLPPS), 10 Î¼g/ml cholesterol, 1 Î¼g/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 0.5 Î¼g/ml purified PCSK9. The PCSK9 used in these experiments contained a FLAG tag at the C terminus and was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel chromatography (Sigma), followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Tricorn Superose 6 10/300 fast performance liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), as previously described (14Lagace T.A.

The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) by electroblotting. Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: an anti-LDLR polyclonal anti-serum (3143) directed against the 14 amino acids at the C terminus of the LDLR (30Russell D.W. Schneider W.J.

The cells were lysed in 150 Î¼l of lysis buffer and then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble debris. A total of 60 Î¼l of the cell lysate was saved. Ninety Î¼l of lysate was added to 60 Î¼l of a 50% slurry of neutravidin-agarose and 410 Î¼l of lysis buffer. The mixture was rotated overnight at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation at 3,000 Ã g for 5 min, the pellets were washed in lysis buffer three times for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The cell surface proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 1Ã SDS loading buffer (31 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol) and incubated for 5 min at 90 Â°C. The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8%) and immunoblotted using a monoclonal anti-hLDLR antibody (HL-1) directed against the linker sequence between the forth and fifth LDLR ligand-binding repeat (31van Driel I.R.

After 8 days, the cells were infected with viruses expressing Î²-galactosidase, the wild-type LDLR or mutant LDLR (1.4 Ã 109 particles/35-mm dish). After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 1 ml of culture medium containing 5% (v/v) NCLPPS, 10 Î¼g/ml cholesterol, 1 Î¼g/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 1 Î¼g/ml purified recombinant PCSK9 for 4 h. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 150 Î¼l of lysis buffer. Whole cell protein extracts were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and immunoblot analysis to detect the LDLR (HL-1) and PCSK9 (15A6). Transferrin receptor was detected using a monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen).Purification of GST:EGF-A Fusion ProteinsâWild-type and mutant (D310E) EGF-A of the LDLR were expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins using the vector pGEX-4T (GE Healthcare) in Escherichia coli BL-21-DE3 cells (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). The transformed cells were grown at 37 Â°C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 Î¼g/ml) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h when the A600 reached 0.8. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C. The cell pellets were resuspended and incubated on ice for 30 min in 25 ml of PBS containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell operated at 1500 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6.9 kPa). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,500 Ã g for 30 min. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-Î¼m filter, and GST:EGF-A fusion protein was purified using Glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) affinity gel chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fusion protein was eluted with 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, for 2 h at room temperature, and concentrated using a Centriplus filter (3-kDa molecular mass cut-off; Millipore, Billerica, MA). The fusion protein was further purified using size exclusion chromatography on a Tricorn Superose 12 10/300 fast performance liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the fusion protein were concentrated using a 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off Centriplus filter. Protein purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining (Bio-Rad).Co-immunoprecipitation of Purified GST:EGF-A Fusion Protein and PCSK9âPurified wild-type or mutant GST:EGF-A (1 Î¼g) and PCSK9 (1 Î¼g) were incubated in 500 Î¼l of immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS, 1% Tween 20 and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 Â°C on a rotator in the presence of an anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Novus, Littleton, CO) or an anti-PCSK9 polyclonal antibody (295A) (14Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and protein A-agarose (Replicon, Waltham, MA). After centrifugation at 3,000 Ã g for 5 min, the supernatants were removed and retained. The pellets were washed in immunoprecipitation buffer three times for 10 min at 4 Â°C, and the proteins were eluted using 1Ã SDS loading buffer containing 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol (pellets). The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%), and immunoblotting. PCSK9 was detected using a monoclonal antibody, 15A6. GST:EGF-A was detected using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen).Ligand Blotting and pH DependenceâPurified extracellular domain of the LDLR (amino acids 1-699) was kindly provided by J. Deisenhofer (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The LDLR protein (200 ng) was size-fractionated under nonreducing conditions by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and cut into individual strips. Blocking buffer (PBS plus 2.5% nonfat milk) was added to each strip. After 30 min, the strips were rinsed briefly in pH buffer (50 mm Trismaleate, pH 7.0 to 5.2, or 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2.5% nonfat milk) and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min with 1.0 Î¼g/ml 125I-PCSK9 (0.5 Î¼Ci/Î¼g) in the pH buffer in the absence or presence of 50 Î¼g/ml nonradiolabeled PCSK9. Following three 15-min washes with pH buffer, the strips were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate. The resulting signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 system (GE Healthcare). Specific binding represents total binding (absence of excess nonradiolabeled PCSK9) minus nonspecific binding (presence of excess nonradiolabeled PCSK9).Immunofluorescence of WIF-B CellsâWIF-B cells were grown as previously described (33Graf G.A.

The medium was changed to F12 Coon's modification medium (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 5% human lipoprotein-poor serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. On the day of the experiment the cells were incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml of either native or heat-inactivated (for 10 min at 95 Â°C) recombinant PCSK9. The coverslips were rinsed with cold PBS and were fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS at 4 Â°C for 5 min. The cells were permeabilized in methanol at 4 Â°C for 10 min and then incubated in PBS plus 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Buffer A) for 30 min followed by an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C in Buffer A plus rabbit anti-bovine LDLR anti-serum (0.5 Î¼g/ml) (4548) (34Beisiegel U. Kita T. Anderson R.G. Schneider W.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

The coverslips were washed three times for 5 min with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (Buffer B) and then incubated for 1 h in buffer A with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 Î¼g/ml) (Invitrogen). The coverslips were rinsed in Buffer B prior to mounting with a 4â²,6â²-diamino-2-phenylindole containing mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaging the sections using a 100Ã 1.3 objective on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510 Meta 2P).RESULTSPCSK9 Binding to the Extracellular Domain of the LDLRâPreviously, we showed that PCSK9 binds the LDLR on the surface of cells (14Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2995-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To map the site of PCSK9 binding to the LDLR, we used cultured monkey kidney cells (COS-M cells) to express either wild-type LDLR or LDLRs lacking each (or all) of the ligand-binding repeats. Purified human PCSK9 (0.5 Î¼g/ml) was added to the medium, and after 2 h the cells were lysed and subjected to duplicate immunoblotting to detect the LDLR and PCSK9 (Fig. 1A). The antibody used to detect the LDLR recognizes both the precursor (â¼120 kDa) and the mature, fully glycosylated form (â¼160 kDa) of the receptor (35Tolleshaug H. Hobgood K.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), as well as partially glycosylated forms of the receptor that are often seen when the receptor is expressed in COS-M cells and HEK-293 cells (27Esser V. Limbrid L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar amounts of mature LDLR were expressed in cells transfected with each construct. No PCSK9 was found associated with the cells expressing the vector alone (lane 1), whereas PCSK9 bound to cells expressing the wild-type LDLR (lane 2) and in cells expressing LDLRs lacking one or all of the ligand-binding repeats (lanes 3-10). From these experiments we concluded that the ligand-binding repeats were not required for binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR.Next, we examined the effect of deleting portions of the EGF precursor homology domain of the LDLR on PCSK9 binding. No PCSK9 was detected in cells expressing a LDLR missing the first EGF-like repeat, EGF-A (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or the entire EGF precursor homology domain (lane 7), whereas PCSK9 bound to cells with receptors lacking EGF-B (lane 4), the Î²-propeller domain (lane 5) or the clustered O-linked sugar region (lane 10). Deletion of the third EGF-like repeat (EGF-C) disrupted the intracellular trafficking of the LDLR so that no mature, fully glycosylated form of the receptor was seen in these cells (see below), and no PCSK9 binding was detected (lane 6). These results are consistent with a requirement for EGF-A for PCSK9 binding to the LDLR.EGF-A Is Required for PCSK9 Binding to the LDLRâProtein structures determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystallography (36Kurniawan N.D.

https://openalex.org/W2151488696,"Spatial working memory (WM; i.e., âscratchpadâ memory) is constantly updated to guide behavior based on representational knowledge of spatial position. It is maintained by spatially tuned, recurrent excitation within networks of prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons, evident during delay periods in WM tasks. Stimulation of postsynaptic Î±2A adrenoceptors (Î±2A-ARs) is critical for WM. We report that Î±2A-AR stimulation strengthens WM through inhibition of cAMP, closing Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and strengthening the functional connectivity of PFC networks. Ultrastructurally, HCN channels and Î±2A-ARs were colocalized in dendritic spines in PFC. In electrophysiological studies, either Î±2A-AR stimulation, cAMP inhibition or HCN channel blockade enhanced spatially tuned delay-related firing of PFC neurons. Conversely, delay-related network firing collapsed under conditions of excessive cAMP. In behavioral studies, either blockade or knockdown of HCN1 channels in PFC improved WM performance. These data reveal a powerful mechanism for rapidly altering the strength of WM networks in PFC.

There are multiple forms of memory mediated by distinct brain systems: e.g., long-term consolidation of declarative memories mediated by hippocampal circuits, repetitious experience creating habit memories in striatal loops, and varying types of associative memories stored in the cortex, amygdale, and cerebellum. In contrast to these enduring forms of memory, working memory (WM) maintains information in a temporary buffer that is constantly updated according to cognitive demands. WM depends on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a highly evolved brain region that is greatly expanded in human and nonhuman primates. The contents of WM can be recalled from long-term storage or can represent a recent event that is temporarily held in mind. This represented information is used to guide behavior, thought, and emotion, allowing us to inhibit inappropriate actions and to plan for the future (Fuster, 1985Fuster J.M. The prefrontal cortex, mediator of cross-temporal contingencies.Hum. Neurobiol. 1985; 4: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar, Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Given the short-term nature of WM, it is unlikely to involve the types of synaptic structural changes thought to underlie consolidation of long-term memory. Rather, WM is thought to arise from recurrent activity in a network of PFC neurons with shared properties (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The spatial WM characteristics of neurons in the primate PFC (area 46) have been well characterized in monkeys performing spatial WM tasks that require the animal to remember a constantly changing, visually cued spatial location over a brief delay period. Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar identified a canonical PFC microcircuit with spatially tuned mnemonic delay period activity. The key features of the PFC microcircuit are (1) persistent activity created by mutual excitation between pyramidal neurons with similar spatial properties, and (2) spatial tuning regulated by inhibitory interneurons with dissimilar spatial properties. The horizontal connectivity of layer III pyramidal cells is thought to be an important component of the PFC microcircuit (Kritzer and Goldman-Rakic, 1995Kritzer M.F. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Intrinsic circuit organization of the major layers and sublayers of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the rhesus monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recurrent connections allow PFC neurons to continue firing during the delay period when no stimulus is present in the environment, maintaining representations over time even in the presence of distracting stimuli (Miller et al., 1996Miller E.K. Erickson C.A. Desimone R. Neural mechanisms of visual working memory in prefrontal cortex of the macaque.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5154-5167PubMed Google Scholar). This is a fragile process that is highly dependent on the correct neurochemical environment. Catecholamines have an essential influence on PFC spatial WM functions. Although early work focused on dopamine, it is now known that norepinephrine (NE) strongly influences WM via postsynaptic Î±2A-adrenoceptors (Î±2A-ARs) (Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1985Arnsten A.F.T.

Alpha-2 adrenergic modulation of prefrontal cortical neuronal activity related to spatial working memory in monkeys.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 21: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Conversely, stimulation of postsynaptic Î±2A-ARs strengthens PFC cognitive functions in rodents (Franowicz et al., 2002Franowicz J.S. Kessler L. Dailey-Borja C.M. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Arnsten A.F.T. Mutation of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor impairs working memory performance and annuls cognitive enhancement by guanfacine.J.

The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist guanfacine improves memory in aged monkeys without sedative or hypotensive side effects.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4287-4298PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (Jakala et al., 1999Jakala P. Riekkinen M. Sirvio J. Koivisto E. Kejonen K. Vanhanen M. Riekkinen P.J.

Based on this research, the Î±2A-AR agonist, guanfacine, is currently used to treat PFC cognitive deficits in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Scahill et al., 2001Scahill L.

Working memory deficits after traumatic brain injury: catecholaminergic mechanisms and prospects for treatmentâa review.Brain Inj. 2004; 18: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the cellular basis and molecular events underlying these therapeutic actions are not known. Recent studies indicate that elevated cAMP signaling in PFC impairs behavioral measures of WM, and that Î±2A-AR stimulation improves WM performance via Gi suppression of cAMP intracellular signaling. In contrast to long-term memory consolidation which is facilitated by cAMP signaling, WM performance at short delays is impaired by increased cAMP signaling, e.g., following infusion of the cAMP analog, Sp-cAMPS, into the rat PFC (Taylor et al., 1999Taylor J.R. Birnbaum S.G. Ubriani R. Arnsten A.F.T. Activation of protein kinase A in prefrontal cortex impairs working memory performance.J. Neurosci. (Online). 1999; 19: RC23PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, WM performance of aged monkeys is impaired by systemic administration of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, rolipram, which increases endogenous levels of cAMP (Ramos et al., 2003Ramos B. Birnbaum S.B. Lindenmayer I. Newton S.S. Duman R. Arnsten A.F.T. Dysregulation of protein kinase A signaling in the aged prefrontal cortex: New strategy for treating age-related cognitive decline.Neuron. 2003; 40: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The enhancing effects of guanfacine on WM can be blocked by coinfusion of low dose Sp-cAMPS in the rat PFC (Ramos et al., 2006Ramos B. Stark D. Verduzco L. van Dyck C.H. Arnsten A.F.T. Alpha-2A-Adrenoceptor stimulation improves prefrontal cortical regulation of behavior through inhibition of cAMP signaling in aging animals.Learn. Mem. 2006; 13: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of cAMP with Rp-cAMPS infusions improved WM performance (Ramos et al., 2003Ramos B. Birnbaum S.B. Lindenmayer I. Newton S.S. Duman R. Arnsten A.F.T. Dysregulation of protein kinase A signaling in the aged prefrontal cortex: New strategy for treating age-related cognitive decline.Neuron. 2003; 40: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that excessive cAMP actions in PFC impair WM. Importantly, dysregulated cAMP signaling may contribute to WM deficits in schizophrenia, as a gene linked to this disorder, DISC1, has been found to upregulate PDE4B activity under conditions of high cAMP production (Millar et al., 2005Millar J.K. Pickard B.S. Mackie S. James R.S. Christie S. Buchanan S.R. Malloy M.P. Chubb J.E. Huston E. Baillie G.S. et al.DISC1 and PDE4B are interacting genetic factors in schizophrenia that regulate cAMP signaling.Science. 2005; 310: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus it is key to understand how elevated cAMP signaling impairs PFC cognitive operations. Although cAMP is often associated with protein kinase A, it also has powerful influences on Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that pass an h current (Ih) when opened. In neocortex and hippocampus, Ih channels are heteromers of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits that are highly responsive to cAMP (Chen et al., 2001Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S.A. Properties of hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current defined by coassembly of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits and basal modulation by cyclic nucleotide.J. Gen.

Dendritic lh normalizes temporal summation in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). As pyramidal cells have a negative resting potential (â¼ â65 mv), HCN channels are thought to open during the awake, resting state in the presence of cAMP (Nolan et al., 2004Nolan M.F. Malleret G. Dudman J.T. Buhl D.L. Santoro B. Gibbs E. Vronskaya S. Buzsaki G. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Morozov A.

In hippocampus, inputs to CA1 pyramids are spatially segregated such that the opening of Ih channels on distal dendrites functionally disconnects CA1 pyramidal cells from CA3 inputs without influencing perforant path connections (Nolan et al., 2004Nolan M.F. Malleret G. Dudman J.T. Buhl D.L. Santoro B. Gibbs E. Vronskaya S. Buzsaki G. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Morozov A.

Ih channels may have similarly powerful effects on PFC function, given the importance of dendritic inputs for sustaining recurrent excitation during the delay period of WM tasks. Ih channels are particularly dense on pyramidal dendrites of the superficial cortical layers (LÃ¶rincz et al., 2002LÃ¶rincz A. Notomi T. Tamas G. Shigemoto R. Nusser Z. Polarized and compartment-dependent distribution of HCN1 in pyramidal cell dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004Notomi T. Shigemoto R. Immunohistochemical localization of Ih channel subunits, HCN1â4, in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 471: 241-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In monkey PFC, these layers also contain the highest concentration of Î±2A-ARs, localized in axons, dendritic spines and shafts (Aoki et al., 1998Aoki C. Venkatesan C. Go C.-G. Forman R. Kurose H. Cellular and subcellular sites for noradrenergic action in the monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as revealed by the immunocytochemical localization of noradrenergic receptors and axons.Cereb. Cortex. 1998; 8: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Goldman-Rakic et al., 1990Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Gallager D.W. Overlap of dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic receptors and complementarity of their subtypes in primate prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2125-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that HCN1 or HCN1/HCN2 heteromers on spines of pyramidal dendrites are spatially coexpressed with the Î±2A-AR, thus providing a potent substratum for functional interaction in the primate PFC. Electrophysiological and cognitive experiments support a model where Î±2A-AR agonists such as guanfacine improve PFC cognitive function by inhibiting the production of cAMP, closing HCN channels, and strengthening the PFC networks that underlie delay-related cell firing in monkeys performing a spatial WM task. Monkeys performed an oculomotor spatial delayed response (ODR) task, illustrated in Figure 1A. The ODR task requires the monkey to make a memory-guided saccade to a visuo-spatial target. Neurons were recorded from area 46 of the dorsolateral PFC (Figure 1B) as the monkey performed the task. Figure 1C shows the activity of a PFC neuron with task-related firing. This neuron shows delay-related firing for the 180Â° location (preferred direction) but not for other directions (e.g., 0Â°, nonpreferred direction). In the present study, 128 neurons with delay-related mnemonic activity were isolated and subjected to iontophoretic application of pharmacological agents (see the Supplemental Data, available with this article online, for tables summarizing the effects of drugs [Table S1] and their reversal [Table S2] on PFC neuronal response). Intra-PFC administration of the Î±2A-AR agonist, guanfacine, improves WM performance (Mao et al., 1999Mao Z.-M. Arnsten A.F.T. Li B.-M. Local infusion of alpha-1 adrenergic agonist into the prefrontal cortex impairs spatial working memory performance in monkeys.Biol. Psychiatry. 1999; 46: 1259-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, guanfacine has never been examined for its effects on PFC neuronal firing. In the present study, guanfacine was applied iontophoretically to 35 neurons with spatial delay-related activity. Low doses of guanfacine (5â15 nA) significantly enhanced delay-related activity for the preferred direction in 28 out of 35 cases, while having no effect on neuronal activity of the remaining 7 neurons. In contrast, high doses of guanfacine (20â50 nA) suppressed delay-related activity in nine out of nine neurons, perhaps due to stimulation of presynaptic Î±2A-ARs, reducing endogenous NE release. Figure 2A shows a PFC neuron with relatively weak spatial mnemonic tuning in the control condition. Following guanfacine application (10 nA), delay-related firing was substantially increased for the preferred (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001) but not for the nonpreferred direction (p > 0.05), thus enhancing spatial mnemonic tuning. In neurons with strong spatial mnemonic tuning, the effects of guanfacine (5 nA) were similar but smaller in magnitude, as shown in Figure 2B (p < 0.001). At higher doses, guanfacine (50 nA) did not have enhancing effects (Figure 2B). Previous studies demonstrated that iontophoretic application of yohimbine, an Î±2-AR antagonist, suppressed delay-related firing in PFC neurons (Li et al., 1999Li B.-M. Mao Z.-M. Wang M. Mei Z.-T. Alpha-2 adrenergic modulation of prefrontal cortical neuronal activity related to spatial working memory in monkeys.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 21: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Replicating these previous reports, iontophoresis of yohimbine (15 nA) suppressed delay-related activity for the preferred direction, thus eroding spatial mnemonic tuning (p < 0.0001, Figure 2C). The suppressive effects of yohimbine on delay activity occurred in 15 out of 15 cases (p < 0.01 for each cell). Furthermore, coiontophoresis of yohimbine (15 nA) reversed the enhancing effects of guanfacine on delay-related activity (p < 0.01, Figure 2D), consistent with actions at Î±2-ARs (population responses for guanfacine and yohimbine alone can be seen in Figures 2E and 2F, respectively). These results indicate that endogenous NE stimulation of Î±2-ARs plays an important role in strengthening delay-related firing. Behavioral studies in rats have shown that amplification of cAMP actions with Sp-cAMPS impaired spatial WM, while inhibition of cAMP actions with Rp-cAMPS ameliorated WM deficits. Consistent with these behavioral results, we found that iontophoresis of Sp-cAMPS (10 nA) significantly decreased delay-related firing for the preferred direction (p < 0.001, Figure 3A). Although the suppressive effects of Sp-cAMPS were replicated in 13 out of 27 neurons, Sp-cAMPS was found to nonspecifically increase the neuronal firing in 9 of 27 neurons, and had no effect in 5 neurons. These effects may result from Sp-cAMPS blocking adenosine receptors, inducing a nonspecific increase in firing rate. Thus, we examined an alterative method for increasing cAMP signaling. Etazolate is a PDE4 inhibitor that increases cAMP levels by inhibiting the breakdown of endogenously produced cAMP. Iontophoretic application of etazolate (25 nA) had highly consistent suppressing effects on spatial mnemonic activity in 10 of 12 PFC neurons. One example is shown in Figure 3B, in which etazolate dramatically inhibited spatial delay-related firing (p < 0.0001). The population response is shown in Figure 3F. In contrast to Sp-cAMPS and etazolate, iontophoresis of the cAMP inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS (40â50 nA) specifically increased delay-related firing for the preferred direction in 8 of 12 neurons (p < 0.001, Figure 3C, population response in Figure 3E). This enhancing effect was reversed by subsequent coiontophoresis of Sp-cAMP (p < 0.001), consistent with actions via cAMP signaling. Thus, inhibition of cAMP actions had an effect similar to that of iontophoresis of guanfacine. The enhancing effects of guanfacine on WM in rats has been reversed by coinfusion of Sp-cAMPS (Ramos et al., 2006Ramos B. Stark D. Verduzco L. van Dyck C.H. Arnsten A.F.T. Alpha-2A-Adrenoceptor stimulation improves prefrontal cortical regulation of behavior through inhibition of cAMP signaling in aging animals.Learn. Mem. 2006; 13: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We examined whether the enhancing effects of guanfacine on PFC neuronal firing are similarly reversed by Sp-cAMPS. As observed above, iontophoresis of guanfacine (10 nA) significantly increased delay-related firing for the preferred direction (p < 0.001, Figure 3D). Subsequent coiontophoresis of Sp-cAMPS (10 nA) with guanfacine (10 nA) significantly reversed the enhancing effects of guanfacine in six of nine cases (p < 0.001, Figure 3D). These results are consistent with guanfacine increasing delay-related firing through suppression of cAMP. As cAMP can increase the open state of HCN channels, we examined the role of Ih in WM by iontophoresing the HCN channel blocker, ZD7288. Low doses of ZD7288 (10 nA), like guanfacine or Rp-cAMPS, significantly increased delay-related firing for the preferred direction in 19 of 27 neurons. As with guanfacine, ZD7288 effects were most obvious in neurons with weak spatial tuning, however, small but consistent effects were also observed in well-tuned neurons with robust firing for the preferred direction under control conditions. For example, in Figure 4A, iontophoretic application of ZD7288 (5 nA) significantly increased delay-related firing for the preferred direction (p < 0.001), without altering baseline firing rates (p > 0.05), or firing for the nonpreferred direction (p > 0.05). ZD7288 had very robust enhancing effects on cells with weak mnemonic firing under control conditions. One example is shown in Figure 4B, in which application of ZD7288 induced dose-dependent effects, with a low dose (5 nA) significantly increasing delay-related firing for the preferred direction (p < 0.001). Subsequent application of ZD7288 at 10 nA further enhanced the delay-related activity for the preferred direction (p < 0.0001). This higher dose of ZD 7288 slightly increased the background firing rate, but produced greater delay-related firing for the preferred than the nonpreferred direction (ANOVA on percentage increase, p < 0.01). At the highest concentration (40 nA), ZD7288 decreased rather than increased firing (Figure 4B). These inhibitory effects likely arose from nonspecific blockade of glutamate receptors at high doses (Chen, 2004Chen C. ZD7288 inhibits postsynaptic glutamate receptor-mediated responses at hippocampal perforant path-granule cell synapses.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The population response for low-dose ZD7288 application in 27 neurons is shown in Figure 4E. A functional link between HCN channels and Î±2-ARs was examined by observing whether ZD7288 could reverse the effects of Î±2-AR blockade (Figure 4C). As observed above, iontophoretic application of yohimbine (15 nA) dramatically suppressed delay-related activity for the preferred direction (p < 0.0001). Subsequent coiontophoresis of ZD7288 significantly reversed the yohimbine response, restoring spatial mnemonic activity (p < 0.001). ZD7288 was able to reverse the suppressive effects of yohimbine in seven of nine cases (p < 0.05 for each case). These data support a functional interaction between Î±2-ARs and HCN channels at the physiological level. We also examined functional interactions between HCN channels and cAMP. As shown in Figure 4D, the reduction in delay-related firing induced by the PDE4 inhibitor, etazolate (p < 0.0001) was fully reversed by coiontophoresis of ZD7288 (p < 0.001). ZD7288 reversed the suppressive effects of etazolate in six of eight cases (p < 0.05 for each case; Figure 4F). Thus, blockade of HCN channels restored delay-related firing under conditions of high endogenous cAMP levels induced by either PDE4 inhibition or Î±2-AR blockade. These electrophysiological results demonstrate the key role of Î±2A-cAMP-HCN signaling in permitting spatial mnemonic firing in PFC networks. The cellular and network consequences of modulation of HCN channels was examined with intracellular and whole-cell recordings from layer V pyramidal cells simultaneously with extracellular multiple unit recordings in the ferret PFC in vitro (n = 55, see Figure 4G). Under normal conditions, these slices generate up and down states, consisting of repeating periods of recurrent network activity (Shu et al., 2003Shu Y.-S. Hasenstaub A. Badoual M. Bal T. McCormick D.A. Barrages of synaptic activity control the gain and sensitivity of cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10388-10401PubMed Google Scholar). Bath application of ZD7288 (20â50 Î¼M; n = 10) resulted in a nearly 500% increase in duration of the recurrent network activity of the up state from an average of 0.84 (Â± 0.25) to 4.1 (Â± 1.3) s and an increase in up-state action potential discharge from 1.8 Â± 1.7 Hz to 9.2 Â± 4.9 Hz (n = 9). This ZD7288-induced enhancement of recurrent network activity occurred in conjunction with a progressive hyperpolarization of layer V pyramidal neurons (n = 12), an increase in apparent input resistance (from 18.6 Â± 7.5 to 36 Â± 10.8 mÎ©, n = 10), and a marked enhancement of the amplitude of synaptic barrages of the up state from an average peak amplitude of 7.6 Â± 2.7 mV to 20.7 Â± 7.2 mV (n = 21 Figure 4G, lowest panel). These results reveal that reduction of the Ih results in significant enhancement of local recurrent network activity in cortical networks, presumably through enhanced effectiveness of dendritic synaptic potentials to initiate action potential activity (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in I(h).Nat.

The next study tested the hypothesis that reducing Ih in rat prelimbic PFC (Figure 5A) would improve performance of a spatial delayed alternation task sensitive to PFC lesions (Larsen and Divac, 1978Larsen J.K. Divac I. Selective ablations within the prefrontal cortex of the rat and performance of delayed alternation.Physiolog. Psychol. 1978; 6: 15-17Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The prelimbic PFC displayed strong HCN1 immunoreactivity, with robust labeling of the apical dendrites in superficial layers (Figures 5B and 5C). Ih was then reduced through either (1) blockade of HCN channels with intra-PFC ZD7288 infusions or (2) knockdown of HCN1 channel expression in PFC. The first experiment tested whether infusion of ZD7288 into prelimbic PFC would improve performance as previously seen with guanfacin"

https://openalex.org/W2006764478,"Although oxidative damage has long been associated with ageing and neurological disease, mechanistic connections of oxidation to these phenotypes have remained elusive. Here we show that the age-dependent somatic mutation associated with Huntingtonâs disease occurs in the process of removing oxidized base lesions, and is remarkably dependent on a single base excision repair enzyme, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1). Both in vivo and in vitro results support a âtoxic oxidationâ model in which OGG1 initiates an escalating oxidationâexcision cycle that leads to progressive age-dependent expansion. Age-dependent CAG expansion provides a direct molecular link between oxidative damage and toxicity in post-mitotic neurons through a DNA damage response, and error-prone repair of single-strand breaks. Oxidative damage has been linked to ageing and neurodegenerative disease for decades, but the physiological link between oxidation and the genetics of ageing remains elusive. Now it may have been found. Huntington's and several other neurodegenerative diseases involve the expansion of CAG triplet repeats. In a mouse model of human Huntington's disease, this expansion occurs in mid-life and continues throughout life. The expansion occurs in terminally differentiated cells and is associated with oxidative damage. Deficiency in the glycolase OGG1 attenuates age-dependent repeat expansion, and as OGG1 is a DNA repair enzyme, it seems that aberrant repair of oxidative damage triggers the disease. This work suggests targets for drugs to stop or slow the onset of the disease. Several neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expansion of CAG triplet repeats, and, using a mouse model of human Huntington's disease, this study shows that this expansion occurs in mid-life and continues throughout life; furthermore, the expansion occurs in terminally differentiated cells. This is associated with oxidative damage, and deficiency in OGG1, a DNA repair enzyme, attenuates age-dependent repeat expansion â thus it seems that aberrant repair of oxidative damage is the basis for this disease."

As an important step towards understanding the systems biology of a complex eukaryote, we cataloged 63% of the predicted Drosophila melanogaster proteome by detecting 9,124 proteins from 498,000 redundant and 72,281 distinct peptide identifications. This unprecedented high proteome coverage for a complex eukaryote was achieved by combining sample diversity, multidimensional biochemical fractionation and analysis-driven experimentation feedback loops, whereby data collection is guided by statistical analysis of prior data. We show that high-quality proteomics data provide crucial information to amend genome annotation and to confirm many predicted gene models. We also present experimentally identified proteotypic peptides matching â¼50% of D. melanogaster gene models.

https://openalex.org/W1976337404,"Diverse cell types require the ability to maintain dynamically polarized membrane-protein distributions through balancing transport and diffusion. However, design principles underlying dynamically maintained cortical polarity are not well understood. Here we constructed a mathematical model for characterizing the morphology of dynamically polarized protein distributions. We developed analytical approaches for measuring all model parameters from single-cell experiments. We applied our methods to a well-characterized system for studying polarized membrane proteins: budding yeast cells expressing activated Cdc42. We found that a balance of diffusion, directed transport, and endocytosis was sufficient for accurately describing polarization morphologies. Surprisingly, the model predicts that polarized regions are defined with a precision that is nearly optimal for measured endocytosis rates and that polarity can be dynamically stabilized through positive feedback with directed transport. Our approach provides a step toward understanding how biological systems shape spatially precise, unambiguous cortical polarity domains using dynamic processes."

https://openalex.org/W2080559728,"Bid, a caspase-activated proapoptotic BH3-only protein, is essential for Fas-induced hepatocyte destruction. Recent studies published in Cell produced conflicting results, indicating that loss of Bid either protects or enhances apoptosis induced by DNA damage or replicative stress. To resolve this controversy, we generated novel Bid-deficient mice on an inbred C57BL/6 background and removed the drug-selection cassette from the targeted locus. Nine distinct cell types from these Bid-deficient mice underwent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in a manner indistinguishable from control WT cells in response to DNA damage or replicative stress. Moreover, we found that even cells from the original Bid-deficient mice responded normally to these stimuli, indicating that differences in genetic background or the presence of a strong promoter within the targeted locus are unlikely to explain the differences between our results and those reported previously. We conclude that Bid has no role in DNA damage- or replicative stress-induced apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2156802128,"Sphingomyelin (SM) is a vital component of cellular membranes in organisms ranging from mammals to protozoa. Its production involves the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, yielding diacylglycerol in the process. The mammalian genome encodes two known SM synthase (SMS) isoforms, SMS1 and SMS2. However, the relative contributions of these enzymes to SM production in mammalian cells remained to be established. Here we show that SMS1 and SMS2 are co-expressed in a variety of cell types and function as the key Golgi- and plasma membrane-associated SM synthases in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, respectively. RNA interference-mediated depletion of either SMS1 or SMS2 caused a substantial decrease in SM production levels, an accumulation of ceramides, and a block in cell growth. Although SMS-depleted cells displayed a reduced SM content, external addition of SM did not restore growth. These results indicate that the biological role of SM synthases goes beyond formation of SM.

These results indicate that the biological role of SM synthases goes beyond formation of SM. Sphingolipids are ubiquitous components of biomembranes in eukaryotic cells. The most abundant sphingolipid species in mammalian cells is sphingomyelin (SM), 3The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; DAG, diacylglycerol; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; siRNA, small interfering RNA duplex; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); NS, non-silencing; LA, lamin A; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EPC, ethanolamine phosphorylceramide; MS, mass spectrometry. which comprises 5â15% of total phospholipids. SM synthesis involves the transfer of a phosphocholine head group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide with concomitant production of diacylglycerol (DAG) (1Ullman M.D. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1506-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, SM synthase, thus occupies a central position at a crossroad of sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism and has considerable biological potential as a regulator of the proapoptotic factor ceramide and mitogenic factor DAG. Indeed several lines of evidence indicate that SM synthesis plays a critical role in cell growth and survival. Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells with a thermolabile serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis, die in the absence of externally added sphingoid base when shifted to the non-permissive temperature. The mutant cells could be rescued by added SM but not by glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the precursor of higher glycosphingolipids (3Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another study reported the isolation of a mouse lymphoid cell line with diminished SM synthase activity and a defect in cell growth when cultured under serum-free conditions; growth could be restored by supplementing the medium with exogenous SM (4Yamaoka S. Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Finally fluctuations in SM synthase activity have been linked to mitogenic and proapoptotic signaling in a variety of mammalian cell types (5Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Biol.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 415-423PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the requirement of SM synthesis in cell growth is not clear, and any of the following scenarios may apply. To begin with, SM accumulates in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and its high packing density and affinity for cholesterol likely contribute to the barrier function of this organelle. In addition, SM at the plasma membrane provides a reservoir of lipid signaling molecules that are liberated by acidic or neutral SMases in response to a variety of biological stimuli (8Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); these molecules include ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, and have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (9Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 10Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). As SM has a strong capacity to form microdomains, its production in the trans Golgi may affect the lateral organization of other membrane components and hence provide a physical basis for sorting events that help establish the compositional and functional differences between the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and Golgi itself (11Holthuis J.C. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. Van Meer G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Moreover SM synthesis in the trans Golgi may create a local pool of DAG, which provides a cue for protein kinase D recruitment and the formation of secretory vesicles (12Baron C.L. Malhotra V. Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Finally by regulating the cellular levels of the proapoptotic factor ceramide and mitogenic factor DAG in opposite directions, SM synthesis may have a direct impact on cell proliferation and life span (13Hampton R.Y. Morand O.H. Science. 1989; 2461050Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Using an expression cloning strategy in yeast, we previously identified a family of SM synthases whose members are present throughout the animal kingdom from mammals and nematodes to protozoa like the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 16Tafesse F.G. Ternes P. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In fact, each organism capable of SM production displays a multiplicity of SM synthase (SMS) genes. The human genome contains two of these genes, named SMS1 and SMS2. The corresponding enzymes fulfill essentially all criteria attributed previously to SM synthase and reside in organelles where SM synthesis is known to occur, namely the Golgi (SMS1) and plasma membrane (SMS2) (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 17Lee N.P. Mruk D.D. Xia W. Cheng C.Y. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 192: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, Yamaoka et al. (4Yamaoka S. Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) reported the expression cloning of human SMS1 using a mouse lymphoid cell line with severely reduced SM synthase activity and susceptibility to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin-induced cell death. This work suggested that SMS1 represents a major SM synthase activity in mammalian cells with a critical role in cell growth. However, the molecular basis of the SM synthase defect in the lymphoid cell line has not yet been clarified. Interestingly a recent study showed that resistance of S49 mouse lymphoma cells to alkyl-lysophospholipid-induced apoptosis is due to transcriptional down-regulation of SMS1 (18Van der Luit A.H.

Whether alkyl-lysophospholipid-resistant S49 cells are defective in growth when cultured under serum-free conditions (i.e. without exogenous SM) is unclear. Consequently the precise contribution of SMS1 and SMS2 to SM production and growth in mammalian cells remains to be determined. In the present study we used RNA interference to specifically deplete SMS1 or SMS2 from human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and analyzed the effect of these manipulations on the Golgi- and plasma membrane-associated SM synthase activities, SM production levels, overall lipid composition, and cell growth.

Cell Culture, Plasmid Transfection, and RNA InterferenceâHeLa cells were routinely cultured at 37 Â°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with human SMS1-V5/pcDNA3.1, human SMS2-V5/pcDNA3.1 (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C.

Krueschner, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen).

All transfections with siRNAs were carried out in Opti-MEM I Glutamax medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3% normal or delipidated fetal calf serum as indicated. Delipidated serum was prepared by butanol-diisopropyl ether extraction according to Cham and Knowles (20Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several different SMS1- and SMS2-directed siRNAs were initially tested on SMS1-V5- and SMS2-V5-expressing HeLa cells. This yielded one SMS1 siRNA (sense, CUACACUCCCAGUACCUGG) and three different SMS2 siRNAs (2a sense, GGCUCAAUUCCUUGCUGCU; 2b sense, CCCAAGAGCUUAUCCAGUG; 2c sense, GUCAAUAGUGGGACGCAGA) that each gave a strong (80â90%) and specific reduction in expression of the corresponding SMS protein after 3 days of treatment. Non-silencing (NS) siRNA (sense, UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU) and siRNA directed against the nuclear matrix protein lamin A (LA; sense, CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACA) served as controls. For long term RNA interference, cells were passaged after 3 days of siRNA transfection, retransfected with siRNAs, and then incubated for 3 or 4 additional days as indicated. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunofluorescence MicroscopyâHeLa cells and yeast strains expressing V5-tagged SMS1 or SMS2 were processed for immunoblot analysis as described previously (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J.

An 18-amino acid peptide (CRKYSRVQKIGEDNEKST) corresponding to the C terminus of human SMS2 was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits (Exalpha Biologicals Inc., Maynard, MA). One of the resulting antisera (antiserum 15910) was selected for this study and used at a dilution of 1:1,000 for immunoblot analysis.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-lamin A/C antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against the V5 epitope and p24 protein were described previously (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C.

For immunoblot analysis, antibody incubations were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% ovalbumin and 0.5% Tween 20. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Chemiluminescent bands were quantified using a GS-710 calibrating imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) with QuantityOne software. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C.

Briefly HeLa cells grown on 15-cm dishes were scraped and disrupted in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose containing freshly added protease inhibitors) (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) with 80 strokes of a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 Ã g for 15 min, and pellets were washed once in ice-cold lysis buffer. Supernatants were pooled, and Percoll was added to a final concentration of 22.5% (v/v). Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in a Beckman 50Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 Â°C, and 24 0.4-ml fractions were collected from the top. Equal amounts per fraction were subjected to immunoblotting and analyzed for GlcCer and SM synthase activity. To this end, gradient fractions (100 Î¼l) were incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 10 Î¼m C6-NBD-Cer, 1 mm UDP-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Lipids were extracted by addition of 1.7 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2.2), dried under N2, and subjected to butanol/water partitioning. Lipids recovered from the butanol phase were separated by TLC for 30 min in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid: water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v/v/v). Fluorescent lipids were visualized on a Storm 860 imaging analysis system (GE Healthcare) and quantified with ImageQuant software. Metabolic LabelingâHeLa cells were labeled with N-methyl[14C]choline (2 Î¼Ci/ml) or 3-l-[14C]serine (1 Î¼Ci/ml) for 4 h or in the case of 1-[3H]sphingosine (1 Î¼Ci/ml) for 1 h in Opti-MEM containing 3% delipidated serum at 37 Â°C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then subjected to lipid extraction using the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The organic extracts were dried under N2 and, where indicated, deacylated by mild base treatment in 0.5 m methanolic NaOCH3 (60 min at room temperature). Lipids were extracted with chloroform and separated by TLC in chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia solution (50:25:6, v/v/v) or in the case of 1-[3H]sphingosine labeling using chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (60:40:9, v/v/v). Radiolabeled lipids were detected by exposure to BAS-MS imaging screens (Fuji Photo Film Co.), read out on a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager, and quantified with ImageQuant software. Mass Spectrometric AnalysisâHeLa cell lipid extracts were prepared according to the method of Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but omitting the salt. Crude lipid extracts were evaporated under N2, dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:2), and supplemented with internal standards for SM, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, ceramide, and GlcCer as described previously (24Hermansson M. Kakela R. Berghall M. Lehesjoki A.E. Somerharju P. Lahtinen U. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate analysis (25Bartlett E.M. Lewis D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), sphingolipid concentration was determined according to Naoi et al. (26Naoi M. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and cholesterol concentration was determined as described in Gamble et al. (27Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid molecular species and classes were quantified by liquid chromatography-MS as detailed in Hermansson et al. (24Hermansson M. Kakela R. Berghall M. Lehesjoki A.E. Somerharju P. Lahtinen U. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using an Interchrom Lichrosphere diol-modified silica column coupled on line to a Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). C6-NBD-ceramide Staining of the GolgiâC6-NBD-ceramide labeling of live HeLa cells was performed as described previously (28Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly subconfluent cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated for 30 min in HBSS containing 5 Î¼m C6-NBD-ceramide complexed with 5 Î¼m fatty acid-free BSA at 4 Â°C. Cells were washed three times, chased in HBSS + 1% BSA for 10 min at 37 Â°C, and then fixed with 0.125% glutaraldehyde in HBSS for 5 min at 4 Â°C. Cells were immediately observed using a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 microscope. Cell Surface SM Synthase AssayâCell surface SM synthase activity was assayed essentially as described previously (29van Helvoort A. van't Hof W. Ritsema T. Sandra A. van Meer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS and incubated for 3 h at 0 Â°C in HBSS containing 5 Î¼m C6-NBD-ceramide and 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA followed by a 30-min incubation in HBSS + 1% (w/v) BSA. The medium was pooled, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and subjected to butanol/water partitioning. Lipids recovered from the butanol phase were separated by one-dimensional TLC in chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia solution (9:7:3, v/v/v). Fluorescent lipids were visualized and quantified as above. Cell Growth AssayâHeLa cells plated at 2 Ã 105 cells/9.6-cm2 dish were treated with siRNAs in Opti-MEM as above. After 6 h of treatment, the medium was changed for Opti-MEM containing 3% normal or 3% delipidated fetal calf serum supplemented with 80 Î¼m exogenous SM or PC as described previously (3Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, lipids were dissolved in a small amount of chloroform, dried under sterile conditions, and then dispersed in autoclaved water at concentrations of 5â10 mm with a bath type sonicator for 30 min at room temperature. At the indicated time points, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and resuspended in HBSS containing 1% fetal calf serum. Next 100 ng/ml propidium iodine was added, and the number of viable and dead cells was analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software. To determine apoptotic events, cells were first resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V. After 15 min of incubation, 100 ng/ml propidium iodine was added, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as above. SMS1 and SMS2 Are Co-expressed in Various Cell TypesâNorthern blot analysis previously showed that SMS1 and SMS2 are expressed in all major human tissues (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may anticipate that most cell types contain both SM synthase isoforms. To verify this, we analyzed various mammalian cell lines for SMS1 and SMS2 expression using reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, human colon carcinoma CaCo2 cells, mouse melanoma MEB4 cells, and mouse fibroblast MF cells. As shown in Fig. 1, reverse transcription-PCR revealed the presence of both SMS1 and SMS2 transcripts in all five cell lines analyzed. These results indicate that SMS1 and SMS2 are encoded by ubiquitously expressed genes. Characterization of SMS1- and SMS2-overexpressing HeLa CellsâSMS1 and SMS2 reside in organelles where SM synthesis is known to occur, namely in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, whether SMS1 and SMS2 are responsible for SM synthesis at these locations is not known. This led us to analyze the impact of SMS1 and SMS2 overexpression and depletion on Golgi- and plasma membrane-associated SM synthase activities. To this end, HeLa cells were stably transfected with V5 epitope-tagged SMS1 or SMS2 constructs. Consistent with our previous work (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), SMS1-V5 localized exclusively to the perinuclear region where it displayed extensive co-localization with Golgi marker GM130 (supplemental Fig. 1). SMS2-V5, on the other hand, primarily localized to the plasma membrane. A small portion of the protein was also found in the perinuclear region where it co-localized with GM130. In line with the immunofluorescence microscopy data, subcellular fractionation on Percoll density gradients showed that SMS1-V5 co-migrated with the Golgi-resident GlcCer transferase activity and segregated from the bulk of Na+/K+-ATPase, a marker of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the fractionation profile of SMS2-V5 matched that of Na+/K+-ATPase and was distinct from the fractionation profile of GlcCer transferase (Fig. 2B). The SM synthase activity in SMS1-V5-expressing cells was 2-fold higher than in untransfected cells (891 versus 427 pmol of C6-NBD-SM formed/mg of protein/h) and co-migrated with SMS1-V5 and GlcCer transferase (Fig. 2A). In SMS2-V5-expressing cells on the other hand, the SM synthase activity displayed a 4-fold increase relative to untransfected cells (1,662 versus 427 pmol of C6-NBD-SM formed/mg of protein/h) and co-fractionated with SMS2-V5 and Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 2B). Hence overexpression of SMS1 primarily increases the Golgi-associated SM synthase activity, whereas overexpression of SMS2 primarily increases the SM synthase activity at the plasma membrane. SMS1 Represents a Major whereas SMS2 Represents a Minor SM Synthase Activity in HeLa CellsâTo address whether SMS1 and SMS2 are responsible for the endogenous Golgi- and plasma membrane-associated SM synthase activities in HeLa cells, their expression was blocked using siRNAs. NS siRNA and siRNA directed against the nuclear matrix protein LA served as controls. Several different SMS1- and SMS2-directed siRNAs were initially tested on SMS1-V5- and SMS2-V5-expressing HeLa cells. This yielded one SMS1 siRNA and three different SMS2 siRNAs that each gave a strong (80â90%) and specific reduction in expression of the corresponding SMS protein after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 3A and data not shown). To verify that these siRNAs were also effective in down-regulating expression of endogenous SMS proteins, we raised a polyclonal antibody against an 18-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human SMS2. This antibody cross-reacted with human SMS2 expressed in yeast (Fig. 3B) and primarily recognized a 38-kDa protein in HeLa membrane extracts (Fig. 3C). The latter protein represents endogenous SMS2 because its expression in HeLa cells was drastically (â¼80%) reduced after treatment with SMS2 siRNA but unaffected after treatment with LA or SMS1 siRNAs (Fig. 3C). To determine the individual contributions of SMS1 and SMS2 to the total cellular SM synthase activity, HeLa cells were treated for 3 or 7 days with LA, SMS1, or SMS2 siRNAs; lysed; and then incubated with C6-NBD-ceramide in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of mammalian SMases that does not interfere with SM synthase activity (15Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Formation of C6-NBD-SM was monitored by TLC and then normalized for total amount of protein. As shown in Fig. 4A, cells treated for 3 days with SMS1 siRNA showed a major (â¼60%) reduction in SM synthase activity compared with LA siRNA-treated cells. Moreover these cells proved to be virtually devoid of the SM synthase activity peak that normally co-migrates with the GlcCer transferase peak on a Percoll density gradient (Fig. 4B). When the siRNA treatment was prolonged to 7 days, the SM synthase activity in SMS1-depleted cells dropped even further, namely to â¼20% of that in LA-depleted cells (â¼80% reduction; Fig. 4A). SMS2-depleted cells, on the other hand, displayed a less pronounced reduction in SM synthase activity (â¼40% reduction after 7 days of siRNA treatment; Fig. 4A) and, unlike SMS1-depleted cells, still contained the bulk of SM synthase activity that co-migrates with GlcCer transferase when fractionated on a Percoll density gradient (Fig. 4B). When cells were treated simultaneously with SMS1 and SMS2 siRNAs for 7 days, the SM synthase activity was reduced to nearly 10% of that in LA-depleted cells (â¼90% reduction; Fig. 4A). These results indicate that SMS1 and SMS2 together make up the bulk of SM synthase activity in HeLa cells with SMS1 acting as a major SM synthase activity and SMS2 acting as a minor one. SMS1 Depletion Abolishes C6-NBD-ceramide Staining of the Golgi ComplexâThe fluorescent ceramide analogue C6-NBD-ceramide stains the Golgi complex (30Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and has been applied to study the dynamics of this organelle in living cells (31Cooper M.S. Cornell-Bell A.H. Chernjavsky A. Dani J.W. Smith S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 135-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which C6-NBD-ceramide accumulates in the Golgi is unclear. Fluorescence microscopy of live yeast incubated with C6-NBD-ceramide revealed bright cytoplasmic patches similar in appearance to the Golgi (32Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly this staining was absent in cells treated with aureobasidin A, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for inositol phosphorylceramide synthesis in the Golgi lumen. We reasoned that, analogous to the situation in yeast, C6-NBD-ceramide staining of the Golgi in mammalian cells might require an active SM synthase in the Golgi. To investigate this possibility, HeLa cells were treated with LA, SMS1, or SMS2 siRNA for 3 days and then stained with C6-NBD-ceramide as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Cells depleted of LA or SMS2 showed a bright perinuclear staining reminiscent of the Golgi complex (Fig. 5). However, this perinuclear staining was strongly reduced in a substantial portion (up to 50%) of SMS1-depleted cells. Instead these cells primarily showed a faint staining of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. To investigate the possibility that the absence of perinuclear staining in SMS1-depleted cells was due to collapse of the Golgi complex, we next used HeLa cells stably expressing a red fluorescent protein-tagged version of the Golgi-resident enzyme Î±-mannosidase II. As shown in Fig. 6, the perinuclear C6-NBD-ceramide staining in LA- or SMS2-depleted cells co-localized with red fluorescent protein-tagged Î±-mannosidase II. In contrast, although SMS1-depleted cells contained red fluorescent protein-labeled perinuclear structures reminiscent of the Golgi complex, these structures were devoid of C6-NBD-ceramide staining. These findings suggest that C6-NBD-ceramide labeling of the Golgi requires ongoing SM synthesis i"

We investigated the impact of activin signaling on human osteoblast differentiation, extracellular matrix formation, and mineralization. Activins belong to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily and activin A treatment strongly inhibited mineralization in osteoblast cultures, whereas the activin antagonist follistatin increased mineralization. Osteoblasts produced activin A and follistatin in a differentiation-dependent manner, leading to autocrine regulation of extracellular matrix formation and mineralization. In addition, mineralization in a vascular smooth muscle cell-based model for pathological calcification was inhibited. Comparative activin A and follistatin gene expression profiling showed that activin signaling changes the expression of a specific range of extracellular matrix proteins prior to the onset of mineralization, leading to a matrix composition with reduced or no mineralizing capacity. These findings demonstrate the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization by the activin A-follistatin system, providing the possibility to control bone quality as well as pathological calcifications such as atherosclerosis by using activin A, follistatin, or analogs thereof."

https://openalex.org/W2000906636,"Human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene polymorphism at Exon 7 (Glu298Asp) has been linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction, but the mechanisms are not defined. Shear is a key modulator of NOS3 function in vivo and association with caveolae is important for the control of NOS3 protein activity. Here we tested the hypothesis that altered enrichment of NOS3 in the caveolar membrane defines Glu298Asp genotype-specific responses and NOS3 activity. Basal caveolar membrane enrichment was carried out to quantitate the NOS3 enrichment in caveolae. Cells were subjected to shear and NOS3 protein levels, phosphorylation, enzyme function were investigated. Variant genotypes had lower NOx production pre- and post-shear, but no genotype-dependent alterations in pNOS3 were observed. Asp variants had significantly lower NOS3 enrichment in the caveolar membrane fraction. Further, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Asp variants had substantially less NOS3/Cav-1 association (approximately 40%) during static conditions. Furthermore, acute shear causes impaired NOS3/Cav-1 dissociation in Asp variants. The results from immunoprecipitation studies were in complete agreement with caveolar membrane preparation findings. Collectively, these data demonstrate functional consequences of the Glu298Asp NOS3 variation and further define disruption of NOS3 caveolar localization and shear-induced mobilization as the primary mechanism responsible for these differences."

https://openalex.org/W2044229269,"The rate-limiting step in the transit of absorbed dietary fat across the enterocyte is the generation of the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This vesicle does not require coatomer-II (COPII) proteins for budding from the ER membrane and contains vesicle-associated membrane protein 7, found in intestinal ER, which is a unique intracellular location for this SNARE protein. We wished to identify the protein(s) responsible for budding this vesicle from ER membranes in the absence of the requirement for COPII proteins. We chromatographed rat intestinal cytosol on Sephacryl S-100 and found that PCTV budding activity appeared in the low molecular weight fractions. Additional chromatographic steps produced a single major and several minor bands on SDS-PAGE. By tandem mass spectroscopy, the bands contained both liver and intestinal fatty acid-binding proteins (L- and I-FABP) as well as four other proteins. Recombinant proteins for each of the six proteins identified were tested for PCTV budding activity; only L-FABP and I-FABP (23% the activity of L-FABP) were active. The vesicles generated by L-FABP were sealed, contained apolipoproteins B48 and AIV, were of the same size as PCTV on Sepharose CL-6B, and by electron microscopy, excluded calnexin and calreticulin but did not fuse with cis-Golgi nor did L-FABP generate COPII-dependent vesicles.

These FA and the remaining sn-2-monoacylglycerol are absorbed across the enterocyte apical plasma membrane. Absorption of the FA is thought to occur, at least in part, via specific membrane proteins. FATP4, which is highly expressed at the apical surface of the enterocyte, was shown to increase FA uptake following overexpression, and antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of FATP4 expression reduced FA uptake (1Stall A.

FABPpm, which was first identified in jejunal microvillus membranes, may also be involved in FA uptake, as anti-FABPpm antibodies have been found to inhibit uptake (2Stremmel W. J. Clin.

Once inside the intestinal absorptive cell, the FA are largely bound to intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP), and the majority are rapidly converted into TAG (10Mansbach II, C.M. Dowell R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 605-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for subsequent export from the cell as the major component of intestinal lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins. The absorptive enterocyte contains high levels of two members of the FABP family, the so-called liver FABP (L-FABP) (11Gordon J.I. Elshourbagy N. Lowe J.B. Liao W.S. Alpers D.H. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Both FABPs can transfer long chain FA to phospholipid membranes; however, they appear to utilize distinct mechanisms, I-FABP via collisional interactions with membranes, and L-FABP by aqueous diffusion (18Hsu K.-T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A role for L-FABP in FA transport has been further suggested by fluorescence photobleaching studies, which indicated that the rate of FA movement within the cell was directly proportional to the level of FABP (19Luxon B.A. Milliano M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G361-G366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Weisiger R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phenotype of L-FABP gene-disrupted mice was found to be minimally deviant from wild type controls on a chow diet (4% fat); however, fasting resulted in a reduced ability to generate TAG in the liver from the increased FA present in the plasma under fasting conditions, as well as a decreased rate of hepatic fatty acid oxidation (21Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Han X. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51664-51672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The decrease in liver FA oxidation was shown not to be due to a reduced oxidative capacity (22Martin G.G. Danneberg H. Kumar L.S. Atshaves B.P. Erol E. Bader M. Schroeder F. Binas B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21429-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), further suggesting an involvement of L-FABP in intracellular FA transport. In addition to a potential role in intracellular FA trafficking, L-FABP has been suggested to play a role in cell division (23Keler T. Sorof S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), to serve as a cytosolic reservoir for high levels of unesterified FA (18Hsu K.-T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and to interact with nuclear hormone receptors, perhaps delivering specific ligands (24Schachtrup C. Emmler T. Bleck B. Sandqvist A. Spener F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Finally, and of particular relevance to the present studies, it has been reported recently that mice null for L-FABP exhibit impaired intestinal TAG secretion (25Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S.M. Davidson N.O. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ER exit step is the rate-limiting step in the transit of TAG across the intestinal absorptive cell, from its ER synthetic site to its secretion across the basolateral membrane (26Mansbach II, C.M. Nevin P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zilversmit D.B. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1599-1605PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, in previous work we focused our attention on the mechanism by which pre-chylomicrons exit the ER membrane and fuse with the cis-Golgi, a process that is mediated by a sealed vesicle, the pre-chylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV) (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast to vesicles that transport proteins from ER to Golgi, we found that the coat protein complex-II (COPII) proteins were not necessary for budding of PCTV from the ER but were required for eventual fusion of the formed vesicle with the cis-Golgi (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This study describes our efforts at identifying the protein(s) that are responsible for budding PCTV. By analogy to the COPII protein complex, we expected that separation of cytosol by size exclusion chromatography would result in the identification of a large molecular weight complex. However, we found that the activity was in the portion of the eluate that contains low molecular weight proteins. As detailed in this study, we have identified L-FABP as a protein required for budding of PCTV.

Recombinant ProteinsârI- and rL-FABP were generated in Escherichia coli without tags and were isolated and delipidated using biochemical techniques (31Storch J. Bass N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7827-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Isolation of ER, Cytosol, Golgi, and Metabolic Labeling of EnterocytesâEnterocytes from the proximal half of rat small intestine were isolated and radiolabeled with [3H]TAG essentially as described (32Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, enterocytes were stripped from intestinal villi, collected, incubated with albumin-bound [3H]oleate or [14C]oleate (as indicated) for 30 min at 35 Â°C, and washed with albumin to remove excess [3H]- or [14C]oleate. To label newly synthesized proteins, [3H]leucine was included in the incubation medium in the absence of [3H]oleate (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized, and the ER was isolated using a sucrose step gradient that was repeated to purify the ER. The [3H]- or [14C]TAG-loaded ER preparation contained no Golgi, endosomes, or lysosomes (30Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II., C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). cis-Golgi was isolated from nonradiolabeled rat enterocytes (32Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar) as was cytosol (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cis-Golgi preparation contained GOS28 but not calnexin nor RAB11, indicating no significant ER or lysosomal contamination (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II., C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When lack of ATP activity was required, cytosol was dialyzed twice against buffer A (25 mm Hepes, 125 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.2); no ATP nor an ATP-regenerating system was added, and the cytosol was supplemented with ATPÎ³S (2.5 mm) and EDTA (2 mm). In Vitro PCTV FormationâPCTV containing [3H]TAG were formed from [3H]TAG-loaded intestinal ER (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brief, ER was incubated at 35 Â°C for 30 min with cytosol, an ATP-regenerating system, and Mg2+ in the absence of Golgi acceptor. As indicated, when recombinant proteins were utilized, no cytosol was included in the reaction. The incubation mixture was resolved on a continuous sucrose gradient, and PCTV was isolated from the light portions of the gradient (30Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II., C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PCTVs thus formed were concentrated to 5.0 mg/ml protein using a Centricon-10 filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). In Vitro PCTV Fusion with the GolgiâWhen PCTV fusion with the cis-Golgi was sought, 3H-protein and [14C]TAG-loaded PCTV (150 Î¼g of protein) (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), cis-Golgi membranes (300 Î¼g of protein), and native cytosol (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 35 Â°C with an ATP-regenerating system, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm DTT with a total volume of 500 Î¼l (30Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II., C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cis-Golgi were separated from unreacted PCTV by a sucrose step gradient, and the Golgi TAG radioactivity was determined. Isolation of the PCTV-generating Active Fraction from CytosolâPreliminary studies showed that the active fraction was cytosolic (data not shown). Purification of the active fraction commenced with rat intestinal cytosol, 80 mg of protein (32Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar), which was dialyzed overnight against buffer A at 4 Â°C. The cytosol was concentrated 5-fold on an Amicon filter (YM-10 membrane) (Amicon, Beverly. MA) and further concentrated on a Centricon filter (10-kDa cutoff) to 20 mg/ml protein. The concentrated cytosol was passed over a heparin-agarose column (Sigma), previously equilibrated with 20 mm NaHPO4, 2 mm MgCl2+, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors at pH 7.2. The active fraction (data not shown) was eluted with the equilibration buffer, concentrated to 5 mg of protein/ml (Amicon YM-10 membrane), dialyzed against BisTris buffer, 10 mm, pH 6.9, plus protease inhibitors, and loaded onto an anion exchange column (5-ml Econo column; Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with the equilibration buffer to which 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 m NaCl in BisTris buffer were sequentially added. Each fraction was collected and evaluated for budding activity. The flow-through had the maximum activity. It was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4 with protease inhibitors), loaded onto a pre-packed Sephacryl S-100 column (total volume 320 ml, 26 Ã 60 cm (Pfizer, New York)), and eluted with buffer B. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and checked for activity (Fig. 1B). The active fractions were pooled, concentrated on an YM-10 membrane to 5 mg/ml, dialyzed against buffer C (0.5 mm DTT, Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors), and loaded onto an anion exchange column (5 ml) (Econo-pac; Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with buffer C and buffer C to which 0.1 m NaCl was added. The flow-through and 0.1 m NaCl eluates were collected, and budding activity was determined. The flow-through had 25â30 times the budding activity of native cytosol (data not shown). The active fraction was concentrated on an Amicon YM-10 membrane to 5 mg/ml protein. It had one major and several minor bands on SDS-PAGE (silver stain). The components of the active fraction were analyzed by tandem mass spectroscopy. 90% of the proteins were identified as L-FABP. Mass SpectroscopyâPrior to mass spectroscopy analysis, the active fraction was separated into five fractions using reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography on a C-4 column (Thermo Separation Products, Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) to reduce the complexity of the protein sample and remove salts and buffers. The fractions were freeze-lyophilized, resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and digested with trypsin for 14 h at 37 Â°C. The tryptic peptides were desalted by C-18 ZipTip (Millipore) using the manufacturer's protocol. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed by injecting the tryptic fragments onto a capillary C-18 LC column (our manufacture, New Objective Pico Frit column, 360-Î¼m outer diameter, 75-Î¼m inner diameter, 15-Î¼m tip, 10.4-cm length, and Magic C18AQ packing material, 5-Î¼m beads, 200-Î¼m pores) on line with a Finnigan LCQDECA (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) ion trap mass analyzer equipped with a nano-ESI source. The tryptic peptides were fractionated using 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A and 90% methanol as solvent B. The sequence-specific data obtained were used in the SEQUEST search engine against a nonredundant data base (NCBInr) to identify proteins. Collection of [3H]Chylomicrons and VLDLâChylomicrons were obtained from rats infused intraduodenally with [3H]glyceryltrioleate (10Mansbach II, C.M. Dowell R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 605-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, chow fed rats were provided with a duodenal cannula and a mesenteric lymph duct fistula, placed in a restraining cage, and infused overnight with a glucose/saline solution. The next day, the rats were infused with [3H]glyceryltrioleate (2, 22.5, or 135 Î¼mol/h as indicated) through the duodenal cannula. Hourly collections of the lymph were made on ice and chylomicrons from 4 to 6 h of infusion (steady state chylomicron output) collected by centrifugation through saline (33Mansbach II, C.M. Arnold A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G263-G269PubMed Google Scholar). The chylomicrons were combined and used for column chromatography. VLDL were isolated by serial centrifugations (34Dole V.P. Hamlin III, J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1962; 42: 674-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Chromatography of Chylomicrons, VLDL, and PCTVâChylomicrons, VLDL, and PCTV were chromatographed at 4 Â°C on a Sepharose CL-6B column (1 Ã 40 cm) using phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, as eluent. SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblotsâProteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, were transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After incubation with specific primary and then secondary antibodies, labeled proteins were detected by using ECL reagents and exposing the developed blots to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Measurement of TAG RadioactivityâTAG radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation (32Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar), and mass was quantitated chemically after specific TAG extraction using organic solvents (35Coleman R. Bell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4537-4543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical AnalysisâComparisons between means were carried out using a statistical package supplied by GraphPad Software (Instat, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego) using a two-tailed t test. In considering potential proteins associated with PCTV budding activity from intestinal ER, we first identified as a paradigm the COPII protein complex (â576 kDa), which is required for protein vesicle budding. In line with this postulate, we thought that passage of intestinal cytosol over a sizing column would most efficiently lead to identification of the expected protein complex. However, when 30 mg of native cytosol protein was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-100 column, the results showed that most of the PCTV-generating activity appeared just before the elution of cytochrome c (â12 kDa) (Fig. 1A), contrary to our expectations, indicating that either a small molecular weight protein or a complex of very small proteins provided PCTV budding activity. To improve the resolution of the column and to verify the results obtained in Fig. 1A, we passed native cytosol over a heparin affinity column and next over a DEAE column eluted with buffer, pH 6.9, with all the activity being found in the flow-through of both columns (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the post-DEAE column flow-through chromatographed on an S-100 sizing column. As indicated, budding activity was again found to emerge from the column just before cytochrome c. Control experiments showed that no significant budding occurred at 4 Â°C, in the absence of ATP, or in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 1C). The active fractions from the S-100 column were concentrated and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. A silver stain of the transblotted proteins showed one major band at 14 kDa and several minor bands (data not shown). Because a large (â8%) component of native intestinal cytosol is composed of I- and L-FABP (â14 kDa) and the active fraction contained predominantly a small molecular weight protein, we immunoblotted the active fraction for both I- and L-FABP using monospecific antibodies. Both L- and I-FABP were immuno-identified in approximately equal amounts (data not shown). However, when the concentrated active fractions from the S-100 column were passed over a DEAE column and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, the activity appeared in the flow-through which, on immunoblot, identified L-FABP but not I-FABP and on silver stain contained a major band at â14 kDa and several minor bands of slightly larger molecular weight (data not shown). Tandem mass spectroscopy was performed on the active DEAE, pH 8, flow-through fraction, to identify the protein(s) in the active fraction potentially accounting for the budding activity. The identified proteins were as follows: L- and I-FABP, acyl-CoA-binding protein, glutathione S-transferase, profilin A, and cyclophilin A. Recombinant proteins for each identified protein were obtained and used in an assay that measures the ability of proteins to generate PCTV or other TAG-containing structures from intestinal ER in the absence of acceptor cis-Golgi (28Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Of all six proteins tested, L-FABP had the greatest activity, I-FABP had 23% the activity of L-FABP, and the rest had negligible activity (Fig. 2). The amount of budding activity displayed by 40 Î¼g of rL-FABP approximated that of 1 mg of native cytosol protein (Fig. 2). This level of L-FABP is comparable with that expected in 1 mg of rat intestinal cytosolic protein (14Bass N.A. Manning J.A. Ockner R.K. Gordon J.I. Seetharam S. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1432-1436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the relationship between intestinal ER budding activity and L-FABP, increasing amounts of L-FABP were incubated with [3H]TAG-loaded intestinal ER. The amount of budding activity was proportional to the amount of L-FABP added up to 150 Î¼g of L-FABP after which activity did not increase (Fig. 3A). To confirm that these [3H]TAG data in response to L-FABP represented a true increase in chylomicron output as the amount of L-FABP was increased, immunoblots for apoB48 were performed on PCTV generated from each amount of L-FABP added (Fig. 3B). The apoB48 signal increased as the L-FABP increased up to 150 Î¼g and then plateaued in parallel with the [3H]TAG data shown in Fig. 3A. The finding that activity reaches a max"

The expression of PGR-2 is up-regulated in the late phase of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and predominantly distributed in adipose tissue. Overexpression of PGR-2 in cells decreases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³)-dependent transcription and prohibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation without affecting expression of PPARÎ³. Interestingly, we found that 15-keto-PGE2 can act as a ligand of PPARÎ³ to increase co-activator recruitment, thus activating PPARÎ³-mediated transcription and enhancing adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation reaction of PGE2 to form 15-keto-PGE2, significantly increased PPARÎ³-mediated transcription in a PGE2-dependent manner. Reciprocally, overexpression of wild-type PGR-2, but not the catalytically defective mutant, abolished the effect of 15-keto-PGE2 on PPARÎ³ activation. These results demonstrate a novel link between catabolism of PGE2 and regulation of ligand-induced PPARÎ³ activation.

The production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is elevated in many syndromes of inflammation (13Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 18Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether the catabolism of PGE2 is associated with modulation of PPARÎ³ activity (19Harris S.G. Padilla J. Koumas L. Ray D. Phipps R.P. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 144-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). PGE2, a short-lived mediator, is inactivated via an oxidation reaction catalyzed by NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), which generates 15-keto-PGE2, which is, in turn, further catabolized by a reaction catalyzed by NADPH/NADH-dependent 15-oxoprostaglandin-Î13-reductase (PGR) (20Tai H.H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68 (â69): 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It has been shown that adipose tissue possesses high activity of both PGDH and PGR, indicating that PGE2 catabolism is highly active in adipocytes (21Anggard E. Larsson C. Samuelsson B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1971; 81: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line has been used as a model for characterizing the events responsible for adipocyte differentiation (22Rosen O.M. Smith C.J. Hirsch A. Lai E. Rubin C.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1979; 35: 477-499PubMed Google Scholar), and PGE2 is the most abundant prostaglandin produced in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts through the release of arachidonic acid from endogenous phospholipids stores or upon addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (23Hyman B.T. Stoll L.L. Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the levels of PGE2 decreased upon stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, PGE2 is a major prostaglandin produced in adipocytes (23Hyman B.T. Stoll L.L. Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Bell-Parikh L.C. Ide T. Lawson J.A. McNamara P. Reilly M. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In this report, we used a differential display to identify a novel gene encoding prostaglandin reductase, designated as PGR-2. It is highly expressed in the late phase of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and is also abundant in adipose tissues. PGR-2 is capable of catabolizing 15-keto-PGE2, and its overexpression represses the transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³. Following these observations, we further established that 15-keto-PGE2, an intermediate metabolite within the PGE2 catabolic pathway, can function as a PPARÎ³ ligand, stimulating mouse fibroblasts differentiation into adipocytes. Correspondingly, overexpression of PGDH also increased PGE2-dependent activation of PPARÎ³. Our findings provide new insights into the potential importance of PGE2 catabolism in the regulation of PPARÎ³ activity. MaterialsâChemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.

Cell Cultureâ3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; high glucose) plus 10% calf serum. Two days after confluence, differentiation was induced by the addition of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 172 nm insulin, 1 Î¼m dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine for 2 days. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.4 Î¼m insulin for an additional 2 days of incubation followed by switching to DMEM plus 10% FBS for full differentiation in 2â3 days. The degree of differentiation was monitored by using Oil-Red O staining and triglyceride (TG) assay (GPO-Trinder; Sigma). 293T cells were cultured in DMEM in the presence of 10% FBS. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain ReactionâTotal RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells at various times throughout differentiation and was reverse transcribed with Supertranscript II (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR amplification was performed for PGR-2 (sense primer, 5â²-TAA GTC AGA TGA ATG AGA ACA G-3â²; antisense primer, 5â²-AAC CAC TGA CTC AGC TGT AG-3â²) and 36B4 (sense primer, 5â²-CAT GAT GCG CAA GGC TAT CAG-3â²; antisense primer, 5â²-GAA GGT GTA CTC AGT CTC CA-3â²). Cloning of Mouse PGR-2 cDNAâMouse PGR-2 was cloned from cDNA of 3T3-L1 adipocyte using PCR amplification (sense primer, 5â²-CGG TAT AGC TTG GGA CGC TA-3â²; antisense primer, 5â²-TGC ATG TTA AGA ATC TTT GTG G-3â²) and ligated into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) to generate the pTE-PGR-2 construct. The coding region of PGR-2 was then subcloned to the pCMV-Tag2B expression vector (Stratagene). A PCR reaction was carried out for the construction of pFLAG-PGR-2 using pTE-PGR-2 as a template and two primers (forward primer, 5â²-AAC TGA AGC TTC AAG TGA TGA TCA TA-3â², where the start codon is underlined; and reverse primer, 5â²-AGC TCT CCC ATA TGG TCG ACC T-3â²) to generate a HindIII-SalI DNA fragment of PGR-2. This DNA fragment was cloned into the HindIII-SalI sites of pCMV-Tag2B, yielding pFLAG-PGR-2. The HindIII-XhoI fragment of the pFLAG-PGR-2 was inserted into the SmaI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to yield the pGEX-PGR-2 construct, which was used for the generation of the GST-PGR-2 fusion protein. The HindIII-SalI fragment of the pFLAG-PGR-2 was inserted into the EcoRV-SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences-Clontech) to create the pEGFP-PGR-2 construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-PGR-2, pFLAG-PGR-2, and pEGFP-PGR-2 was performed to generate the PGR-2/Y259F catalytically defective mutant using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primers (mutated sites are underlined): forward primer, 5â²-GGT CAG ATT TCT CAG TTC AGT AAC GAT GTG CCC-3â²; reverse primer, 5â²-GGG CAC ATC GTT ACT GAA CTG AGA AAT CTG ACC-3â². Cloning of Mouse PGDH cDNAâNAD+-dependent PGDH was cloned from the cDNA of mouse kidney using PCR amplification (sense primer, 5â²-AGT CGG ATC CAT GCA CGT GAA CG-3â², where the start codon is underlined; antisense primer, 5â²-CAG TCT CGA GTT ATG GAG CTT TTA C-3â²) to generate a BamHI-XhoI DNA fragment of PGDH. This DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pCMV-Tag2B to yield the pFLAG-PGDH construct. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PGR-2âAn Escherichia coli strain XL1-blue was transformed with the plasmid pGEX-PGR-2 to generate the recombinant protein of PGR-2 for the enzyme assay, and the recombinant protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactoside at 25 Â°C overnight. GST-PGR-2 recombinant protein was purified with a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Enzymatic Assay for PGR-2âPGR-2 activity assay was carried out in a mixture containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm NADPH, and the substrate 15-keto-PGE1, 15-keto-PGE2, 15-keto-PGF1Î±, or 15-keto-PGF2Î± in a total volume of 100 Î¼l. The reaction was started by adding 5 Î¼g of purified GST-PGR-2 protein and incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min. NADPH remaining after the reaction was oxidized by adding 200 Î¼l of color reagent (790 Î¼m indonitrotetrazolium chloride, 60 Î¼m phenazene methosulfate, and 1% Tween 20) at 37 Â°C in the dark for 10 min followed by adding 700 Î¼l of phthalate buffer (pH 3.0) to stop the reaction. The colorimetric reaction is based on the fact that indonitrotetrazolium can react with NADPH in the presence of phenazene methosulfate to produce formazans (25Shivanandappa T. Venkatesh S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The absorbance of formazans was measured at 490 nm with a spectrophotometer. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 Î¼mol NADP+/min. The apparent Km and Vmax values were based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics and calculated by Eadie-Hofstee regression using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0). All values presented are the means of three or more measurements. Prostaglandin ExtractionâSamples after in vitro PGR-2 enzyme reaction were acidified to pH 4.0 by 0.5 m citric acid and extracted on C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges (Cayman Chemical). After the cartridges were washed with water and hexane, prostaglandins were eluted with ethyl acetate containing 1% methanol. The 293T cells expressing PGDH and PGR-2 were incubated in 10 Î¼m PGE2 and 10 Î¼m [2H4]PGE2 for 18 h to extract intracellular PGE2 metabolites. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in homogenization buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 Î¼m indomethacin), and then freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen. After pH adjustment to pH 4.0 and protein precipitation, the supernatants were loaded onto the C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges for prostaglandin elution. Prostaglandin AnalysisâThe in vitro PGR-2 reaction products were analyzed by nano-ESI-MS and MS/MS. The analytes were directed to the homemade nanosprayer applied with â3.5 kV on the QSTAR-XL hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). All of the data were acquired and processed using AnalystQS 1.1 with Bioanalyst 1.1 extension. The instrument was calibrated using the fragment ions that resulted from the collision-induced dissociation of Glu-fibrinopeptide B. Full scan mass spectra (MS) were recorded in the negative ion mode in the range of m/z 100â500. Product ion mass spectra (MS/MS) were obtained for m/z 351 (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2) and m/z 349 (15-keto-PGE2) for further identification of the analytes. Samples were dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 200 Î¼lof 20% acetonitrile, and filtered before analysis for characterization of intracellular PGE2 metabolites. The instrument used was a Thermo-Finnigan Quantum Ultra AM tandem quadrupole interfaced to a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system. A 150 mm Ã 2mm Ã 3 Î¼m Luna C18 (2Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) 100A HPLC column (Phenomenex) was maintained at 40 Â°C. The mobile phase was generated from HPLC-grade water (A) and 5% methanol/95% acetonitrile (B), each containing 0.005% acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide. The flow rate was 200 Î¼l/min using a gradient starting at 20% B and ramping to 60% B in 20 min. Transitions monitored were: [2H4]-PGE2, m/z 355 â 275 at a collision energy (CE) of 18 eV; PGE2, m/z 351 â 271, CE 18 eV; [2H4]-15-keto-PGE2, m/z 353 â 165, CE 20 eV; 15-keto-PGE2, m/z 349 â 161, CE 20 eV; [2H4]-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, m/z 355 â 223, CE 18 eV; 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, m/z 351 â 219, CE 18 eV. The collision gas was argon, 1.5 millitorr. Source collision-induced dissociation was 12 eV. All compounds were conclusively identified by comparison with synthetic standards (Cayman Chemical). Transfection and Reporter AssaysâOne day before transfection, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were plated at 70â80% confluence, and 293T cells were plated at 30% confluence. After overnight growth at 37 Â°C, cells were incubated with transfection mixture containing plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine at a 1:6 ratio (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested for determination of luciferase and Î²-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was repeated three or more times. Transient Transfection in 3T3-L1 PreadipocytesâEnforced expression of GFP-PGR-2 was performed in post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-PGR-2, and pEGFP-PGR-2/Y259F construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 5 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then washed gently and treated with the standard induction medium for adipocyte differentiation. Ligand Binding AssaysâLigand binding assays were performed with GST-mPPARÎ³2 fusion protein, which was expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The protein-bound Sepharose beads were used directly in a binding reaction with 100 nm [3H]BRL49653 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Competitors or solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) were added as indicated. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 Â°C, the PPARÎ³-Sepharose beads were washed with 10 volumes of ice-cold binding buffer and pulled by centrifugation. The amount of [3H]BRL49653 bound to the beads was measured with a scintillation counter. Each experiment was repeated three or more times. Coactivator Recruitment by in Vitro GST Pulldown AssayâGST and GST-SRC1 were expressed in E. coli. and purified on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. The purified His-tagged hPPARÎ³-LBD was preincubated with ligands for 30 min on ice and then mixed with immobilized GST or GST-SRC1 in the pulldown buffer (1Ã phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The reactions were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C after which beads were washed three times in pulldown buffer and boiled in 2Ã sample buffer. Proteins bound to beads were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE. Blots were then developed with antibodies against PPARÎ³ or GST. Statistical AnalysesâResults are expressed as the means Â± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test for comparison of each effect versus control. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Identification of PGR-2 by Differential Display during 3T3-L1 Adipocyte DifferentiationâThe genes differentially expressed in 3T3-L1 cells at day 10 after the induction of adipocyte differentiation were screened using differential display. Among those genes up-regulated, one gene shares 100% identity to NM_029880 as well as AK021033 or AK020666 in the GenBankâ¢. Further blast search of the data base revealed that gene corresponding to NM_029880 encodes a protein sharing a 40% amino acid sequence identity with two paralogous sequences, human NM_012212 and mouse NM_025968, both of which encode the bifunctional leukotriene B4-12-hydroxydehydrogenase/15-oxoprostaglandin-Î13-reductase (LTB4DH/PGR or PGR-1) (26Yokomizo T.

Expression of PGR-2 was increased during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells at both the mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein levels, with a time lag of â¼1 day following the expression of PPARÎ³ (Fig. 2B). Among the mouse tissues examined, adipose tissue showed the highest expression of PGR-2 mRNA (Fig. 2C). This expression pattern was distinct from that of PGR-1, which is most highly expressed in liver and kidney (26Yokomizo T. Ogawa Y. Uozumi N. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2844-2850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Functional Characterization of PGR-2 as a 15-Oxoprostaglandin-Î13-reductaseâTo analyze the biochemical function of PGR-2, we cloned and sequenced PGR-2 cDNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). We expressed and purified the recombinant mouse PGR-2 as a GST fusion protein from the E. coli system to perform an enzymatic assay (Fig. 3A). Based on the presence of a conserved domain of putative NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductase in its amino acid sequence, we measured its prostaglandin reductase activity using different prostaglandins as the substrate. Toward this end, we developed a colorimetric assay by measuring formazan formation from the reduction of the tetrazolium salt in detecting the prostaglandin reductase activity (See âExperimental Proceduresâ). The results of enzymatic analysis showed that 15-keto-PGE2, 15-keto-PGE1, 15-keto-PGF2Î±, and 15-keto-PGF1Î± were promising substrates, whereas 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandins were not. Neither dehydrogenase activity nor LTB4DH activity was associated with PGR-2 (Table 1). Kinetic studies revealed that PGR-2, requiring NADPH but not NADH as a cofactor, had the highest efficiency in converting 15-keto-PGE2 into 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 (Kcat/Km = 229.8 mmâ1 minâ1 compared with 222.9 mmâ1 minâ1 for 15-keto-PGF1Î±, 215.1 mmâ1 minâ1 for 15-keto-PGE, and 136.0 mmâ1 minâ11 for 15-keto-PGF2Î± (as summarized in Table 2)). The reaction product obtained from the incubation of 15-keto-PGE2 and NADPH with purified PGR-2 was further analyzed by ESI-MS/MS to verify 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 formation in the reaction (Fig. 3C). The molecular anion ([M â H]â = m/z 351) from the reaction product gave the same fragments in the MS/MS spectrum as standard 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, which yielded ions that were 2 proton mass units higher than corresponding ions in the 15-keto-PGE2 MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 3, B and C).TABLE 1Specific activities of PGR-2 on various compoundsSubstratesSpecific activityaND, non-detectable.nmol/minÂ·mg protein15-Keto-PGE2178.4 Â± 13.715-Keto-PGE1115.0 Â± 4.815-Keto-PGF2Î±230.9 Â± 5.715-Keto-PGF1Î±206.4 Â± 6.36-Keto-PGF1Î±NDPGF2Î²ND11Î²-PGF2Î±ND13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-PGD2ND13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-PGE2ND13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-PGF2Î±NDLeukotriene B4NDa ND, non-detectable.

Open table in a new tab We also analyzed the in vivo catabolites of PGE2 through the action of PGDH and PGR-2 in intact cells. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid (Tag2B) or expression vectors of PGDH and PGR-2 and treated with PGE2 (Fig. 4A). Deuterium-labeled PGE2 was included in the medium for in vivo uptake to assure the identity of lipid metabolites for mass spectrometric analysis. Intracellular lipid extracts were prepared from these cells for mass spectrometric analysis. We found that both 15-keto-PGE2 and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 could be detected in 293T cells expressing PGDH and PGR-2 (Fig. 4B). However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 was undetectable in cells transfected with the control vector (data not shown). The Role of PGR-2 Expression in AdipogenesisâBecause the expressed level of PGR-2 was not increased until 3T3-L1 cells had attained late stage differentiation to adipocytes, we then determined whether constitutive expression of PGR-2 would influence adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 cells were transiently transfected with a wild-type expression vector and a catalytically defective GFP-PGR-2, and differentiation was then induced. Based on structural prediction, the conserved Tyr-259 residue in PGR-2 (Fig. 1) might function as the Tyr-245 of PGR-1 that participates in the hydrogen bond network around the 2â²-hydroxyl group of the nicotine amide ribose, which interacts with two water molecules in stabilizing an enolate intermediate for the catalysis of 15-keto-PGE2 reduction (28Hori T. Yokomizo T. Ago H. Sugahara M. Ueno G. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Shimizu T. Miyano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22615-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Y259F mutant of PGR-2 was then generated and showed a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency in the reduction reaction of 15-keto-PGE2 (Fig. 5A). We found that ectopic expression of the wild type but not Y259F of GFP-PGR-2 dramatically inhibited adipocyte differentiation, as evaluated by the accumulation of lipid droplets with Oil-Red O staining (Fig. 5B), and decreased intracellular TG synthesis by 53% as compared with control cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ectopic expression of wild-type GFP-PGR-2, but not the Y259F mutant, significantly reduced the induction of the PPARÎ³ target gene, aP2, whereas the expression level of PPARÎ³ remained unaltered (Fig. 5D). These results clearly demonstrate that constitutive expression of functional PGR-2 impairs PPARÎ³-mediated adipocyte differentiation without affecting the protein expression level of PPARÎ³. 15-Keto-PGE2 Is a PPARÎ³ LigandâThe effect of overexpression of PGR-2 on the suppression of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5, BâD) and the induction pattern of PGR-2 expression (Fig. 2, A and B) indicates that catabolism of 15-keto-PGE2 by PGR-2 needs to be suppressed during the early phase of adipocyte differentiation. Because PGE2 is a major prostaglandin produced in preadipocytes (23Hyman B.T. Stoll L.L. Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2079119292,"Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are widely expressed in epithelial cells and mediate cell repulsive motility through heterotypic cell-cell interactions. Several Ephs, including EphA2, are greatly overexpressed in certain tumors, in correlation with poor prognosis and high vascularity in cancer tissues. The ability of several Eph receptors to regulate cell migration and invasion likely contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. We report here that in prostatic carcinoma cells ephrinA1 elicits a repulsive response that is executed through a Rho-dependent actino/myosin contractility activation, ultimately leading to retraction of the cell body. This appears to occur through assembly of an EphA2-associated complex involving the two kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). EphrinA1-mediated repulsion leads to the selective phosphorylation of Tyr-576/577 of FAK, enhancing FAK kinase activity. The repulsive response elicited by ephrinA1 in prostatic carcinoma cells is mainly driven by a Rho-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain II, in which Src and FAK activation are required steps. Consequently, Src and FAK are upstream regulators of the overall response induced by ephrinA1/EphA2, instructing cells to retract the cell body and to move away, probably facilitating dissemination and tissue invasion of ephrin-sensitive carcinomas.

Eph receptors are the largest subfamily of receptor-tyrosine kinases and are involved in many biological processes including angiogenesis, tissue-border formation, cell migration, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity. There are 16 known Eph receptors that are divided into EphA and EphB subfamilies according to sequence similarity and ligand binding specificity. The EphA subfamily binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ligands (ephrinA), whereas EphB receptors interact with ligands that have transmembrane domains (ephrinB) (1Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Once bound to their ligand, Ephs become phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues. This leads to activation of the catalytic activity of the receptor itself and the formation of docking sites for downstream molecules that regulate signaling. Ephrin/Eph interaction is mediated by cell-to-cell contact and propagates through bidirectional signaling. In general, Eph/ephrins transduce a repulsive motile response that requires removal of the receptor ligand complexes from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage or endocytosis after interaction and adhesion between ephrins and Eph receptors (2Halford M.M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). EphA2 is up-regulated in breast, liver, and prostate cancer, and strong correlation has been reported with poor prognosis (6Fox B.P. Kandpal R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, certain Ephs and their ligands are expressed and up-regulated at sites of active neovascularization, e.g. in endothelial cells during tumor invasion (10Gale N.W. Baluk P. Pan L. Kwan M.

Beside being involved in tumor aggressiveness and vascularization, ephrin-Eph interactions have recently been implicated in the coordination of cell migration during several physiological and pathophysiological processes, including development and tissue morphogenesis (12Murai K.K.

Critical elements of integrin signaling are Src-tyrosine kinase and focal adhesion kinase (FAK); these are two non-receptor-tyrosine kinases regulating focal contact turnover and are both required for efficient cell movement. Recently, Knoll and Drescher (16Knoll B. Drescher U. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6248-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have provided evidence of the involvement of Src in EphA-mediated growth cone formation. A role of FAK has been proposed in Eph/ephrin signaling during cell adhesion to ECM and the formation of dendritic spines, although contradictory, results exist over ephrin-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of FAK (17Carter N.

Reorganization of cell morphology during adhesion and detachment involves changes in focal adhesion complexes as well as in the actin cytoskeleton and is mainly regulated by signals emanating from clustered cell adhesion receptors. Members of the Rho family of GTPases are important in these pathways (20Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5229) Google Scholar, 21Hall A. Biochem. Soc.

Actually, EphA4 stimulation activates Rho through the guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) factor ephexin, which triggers the retraction of retinal ganglion cell growth cones, and ephrinA5 in melanoma cells induces cell rounding and de-adhesion, again through the activation of RhoA (24Lawrenson I.D.

In keeping, the Crk family of adapter proteins (25Matsuda M. Reichman C.T. Hanafusa H. J.

Below, we show that in prostatic carcinoma cells ephrinA1 elicits a motility response by activating the SrcÂ·FAK complex, leading a Rho-dependent actino/myosin contractility activation, finally driving the retraction of the cell body and the re-direction of migration cells.

Defea (Riverside, CA); FAK non-related kinase (FRNK) was subcloned in pTarget vector from the sequence present in pCX4 plasmid (kindly donated by Dr Hajme Yano, Osaka, Japan) using the pTargetâ¢ mammalian expression system from Promega and following the manufacturer's instructions. Human FAK cloned in pRcCMV was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Hanks (Nashville, TN). The Y576F/Y577F-FAK mutant was obtained using the X-L site-directed mutagenesis kit from Qiagen. The pEGFPN1 plasmid encoding EGFP was from Clontech. Cell Culture, Stimulation, and Protein OverexpressionâPC3 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium to which was added 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. PC3 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection the cells were recovered for analysis. For studies using soluble ephrinA1, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were always stimulated with 1 Î¼gÂ·ml -1 Fc or ephrinA1-Fc for the indicated times. ImmunocytochemistryâTo investigate the formation of retraction fibers after washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 20 min at 4 Â°C. Then, after extensive washing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and stained with a 50 Î¼g/ml phalloidin-TRITC for 1 h at room temperature followed by several washes with PBS. The cells were mounted with glycerol plastine and observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysisâ1 Ã 106 cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 Î¼l of complete radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifuging and were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 Â°C with 1â2 Î¼g of the specific antibodies. For anti-EphA2 immunoprecipitation we used either anti-EphA2 antibodies or 1 Î¼gÂ·ml -1 ephrinA1-Fc fusion protein, which precipitates all EphA kinases with similar results. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS/PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and were probed first with specific antibodies, then with secondary antibodies. Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad) was used to perform quantitative analyses. In Vitro Three-dimensional Migration AssayâThe in vitro motility assays were carried out using the Transwell system of Costar equipped with 8-Î¼m pore polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (diameter, 13 mm). Cells were loaded into the upper compartment (5 Ã 105 cells in 500 Î¼l) in serum-deprived growth medium with or without 1 Î¼gÂ·ml -1 of ephrinA1. The upper chambers were placed into 6-well culture dishes containing 1 ml of medium with 50 ng/ml human EGF as chemoattractant. After 24 h of incubation at 37 Â°C, non-invading cells were removed mechanically using cotton swabs, and the micro-porous membrane containing the invaded cells was stained with DiffQuick solution. Chemotaxis was evaluated by counting the cells migrated to the lower surface of the polycarbonate filters. For each filter the number of cells in six randomly chosen fields was determined, and the counts were averaged (mean Â± S.D.). Rho Activity AssayâRho-binding domain was expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in BL21 cells. Levels of GTP-bound RhoA in cell lysates were measured as described by Ren et al. (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed in TBS-Triton X-100, and the NaCl and MgCl2 concentrations were adjusted to 500 and 10 mm, respectively, before the beads were added. Measurement of Retracted CellsâPC3 cells were plated on fn-coated coverslides. 24 h after starvation the cells were stimulated with ephrinA1-Fc or Fc alone for 15 min and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with phalloidin-TRITC as described above. At least 10 pictures were taken by fluorescence microscopy at 40Ã magnification, and the mean of the ratio between separated cells that had retracted their cytoplasm and formed retraction fibers and the total number of cells (retracted cells plus spread cells) was calculated by counting cells. EphrinA1 Leads to Activation of the Src-FAK PathwayâSrc family kinases have recently been proposed as possible mediators of EphA receptor signaling during retinal axon guidance (16Knoll B. Drescher U. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6248-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is well known that Src kinase is important in cytoskeletal rearrangement during physiologic and pathological conditions, such as migration and metastasis (29Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by repulsive and guidance factors, such as ephrins, are similar to those elicited by chemo-attractant motility factors. Indeed, the motility cues induced by guidance factors may play a key role in the directional motility of disseminating cancers (30Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6524-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we focused on the role of Src kinase in ephrinA1 elicited signaling, choosing as a model a metastatic prostate carcinoma cell line with high endogenous EphA2 overexpression. In PC3 cells ephrinA1 is able to induce Src activation, with a maximum observed after 15 min based on the phosphorylation level of Src regulatory tyrosines 416 and 527 (Fig. 1A). Activated Src kinase rapidly associates with FAK, forming a bipartite kinase (31Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We, therefore, looked at the association between these two molecules in ephrinA1 stimulation (Fig. 1B). Upon ephrinA1 stimulation, we find that FAK associates with Src in a ligand-dependent manner. Formation of the SrcÂ·FAK complex upon ephrinA1 stimulation leads to enhancement of FAK kinase activity, as demonstrated by phosphorylation of FAK upon ligand engagement (Fig. 1C). Involvement of FAK-tyrosine kinase in ephrinA1 signaling is further indicated by its ligand-dependent association with EphA2 receptor (Fig. 1D). To investigate the mechanisms involved in the activation of FAK after ephrinA1 stimulation, we analyzed its phosphorylation level in PC3 cells treated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and in cells transfected with the dominant negative form of Src, SrcK-. The SrcK-mutant is catalytically inactive as it carries a mutation in the ATP binding site, but it is still able to bind substrates. We find that ephrinA1-mediated FAK phosphorylation is Src-dependent since both the treatment with PP2 and the overexpression of SrcK-severely impair FAK activation (Fig. 1E). FAK is a large tyrosine kinase that, upon autophosphorylation on Tyr-397, recruits Src; this in turn phosphorylates FAK on several tyrosine sites, setting up multiple signal transduction pathways (31Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Analysis of the specific tyrosines of FAK, such as tyrosine 407, 397, 925, 861, 576, and 577, shows that only Tyr-576 and -577 are specifically phosphorylated upon ephrinA1 stimulation, whereas the phosphorylation level of tyrosines 407, 861, and 397 are not affected (Fig. 2). We also find evidence that the phosphorylation of tyrosines 576 and 577 depends on Src activity, as demonstrated by the use of PP2 (Fig. 2). This tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was further confirmed in breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB231 and in non-transformed breast epithelial cells MCF10A (data not shown). Considering that the phosphorylation of Tyr-576/577 of FAK has been reported to increase the kinase activity of FAK (32Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data provide evidence that ephrinA1 stimulation leads to the recruitment and activation of the SrcÂ·FAK complex. Rho Activation by EphrinA1 Involves Src and FAK EngagementâA recognized way in which Eph receptors affect cellular morphology is by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape through the regulation of Rho family GTPases (12Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. Neuron. 2005; 46: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently RhoA activation has been reported to affect the ephrinB2-mediated cell migration of melanoma cells (15Yang N.Y. Pasquale E.B. Owen L.B. Ethell I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32574-32586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho small GTPase has been involved in ephrinA1-mediated angiogenesis or inhibition of integrin-induced cell spreading and dendritic spine retraction (33Deroanne C. Vouret-Craviari V. Wang B. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Fu W.Y. Chen Y. Sahin M. Zhao X.S. Shi L. Bikoff J.B. Lai K.O. Yung W.H. Fu A.K. Greenberg M.E. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35Hunter S.G. Zhuang G. Brantley-Sieders D. Swat W. Cowan C.W. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4830-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated if Src and FAK activation in response to ephrinA1 plays a role in RhoA regulation in PC3 cells. We used as tools the dominant negative mutants for FAK (FRNK) and Src (SrcK-). The FRNK mutant is a natural dominant negative protein for FAK as a result of its ability to inhibit the formation of the SrcÂ·FAK complex (36Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Actually FRNK is devoid of kinase activity and contains only the C-terminal region of FAK, maintaining the proline-rich regions responsible for stabilizing Src association through binding of SH3 domains (37Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We overexpressed these mutants in ephrinA1-stimulated PC3 cells and analyzed the activation of RhoA by means of glutathione S-transferase pulldown. The results indicate that Src activation and the formation of the bipartite kinase SrcÂ·FAK are required steps for ephrinA1-induced RhoA activation (Fig. 3A). In addition, the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-576/577 is a key regulatory step in ephrinA1 RhoA activation, as demonstrated by the overexpression of the ephrin-insensitive Y576F/Y577F FAK mutant (Fig. 3B). EphrinA1 Repulsion Determines Cell Body Retraction Activating Actino/Myosin ContractilityâRhoA is acknowledged to affect cell body retraction and rounding through the downstream activation of cytoskeleton contractility. Myosin II is the principal motor protein responsible for cell motility, and the phosphorylation of its MLCII through the Rho-activated kinase is a primary means for activating its motor power and executing cytoskeleton contractility (38Matsumura F. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Rho-dependent signal induced by ephrinA1 involves actino/myosin contractility, we investigated the phosphorylation level of MLCII in response to ephrinA1 (Fig. 4A). The results show that ephrinA1 elicits a strong activation of MLCII phosphorylation in PC3 cells and that this event is downstream with respect to Src and FAK activation/association. We confirmed the direct involvement of RhoA in MLCII activation by ephrinA1 through overexpression of its dominant negative RhoA-N19 (Fig. 4B). Down-regulation of cell-cell contacts and cell shape changes could be critical during neurite outgrowth, synapse remodeling, vascular sprouting, and in initiation of epithelial cell migration during development and metastasis dissemination. Upon ephrinA1 treatment, cells appear to disrupt cell-cell interactions to repel each other and to retract the cell body. We examined the extent of cell-cell contacts and found that ephrinA1 stimulation causes a strong decrease in these contacts (Fig. 5A). In addition we attempted to determine if the activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase/MLCII/myosinII pathway is required for retraction of carcinoma cell body in response to ephrinA1. To this aim we used several targeted inhibitors of the pathway, including the cell-permeable C3 RhoA inhibitor, the Y27632 Rho kinase inhibitor, the ML7 MLC kinase inhibitor, and the myosinII inhibitor blebbistatin. The analysis of retracted cells (Fig. 5B) reveals that the Rho-dependent pathway, converging on myosinII activation, plays a pivotal role in ephrinA1-elicited cell body retraction and prompts cytoskeleton contractility to produce the force necessary for the cell to retract its cytoplasm. EphrinA1 Repulsive Motility Requires Activation of the SrcÂ·FAK ComplexâWe have previously reported that in PC3 cells ephrinA1 leads to retraction fiber formation as a result of cell body retraction (39Parri M. Buricchi F. Taddei M.L. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34008-34018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We now show that the activation of both Src and FAK kinases play a specific role in ephrinA1-induced repulsion, as indicated by quantification of cells displaying retraction fibers (Fig. 6). Our tools were again the dominant negative mutant for FAK, Src, and RhoA and the ephrin-signaling insensitive Y576F/Y577F FAK mutant. Inhibition of Src activation through expression of SrcK-stops the ability of ephrinA1 to induce retraction fibers. The ability of FRNK to inhibit retraction fiber formation suggests a decisive role of the complex formed between Src and FAK. Furthermore, the role of ephrin-induced activation of FAK through the up-regulation of Tyr-576/577 phosphorylation is confirmed by overexpression of the Y576F/Y577F FAK mutant, again eliminating the ephrin-elicited response. Finally, RhoA is involved in retraction fiber formation in response to ephrinA1, in keeping with its recognized role of a key player in cytoskeleton rearrangements. Eph ligands have been reported to affect cell motility, instructing cells to inhibit previously engaged signals toward chemo-attractive molecules and inducing a change of directional motility (14Santiago A. Erickson C.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cooper H.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 621-631PubMed Google Scholar, 41Klagsbrun M. Eichmann A.

Cell. 2005; 121: 127-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To study the role of the activation of Src and FAK kinases in the motility response induced by ephrinA1, we explored the effect of inhibition of Src, FAK, and RhoA (Fig. 7). Indeed, the overexpression of the dominant negative mutants for Src and FAK, the ephrin-insensitive Y576F/Y577F FAK mutant or the dominant negative RhoA, severely impairs the ability of ephrinA1 to inhibit chemotaxis toward EGF. These results suggest that the SrcÂ·FAK /RhoA pathway is a key determinant of the physiological response induced by ephrinA1 in prostate carcinoma cells, playing a critical function in retraction of cell body and in the control of directional migration. The molecular mechanisms underlying the directional cell motility in vitro have come under wide investigation, and this has led to the recognition of several cytoskeletal and signaling proteins implicated in different steps of cell migration. It is likely that in vivo a similar setting of mechanisms plays key functions where the migratory movements of cells, as the axonal growth of cones or the dissemination and organ targeting of metastasis, undergo more complex regulation by both attractive and repulsive cues. The mutual effects of these cues decide the timing and exact path of cell motility. Our data indicate that the activation of a repulsive outcome elicited by ephrinA1/EphA2 leads to the activation of a motile response involving the complex of two tyrosine kinases, Src and FAK. These two kinases are believed to be components of focal adhesion complexes and are involved in cell migration toward chemo-attractants. We report that they are similarly involved in the repulsive motility response, indicating that the features of a moving cell, either elicited by a chemo-attractant or a chemo-repulsive agent, involves some common molecular events. Among the molecular occurrences shared by attraction and repulsion, we include myosin-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangements, again driven through enhancement of Src and FAK activation by ephrinA1. Our studies are in agreement with the recent report by Moeller et al. (19Moeller M.L. Shi Y. Reichardt L.F. Ethell I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), indicating a role for FAK activation in EphB-mediated shortening of dendritic spine precursors, and with the data of Carter et al.

https://openalex.org/W2049046584,"Dynamitin is a commonly used inhibitor of cytoplasmic dynein-based motility in living cells. Dynamitin does not inhibit dynein directly but instead acts by causing disassembly of dynactin, a multiprotein complex required for dynein-based movement. In dynactin, dynamitin is closely associated with the subunits p150Glued and p24, which together form the shoulder and projecting arm structures of the dynactin molecule. In this study, we explore the way in which exogenous dynamitin effects dynactin disruption. We find that pure, recombinant dynamitin is an elongated protein with a strong propensity for self-assembly. Titration experiments reveal that free dynamitin binds dynactin before it causes release of subunits. When dynamitin is added to dynactin at an equimolar ratio of exogenous dynamitin subunits to endogenous dynamitin subunits (1Ã= 4 mol of exogenous dynamitin per mole of dynactin), exogenous dynamitin exchanges with endogenous dynamitin, and partial release of p150Glued is observed. When added in vast excess (â¥25Ã; 100 mol of exogenous dynamitin per mole of dynactin), recombinant dynamitin causes complete release of both p150Glued subunits, two dynamitins and one p24, but not other dynactin subunits. Our data suggest that dynamitin mediates disruption of dynactin by binding to endogenous dynamitin subunits. This binding destabilizes the shoulder structure that links the p150Glued arm to the Arp1 filament and leads to subunit release.

This binding destabilizes the shoulder structure that links the p150Glued arm to the Arp1 filament and leads to subunit release. Dynactin is a multiprotein complex that plays important roles in microtubule-based motility. Dynactin was first identified as an activator of dynein-driven vesicle movement in vitro (1Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1639-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and a host of functional studies have verified that it is required for most, if not all, forms of dynein-based movement in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 3Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 4Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Dynactin facilitates dynein-based motility in two ways: 1) it serves as an adapter protein that allows dynein to bind a variety of subcellular cargoes, and 2) it increases dynein processivity (reviewed in Ref. 4Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Dynactin also interacts with motors of the kinesin superfamily (5Blangy A. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19418-19424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Deacon S.W. Serpinskaya A.S. Vaughan P.S. Lopez Fanarraga M. Vernos I. Vaughan K.T. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) suggesting that its functions are more broad-ranging than previously imagined. In keeping with this idea, we find that dynactin also increases the processivity of kinesin 2 (7Berezuk M.A. Schroer T.A. Traffic. 2007; 8: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to facilitating subcellular motility, dynactin contributes to microtubule anchoring at centrosomes (8Quintyne N.J. Gill S.R. Eckley D.M. Crego C.L. Compton D.A. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9Quintyne N.J. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Its microtubule binding properties may be the basis for additional anchoring and/or plus-end targeting functions. Dynactin consists of eleven distinct subunits, some of which are present in multiple copies, that are organized into a structure with a net mass of 1.1 MDa. Rotary shadow electron microscopy, single particle analysis, and biochemical characterization of intact dynactin and dynactin subcomplexes have provided a clear picture of dynactin structure and subunit organization (10Schafer D.A.

Dynactin contains two distinct structural domains: a 37 Ã 8 nm, cargo-binding structure and a 24 nm-long projecting arm that binds microtubules. These two structures are linked via a triangular shoulder (10Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J.

The cargo-binding domain is a short polymer of eight subunits of the actin-related protein, Arp1, plus associated polypeptides. The projecting arm consists of the N-terminal third of the p150Glued dimer. The shoulder assembly is thought to comprise the C-terminal two-thirds of the p150Glued dimer, four monomers of dynamitin (p50), and two monomers of p24. When dynactin disassembly is induced by treatment with potassium iodide (KI) the projecting arm and shoulder assembly separate into two stable complexes: 1) the p150Glued dimer, two dynamitins, and a single p24 (referred to as âshoulder/sidearmâ in a previous study (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), and 2) a smaller assembly of two dynamitins and a single p24 (referred to as shoulder previously (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)). Under these conditions, the Arp1 filament depolymerizes completely, and the protein complexes that are present at each end of the filament are released intact (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). p150Glued has been reported to interact with Arp1 directly (14Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), but it is likely that the other shoulder components, dynamitin and p24, contribute to and stabilize this interaction. Dynamitin has emerged as an especially important element of dynactin structure (reviewed in Ref. 4Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that dynamitin might attach p150Glued to the Arp1 filament was first proposed on the basis of dynactin ultrastructure (10Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This was later verified biochemically. Overexpression of dynamitin in cultured cells has a dramatic effect on dynactin structure, causing release of p150Glued from the Arp1 filament (15Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A similar effect is seen when purified recombinant dynamitin is added to partially purified dynactin (16Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or Xenopus egg cytosol (17Wittman T. Hyman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In experiments using purified dynactin (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), excess dynamitin causes release of both p150Glued and p24 from the Arp1 filament, demonstrating that no additional cytosolic factors are required. The Arp1 filament retains four dynamitin subunits, the same number found in intact dynactin. However, it has not been possible to determine whether exogenous dynamitin exchanges for endogenous dynamitin on the Arp1 filament, because the large excess of dynamitin used in all previous work completely obscured the behavior of endogenous dynamitin. How exogenous dynamitin interacts with dynactin has important implications regarding dynactin subunit-subunit interactions as well as the mechanism of disruption. Furthermore, it is not clear how p150Glued and p24 are released: as individual polypeptides, in complexes with endogenous dynamitin, or in complexes with exogenous dynamitin. In the present study, we sought to gain a clearer understanding of the mechanism of dynamitin-induced disruption. As a first step, we examined the self-association properties of recombinant, human dynamitin using gel-filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Our data suggest that recombinant dynamitin is present predominantly as monomers and tetramers, both of which are highly elongated. Titration experiments suggest that dynactin disruption involves binding of exogenous dynamitin monomers to the dynactin molecule. Release of p150Glued can be detected at a submolar ratio of exogenous to endogenous dynamitin (0.5Ã, 2 mol of exogenous dynamitin per mole dynactin), but complete disruption requires a molar excess of â¼25Ã. At these high dynamitin concentrations, two exogenous dynamitin subunits are exchanged for two endogenous subunits on the Arp minifilament. Both p150Glued subunits and a single p24 subunit are released in a complex with endogenous dynamitin. The other two dynamitins and one p24 subunit remain tightly associated with the Arp1 minifilament in a 19S-20S complex. Protein PurificationâBovine brain dynactin was purified to 95% homogeneity as described (18Bingham J.B. King S.J. Schroer T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Chick embryo brain dynactin was purified as described (10Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). p150Glued coiled-coil 1 (CC1) 3The abbreviations used are: CC1, coiled-coil 1; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody. in pVEX (8Quintyne N.J.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5089-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The double C to A human dynamitin mutant (C245A/C261A) was generated using QuikChange mutagenesis. Human dynamitins (wild type, mutant, untagged, or tagged with the His-/XPress tag; Invitrogen) were expressed in bacteria and purified by Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography and Superose12 gel-filtration chromatography as described (17Wittman T. Hyman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Elution peaks were identified by using A280. The Superose12 column was eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the isolated dynamitin was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer used for the analytical ultracentrifugation analyses. Disruption experiments were performed in either sedimentation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) or 40 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Tween 20, with the same results. Details of the purification of dynamitin/p24 heterotrimers will be published elsewhere. 4K. C. Maier and T. A. Schroer, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, guanidine-HCl denatured, His-tagged p24 was enriched by nickel HiTrap chromatography and then mixed with an excess of purified dynamitin. The mixture was incubated on ice, and the guanidine-HCl was removed by dialysis. Insoluble p24 was removed by ultracentrifugation, and dynamitin/p24 heterotrimers were separated from free dynamitin by nickel HiTrap chromatography. The assembly state (2:1, dynamitin:p24) was verified by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Analytical UltracentrifugationâThe partial specific volume (vÌ) was calculated from the amino acid composition using the method of Cohn and Edsall (20Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold, New York1943: 370-377Google Scholar). The solvent density (Ï) was calculated from buffer composition as described (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). These calculations along with corrections for temperature were calculated using the computer program SEDNTERP. 5D. Hayes, T. Laue, and J. Philo (2001) Sedimentation interpretation (SENDTERP). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Protein concentration was adjusted to an absorbance of 0.6 at 275 nm, which corresponds to 1.4 mg/ml (â¼30 Î¼m). 0.43-ml samples were loaded into cells with 12-mm double sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and quartz windows. Velocity runs were carried out at 5 Â°C at 56,000 rpm in an An-60 Ti rotor. Data scans were recorded continuously throughout the experiment using the absorption optical system at 275 nm. All data were initially analyzed using the method of van Holde and Weischet (23van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Extrapolation plots were made and used to generate diffusion corrected integral distribution G(s*) plots. Following preliminary analysis, data were further fitted to the Lamm equation using the finite-element method as implemented in the program Ultrascan (24Demeler B. Saber H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Initial estimates for the fitting parameters were obtained from the van Holde-Weischet analysis. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out at 4 Â°C and later at 20 Â°C using cells fitted with 12-mm double sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and sapphire windows. Cell sectors were loaded with 120 Î¼l of either solvent or protein solution. Samples at two or three different concentrations over the range of 0.4 to 2 mg/ml (â¼ 9â45 Î¼m) were run in duplicate in an eight-place An-50 Ti rotor. The lower temperature runs were allowed to reach equilibrium at rotor speeds between 9,500 and 13,000 rpm. The runs at 20 Â°C were made at 18â19,000 rpm, at which speeds the concentration distributions at equilibrium were essentially depleted at the menisci. Equilibrium was assumed to have been established when no detectable changes in the concentration distributions could be detected over 2- to 3-h intervals. Data from the 4 Â°C runs were collected by both the absorption (at 280 nm) and interference optical systems; for the runs at 20 Â°C only the interference system was used. The data from both sets of experiments were analyzed using the ORIGIN-based self-assembly computer program (XL-A/XL-I Data Analysis Software, version 4.0, Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Values for vÌ and Ï were calculated as described above. Dynamitin samples analyzed at 4 Â°C were in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA. Those analyzed at 20 Â°C were in either the solvent just described or in 100 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 2 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA. Dynactin DisruptionâFor all experiments, an equimolar ratio of exogenous dynamitin to endogenous dynamitin was considered to be 4 mol of exogenous dynamitin per mole dynactin, because each mole of dynactin contains 4 mol of dynamitin. 15 Î¼g of bovine dynactin dynamitin was mixed with different amounts of recombinant human dynamitin (0.25â50Ã, XPress-tagged or untagged, mutant or wild type) or buffer alone, diluted to 0.1 or 0.5 ml in sedimentation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The concentrations of dynactin ranged between 0.06 and 12 Î¼m, and those for dynamitin were between 0.05 and 24 Î¼m. All buffers included 1000-fold dilutions of a protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 40 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml NÎ±-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester), 10 mg/ml Î±-benzoyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 10 mg/ml Î±-p-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 10 mg/ml NÎ±-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Following incubation, the samples were diluted further to 1.5 ml in sedimentation buffer and sedimented into a 5â20% continuous sucrose gradient in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 150,000 Ã g for 15 h at 4 Â°C. Fractions were collected, then chloroform/methanol-precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Dynactin subunits were detected by Coomassie Blue staining and/or immunoblotting. Control experiments used a 25Ã molar excess of purified p150Glued amino acids 217â548 (âCC1â) in place of dynamitin. 15 Î¼g of purified chicken dynactin was incubated with a 45-fold molar excess of recombinant wild-type human dynamitin monomers to chick dynactin molecules and processed as above. Control dynactin samples supplemented with buffer alone were incubated in parallel. The behavior of chick dynamitin subunits and human dynamitin were analyzed by immunoblotting with species-specific antibodies. PAGE, Immunoblotting, and DensitometryâSDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 11% polyacrylamide gels using the Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad) and were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) using a Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected using dynactin-specific primary antibodies in conjunction with the Western-Lightâ¢ protein detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Quantitation of the dynactin subunit p150Glued was performed on Coomassie blue-stained gels or immunoblots using National Institutes of Health Image 1 software, after scanning on a flat-bed scanner (Microtek).

An affinity-purified pAb to the Arp11 C terminus was a gift from Dr. M. Way (Cancer Research United Kingdom, London). For p27 (mAb 27A) mice were immunized with purified pointed-end complex from dynactin (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J.

Sera from the immunized mice were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting on purified dynactin, and hybridomas were prepared by standard methods. Purified Recombinant Dynamitin Self-associatesâTo learn more about the interaction between exogenous dynamitin and dynactin and how this causes release of p150Glued and p24 from the Arp1 filament, we performed a hydrodynamic characterization of recombinant human dynamitin. Superose12 HR 10/30 gel-filtration chromatography yielded a major population of molecules with a Stokes radius of 6.3 nm (Fig. 1A). Comparison of this elution profile with that of native, heterotrimeric shoulder complex (i.e. two dynamitins and one p24 (11Eckley D.M. Gill S.R. Melkonian K.A. Bingham J.B. Goodson H.V. Heuser J.E.

The immunoglobulin genes are assembled in developing B cells by recombination-activating gene-mediated rearrangement of the germline V, D, and J gene segments (1Tonegawa S.

Here they undergo further diversification of their Ig genes, namely somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). SHM introduces mainly point mutations in the variable (V) region genes and can alter the affinity of the antibodies produced by B cells, whereas CSR replaces the Ig gene constant regions to acquire different antibody effector functions. Both SHM and CSR are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is thought to catalyze the deamination of cytosine (C) to uracil (U) and generate a U:G DNA lesion (5Muramatsu M.

The precise mechanism of SHM remains elusive, but mutations are ultimately introduced by multiple DNA polymerases during the replication and repair of the U:G mismatch (8Neuberger M.S. Di Noia J.M.

Studies with gene-targeted mice have revealed that DNA polymerases Î· (POLH), Î¸ (POLQ), and REV1 have unique roles in Ig gene SHM. A deficiency in POLH caused an â¼80% reduction of mutations at A/T, suggesting that POLH is the major enzyme generating A/T mutations and that its activity cannot be compensated for by other polymerases (12Delbos F.

The absence of POLQ resulted in decreases of both A/T and C/G mutations, although the magnitude of the reduction differed in two independent studies (15Masuda K. Ouchida R. Takeuchi A. Saito T.

These results collectively suggest that multiple DNA polymerases participate in distinct but overlapping mutagenic pathways to generate different types of base substitutions. Similar to mice and humans lacking POLH, mice deficient for either MSH2 or MSH6 have a large reduction of A/T mutations (26Rada C. Ehrenstein M.R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C.

The MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer binds to mispaired bases, including the U:G mismatch that is potentially generated by AID-mediated deamination of C, and initiates mismatch repair (MMR). Moreover, MSH2-MSH6 was found to interact with and stimulate the polymerase activity of POLH (29Wilson T.M. Vaisman A. Martomo S.A. Sullivan P. Lan L. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Woodgate R. Gearhart P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that POLH introduces mutations at A/T during MMR of the AID-induced U:G lesions. Although mutations at A/T were greatly reduced in mice lacking POLH, MSH2, or MSH6, â¼20% of the normal level of A/T mutations were still generated in these mice, and it remains unclear which polymerase mediates these residual A/T mutations. Because Polqâ/â mice, which completely lack POLQ expression, exhibited â¼20% reduction of mutations at A/T (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), one possibility is that POLQ might be involved in the generation of the residual A/T mutations observed in the absence of POLH. To investigate this possibility, we established mice deficient for both POLH and POLQ and analyzed the frequency and patterns of Ig gene mutations. Our results suggest that POLH and POLQ function in the same genetic pathway to generate mutations at A/T. Establishment of Polqâ/âPolhâ/â MiceâPolqâ/â and Polhâ/â mice were generated in a 129/C57BL/6 mixed background and have been backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for five and nine generations, respectively. Polqâ/â mice were bred with Polhâ/â mice to generate Polq+/âPolh+/â mice, which were then crossed to obtain WT, Polqâ/â, Polhâ/â, and Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice. The genotypes of these mice were verified by genomic PCR of tail DNA as described previously (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J.

The mice were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions, and all of the experiments were approved by the Animal Facility Committee of the RIKEN Yokohama Institute. FACS Analysis, Proliferation Assays, and Induction of Class Switch RecombinationâFACS analysis and B cell proliferation assays were performed essentially as described (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For CSR assays, purified B cells (5 Ã 105/ml) were cultured in a 24-well plate in the presence of either LPS (10 Î¼g/ml) plus IL-4 (20 ng/ml) or CD40 ligand (CD40L, 1/3 dilution and anti-CD8Î±, 2 Î¼g/ml) plus IL-4 (20 ng/ml) for 72 h and analyzed for IgG1 expression by FACS. Somatic Hypermutation AssaysâThree WT, two Polqâ/â, four Polhâ/â, and two Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice (11â13 weeks-old), all of which were confirmed to be IgMb allotype by FACS analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes, were immunized with 100 Î¼g of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-acetyl coupled to chicken Î³-globulin. Two weeks later, B220+PNA+ GC B cells were sorted from spleens of each mouse, and the genomic DNA was isolated. The amplification was performed with a forward primer J558Fr3 (5â²-CAGCCTGACATCTGAGGACTCTGC-3â²) and a reverse primer JHCHint (5â²-CTCCACCAGACCTCTCTAGACAGC-3â²) as described (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with the high fidelity KOD plus polymerase (TOYOBO) under the following conditions: 94 Â°C for 5 min and then 94 Â°C for 20 s and 68 Â°C for 40 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector for sequencing. Only clones with unique sequences were analyzed. The data were corrected for base composition of the 509-bp JH4 intronic region (A, 26.92%; T, 31.04%; C, 14.14%; G, 27.90%). Mismatch Extension AssayâRecombinant POLH and POLQ were purified as described (31Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). POLH and POLQ were first titrated to determine the amount of each enzyme that gives a similar polymerase activity for normal, matched termini. For DNA polymerase extension assays from mispaired termini opposite an A, a 32P-labeled primer 5â²-GATTGAGTGTAGGAGACN-3â² (where N was A, C, G, or T) was annealed with a template 5â²-CTCTTCACCTCTAGTCTCCTACACTCAATC-3â² as described previously (31Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, for extension assays from mispaired termini opposite a T, a 32P-labeled primer 5â²-CACTGACTGTATGATGAN-3â² was annealed with a template 5â²-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3â². Standard reactions for POLH were performed in 10 Î¼l of buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 Î¼m each of the four dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 40 nm of the 32P-labeled primer template as described (31Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). POLQ assays were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.75), 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 Î¼m of each dNTPs, 80 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4% glycerol as described (32Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For the mismatch insertion and extension assay, a 32P-labeled primer 5â²-GATTGAGTGTAGGAGAC-3â² was annealed with a template 5â²-CTCTTCGCCTCTAGTCTCCTACACTCAATC-3â², and the POLH reaction condition was used. The mismatch insertion was analyzed by omitting TTP. Normal B and T Cell Development and Maturation in Polqâ/â Polhâ/â MiceâFACS analysis of the bone marrow cells of WT, Polqâ/â, Polhâ/â, and Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice revealed no obvious differences in the percentages of CD43+ IgMâ progenitor, CD43âIgMâ precursor, and CD43âIgM+ B cells after gating on the B220+ cells (Fig. 1A). The ratio of the immature (B220dullIgM+) and recirculating (B220highIgM+) B cells was similar among these mice (Fig. 1B). B cell differentiation in the spleen was also normal as judged by the similar ratio of CD23+CD21â follicular and CD23âCD21+ marginal zone B cells in all types of mice (Fig. 1C). T cell differentiation also appeared normal because there was a similar representation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen (Fig. 1D). Normal B Cell Responses and Class Switch Recombination in Polqâ/âPolhâ/â MiceâHaving confirmed that B and T cell development was phenotypically indistinguishable among the different mice, we analyzed B cell function as assessed by proliferative responses to various activation signals. As shown in Fig. 2A, Polqâ/âPolhâ/â B cells responded normally to anti-IgM antibodies, CD40L, LPS, and their combination. In addition, these B cells switched normally from IgM to IgG1 upon in vitro stimulation with LPS plus IL-4 or CD40L plus IL-4 (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that deficiency in both POLH and POLQ did not have any obvious effect on B cell development, maturation, activation, or class switch recombination of the Ig genes. Mutation Frequency in Polqâ/âPolhâ/â MiceâTo examine the somatic hypermutation of Ig genes, mice were immunized with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-acetyl coupled to chicken Î³-globulin precipitated with alum, and 2 weeks later their splenocytes were stained with B220 and PNA to identify GC B cells. A similar frequency of the B220+PNA+ cells was observed in WT, Polqâ/â, Polhâ/â, and Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice (supplemental Fig. S1). The B220+PNA+ GC B cells were sorted, and the purity was generally more than 90% (typical profiles shown in supplemental Fig. S1). We analyzed JH4 intronic sequences from three WT, two Polqâ/â, four Polhâ/â, and two Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice that were derived from breeding of Polq+/â by Polh+/â mice. The detailed results from individual mice in each group (except for Polqâ/â mice where the data were obtained from GC B cells pooled from two mice) are shown in supplemental Tables S1âS4. For WT and Polqâ/â mice, we also included data from our previous study (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), allowing the analysis of a larger number of mutations of each type of base substitution. The results from each group were combined and are shown in Table 1. In agreement with earlier studies, the overall mutation frequency in the JH4 intronic region was â¼1% in WT mice (0.996%; Table 1). Mutation frequency at C/G (0.493%) was similar to that at A/T (0.503%), so the ratio of C/G:A/T mutations was 49.5:50.5. Consistent with our recent observations, the overall mutation frequency in Polqâ/â mice dropped to 0.766%, and mutations at C/G and A/T were decreased to 0.377 and 0.389% (24 and 23% reduction compared with WT mice, respectively). As expected, mutations at A/T were reduced by 83% in Polhâ/â mice (0.084% versus 0.503% in WT mice) but interestingly mutations at C/G were unaffected (0.504% versus 0.493% in WT mice), suggesting that POLH was not involved in the generation of C/G mutations and that the decrease of mutations at A/T was not compensated for by an increase in C/G mutations. The overall mutation frequency dropped to 0.588% (41% reduction compared with WT mice) in Polhâ/â mice exclusively because of the decreased A/T mutations. Because Polqâ/â and Polhâ/â mice each exhibited a decrease of mutations at A/T, we expected a greater reduction of A/T mutations in Polqâ/â Polhâ/â mice. Unexpectedly, Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice did not exhibit any further decrease of A/T mutations as compared with Polhâ/â mice (Table 1). These observations suggest that POLH and POLQ likely function in the same genetic pathway, so the double deficiency does not give an additive effect.TABLE 1Mutation frequency in WT and Polq-/-, Polh-/-, and double mutant miceJH4 intron (509 bp)WTaPooled data of this study (three mice, 430 clones) and a previous study (209 clones) (17).Polq-/-bPooled data of this study (two mice, 160 clones) and a previous study (371 clones) (17).Polh-/-cThis study (four mice).Polq-/-Polh-/-dThis study (two mice).Number of clones639531477250Mutated clones (%)487 (76.2%)405 (76.3%)349 (73.2%)176 (70.4%)Total length of mutated sequences247,883206,145177,64189,584Total number of mutationseThe data are corrected for base composition.247015791045530Overall mutation frequency (%)0.9960.766fThe values in bold type indicate significant differences from WT mice (p < 0.001, Ï2 test).0.5880.592Mutation frequency at C/G (%)0.4930.3770.5040.495Mutation frequency at A/T (%)0.5030.3890.0840.097Ratio of mutations at C/G:A/T49.5:50.549.2:50.885.7:14.383.6:16.4a Pooled data of this study (three mice, 430 clones) and a previous study (209 clones) (17Masuda K.

Open table in a new tab Taking advantage of the large number of mutations we have analyzed, we next compared the actual frequency of each type of nucleotide substitution (Fig. 3A). Compared with WT mice (open bars), Polqâ/â mice showed a moderate reduction of mutations of virtually all types of base substitutions (gray bars), indicating that POLQ is involved in the generation of mutations at both A/T and C/G and that its role is not biased toward a particular type of base substitution. Although Polhâ/â mice showed a preferential reduction of mutations that occurred at A/T, the magnitude of reduction differed depending on the type of base substitutions (striped bars). Thus the A to G and T to C substitutions, which together accounted for nearly half of the A/T mutations in WT mice, were almost totally abolished in Polhâ/â mice (94 and 93% reductions, respectively). A slightly less dramatic reduction was observed for A to T and T to A changes (85 and 90% reductions, respectively), whereas A to C and T to G substitutions were decreased by only â¼50%. Therefore, the A to G and T to C transitions are almost exclusively dependent on the activity of POLH, whereas half of the A to C and T to G are likely generated by another polymerase(s). These results are in good agreement with earlier observations in Polhâ/â mice (12Delbos F. De Smet A. Faili A. Aoufouchi S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Martomo S.A. Yang W.W. Vaisman A. Maas A. Yokoi M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Gearhart P.J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As is the case for the overall mutation frequency at A/T (Table 1), the frequency of each type of base substitution at A/T in Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice was very similar to that observed in Polhâ/â mice, further suggesting that POLH and POLQ function on the same genetic pathway in the generation of A/T mutations. Mutation Patterns in Polqâ/âPolhâ/â MiceâWe further analyzed mutation patterns (Fig. 3B), which do not take into consideration the absolute mutation frequency but instead reflect the relative representation of each type of nucleotide substitution among all mutations. The patterns of base substitutions were quite similar between WT and Polqâ/â mice except there was a slight increase of G to C transversions and a moderate decrease of G to T and T to G transversions, as we recently described (17Masuda K. Ouchida R. Hikida M. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Kurosaki T. O-Wang J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By contrast, Polhâ/â mice exhibited dramatically decreased mutations at A/T and an increased representation of C/G mutations as reported previously (12Delbos F. De Smet A. Faili A. Aoufouchi S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Martomo S.A. Yang W.W. Wersto R.P. Ohkumo T. Kondo Y. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Hanaoka F.

Woodgate R. Gearhart P.J. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Again, the mutation patterns in Polqâ/âPolhâ/â mice were quite similar to that in Polhâ/â mice except for a decrease of C to A in the former mice. POLQ Efficiently Catalyzed the Extension from Mispaired Termini Opposite A or TâThe observation that Polqâ/â Polhâ/â mice did not show any further decrease in A/T mutations as compared with Polhâ/â mice suggested that POLQ functions in the same genetic pathway as POLH. Because the reduction of A/T mutations was more dramatic in Polhâ/â than in Polqâ/â mice, one potential pathway would place POLQ downstream of POLH, where it could cooperate with POLH to generate a subset of the A/T mutations. POLQ has already been shown to efficiently catalyze not only the insertion but also the extension step for bypass of a noninstructive abasic site and a thymine glycol (32Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that POLQ might also have the ability to extend DNA synthesis from mispaired termini opposite an A or T, which could be generated by POLH because it frequently incorporates incorrect nucleotides during copying of undamaged DNA (33Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 34Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Rogozin I.B. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we compared the ability of POLH and POLQ to extend DNA synthesis from different types of mispaired termini opposite A or T. Under conditions where both polymerases exhibited similar activities from normal, matched termini (Fig. 4, A, lanes 11 and 12, and B, lanes 2 and 3), we found that POLQ exhibited greater activity than POLH in extending from mispaired termini opposite either A (Fig. 4A) or T (Fig. 4B). POLH was relatively efficient at extension from a G opposite T (Fig. 4B, lane 8) or a T opposite T (Fig. 4B, lane 11) but was inefficient in extending other types of mispaired termini opposite A or T (Fig. 4). In contrast, POLQ was proficient in extending all types of mispaired termini opposite A or T, suggesting that POLQ is an efficient mismatch extender. In this assay, the processivity of POLQ was greater than that of POLH, and POLQ was able to extend one nucleotide further than the template length (Fig. 4, A and B) by nontemplated addition at a blunt end (32Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To examine whether POLQ could directly extend the mispaired termini generated by POLH, we further analyzed the mismatch insertion and extension in the same reaction. POLH alone was able to incorporate an incorrect nucleotide opposite an A but was inefficient in extending after the misincorporation site (Fig. 4C, lane 10). POLQ alone was able to insert the wrong nucleotide opposite A and further carried out the extension to the end of the template albeit at relatively low efficiency (Fig. 4C, lane 16). When POLH and POLQ were both present in the same reaction, a more efficient extension was observed (Fig. 4C, lane 11). At a higher concentration, POLH alone catalyzed greater mismatch insertion and apparent extension (Fig. 4C, lane 12), and the presence of POLQ resulted in further extension (Fig. 4C, lane 13). A mutant POLH, in which the conserved aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) residues at amino acid positions 115 and 116 were both converted to alanine (AA), had no detectable polymerase activity (lanes 6 and 14) and did not increase but rather slightly inhibited the activity of POLQ (compare lane 7 versus lane 8 and lane 15 versus lane 16). These observations indicate that the increased mismatch extension observed in the presence of both POLH and POLQ was not due to POLH-mediated stabilization of POLQ. It is now well appreciated that multiple DNA polymerases participate in the SHM of Ig genes. It has been unclear, however, whether these polymerases collaborate or compete with each other to generate the various types of mutations. The present study provides genetic and biochemical evidence that POLH and POLQ function in the same pathway in the generation of A/T mutations. POLH and POLQ are unable to functionally compensate for each other because the absence of each enzyme alone caused a decrease of A/T mutations. Therefore, they likely play distinct roles within the same genetic pathway. Previously, it has been shown that Ig gene somatic mutations at A/T correlated well with the spectrum of substitutions at A/T base pairs introduced by POLH (35Rogozin I.B. Pavlov Y.I"

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1 are two cytokines that induce inflammation through activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB.

Both TAB2 and TAB3 contain CUE, coiled-coil, and nuclear protein localization 4 zinc finger (NZF) domains. The NZF domains of TAB2/3 are critical for TAB2/3 to bind to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of other adaptor proteins, such as receptor-interacting protein and TRAF6, which are two signaling proteins essential for TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation, respectively. In a search for proteins containing NZF domains conserved with those of TAB2/3, we identified RBCK1, which has been shown to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in iron metabolism. Overexpression of RBCK1 negatively regulates TAB2/3-mediated and TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation, whereas knockdown of RBCK1 by RNA interference potentiates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. RBCK1 physically interacts with TAB2/3 and facilitates degradation of TAB2/3 through a proteasome-dependent process.

Stimulation of cells with TNF or IL-1Î² initiates a cascade of signaling events leading to activation of transcription factors NF-ÎºB and AP1 (activator protein 1) and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (1Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 2Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : re3Google Scholar).

Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). NF-ÎºB is sequestered in the cytoplasm and kept inactive in nonstimulated cells through binding to inhibitory IÎºB (inhibitor of ÎºB) proteins. Following stimulation with cytokines, infectious agents, or radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks, the IÎºB proteins are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and ultimately degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, which frees NF-ÎºB from IÎºB proteins to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of target genes (3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made during the past couple of decades in identifying molecular components involved in TNF- and IL-1-triggered NF-ÎºB activation pathways. Binding of TNF to TNFR-I leads to its trimerization and the recruitment of adaptor proteins, including TRADD, TRAF2, and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) (1Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). RIP is subsequently polyubiquitinated in a Lys48- or Lys63-linked manner, among which Lys63-linked ubiquitination of RIP is required for the recruitment and activation of TAK1 (TGF-Î²-activated kinase 1), a kinase associated with adapter proteins TAB2 (TAK1-binding protein 2) and TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein 3) (4Kanayama A.

The activated TAK1 subsequently activates downstream kinases IKKÎ± and IKKÎ², which phosphorylate IÎºB proteins, and leads to NF-ÎºB activation (6Hacker H. Karin M. Sci.

As described above, the adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 are critical intermediates for both TNF- and IL-1-induced activation of NF-ÎºB. TAB2 deficiency was embryonic lethal due to liver degeneration and apoptosis. However, TAB2-deficient cells were still capable of activating IKK and JNK in response to TNF, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide (22Sanjo H. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Akira S.

Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). TAB2 and TAB3 are structurally related, and both contain an N-terminal CUE domain and C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) and nuclear protein localization 4 (Npl4) zinc finger (NZF) domains (24Wang B.

TAB2 and TAB3 physically link TAK1 to RIP upon TNF stimulation and to TRAF6 upon IL-1Î² stimulation mainly through their respective NZF domains (4Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M.

Collectively, TNF stimulation leads to a RIP-TAB2/3-TAK1 complex, whereas IL-1 stimulation leads to the formation of a TRAF6-TAB2/3-TAK1 complex, both of which are critical for the signaling pathways leading to NF-ÎºB activation. In this study, we found that the NZF-containing protein RBCK1 (RBCC protein interacting with protein kinase C1) interacts with TAB2 and TAB3 and targets them for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Overexpression of RBCK1 inhibits TAB2/3-mediated and TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation, whereas knockdown of RBCK1 by RNAi potentiates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Our findings suggest that RBCK1 plays an inhibitory role in inflammatory signaling pathways. Reagents and AntibodiesâRecombinant TNF, IL-1Î², and IFN-Î³ were purchased from R&D Systems. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (M2) and HA epitopes and MGC132 (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ubiquitin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were purchased from the indicated manufacturers. Mouse anti-RBCK1, mouse anti-TAB2, and rabbit anti-TAK1 were raised against recombinant human full-length RBCK1, TAB2, and TAK1 proteins, respectively.

Approximately 20 h after transfection, luciferase assays were performed using a dual specific luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activities. All reporter gene assays were repeated at least three times. Data shown were average values Â± S.D. from one representative experiment. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisâTransient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation, as well as endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, were performed as described (27Shu H.B.

RNAi ExperimentsâDouble-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into the pSuper. Retro RNAi plasmid (Oligoengine Inc.). The following sequences were targeted for human RBCK1 cDNA: oligonucleotide 1, 5â²-GACCCCAGATTGCAAGGGA-3â²; oligonucleotide 2, 5â²-TGAGTTCACCTGCCCTGTG-3â²; oligonucleotide 3, 5â²-GGCCATCCATGAGCAGATG-3â²; oligonucleotide 4, 5â²-CTGCAAGGAGTATCAGGAG-3â²; oligonucleotide 5, 5â²-GGAGTATCAGGAGGACCTG-3â². RBCK1 Interacts with TAB2 and TAB3âPrevious studies have indicated that the CC domains of TAB2/3 are required for their ubiquitination and protein-protein interaction (23Ishitani T. Takaesu G.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas the NZF domains are critically involved in binding to polyubiquitin chains of RIP and TRAF6, which is key to TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation (4Kanayama A.

To further understand the roles of TAB2/3 in TNF- and IL-1-triggered NF-ÎºB activation pathways, we sought to identify proteins containing NZF domains similar to those of TAB2/3. Data base searches led to identification of RBCK1, also called HOIL-1 (28Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which contains an NZF domain at its N terminus (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, it contains an intermediate CC domain and a C-terminal RING-IBR region, also known as RBR (31Marin I. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or TRIAD domain (32van der Reijden B.A. Erpelinck-Verschueren C.A. Lowenberg B. Jansen J.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which contains two zinc finger domains and a cystine/histidine-rich motif in between (Fig. 1A). It has been shown that RING-IBR region-containing proteins are involved in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (31Marin I. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RBCK1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein and ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues in rat (33Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RBCK1 is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (34Tatematsu K. Yoshimoto N. Koyanagi T. Tokunaga C. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Yoshida M. Okajima T. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22937-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been reported that RBCK1 causes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of heme-oxidized IRP2 (iron regulatory protein-2) as an E3 ligase in iron metabolism (28Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y.

Since RBCK1 contains an NZF domain that is related to the NZF domains of TAB2 and TAB3, we examined whether it associates with TAB2 and TAB3 through homophilic interactions. We transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for HA-tagged TAB2 or TAB3 and FLAG-tagged RBCK1. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RBCK1 interacted with both TAB2 and TAB3 (Fig. 1C). To determine whether RBCK1 is associated with TAB2 and TAB3 under physiological conditions, we raised mouse polyclonal antiserum against recombinant human full-length RBCK1 and TAB2 (Fig. 1D). Anti-TAB2 also recognized TAB3 because of their structural similarity (data not shown). Endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RBCK1 was associated with TAB2/3 in untransfected 293 cells (Fig. 1E). To determine whether other proteins associated with TAB2 and TAB3 interact with RBCK1, we performed transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 1F, RBCK1 interacted with TAK1, TRAF6, and RIP but not TRAF2 and TAB1 in these experiments. Domain Mapping of the Interactions between RBCK1 and TAB2/3âIt has been reported that the interaction between TAB2/3 and TAK1 is dependent on their respective CC domains (19Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 23Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To determine which domain of RBCK1 facilitates its interaction with TAB2/3, we made a series of RBCK1 deletion mutants (Fig. 2A), including aa 1â220 (carrying NZF), aa 221â500 (carrying CC and RING-IBR), aa 1â270 (carrying NZF and CC), and aa 271â500 (carrying RING-IBR). Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that RBCK1 (aa 1â270) interacted with TAB2 as strongly as its full-length did, and RBCK1 (aa 1â220) and RBCK1 (aa 221â500) mutants interacted with TAB2 to a lesser extent compared with the full-length RBCK1 (Fig. 2B). In the same experiment, RBCK1 (aa 271â500) did not interact with TAB2 (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that the N terminus of RBCK1, which contains the NZF and CC domains, is essential for its interaction with TAB2. Similar results were obtained with TAB3 (data not shown). Similarly, we made a series of TAB2 deletion mutants and determined which domains of TAB2 are required for its interaction with RBCK1 (Fig. 2A). In transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, full-length TAB2, TAB2 (aa 55â693), and TAB2 (aa 361â693) interacted with RBCK1 efficiently (Fig. 2C). In the same experiments, TAB2 (aa 1â665) interacted with RBCK1 weakly, whereas TAB2 (aa 1â360) did not interact with RBCK1 (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that TAB2 interacts with RBCK1 through its C-terminal CC- and NZF-containing fragment. Similar results were obtained with TAB3 and its deletion mutants (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that the N terminus of RBCK1 and the C terminus of TAB2/3 are required for their interactions. RBCK1 Inhibits TAB2/3-mediated TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB ActivationâTAB2 and TAB3 are essential for TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation in a redundant way, and overexpression of TAB2 and TAB3 potently activates NF-ÎºB (19Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 23Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 35Jin G. Klika A. Callahan M. Faga B. Danzig J. Jiang Z. Li X. Stark G.R. Harrington J. Sherf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since RBCK1 was found to interact with TAB2 and TAB3, we next investigated the effect of RBCK1 on TAB2/3-mediated and TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Reporter gene assays indicated that RBCK1 inhibited TAB2- and TAB3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Moreover, RBCK1 inhibited TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. 3B) but did not affect IFN-Î³-mediated IRF-1 activation (Fig. 3C). We further determined which domains are responsible for the inhibitory effect of RBCK1 on TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. In reporter gene assays, RBCK1 (aa 221â500) inhibited TAB2- or TAB3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation as potently as the full-length RBCK did, RBCK1 (aa 1â270) and RBCK1 (aa 271â500) inhibited TAB2- or TAB3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation to a lesser degree, and RBCK1 (aa 1â220) had little inhibitory effect (Fig. 3D). Knockdown of RBCK1 Potentiates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB ActivationâSince RBCK1 inhibits TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation in overexpression experiments, we examined whether RBCK1 regulates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation under physiological condition. To test this, we made five RNAi plasmids targeting different sites of human RBCK1 mRNA. Transient transfection and Western blot analysis indicated that one of these RNAi plasmids (RBCK1-RNAi-4) could markedly inhibit the expression of transfected and endogenous RBCK1 in 293 cells, whereas the other RNAi plasmids had a little or no effect on RBCK1 expression (Fig. 4, A and B). In reporter gene assays, knockdown of RBCK1 by RBCK1-RNAi-4 plasmid activated NF-ÎºB activation and potentiated TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. 4, C and D). In similar experiments, knockdown of RBCK1 neither activated IRF-1 nor potentiated IFN-Î³-induced IRF-1 activation (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these data suggest that RBCK1 is a physiological inhibitor of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation pathways. RBCK1 Reduces TAB2/3 Protein Level in a Proteasome-dependent MannerâSince RBCK1 interacts with TAB2/3 and inhibits TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for this observation. Previously, it has been shown that RBCK1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and involved in proteasome-dependent protein degradation in iron metabolism (28Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether RBCK1 could cause ubiquitination and degradation of TAB2 and TAB3. We transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for TAB2 and TAK1 together with RBCK1 or its deletion mutants. Western blot analysis indicated that overexpression of RBCK1 caused down-regulation of TAB2 but not TAK1. In addition, RBCK1 (aa 221â500) and RBCK1 (aa 271â500) caused down-regulation of TAB2 but not TAK1, whereas RBCK1 (aa 1â220) and RBCK1 (aa 1â270) had no significant effect on TAB2 protein level (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained for TAB3 (data not shown). These results suggest that RBCK1 inhibits TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation through degradation of TAB2/3. To determine whether the reduction of TAB2/3 protein levels by RBCK1 is dependent on ubiquitination, we transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for HA-TAB2 and FLAG-ubiquitin, in combination with empty control plasmid or full-length RBCK1. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated that RBCK1 significantly increased ubiquitination of TAB2 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the addition of MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, rescued TAB2 from RBCK1-mediated degradation (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these observations suggest that RBCK1 negatively regulates TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by causing ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of TAB2/3. Inflammation is a homeostatic mechanism that limits the effects of infectious agents. TNF and IL-1 are two proinflammatory cytokines, which induce inflammation through activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB. In this study, we identified RBCK1 as a negative regulator of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Various studies have indicated that two homologous and structurally related adapter proteins TAB2 and TAB3 play redundant roles in TNF- and IL-1-mediated NF-ÎºB activation pathways. TAB2 and TAB3 are associated with TAK1, and these protein complexes are recruited to RIP upon TNF stimulation and to TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation (4Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M.

Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both TAB2 and TAB3 contain CUE, CC, and NZF domains. Among them, NZF domain is highly conserved, and the intact NZF domain is critical for TAB2/3 to bind to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains of other adaptor proteins, such as RIP and TRAF6, which are two signaling proteins essential for TNF- and IL-1-induced IKK activation, respectively (4Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In a search for proteins containing NZF domains conserved with those of TAB2/3, we identified RBCK1, which has been shown to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in iron metabolism (28Yamanaka K. Ishikawa H. Megumi Y. Tokunaga F. Kanie M. Rouault T.A. Morishima I. Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Besides an NZF domain, RBCK1 contains a CC motif and a RING-IBR region, indicating that RBCK1 might be multifunctional through association with other proteins. Our coimmunoprecipitation results suggest that RBCK1 interacts with TAB2 and TAB3 both in the mammalian overexpression system and in untransfected cells (Fig. 1, CâE). In addition, RBCK1 interacts with TAK1, TRAF6, and RIP, signaling components that are associated with TAB2/3 (Fig. 1, CâF). These findings suggest that RBCK1 is physically associated with TAB2/3-containing protein complexes. In reporter gene assays, overexpression of RBCK1 inhibits TAB2/3-mediated and TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas knockdown of RBCK1 by RNAi potentiates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that RBCK1 is a physiological suppressor of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation pathways. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the RING-IBR domain exerts E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is involved in proteasome-dependent protein degradation (31Marin I. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the RING-IBR domain is essential for RBCK1 to confer its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of TAB2/3 (Fig. 5). Consistently, the RBCK1 mutants that contain the CC and RING-IBR domain also inhibit TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. Furthermore, it has been reported that TAB2/3 are modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination upon stimulation, which seems to be required for their adaptor functions (23Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the following model of the role of RBCK1 in TNF- and IL-1-induced signaling. In this model, RBCK1, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is associated with TAB2/3 through their respective CC and NZF domains. This association causes TAB2/3 ubiquitination and degradation and therefore negatively regulates TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Further research could be done to find out the exact mechanism by which RBCK1 exerts the degradation of TAB2/3 in quiescent cells or stimulated cells, if the efficient experimental system is available. Domain mapping experiments suggest that the N-terminal CC- and NZF-containing fragment of RBCK1 (aa 1â270) and the C-terminal CC- and NZF-containing fragment of TAB2 (aa 361â693) are responsible for their interactions (Fig. 2), whereas the C-terminal RING-IBR domain of RBCK1 (aa 271â500) is responsible for catalyzing the ubiquitination of TAB2 (Fig. 5). In our experiments, RBCK1 (aa 221â500) interacts with TAB2/3 weakly but can still efficiently inhibit TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation. The simplest explanation for this observation is that the concentration of overexpressed RBCK1 (aa 221â500) is high, and a tight interaction between RBCK1 (aa 221â500) and TAB2/3 is not required for RBCK1 (aa 221â500)-mediated ubiquitination of TAB2/3. This is further supported by the observation that RBCK1 (aa 271â500) could also inhibit TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation, although to a lesser degree compared with RBCK1 (aa 221â500) (Fig. 3). In reporter assays, RBCK1 (aa 1â270) also inhibited TAB2/3-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (Fig. 3). Although we do not know the exact mechanism behind this observation, one possible explanation is that RBCK1 (aa 1â270) blocks recruitment of other signaling components in the NF-ÎºB activation pathways to TAB2/3. Host inflammatory responses must be strictly controlled by a variety of negative regulators, because hyperactivation of inflammatory pathways is usually harmful. So far, a number of suppressors of inflammatory signaling have been identified. For example, IRAK-M, a homolog of IRAK1 that is induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation after 24 h, interacts with MyD88 to negatively regulate its signaling to TRAF6 (36Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D.

The inhibitory factors alleviate the inflammatory responses, thereby preventing the host from mounting extraordinary inflammatory responses. The identification of RBCK1 as a novel inhibitor of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation pathways provides an additional target and approach for controlling inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2016199934,"Telomere 3' overhang-specific DNA oligonucleotides (T-oligos) induce cell death in cancer cells, presumably by mimicking telomere loop disruption. Therefore, T-oligos are considered an exciting new therapeutic strategy. The purpose of this study was to elucidate how T-oligos exert antitumor effects on human malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that T-oligos inhibited the proliferation of malignant glioma cells through induction of nonapoptotic cell death and mitochondria hyperpolarization, whereas normal astrocytes were resistant to T-oligos. Tumor cells treated with T-oligos developed features compatible with autophagy, with development of autophagic vacuoles and conversion of an autophagy-related protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 from type I (cytoplasmic form) to type II (membrane form of autophagic vacuoles). A reverse-phase protein microarray analysis and Western blotting revealed that treatment with T-oligos inhibited the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Moreover, pretreatment with T-oligos significantly prolonged the survival time of mice inoculated intracranially with malignant glioma cells compared with that of untreated mice and those treated with control oligonucleotides (P=0.0065 and P=0.043, respectively). These results indicate that T-oligos stimulate the induction of nonapoptotic autophagic also known as type II programmed cell death and are thus promising in the treatment of malignant glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2114065647,"CD97, the archetypal member of the EGF-TM7 protein family, is constitutively expressed on granulocytes and monocytes and rapidly up-regulated on T and B cells following activation. The key isoform of CD97 expressed on leukocytes binds the complement regulatory protein CD55 (also termed decay-accelerating factor). CD97 has been shown recently to mediate co-stimulation of T cells via CD55. Here, we demonstrate that blocking the interaction between CD55 on monocytes and CD97 on T cells leads to inhibition of proliferation and interferon-Î³ secretion. This implies that bidirectional interactions between CD97 and CD55 are involved in T cell regulation. Structural studies presented here reveal the molecular basis for this activity. We have solved the structure of EMR2, a very close homolog of CD97, using x-ray crystallography. NMR-based chemical shift mapping of the EMR2-CD55 interaction has allowed us to generate a model for the CD97-CD55 complex. The structure of the complex reveals that the T cell and complement regulatory activities of CD55 occur on opposite faces of the molecule. This suggests that CD55 might simultaneously regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses, and we have shown that CD55 can still regulate complement when bound to CD97."
https://openalex.org/W2005021452,"The induction of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis by insulin is mediated in part by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). SREBP-1c is directly regulated by insulin by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Previously, we have demonstrated that the insulin-responsive cis-acting unit of the rat SREBP-1c promoter is composed of several elements that include a sterol regulatory element, two liver X receptor elements, and a number of conserved GC boxes. Here we systematically dissected the role of these GC boxes and report that five <i>bona fide</i> Sp1-binding elements of the SREBP-1c promoter determine its basal and insulin-induced activation. Luciferase expression driven by the rat SREBP-1c promoter was accelerated by ectopic expression of Sp1, and insulin further enhanced the transactivation potential of Sp1. Introduction of a small interfering RNA against Sp1 reduced both basal and insulin-induced activation of the SREBP-1c promoter. We also found that Sp1 interacted with both SREBP-1c and LXRÎ± proteins and that insulin promoted these interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that insulin facilitated the recruitment of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 to the SREBP-1c promoter. These studies identify a novel mechanism by which maximal activation of the rat SREBP-1c gene expression by insulin is mediated by Sp1 and its enhanced ability to interact with other transcriptional regulatory proteins."

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Systemin and AtPep1 are processed from larger precursor proteins that lack leader peptide sequences, and systemin is known to be synthesized and stored in the cytoplasm (9Narvaez-Vasquez J. Ryan C.A. Planta. 2004; 218: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both systemin and AtPep1 have been shown to interact with cell surface leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases in plasma membranes (10Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9585-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Yamaguchi Y. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides in tobacco and tomato leaves (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol.

The rapid medium alkalinization responses of the hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides in suspension-cultured cells at low nanomolar concentrations (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a response common in response to peptide ligands, suggest that the activities of the peptides are receptor-mediated. Because of the similarities to systemins in size, proline/hydroxyproline-rich compositions, and their powerful biological activities in activating expression of defensive genes, the hydroxyproline-rich glyco-peptides have been included in a functionally defined systemin subfamily called HypSys peptides (4Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Lennarz W. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. Vol. 3. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2004: 381-384Crossref Google Scholar). HypSys defense peptides were initially discovered when investigating systemic wound signaling in tobacco plants. Tobacco plants lack a prosystemin gene, and therefore systemin, but still can systemically activate a tobacco trypsin inhibitor gene in leaves in response to wounding (13Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In seeking the systemic signal, two hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides of 18 amino acids were isolated from tobacco leaf extracts and shown to be inducers of tobacco trypsin inhibitor activity when supplied to tobacco leaves through their cut petioles at a concentration of less than 2 pmol/plant (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both peptides are derived from a single hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein of 165 amino acids, called Nicotiana tabacum proHypSys (NtproHypSys). The expression of the precursor gene NtpreproHypSys is inducible by NtHypSys peptides, methyl jasmonate, wounding, and elicitors (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Rocha-Granados M.C. Sanchez-Hernandez C. Sanchez-Hernandez C. Martinez-Gallardo N.A. Ochoa-Alejo N. Delano-Frier J. Planta. 2005; 222: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The gene is strongly induced during attacks by Manduca sexta larvae and adult white flies (Bemisia tabaci) (14Rocha-Granados M.C. Sanchez-Hernandez C. Sanchez-Hernandez C. Martinez-Gallardo N.A. Ochoa-Alejo N. Delano-Frier J. Planta. 2005; 222: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing NtpreproHypSys under control of the 35S promoter have enhanced resistance toward Helicoverpa armigera larvae (15Ren F. Yu Y.-T. Plant Sci. 2006; 117: 286-292Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that constitutive processing of the NtproHypSys precursor protein occurs in the transgenic plants in the absence of wounding, similar to tomato plants overexpressing prosystemin (16McGurl B. Pearce G. Orozco-Cardenas M. Ryan C.A. Science. 1992; 255: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). An ortholog of NtpreproHypSys in tomato leaves, called LepreproHypSys (6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), encodes a protein precursor of 146 amino acids in which three hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides are harbored. The three peptides have been isolated from tomato leaves and shown to be powerful inducers of the synthesis of protease inhibitors I and II in leaves when supplied through cut petioles (6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). LepreproHypSys is expressed in leaves in response to methyl jasmonate vapors, to wounding, and by supplying young tomato plants with the three LeHypSys peptides through their cut stems at low nanomolar concentrations. In seeking HypSys peptides in leaves of other Solanaceae species, we have isolated two genes from petunia (Petunia hybrida) and called them PhpreproHypSys I and II. The genes are orthologs of NtpreproHypSys and LeproproHypSys. Three PhHypSys peptides were isolated from petunia leaf extracts that were encoded by PhpreproHypSys I, but no peptides encoded by PhpreproHypSys II were found during the isolations. The three PhHypSys peptides were named I, II, and III. In contrast to the tobacco and tomato HypSys peptides, the PhHypSys peptides induce neither anti-herbivore protease inhibitor activity in leaves nor polyphenol oxidase activity, but the peptides did activate the expression of defensin 1, a gene associated with inducible defense of plants against pathogens (17Lay F.T. Anderson M.A. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Menezes H. Jared C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol.

The data presented here support the roles of endogenous plant defense-signaling peptides from different plant species as amplifiers of the defense signaling pathways for inducible defense genes that have evolved in their unique ecological niches. Peptide AssaysâPetunia suspension cells utilized for the alkalinization assay were maintained as previously described (8Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), and the medium was adjusted to pH 5.6 with KOH. Cultures were maintained by transferring 3 ml of cells to 45 ml of media every 7 days and were assayed 3â5 days after transfer. Cultured cells were continually shaken at 160 rpm at all times. One hour before assaying for alkalinating activity, 1 ml of cells was aliquoted into each well of 24-well cell culture cluster plates and allowed to equilibrate on a flat bed shaker. Aliquots from HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription. fractions or from solutions of purified peptides (1â10 Î¼l) were added to the cells, and the pH was monitored for 20 min. Petunia plants used for protease inhibitor and polyphenol oxidase assays were grown in chambers under 17 h of light (300 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) at 28 Â°C and 7 h of darkness at 17 Â°C. Peptides were supplied to excised plants through their cut stems for 1 h, and the plants were placed in 20-ml vials containing distilled water and incubated in closed plexiglass boxes for 24 h at 200 microeinsteins m-2 s-1 before crushing the leaves with a mortar and pestle to express juice for protease inhibitor protein (13Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and polyphenolase activity assays (20Howe G.A. Ryan C.A. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide IsolationâFour-week-old petunia plants, before onset of flowering, were sprayed with methyl jasmonate as previously described (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). After 15 h, the leaves were collected (10 kg), ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -20 Â°C. Frozen leaves (â¼1 kg) were homogenized in a 4-liter blender for 2 min using 2.4 liters of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the leaf juice was expressed through four layers of cheesecloth and allowed to filter through a layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem). The liquid was centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 20 min. The acidic supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 10 n NaOH and recentrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 20 min. After readjusting the supernatant to a pH of 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid, the clear solution was applied to a3 Ã 25-cm, 40 Î¼m, C18 reversed phase flash column (Bondesil, Varian Analytical Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O. Elution was performed at 8 p.s.i. with compressed nitrogen gas. After loading, the column was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O, followed by 250 ml of 40% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to elute peptides. Methanol was removed using a rotary evaporator, and the remaining liquid was lyophilized to dryness. The dry weight yield from 10 consecutive extractions was 7.8 g. The dry powder was dissolved in 30 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O, centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min and applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (4 Ã 40 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O in three sequential runs (10 ml each). Eight-ml fractions were collected, and the alkalinization activity was assayed as described above using 10 Î¼l of each fraction/ml of cells. The activity was found primarily in fractions eluting at 1â1.5 void volumes, which were pooled and lyophilized. The dry powder (150 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and after centrifugation and filtration, two 2.5-ml aliquots were separately chromatographed on a C18-HPLC preparative column (218TP1022, 10 Î¼m, 22 Ã 250 mm; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. After 5 min, a gradient was applied from 0 to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 90 min. The absorbance was monitored at 225 nm. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and 10-Î¼l aliquots were analyzed for alkalinating activity. Three major peaks of activity were detected, and fractions 42â46 (peak 1), fractions 49â52 (peak 2), and fractions 54â55 (peak 3) were each pooled separately and lyophilized. The yields were 56, 40, and 10 mg, respectively. The alkalinating activity peaks were subjected to strong cation exchange chromatography on a poly-SULPHOETHYL Aspartamide column (5 Î¼m, 4.6 Ã 200 mm; The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). The column was equilibrated in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile, and, after dissolving and centrifuging, each peak was loaded onto the column in 1-ml aliquots, and after 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied to 100% elution buffer, consisting of 5 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm potassium chloride, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile. Absorbance was monitored at 225 nm. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was employed, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Aliquots of 5 Î¼l from each fraction were used for alkalinization assays. Peak 1 eluted in fractions 53â55, peak 2 in fractions 42â44, and peak 3 in fractions 56â59. Fractions of each peak were pooled, lyophilized, and further purified by reversed phase C18 chromatography at pH 6 (column 218TP54, 5 Î¼m, 4.6 Ã 250 mm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The dried material was dissolved in 1 ml of column equilibration buffer, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and, after centrifugation, the clear supernatant was applied to the column with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied from 0 to 40%, consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, in 50% acetonitrile. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm, and aliquots of 5 Î¼l were used to determine alkalinating activity. Peak 1 was identified in fractions 37â39, peak 2 in fractions 49â51, and peak 3 in fractions 54â58. Each peak was pooled and lyophilized for further purification. The lyophilized peaks were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O and centrifuged, and the supernatants were loaded onto a narrow bore C18 column (218TP52; 5 Î¼m, 2.1 Ã 250 mm; Vydac) and eluted with methanol/trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied from 0 to 60% methanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Alkalinating activity was determined with 2 Î¼l of each eluted fraction. Peak 1 eluted in fractions 61â63, peak 2 in fractions 62â64, and peak 3 in fractions 63â66. As a final purification step and to quantify the material in each of the three peaks, the same narrow bore reversed phase C18-HPLC column employed above was utilized with an acetonitrile gradient. The fractions containing Peaks 1â3 were pooled, methanol was removed with a SpeedVac concentrator, and the remaining solution was loaded onto the column. After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied from 0 to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Alkalinating activity was assayed after adding 1 Î¼l of each fraction to 1 ml of petunia cells. The activity eluted in fractions 48â49 for peak 1, 53â54 for peak 2, and 61â63 for peak 3. The peaks were quantified by comparing peak areas relative to known quantities of synthetic tobacco HypSys I and II. The yield for peak 1 was 100 pmol, peak 2 was 96 pmol, and peak 3 was 470 pmol. Peptide Analysis and SynthesisâAmino-terminal sequencing was performed using Edman chemistry on a Procise model 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization spectra were obtained using a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framington, MA) Voyager time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Î±-Cyano-4-hyroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) was used as the matrix. Peptide synthesis was performed as described (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate contents were estimated from the changes in mass of each peptide after mild acid hydrolysis. cDNA IsolationâThe cDNAs that were previously isolated from tobacco and tomato each contain a 30-nucleotide region overlapping the processing site of the leader peptide. From these sequences, a consensus, degenerative oligonucleotide primer, 5â²-GGAGCTNAAGCAAGAACTTTRCTAGNAAAT-3â² (where N represents G/C/T/A, and R is G/A), was synthesized for 3â² RT-PCR (Ambion, Austin, TX) to seek orthologs of the two genes in petunia. A product was produced that was subsequently cloned by TOPO methodology (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was found to have homology to regions in tomato and tobacco HypSys precursor proteins. To obtain the complete nucleotide sequence, 5â² RT-PCR was performed using the reverse complement of an internal sequence that overlapped the 3â² RT-PCR product by 210 bp. The sequences of the three peptides isolated from petunia leaf extracts did not match the coding sequence of the isolated cDNA. Therefore, a degenerative primer deduced from the peptide sequence of Peak 2, GRHDYHL(P/S)PP, was synthesized for use in RT-PCR to seek the cDNA that coded for the peptides. The reverse complement primer 5â²-WGGWGGWGGNARRTGRTARTCRTGYCTNCC-3â² (where W represents A/T, N is A/C/G/T, R is A/G, and Y is C/T) was employed. A fragment was amplified and sequenced and contained a potential HypSys. A second RT-PCR search was performed using a primer to the nucleotides coding for the potential HypSys peptide fragment SSP-PPSDF with the reverse complement primer of 5â²-AATCACTTGGTGGAGATGATGA-3â². The 3â²-end of the sequence was obtained by synthesizing a primer, 5â²-GGAGCTGAAGCAAGATCTTTGC-3â², from within the region contained in the degenerative 30-mer (Fig. 1B) with all of the correct bases using 3â²-rapid amplification of cDNA ends RT-PCR. This resulted in the complete sequence of a cDNA that encoded the sequence of the peptides isolated from Peaks 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Identification and isolation of bioactive peptides in extracts from petunia leaves.

Doyle J.L. Phytochem. Bull. 1987; 19: 11-15Google Scholar). DNA samples were restriction-digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and XbaI, size-fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and Southern blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled specific probes. Expression AnalysesâThree-week-old plants having 6â8 expanded leaves were analyzed for expression levels of the two genes. The lower leaves of petunia plants were wounded with a hemostat across the midvein. Expression of the genes in both wounded and upper unwounded leaves was assayed by blot analyses with RNA collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h following the injury. At the time of collection, the leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle, and stored at -80 Â°C. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 15 Î¼g of each sample was separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted on Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled specific probes at 65 Â°C. Following hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min each at 55 Â°C, followed by two washes each with 0.5Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min and two washes with 0.1Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min each at 65 Â°C. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film from 4 to 24 h at -80 Â°C. MeJA TreatmentâThree-week-old plants were sprayed with a solution of 125 Î¼l of MeJA in 500 ml of double-distilled water containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The leaf samples were collected for assays at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after spraying and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 Â°C. Isolation of PhpreproHypSys I and II cDNAsâA consensus sequence derived from a highly conserved region of 30 nucleotides within the coding regions of NtpreproHypSys (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and LepreproHypSys (6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) was used to synthesize a primer for RT-PCR to search for an ortholog in petunia (Fig. 1B). Two cDNAs were isolated that encoded proteins of 214 and 207 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The gene coding for the 214-amino acid protein, called PhpreproHypSys I, exhibited 34.2% identity with the tomato HypSys precursor and 24.7% identity with the tobacco precursor, whereas the gene coding for the 207-amino acid protein, called PhpreproHypSys II, exhibited 42.7% identity with the tobacco HypSys precursor and 20.8% identity with the tomato precursors. The deduced proteins from both genes contained leader sequences as well as internal regions of 18â21 amino acids that were rich in proline and serine residues resembling the regions in the tobacco and tomato precursor proteins from which the HypSys peptides of tobacco and tomato were derived. Isolation and Characterization of Bioactive Petunia Leaf Hydroxyproline-rich GlycopeptidesâExtracts were prepared from petunia leaves using protocols that led to the isolations and purifications of HypSys peptides from tobacco and tomato leaves (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Column fractions from purification steps were assayed using the alkalinization response of suspension-cultured petunia cells (cf. âExperimental Proceduresâ). Three bioactive peaks were identified (Fig. 3A) and purified to apparent homogeneity, and their amino acid sequences and molecular masses (Fig. 3B) indicated that all three peptides were encoded in the PhpreproHypSys I gene (Figs. 2A and 3C). Peak 2 contained two isoforms that were identical except at residue 7, which was a serine in one isoform and a proline in the other. Commercial Petunia hybrida varieties are tetraploid, and the isoforms are a common result of polyploidy. The isoform containing the serine at residue 7 is the HypSys peptide encoded in PhpreproHypSys I (Fig. 2). The purified peptides had identical biological activities when assayed in the alkalinization assay at low nanomolar concentrations. Peptides 1 and 2 contained 10 pentose units and one hexose unit, determined using mass spectrometric analyses, whereas peptide 3 contained 3â6 pentose units and no hexose, which may account for the broad peak 3 (Fig. 3B). The three peptides, because of their similarities in sizes, their hydroxyproline-rich regions, and being derived from an ortholog of tobacco and tomato HypSys precursors, were named PhHypSys I, II, and III. In Fig. 4, the amino acid sequences of HypSys peptides from petunia are compared with HypSys peptides from tobacco and tomato. The fourth putative peptide identified in the petunia precursor protein (cf. Fig. 2A, residues 41â59) is enriched in serine and proline residues and was tentatively named PhHypSys IV; it is not shown, since no peptide matching this sequence was detected during the purification of HypSys peptides. Additionally, no HypSys peptides were detected that matched any sequences in PhpreproHypSys II. Expression Analyses of PhpreproHypSys I and PhpreproHypSys IIâTo analyze wound inducibility of the two genes, 3-week-old petunia plants were wounded with a hemostat across the midveins of the sixth to eighth leaves from the apex, total RNA was extracted from both the wounded leaves and upper unwounded leaves, and transcript levels were assayed over time by gel blot analyses using oligonucleotide probes specific for each gene. PhpreproHypSys I mRNA was wound-inducible and peaked in lower wounded leaves within 4 h and in upper unwounded leaves at about 6 h (Fig. 5A). The time course expression of PhpreproHypSys II was different, being constitutively expressed in leaves of unwounded plants and not increased in response to wounding, either in wounded leaves or in upper unwounded leaves (Fig. 5A). PhpreproHypSys I was rapidly and strongly induced by MeJA within 1 h, but PhpreproHypSys II expression gradually increased over the 6-h duration of the experiments (Fig. 5B). In young tomato plants, protease inhibitor and polyphenol oxidase activities increase in response to wounding and exposure to MeJa vapors. Therefore, protease inhibitor and polyphenol oxidase activities were assayed in petunia leaves in response to wounding and MeJA. These assays were also performed in leaves in response to PhHypSys peptides, supplied through their cut petioles. We found no evidence for an increase in protease inhibitor activities or polyphenol oxidase activity in any of these experiments (data not shown). We therefore considered the possibility that the HypSys peptides may be activating defense genes against pathogens, such as defensin 1, rather than against herbivores, as we had recently found with AtPep1 and homologs in Arabidopsis (7Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To determine if wounding petunia leaves would induce the expression of defensin 1, leaves of young plants were wounded, and the expression of defensin 1 was assayed in leaf RNA using RT-PCR at 0, 4, 12, and 24 h. In Fig. 6, the expression of the gene is shown to increase through 4â12 h and then decrease by 24 h. Petunia leaves were supplied through the cut petioles with 8 pmol of PhHypSys I, II, and III, and increases in the expression of defensin 1, a component of the innate immune response in plants (17Lay F.T. Anderson M.A. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 19Thomma G.P.H.J. Cammue P.P.A. Thevissen K. Planta. 2002; 216: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), was assayed in leaf extracts 4 h later. defensin 1 was expressed in response to all three of the peptides (Fig. 7A), indicating that the peptides, as with wounding, were activating the defensin 1 gene. PhHypSys I, II, and III were chemically synthesized but lacking the carbohydrate residues found in the native peptides, and they were assayed for their abilities to cause an alkalinization response. The synthetic peptides were active at micromolar concentrations rather that at nanomolar concentrations as found with the native peptides, indicating the importance of the carbohydrates to bioactivity. Supplying the synthetic peptides to leaves through their cut petioles at 25 nmol/leaf resulted in the expression of defensin I within 2 h (Fig. 7B). HypSys peptides in tobacco (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and tomato (6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) leaves are powerful inducers of anti-herbivore defense genes. The isolation of these peptides and their precursor genes prompted a search for similar peptides and genes in leaves of other Solanaceae species. A petunia (Petunia hybrida) HypSys precursor gene was sought using RT-PCR with mRNA from leaves of plants treated with MeJA 15 h before harvesting (MeJA induces the expression of HypSys precursor genes in tobacco and tomato leaves). An oligonucleotide primer with a consensus sequence based on a highly conserved 30-bp region found in tomato and tobacco preproHypSys genes (Fig. 1) successfully identified two petunia leaf cDNAs encoding proteins homologous to the tobacco and tomato HypSys precursors (Fig. 2, A and B). The precursor genes were named PhpreproHypSys I and PhpreproHypSys II, consistent with the tobacco and tomato precursor genes (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the two proteins contained 214 and 207 amino acids, respectively, that included four proline-rich regions flanked by charged residues (Fig. 2, A and B). Three of the four regions were identical to peptides isolated from a petunia leaf extract from PhpreproHypSys I (Fig. 3, A and B). Proline residues of the purified peptides were post-translationally modified with hydroxyl and glycosyl groups (Fig. 3C), consistent with the HypSys peptides characterized from tobacco and tomato leaves The three peptides were named PhHypSys I, II, and III, although the fourth encoded peptide (Fig. 2A, residues 41â59), which was not isolated, was named PhHypSys IV. If this peptide is found, then the precursor will be the first example of a plant polyprotein that produces more than three bioactive peptides. No peptides were purified that were encoded by PhpreproHypSys II. The amino acid sequences of the three HypSys peptides from petunia are compared in Fig. 4 with those of tobacco and tomato. All of the peptides contain a region of 2â4 hydroxyproline-rich residues with a consensus sequence of X(P)2â4Y, where X represents Thr, Ser, or Pro and Y is Lys, Thr, Ser, or Ala. The consensus sequence is flanked in each peptide by charged amino acids (Fig. 4). Hydroxyproline-rich sequences are typically found to exist in polyproline II conformations that are composed of imino acids that form Î²-helices (or kinks) in proteins and peptides (22Reiersen H. Rees A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 679-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Rath A. Davidson A.R. Deber C.M.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Polyproline II structures have been associated with peptide hormone-receptor recognition and with other protein-protein interactions (25Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In addition to the hydroxyproline-rich motifs, each peptide contains several carbohydrate residues, mainly pentoses, that may contribute to the conformations required for receptor recognition. While cell surface leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases have been isolated for the systemin and AtPep1 peptides, a receptor for a HypSys peptide has not yet been identified. The PhproHypSys peptide precursor protein, deduced from the PhpreproHypSys I sequence, is initially synthesized with a leader sequence and is presumed to be synthesized through the secretory pathway, where post-translational hydroxylations and glycosylations occur. A pSORT program (26Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) analysis suggests that the nascent PhproHypSys I is sequestered in the cell wall, similar to the LeproHypSys protein (12NarvaÃ©ez-VaÃ©squez J. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12974-12977Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The three PhHypSys peptides derived from the precursor contain N-terminal Arg residues that are part of a GR motif that may be a component of the processing site (Fig. 2A). GR residues are also found in the LeproHypSys precursor at the N termini processing sites of the three tomato HypSys peptides and at the N terminus of one of the two tobacco HypSys peptides (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The GR motif is a strong candidate for being part of the recognition sequence for a processing enzyme, and the loss of the Gly at the N termini in several HypSys peptides suggests that an exopeptidase may trim the N termini. Each of the petunia peptides terminates in a Gln residue, as do two of the three tomato HypSys peptides (Fig. 4), but in the two tobacco precursor proteins (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), no Gln residues are found near the C termini. PhpreproHypSys I is expressed in petunia leaves in response to wounding (Fig. 5A) in both the wounded leaves and in the upper unwounded leaves (Fig. 5A). This systemic wound response is similar to that found with prosystemin (16McGurl B. Pearce G. Orozco-Cardenas M. Ryan C.A. Science. 1992; 255: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), NtpreproHypSys (5Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and LepreproHypSys (6Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, PhpreproHypSys II is constitutively expressed in leaves and does not increase in response to wounding. PhpreproHypSys I is strongly expressed in response to MeJA, whereas PhpreproHypSys II expression increases slowly with time (Fig. 5A). Further investigations of the tissue- and cell-specific localization of PhpreproHypSys II expression and its encoded protein and peptides may reveal the role of this gene in petunia plants. Our finding that the PhHypSys peptides activated expression of defensin 1, an inducible defense protein, supports the proposal that the roles of plant peptide defense signals are to amplify signaling pathways that regulate diverse defense responses against predators and/or pathogens (27Ryan C.A. Moura D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6519-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Ryan C.A. Biochem. Biophys.

HO-1 enzymatic activity results in the formation of the cytoprotective metabolites CO and biliverdin. In the skin, HO-1 is strongly induced after long wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA-1). Here we show that UVA-1 irradiation generates oxidized phospholipids derived from 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC) that mediate the expression of HO-1 in skin cells. Using EO6 antibodies that recognize oxidized phospholipids, we show that UVA-1 irradiation of dermal fibroblasts generates oxidation-specific epitopes.

In addition, we demonstrate that the oxidation of PAPC by UVA-1 is a singlet oxygen-dependent mechanism. Together, we present a novel mechanism of UVA-1-induced HO-1 expression that is mediated by the generation of biologically active phospholipid oxidation products.

Evidence suggests that the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) by UVA-1 (340â390 nm) and subsequent oxidation of intracellular membrane lipids (4Basu-Modak S. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4505-4510PubMed Google Scholar, 5Basu-Modak S. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) are involved in this process. However, neither the mechanisms nor the structures of responsible lipid oxidation products have been described so far. HO-1 plays a general role in cutaneous wound repair, and the resolution of inflammation is strongly up-regulated after skin injury and declines to basal levels after completion of wound healing (6Hanselmann C. Mauch C. Werner S. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HO-1 converts free heme and heme moieties of proteins to carbon monoxide, iron, and biliverdin, which is rapidly converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. CO and bilirubin have well described antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (7Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 8Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234â235: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), suggesting that induction of HO-1 is a general mechanism that protects the cell against oxidative damage. Accordingly, the adaptive response of skin fibroblasts after repeated UVA irradiation, which protects them against further membrane damage, is mediated by induction of HO-1 (9Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2607-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC) is a major component of cell membranes and lipoproteins. Its oxidation products are found in cells during inflammation (10Subbanagounder G. Wong J.W. Lee H. Faull K.F. Miller E. Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7271-7281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), in membranes of apoptotic cells (11Huber J. Vales A. Mitulovic G. Blumer M. Schmid R. Witztum J.L. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), as well as in oxidized low density lipoprotein (12Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Polyunsaturated fatty acyl residues at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone, such as the arachidonoyl moiety in PAPC, are especially prone to oxidative modification. Thus, the oxidation of PAPC (OxPAPC) leads to the addition of oxygen atoms as well as to fragmentation of the arachidonate moiety. The type of oxidative modification determines the biological activity of these oxidized phospholipids (13Furnkranz A. Leitinger N. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). OxPAPC was shown to induce HO-1 expression in several cell types of the vasculature and the immune system (14Ishikawa K. Navab M. Leitinger N. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Here we report that photooxidation of PAPC or irradiation of skin cells results in formation of biologically active lipid oxidation products that induce HO-1 expression. Using mass spectrometry and EO6 antibodies that detect oxidation products of PAPC, we identify epoxyisoprostane-phosphatidylcholine, a known inducer of HO-1, among these oxidation products, and demonstrate their intracellular formation. Because UVA-1 phototherapy is successfully used for treatment of inflammatory skin diseases (15Mang R. Krutmann J. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2005; 21: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), identification of UV-generated biomolecules with protective effects will lead to the development of novel drugs that could be used to substitute for UVA-1 phototherapy. Cell CultureâNeonatal human epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) derived from foreskin were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Keratinocytes were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium up to the fifth passage. Human neonatal skin fibroblasts (FB) were obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (1000 units/ml; Invitrogen) to subconfluence. Skin EquivalentsâIn vitro reconstructed skin equivalents were generated as described previously (16Rendl M. Ban J. Mrass P. Mayer C. Lengauer B. Eckhart L. Declerq W. Tschachler E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1150-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.3 Ã 106 KCs were added on top of a collagen gel containing fibroblasts. After overnight incubation, the medium from the upper chamber was removed, thus putting the KC at air-liquid interface. Afterward, skin equivalents were cultured in serum-free KC-defined medium, which is KC growth medium without bovine pituitary extract, supplemented with 1.3 mm calcium, 10 Î¼g/ml transferrin, 50 Î¼g/ml ascorbic acid, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)âRNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 900 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and oligo(dT) primers. The following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were used: HO-1: F, 5â²-AAGATTGCCCAGAAAGCCCTGGAC-3â²; R, 5â²-AACTGTCGCCACCAGAAAGCTGAG-3â²; Î²2-microglobulin; F, 5â²-GATGAGTATGCCTGCCGTGTG-3â²; and R, 5â²-CAATCCAAATGCGGCATCT-3â². qPCR was performed using LightCycler technology and the Fast Start SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). In all assays, cDNA was amplified using a standardized program (10-min denaturing step; 55 cycles of 5 s at 95Â°C, 15 s at 65Â°C, and 15 s at 72 Â°C; melting point analysis in 0.1 Â°C steps). Quantification of target gene expression was performed using a mathematical model by Pfaffl (17Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). The expression of the target molecule was normalized to the expression of Î²2-microglobulin. Western Blot AnalysisâBound HO-1 antibodies (SPA-896; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) were detected by anti-IgG conjugated with peroxidase and subsequent chemiluminescent detection. UV IrradiationâUV irradiation was carried out as described previously (18Mildner M. Weninger W. Trautinger F. Ban J. Tschachler E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a light source for UVA-1, a Mutzhas Supersun 5000-type solar simulator (Mutzhas, Munich, Germany) filtered for the emission of UVA-1 (340â390 nm) was used. UVB (280â320 nm) irradiation was performed with a Waldmann F15 T8 tube (Waldmann, Villingen, Germany). The cells were irradiated with 10 to 40 J/cm2 of UVA-1 or with 20 mJ/cm2 of UVB under a thin layer of phosphate-buffered saline at 25 Â°C. The maximal amount of UVA-1 radiation used in this study on cells (60 J/cm2) would reach the surface of the skin during 168 min of sunlight exposure at noon at a northern latitude of 35Â°; 30% would reach the dermis (19Vile G.F. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This is within the fluency range used for UVA-1 phototherapy (15Mang R. Krutmann J. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2005; 21: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence/ImmunohistochemistryâDermal fibroblasts were grown on 8-well Permanox slides (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). The cells were fixed with 80% methanol (5 min, 4 Â°C) and labeled with EO6 (kindly provided by J. L. Witztum, San Diego, CA) and control IgM antibody as described previously (20Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Horkko S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The cells were counterstained using an antibody against active Caspase 3 (rabbit IgG, 0.5 mg/ml, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and control IgG. Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of skin equivalents were stained for HO-1 (SPA-896; Stressgen). Lipid OxidationâPAPC was oxidized by exposure of the dry lipid to air for 72 h to generate OxPAPC. PAPC dried to a thin film on a glass support was irradiated with UVA-1 with 80 J/cm2 to generate UV-PAPC. For treatment with singlet oxygen, all lipids were vortexed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 90 Î¼m (final concentration in the culture medium was 9 Î¼m) Rose Bengal (Sigma-Aldrich) and irradiated with 10 J/cm2 UVA-1 (see Fig. 5A) or under a commercial 35 W halogen lamp at a distance of 30 cm for 30 min (see Fig. 5, B and C). The extent of oxidation was monitored by ESI-MS as described previously (12Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W.

Lipid ExtractionâTotal lipids were extracted from dermal fibroblasts using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene and 0.17 m formic acid as described (12Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

Thin Layer ChromatographyâTLC analysis of lipids was performed on Silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) using a mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (100:50:10, v/v/v) as a developing solvent. Lipid spots were visualized after treatment with 10% copper sulfate in an 8.5% aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid and subsequent heating at 180 Â°C. Mass SpectrometryâMass spectrometry was performed on a PE Sciex API 365 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with an electrospray source. Flow injection experiments were performed by injecting 20-Î¼l aliquots of lipid samples dissolved in 200 Î¼l of methanol-water-formic acid (80:20:0.1, v/v/v) into a stream of the same solvent mixture, delivered by an HPLC system (HP1100; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Spectra were acquired in the positive mode in the range of 400â900 Da. Liquid chromatography-MS and liquid chromatography-MS/MS was performed using an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (150 Ã 4.6 mm, 5 Î¼m). Samples were dissolved in mobile phase A (10 mm ammonium acetate in methanol-water, 80:20, v/v). Analytes were eluted using a gradient from 25% mobile phase B (10 mm ammonium acetate in methanol) to 100% B in 30 min, followed by an isocratic step at 100% B for 30 min. MS and tandem MS detection was performed in the scan mode (400â900 Da) or the multiple reaction monitoring mode detecting the phosphatidylcholine-specific fragment at 184.1 Da produced from various precursor ions (m/z 594, 610, 782, 814, 828, 846, 878 [MH]+) at a collision energy of 35 eV. Quantification of the peak areas for the multiple reaction monitoring transition m/z 828 > 184 in the elution time range of 7â13 min was performed using Analyst software (version 1.4, Applied Biosystems). OxPAPC Induces HO-1 Expression in KCs and Dermal FBâWe and others have recently shown that HO-1 expression in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells is strongly up-regulated by OxPAPC, which had been generated by air exposure (14Ishikawa K.

As it has been reported previously (5Basu-Modak S. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), treatment of FB with UVA-1 (40 J/cm2), but not UVB (20 mJ/cm2), leads to a strong induction of HO-1 mRNA expression. This effect was mimicked by the addition of OxPAPC (100 Î¼g/ml) (Fig. 1A). When OxPAPC was added at different concentrations to cultures of primary human epidermal KC and FB, HO-1 mRNA and protein expression were strongly induced in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). Strong induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein was also observed when epidermal equivalent cultures, which mimic more closely the in vivo situation, (16Rendl M. Ban J. Mrass P. Mayer C. Lengauer B. Eckhart L. Declerq W. Tschachler E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1150-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were exposed to OxPAPC for 4 consecutive days (Fig. 1D). HO-1 protein expression was most pronounced in the epidermal layers immediately below the stratum corneum. These data demonstrate that like UVA-1, OxPAPC is able to strongly stimulate HO-1 expression in skin cells. HO-1 Inducing Activity Is Contained in âLong Chainâ but Not in âShort Chainâ Oxidized PhospholipidsâOxPAPC contains several oxidation products of PAPC that can be grouped into long chain oxidation products, which result from insertion of oxygen into the arachidonic acid moiety, and short chain oxidation products, which result from oxidative fragmentation (21Birukov K.G. Bochkov V.N. Birukova A.A. Kawkitinarong K. Rios A. Leitner A. Verin A.D. Bokoch G.M. Leitinger N. Garcia J.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Distinct biological properties have been attributed to compounds of either group (24Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Subbanagounder G. Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1751-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To identify HO-1-inducing compounds within OxPAPC, we tested long chain, short chain, and a polar lipid fraction that had been separated by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, HO-1 was strongly induced in fibroblasts by the long chain fraction, whereas the other fractions had virtually no effect. This was confirmed when the synthetic short chain compounds 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (POVPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, as well as 1-palmitoyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (lyso-PC) failed to induce HO-1 expression, as did unoxidized PAPC and di-myristoyl-phosphorylcholine (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that the capacity to induce HO-1 resides within the long chain oxidation products of PAPC. To examine a possible contribution of lipid hydroperoxides, which are present in the OxPAPC preparation, to the induction of HO-1 expression, we incubated fibroblasts with the ROS scavengers Î²-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E prior to exposure to OxPAPC. This treatment did not significantly reduce OxPAPC-mediated HO-1 induction (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that secondary peroxidation of cellular lipids caused by OxPAPC was not involved in the induction of HO-1 expression. UVA-1 Irradiation of PAPC (UV-PAPC) Leads to Formation of Long Chain Oxidation Products That Induce HO-1 ExpressionâPAPC is abundant among phospholipids of cellular membranes (26Williams S.D. Hsu F.F. Ford D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1585-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because it contains a polyunsaturated fatty acyl side chain (20:4) at the sn-2 position, it is prone to oxidation by UV light, singlet oxygen, or free radicals (27McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25189-25192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Girotti A.W. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2001; 63: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For the skin, UVA irradiation is an important inducer of oxidative stress and results in the expression of HO-1 in fibroblasts (2Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). To investigate the direct effects of UVA-1 irradiation on PAPC oxidation, we irradiated synthetic PAPC in vitro. PAPC was dried to a film on a glass support and irradiated with fluencies up to 80 J/cm2 UVA-1. The irradiated PAPC (UV-PAPC) and the sham treated PAPC were analyzed by ESI-MS (Fig. 3, A and B). Fig. 3C shows the formation of mono-, di-, and tri-hydroperoxides of the arachidonic acid moiety of PAPC (m/z 814 (peak b), 846 (peak d), and 878 (peak e)) as well as ions with m/z 828 (peak c). The relative intensity of the nonoxidized [MNa]+ ion (peak a) was set as 100%. Generation of these oxidation products was UVA-1 fluency-dependent, whereas irradiation with corresponding fluencies of UVB (up to 120 mJ/cm2) did not lead to formation of these oxidation products (supplemental Fig. S2). The ion with m/z 828 (c) corresponds to 1-palmitoyl-2-(epoxy-isoprostane-E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PEIPC), a strong inducer of HO-1 expression (14Ishikawa K. Navab M. Leitinger N. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PEIPC was also present in the long chain TLC fraction of OxPAPC (Fig. 2A), as evidenced by ESI-MS and recently described by us (21Birukov K.G. Bochkov V.N. Birukova A.A. Kawkitinarong K. Rios A. Leitner A. Verin A.D. Bokoch G.M. Leitinger N. Garcia J.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ions (b), (d), and (e) correspond to the mono-, di-, and trihydroperoxides of PAPC. To investigate the respective biological activities, sham treated PAPC and UVA-1-treated (20, 40, and 80 J/cm2) PAPC were added to cultures of FB, and HO-1 mRNA expression was measured after 4 h. UV-PAPC, but neither sham treated nor UVB-treated PAPC (supplemental Fig. S2), induced HO-1 expression (Fig. 3D), confirming that UVA-1-mediated oxidation of PAPC leads to the formation of biologically active lipid mediators. UV-PAPC consists of a molecule with m/z 828 (PEIPC), hydroperoxides, and trace amounts of hydroxides of PAPC. To investigate which of the oxidation products present in UV-PAPC induce HO-1 expression, we treated dermal FB with synthetic hydroperoxides and hydroxides of PAPC as well as with PEIPC that had been purified from OxPAPC. Although purified PEIPC strongly induced HO-1 expression, neither the hydroperoxides nor the hydroxides were biologically active (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, we conclude that PEIPC (m/z 828) is the oxidized phospholipid species present in UV-PAPC, which induces HO-1 expression. UVA-1 Irradiation Generates Oxidation-specific Phospholipid Epitopes in Human Fibroblasts and Leads to Formation of PEIPCâTo investigate whether UVA-1 would induce phospholipid oxidation in living cells, we irradiated FB for different times and analyzed them for the presence of PAPC oxidation products. In addition to ESI-MS, we used the murine monoclonal IgM antibody EO6, which binds to oxidized phosphorylcholine-containing phospholipids present in OxPAPC, in oxidized low density lipoprotein, and in the cell membranes of apoptotic cells. For instance, EO6 recognizes POVPC and PEIPC, but not lyso-PC (10Subbanagounder G. Wong J.W. Lee H. Faull K.F. Miller E. Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Irradiation of FB with UVA-1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of intracellular EO6 immunoreactivity, demonstrating the formation of phospholipid oxidation products within 10 min after UVA-1 exposure (Fig. 4, AâD). Staining with antibodies detecting active caspase 3 (aC-3) showed that EO6 immunoreactivity was not confined to apoptotic cells (EO6 positive: 45.5%, aC-3 positive: 15.6%, double positive: 8.5% after irradiation with 60J/cm2) (supplemental Fig. S4). At lower fluencies of UVA-1, apoptosis (as detected with aC-3) in FB did not occur at all (supplemental Fig. S4), whereas EO6 immunoreactivity was found on 12% of cells as compared with 3% of sham treated cells. Among the lipids present in UV-PAPC, only PEIPC (m/z 828) was reported to be recognized by the EO6 antibody (10Subbanagounder G. Wong J.W. Lee H. Faull K.F. Miller E. Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7271-7281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To confirm the structure of the ion with m/z 828 as PEIPC (12Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we performed HPLC-tandem MS analysis of OxPAPC and UV-PAPC (Fig. 4, E and F). Multiple reaction monitoring revealed an identical HPLC elution profile for m/z 828 in both OxPAPC and UV-PAPC. In addition, retention times were identical, and relative abundances of individual peaks were highly comparable. Thus, we conclude that the molecule with m/z 828 that is present in UV-PAPC is identical to PEIPC. To investigate whether PEIPC is formed in dermal FB upon irradiation, we analyzed total lipid extracts from nonirradiated and UVA-1-irradiated (40 J/cm2) dermal fibroblasts. In Fig. 4G we show that PEIPC is strongly increased in extracts of UVA-1-irradiated cells. To quantify the amounts of PEIPC formed in the cells after irradiation, we measured the peak areas for the multiple reaction monitoring transition 828 > 184 in the elution time range of 7â13 min (shaded gray in the diagram in Fig. 4) using Analyst software (version 1.4, Applied Biosystems). We generated a calibration curve (Fig. 4H) where we plotted the area counts versus the amount of OxPAPC loaded onto the column. This was used to calculate the amount of PEIPC in the cell extracts. For this calculation we estimated the cell volume of a human dermal foreskin fibroblast to be 3.5 pl, a cell number of 3.2 Ã 106 cells/mg of protein (32Dall'Asta V. Rossi P.A. Bussolati O. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10485-10491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and about 20 mol % of OxPAPC corresponding to the isomers of PEIPC. We found that the intracellular concentration of PEIPC was 0.8 Î¼m in nonirradiated cells and increased to 7.7 Î¼m after irradiation with 40 J/cm2 of UVA-1. It was recently shown that PEIPC-induced gene expression in endothelial cells at concentrations as low as 0.1 Î¼m (33Li R. Mouillesseaux K.P. Montoya D. Cruz D. Gharavi N. Dun M. Koroniak L.

These data demonstrate that UVA-1 irradiation leads to formation of oxidized phospholipids in cells that remain viable and that PEIPC is formed in sufficient amounts to induce expression of HO-1. Generation of HO-1-inducing Oxidized Phospholipids by UVA-1 Involves Singlet Oxygen and Requires an sn-2 Arachidonate MoietyâSinglet oxygen (1O2) is an important ROS that mediates photooxidation by UVA-1 (35Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1520-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of singlet oxygen in UVA-1-induced oxidation of PAPC, the 1O2 generator Rose Bengal (RB) was added before irradiation. To test whether generation of 1O2 would enhance the formation of biologically active phospholipids and whether this activity is confined to phospholipids containing an arachidonic acid moiety, we used 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphorylcholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleyl-sn-3-glycerophosphorylcholine (PLPC), which differ from PAPC in their length and number of double bonds of the sn-2 acyl chain: a single double bond in"

Although structural information is not available for JAM-B and JAM-C, sequence analysis suggests that homophilic contacts are conserved between JAM family members (24Prota A.E. Campbell J.A.

The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) also contains two extracellular Ig-like domains that form similar dimers via the GFCCâ² interface. Moreover, intermolecular interactions in CAR also include some contacts between charged residues (30van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Zandt H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S.

Chemical cross-linking of JAM-A diminishes the capacity of reovirus to bind JAM-A in vitro and on cells and negates the competitive effects of soluble JAM-A on reovirus attachment (32Forrest J.C.

These findings suggest that reovirus binds to monomeric JAM-A by engaging the dimer interface to effect stable cell attachment. However, the precise nature of Ï1-JAM-A interactions is not understood. Moreover, as all reovirus serotypes bind to JAM-A, it is not apparent how JAM-A binding contributes to the serotype-dependent differences in reovirus tropism in the murine central nervous system.In this study, we performed a systematic mutagenic analysis of the dimer interface of the D1 domain of JAM-A. We engineered point mutations in the dimer-contributing surface of the extracellular domain of JAM-A, purified the resultant mutants, and characterized effects of the mutations on JAM-A homodimerization and binding to the purified Ï1 head domain. In complementary experiments, we tested the capacity of CHO cells expressing full-length JAM-A point mutants to support binding and infection by prototype strains from each of the three reovirus serotypes. Our results indicate that reovirus T3D Ï1 engages JAM-A via residues in Î²-strands C and Câ² within the dimer interface and that JAM-A binding requirements differ significantly among the reovirus serotypes. These findings enhance an understanding of reovirus-receptor interactions and suggest that the nature of JAM-A contacts contributes to differences in pathogenesis among reovirus serotypes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Viruses, and AntibodiesâSpinner-adapted murine L929 cells were cultured as described (33Barton E.S.

CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented to contain 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Reovirus strains T1L, T2J, and T3D are laboratory stocks. Strain T3SA- is a reassortant strain containing the S1 gene of T3C44, which does not bind sialic acid (17Chappell J.D. Gunn V.L. Wetzel J.D.

Reoviruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation from infected L929 cells as described (13Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 246-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Particle concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm using a conversion factor of 2.1 Ã 1012 particles/ml/A260. hJAM-A-specific monoclonal antibody J10.4 was provided by Dr. Charles Parkos (Emory University).Protein Expression and PurificationâThe C-terminal head domain of T3D Ï1 was purified as described (20Schelling P.

Soluble ectodomains of wild-type and point mutant hJAM-A constructs were fused to an amino-terminal GST affinity tag via a thrombin cleavage site and purified as described (24Prota A.E. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Forrest J.C. Peters T.R. Watson M.J. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5366-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences corresponding to residues 27-233 of wild-type hJAM-A were cloned by PCR, digested with BamHI and XhoI, and ligated into pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) for bacterial transformation. Point mutants of hJAM-A were engineered using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of primers used to engineer point mutations in hJAM-A are listed in supplemental Table 1. A GST fusion with the D1 domain of hJAM-A was engineered by inserting a XhoI or BamHI restriction site into the D1/D2 linker of hJAM-A in pGEX-4T-3 using site-directed PCR mutagenesis. Digestion with XhoI or BamHI followed by ligation eliminated the D2 domain (residues 131-233) or D1 domain (residues 27-131), respectively, and fused the remaining domain to GST. Bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding GST-JAM-A constructs were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 Â°C with shaking, and protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactoside (GE Healthcare) at 25 Â°C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 Î¼g/ml lysozyme, and lysed by sonication. GST-hJAM-A proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography. Soluble wild-type and point-mutant hJAM-A ectodomains were liberated from the glutathione resin by incubation with 20 units/ml thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature overnight.Gel Filtration ChromatographyâGel filtration of purified hJAM-A extracellular domains was performed by loading â¼0.5 mg of each protein onto a Superdex 75 column mounted on a BioLogic HR Work station (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide. Gel filtration of the hJAM-A extracellular domain and the Ï1 head domain was performed using a Superdex 75 column mounted on a SMART analytical chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The Ï1 head (10 Î¼g) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.1) and wild-type or mutant forms of the hJAM-A extracellular domain (12.74 Î¼g) in PBS were mixed and incubated at 0 Â°C for 40 min prior to gel filtration. Mixtures of proteins or individual proteins were resolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl.GST Capture AssaysâSwelled, washed, glutathione-coated beads (Sigma) were incubated with 20 Î¼g of purified GST or GST-hJAM-A fusion proteins and diluted in 200 Î¼l of PBS plus 1% Tween 20 at 4 Â°C for 1 h. Glutathione beads with captured GST fusion proteins were washed twice with PBS plus 1% Tween 20 and incubated with 10 Î¼g of purified T3D Ï1 head domain in 200 Î¼l of PBS plus 1% Tween 20 at 4 Â°C for 1 h, followed by two additional washes. After the final wash, buffer was aspirated carefully, and beads with bound proteins were resuspended in 30 Î¼l of sample buffer (313 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 10% Î²-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples (15 Î¼l/lane) were loaded into wells of a SDS 4-20% continuous gradient polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 120 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Assessment of Ï1-JAM-A Interactions Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)âA BIAcore CM5 chip (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) was coated with mouse ascites containing monoclonal GST-specific antibody (Sigma) to â¼1800 resonance units of IgG by amine coupling. Purified GST or wild-type or mutant GST-hJAM-A ectodomain fusion proteins at a concentration of 2 Î¼m in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.0) were captured by injection across individual flow cells of an antibody-coated chip for 3 min at 30 Î¼l/min using a BIAcore 2000 (GE Healthcare). Purified T3D Ï1 head domain was injected across the conjugated chip surface at 30 Î¼l/min. Following Ï1 binding, chip surfaces were regenerated with a 20-Î¼l pulse of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.5). Affinity constants for Ï1 binding to hJAM-A were determined using separate kon and koff nonlinear regression with BIAevaluation 3.0 software (GE Healthcare), assuming a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (35Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of Ï1 constructs were calculated based on Ï1 forming a homotrimer (20Schelling P.

Cells were detached from plates by incubation with 20 mm EDTA in PBS and incubated with hJAM-A-specific monoclonal antibody J10.4 at 10 Î¼g/ml or incubated with reovirus T1L, T2J, or T3SA- (105 particles/cell) on ice for 1 h. Virus-adsorbed cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with clarified, combined T1L/T3D antiserum (37Becker M.M. Goral M.I. Hazelton P.R. Baer G.S. Rodgers S.E.

Samples were washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) at a 1:1000 dilution on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

CHO cells (2 Ã 105) were transiently transfected with receptor-encoding plasmids using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h to allow receptor expression. Cells were infected with reovirus at multiplicities of infection of 1 (T1L), 5 (T2J), and 10 (T3SA-) plaque forming units/cell and incubated at 37 Â°C for 18-20 h. Infected cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described (33Barton E.S. Connolly J.L. Forrest J.C. Chappell J.D. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Images were captured at Ã200 magnification using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. For each experiment, three fields of view were scored from three independently transfected wells. Mean values from three independent experiments were compared using the unpaired Student's t test as applied using Microsoft Excel. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSAnalysis of Ï1 Head Binding to GST-JAM-AâFor studies of Ï1-JAM-A interactions, we purified an N-terminal GST fusion with the extracellular region of JAM-A (GST-JAM-A) (24Prota A.E.

To determine whether GST-JAM-A is capable of binding Ï1, we captured GST-JAM-A on the surface of a biosensor chip via a covalently linked GST-specific antibody. We then injected a purified C-terminal fragment of T3D Ï1 at three different concentrations and detected association with GST-JAM-A by SPR (Fig. 2A). The injected fragment of Ï1 incorporates residues 293 to 455, which comprise the globular Î²-barrel head domain and one Î²-spiral repeat of the tail and is referred to as the Ï1 head (20Schelling P.

The Ï1 head did not show any specific binding to the GST-specific antibody or to GST captured on the biosensor surface (data not shown). However, the Ï1 head bound GST-JAM-A with an affinity of â¼2.4 Ã 10-9 m, which approximates previous calculations of Ï1 affinity for JAM-A (19Barton E.S. Forrest J.C. Connolly J.L. Chappell J.D.

To determine whether the isolated D1 Ig-like domain of JAM-A is capable of Ï1 engagement, we expressed and purified only the D1 or D2 Ig-like domains of JAM-A with an N-terminal GST tag. We assessed the capacity of the fusion proteins to bind the Ï1 head using the SPR strategy employed for GST-JAM-A. Whereas the Ï1 head bound GST-D1 with an affinity similar to GST-JAM-A, GST-D2 was incapable of capturing the Ï1 head (Fig. 2B and data not shown). In accordance with data obtained using chimeric receptor molecules (32Forrest J.C. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Stehle T. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48434-48444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), these data indicate that the membrane distal D1 domain of JAM-A is sufficient for high affinity interactions with Ï1.FIGURE 2Characterization of the Ï1 head domain binding to GST-JAM-A.

https://openalex.org/W2007502830,"Cell fusion is one mechanism by which bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) take on the gene expression pattern of nonhematopoietic cells. This process occurs in a number of organs with postengraftment injury but has never been found in the lung. We performed bone marrow (BM) transplant in a murine model of lung inflammation to test whether transplanted BMDCs develop lung-specific gene expression by fusing with diseased pneumocytes. Mice lacking the lung-specific protein surfactant protein C (Sp-C) were lethally irradiated, transplanted with sex mismatched wild-type marrow, and sacrificed 6 months later. Nineteen/38 recipients exhibited Sp-C mRNA (RT-PCR) and/or protein (mean 0.95+/-1.18 Sp-C+ cells per 1000 type II pneumocytes by confocal microscopy). In male recipients of female BM, 65% of Sp-C + cells contained the Y chromosome, indicating their origin from fusion. Only 28% of Sp-C+ cells in female recipients of male BMDCs contained the Y chromosome, suggesting that 72% of Sp-C-expressing cells lost the Y chromosome. In the setting of post-transplant inflammation, pneumocyte-specific reprogramming of transplanted BMDCs predominantly derives from heterokaryon formation. This process does not reverse inflammation caused by Sp-C deficiency; nevertheless, further investigation may identify phenotypes benefiting from such an approach."

https://openalex.org/W2022759509,"Lysosomal degradation of the receptor-tyrosine kinase cMet requires receptor ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl followed by clathrin-dependent internalization. A role for Cbl as an adaptor for cMet internalization has been previously reported. However, the requirement for Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity in this process and its mode of recruitment to cMet has yet to be determined. Cbl can directly bind cMet at phosphotyrosine 1003 or indirectly via Grb2 to phosphotyrosine 1356 in the multisubstrate binding domain of cMet. The direct binding of Cbl with cMet is critical for receptor degradation and not receptor internalization. Here we show a strict requirement for Grb2 and the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl for cMet endocytosis. Receptor internalization was impaired by small interfering RNA depletion of Grb2, overexpression of dominant negative Grb2 mutants, and point mutations in the cMet multisubstrate docking site that inhibits the direct association of Grb2 with cMet. The requirement for Grb2 was specific and did not involve the multiadaptor Gab1. cMet internalization was impaired in cells expressing an ubiquitin ligase-deficient Cbl mutant or conjugation-deficient ubiquitin but was unaffected in cells expressing a Cbl mutant that is unable to bind cMet directly. Expression of a Cbl-Grb2 chimera rescued impaired cMet endocytosis in cells depleted of endogenous Grb2. These results indicate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl is critical for clathrin-dependent cMet internalization and suggest a role for Grb2 as an intermediary linking Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity to this process.

Endocytic studies on other RTKs, most notably the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), suggest that modification of the endocytic trafficking machinery by the activated receptor and/or its associated signaling molecules regulates receptor internalization and degradation. For example, the signaling adaptor Grb2 has been shown to function as an important initiator of EGFR endocytosis (17Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Grb2 and overexpression of Grb2-SH3 mutants deficient in binding downstream signaling molecules blocks the recruitment of EGFR into clathrin-coated pits and subsequent receptor internalization, with negligible effects on the downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (19Johannessen L.E.

Grb2 functions to regulate EGFR internalization through the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl (20de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J.

However, it remains unclear if the requirement for Grb2 on EGFR endocytosis is mediated solely through interactions with Cbl, functions at the level of EGFR ubiquitination, involves additional Grb2-dependent interactions, or extends to other RTKs. cMet and the EGFR are prototypic members for distinct RTK subfamilies and as such exhibit unique structural and functional characteristics. In contrast to the EGFR, cMet is a heterodimer composed of an extracellular Î± chain that is disulfide-linked to a transmembrane Î² chain that contains cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase activity (23Park M.

Ligand binding induces the autophosphorylation of cMet and EGFR at multiple tyrosines in their respective C-terminal regions enabling the recruitment and subsequent activation of shared downstream adaptor and signaling molecules. The EGFR possesses six tyrosine transphosphorylation sites dispersed throughout the C-terminal region (for review, see Ref. 27Bazley L.A. Gullick W.J. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas cMet contains two key tyrosine phosphorylation sites at positions 1349 and 1356 in a unique multisubstrate-docking site, that function to concomitantly activate multiple downstream signaling pathways (28Ponzetto C.

Cbl has been shown to function as an adaptor important for cMet internalization through clathrin-coated pits via the recruitment of the endophilin-CIN85 complex (4Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, a requirement for Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity and its mode of recruitment for cMet internalization was not examined. In this study we report that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl is important for clathrin-mediated cMet internalization. Moreover, Grb2 bound directly to the cMet multisubstrate docking site acts as an intermediary for Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity in these events.

Cell lines were analyzed for cMet expression by Western blotting with the anti-cMet antibody DL-21 (Upstate Biotechnology), and those cell lines that exhibited similar cMet levels were chosen for further analysis. The parental H10 cMet null â/â cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12(1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum. H10 derivatives stably expressing wild type or mutant cMet alleles were grown in the same medium containing 5 Î¼g/ml puromycin. Human mammary epithelial cells (T47D) stably expressing full-length human cMet (T47D/cMet) were a generous gift of Morag Park (McGill University) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 400 Î¼g/ml G418. siRNAs and Cell TransfectionsâFor siRNAs depletion studies, cells were grown on coverslips in 60-mm plates and transfected with Smartpoolsâ¢ containing four siRNA duplexes for Gab1, Grb2, Shc, or a control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Typically each coverslip of cells was transfected with 200 pmol of siRNA and 8 Î¼l of Lipofectamine 2000. T47D/cMet cells were routinely cultured on coverslips coated with 100 Î¼g/ml polylysine before experimentation. All experiments were routinely performed 72 h after siRNA transfection. Cell transfections using plasmids were performed as previously described (3Li N. Xiang G.S. Dokainish H. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and GST Pulldown AssaysâFor immunoprecipitation (IP) studies cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) and lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C, and then 500â1000 Î¼g of each lysate was incubated with 5 Î¼g of primary antibody overnight at 4 Â°C. Antibody-protein complexes were precipitated with 50 Î¼l of protein A/G-agarose solution (Pierce) by rotation at 4 Â°C for 4 h. The protein-beads complex were collected by centrifugation at 1000 Ã g for 5 min, washed with lysis buffer 3 times, and then resuspended in SDS loading buffer and fractionated by SDS/PAGE. For GST pulldown assays, the cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4). Lysates (0.5â1.0 mg of protein) were incubated with the appropriate GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 Â°C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer followed by a final wash in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, then analyzed by SDS/PAGE. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western AnalysisâThe biotinylation and receptor internalization assays were described previously (3Li N. Xiang G.S. Dokainish H. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were surface-biotinylated at 4 Â°C for 30 min with EZ-link NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). Surface-expressed proteins were isolated directly using streptavidin-agarose beads as described by the manufacturer (Pierce) and identified by Western analysis. Western analysis was performed using ECL (GE Healthcare), and the resulting digitized blots were quantified using AlphaEase Version 3.1.2 Software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Flow Cytometry AnalysisâcMet internalization from the plasma membrane was measured by assaying the residual amount of immunoreactive receptor accessible at the cell surface to a monoclonal antibody recognizing an extracellular epitope. Briefly, cells grown to 80% confluence on 60-mm dishes were sera-starved for 4â6 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml internalin B (InlB) at 37 Â°C under steady state conditions to drive cMet internalization. At the indicated times, receptor endocytosis was terminated by placing the cells on ice. The cells were immediately rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and residual surface-bound InlB was stripped using three consecutive 5-min ice-cold acid washes (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 3.5). Cells were detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and then resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum). Cells were incubated with anti-cMet antibody (AF276, R&D System, MN) in FACS buffer at 4 Â°C for 1 h, washed 3 times with ice-cold FACS buffer, and then incubated with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody in FACS buffer at 4 Â°C for 30 min. After 3 ice-cold washes with FACS buffer, the cells were analyzed using a FACS Canto flow cytometer or fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS for later analysis. Cell viability, as determined by the exclusion of propidium iodide, routinely exceeded 95%. 20,000 cells were analyzed for each sample in triplicate for each condition in each experiment. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the cells at each time point was analyzed and compared with a negative control using control antibody only. The MFI values for each condition were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated across all experiments. The relative percentage of residual cell surface cMet at each time point (tx) was calculated relative to the MFI of cells without internalization (t0) as (MFI tx â MFI control antibody only/MFI t0 â MFI control antibody only) Ã 100.

https://openalex.org/W2070501217,"Tim14 and Tim16 are essential components of the import motor of the mitochondrial TIM23 preprotein translocase. Tim14 contains a J domain in the matrix space that is anchored in the inner membrane by a transmembrane segment. Tim16 is a J-related protein with a moderately hydrophobic segment at its N terminus. The J and J-like domains function in the regulation of the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 chaperone of the import motor. We report here on the role of the hydrophobic segments of Tim16 and Tim14 in the TIM23 translocase. Yeast cells lacking the hydrophobic N-terminal segment in either Tim16 or Tim14 are viable but show growth defects and decreased import rates of matrix-targeted preproteins into mitochondria. The interaction of the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex with the core complex of the TIM23 translocase is destabilized in these cells. In particular, the N-terminal domain of Tim16 is crucial for the interaction of the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex with the TIM23 preprotein translocase. Deletion of hydrophobic segments in both, Tim16 and Tim14, is lethal. We conclude that import into the matrix space of mitochondria requires association of the co-chaperones Tim16 and Tim14 with the TIM23 preprotein translocase.

Import of proteins into mitochondria and their intraorganellar sorting are mediated by translocases, oligomeric protein complexes present in the mitochondrial membranes (1Endo T. Yamamoto H. Esaki M.

Translocation of proteins across both mitochondrial membranes, the outer and the inner membranes, into the matrix space requires the concerted action of the translocase of the outer membrane and the preprotein translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 2The abbreviations used are: TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; mtHsp70, mitochondriales Hsp70; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose; IMS, intermembrane space; TM, transmembrane; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. ) complex (5Berthold J.

Besides the receptor and pore-forming subunits the TIM23 translocase contains subunits that make up the mitochondrial import motor. The import motor is associated with the integral components of the TIM23 translocase at the matrix side of the inner membrane and promotes further transport of preproteins across the translocation pore (for review see Refs. 15Neupert W.

The import motor can be viewed as a specialized Hsp70 chaperone system. It consists of the central component mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) and of at least four other subunits that are essential for viability of yeast cells, Tim44, Tim14 (Pam18), Tim16 (Pam16), and Mge1 (18Kang P.J.

Commun. 1994; 200: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With the help of these subunits mtHsp70 converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into vectorial movement of the unfolded polypeptide chain across the translocation pore. MtHsp70 is part of the highly conserved Hsp70 family whose members bind to unfolded polypeptide chains in a reversible, ATP-dependent manner (29Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 30Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). In the ATP state, the peptide binding domains of Hsp70s have an open conformation and they bind polypeptide chains with low affinity and high exchange rates. ATP hydrolysis by the nucleotide binding domain of Hsp70 triggers a conformational change of the peptide binding domain to its closed state so that this domain tightly binds to the polypeptide. The polypeptide is released upon dissociation of ADP and rebinding of ATP. This nucleotide exchange reaction is catalyzed by members of the GrpE family, in the case of the import motor the soluble matrix protein Mge1. MtHsp70 is recruited to the translocation pore of the TIM23 translocase by Tim44, a protein associated with the inner membrane (31Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 32Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L. Hannavy K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Horst M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, it can immediately bind to the incoming unfolded polypeptide chain when it emerges from the translocation pore. In this way, mtHsp70 prevents backsliding of the polypeptide chain. To allow vectorial movement of the incoming polypeptide chain into the matrix space, bound mtHsp70 has to be released from Tim44 during the ATP-driven reaction cycle of the import motor. Tim44 can be regarded as a scaffold for the organization of the import motor. Besides its recruiting function for mtHsp70, it is required for the association of two further subunits of the import motor, Tim14 and Tim16, to the TIM23 translocase (21Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tim14 belongs to the class of J domain co-chaperones that stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 chaperones and thereby promote tight substrate binding by Hsp70s (21Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Muller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tim14 has one transmembrane segment that anchors the protein to the inner membrane with the J domain facing the matrix space. Association of Tim14 with the TIM23 translocase needs Tim16, which forms a stable subcomplex with Tim14 (24Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Tim16 has two conserved domains, the N terminus containing a segment of hydrophobic amino acid residues and a J-like domain. The J-like domain lacks the canonical HPD motif of J domain co-chaperones that is required for the stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp70. Indeed, Tim16 has no J protein activity but, rather, inhibits the stimulation of the ATPase activity by Tim14 in vitro (34Li Y. Dudek J. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Voos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38047-38054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35D'Silva P.R. Schilke B. Walter W. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is under discussion whether Tim16 modulates the stimulatory effect of Tim14 on mtHsp70 in vivo. Formation of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex requires the conserved matrix part of Tim14 including the J domain and the conserved J-like domain of Tim16 (34Li Y. Dudek J. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Voos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38047-38054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Tim16 forms also a complex with Mdj2, a close homolog of the J protein Tim14 (36Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Popov-Celeketic D. Berg A. Hell K. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31608-31614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mdj2 can be present in the import motor instead of Tim14. It appears to function in a manner similar to Tim14, because it is able to rescue the deletion of Tim14 upon overexpression. In wild type cells it is present in lower amounts compared with Tim14. It is not required for viability of yeast cells, and its function is not clear to date. Pam17 is another non-essential protein whose deletion affects the import of presequence proteins into the mitochondrial matrix (38van der Laan M. Chacinska A. Lind M. Perschil I. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7449-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is still under debate how the motor functions. To understand its molecular mechanism, a detailed functional analysis of the motor components and its domains is needed. Here we report on the roles of the characteristic N-terminal segments of Tim14 and Tim16. Although their J and J-like domains have been studied in detail, the roles of these segments have not been investigated. We show that the transmembrane segment of Tim14 and the conserved hydrophobic N terminus of Tim16 are not required for the formation of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex but rather play an important role in the association of the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex with the TIM23 translocase. The absence of both hydrophobic segments in Tim14 and Tim16 is lethal for yeast cells. We conclude that association of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex with the membrane-embedded part of the TIM23 complex is crucial for the import of preproteins by the TIM23 complex. Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and Cell GrowthâThe TIM14 open reading frame together with its promoter (400 base pairs upstream) and its terminator region (402 base pairs downstream) and the TIM16 open reading frame together with its promoter (327 base pairs upstream) and its terminator region (410 base pairs downstream) were cloned with the restriction sites SacI and XhoI into the centromeric yeast plasmid pRS314 (37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants of Tim14 and Tim16 were first subcloned with promoter and terminator sequences in pGEM4. In the case of the Tim14Î60 variant the promoter region (restriction sites SacI and KpnI) and the nucleotide sequence coding for the start methionine and the amino acid residues 61 to 168 of Tim14 plus the terminator region (BamHI and XhoI) were cloned as two fragments in pGEM4. For the variants with the mitochondrial presequence of the subunit 9 of the F1FO-ATPase from Neurospora crassa the nucleotide sequence coding for amino acid residues 1 to 69 of subunit 9 was cloned in pGEM4 in front of the nucleotide sequence coding for amino acid residues 99 to 168 of Tim14 and amino acid residues 25 to 149 of Tim16, using the restriction sites BamHI and XbaI. Then the subcloned nucleotide sequences were transferred as SacI/XhoI fragment from pGEM4 to pRS314 plasmid, generating the plasmids pRS314-Tim14Î60, pRS314-Su9Tim14Î98, and pRS314-Su9Tim16Î24. The plasmids containing the TIM14 and TIM16 constructs were transformed into the respective haploid chromosomal deletion strains of TIM14 and TIM16 expressing the corresponding wild type genes from an URA3-carrying plasmid (36Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Popov-Celeketic D. Berg A. Hell K. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31608-31614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells that had lost the URA3 plasmid expressing the wild type protein were selected on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The selected cells contained the pRS314 plasmid expressing the wild type or the variants of Tim14 and Tim16. Growth of these cells was tested on yeast extract-peptone dextrose (YPD) plates. Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells grown at 30 Â°C in YPD medium or lactate medium. To test the growth of yeast cells in the absence of both hydrophobic segments of the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex a double deletion mutant of TIM16 and TIM14 harboring pRS314-Su9Tim16Î24 and the TIM14 gene on a URA3-containing plasmid was generated. To this end, the chromosomal TIM14 open reading frame was replaced with the KanMX4 cassette by homologous recombination in the TIM16 deletion strain harboring pRS314-Su9Tim16Î24 and the TIM14 gene on a URA3-containing plasmid (40Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil and containing G418. The nucleotide sequences to express wild type Tim14 and the Su9Tim14Î98 variant were subcloned from the plasmid pRS314 into the plasmid pRS315 containing the Leu auxotrophy marker. These plasmids were transformed in the generated double deletion strain. Viability of a strain harboring only the Tim16Î24 and the Tim14Î98 variants was tested by selection of cells that have lost the URA plasmid expressing wild type Tim14 on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Import of Proteins into Isolated MitochondriaâPrecursor proteins were synthesized in a standard or in a transcription and translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The import of precursor proteins into isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg protein mlâ1) was performed in import buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 500 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgAc2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm potassium phosphate, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.2) containing 4 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 Î¼g/ml creatine kinase. Following preincubation for 3 min at 25 or 12 Â°C, the import reaction was started by addition of 1â3% reticulocyte lysate (v/v) containing the radiolabeled precursor protein and further incubated. At indicated times aliquots were withdrawn. Aliquots were divided and diluted either in SH buffer (600 mm sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) or SH buffer plus 50 Î¼g/ml proteinase K and incubated for 20 min on ice. Protease treatment was stopped by addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondria were reisolated and washed and the import reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and autoradiography. The amount of proteinase K-protected preprotein was quantified by laser densitometry (Pharmacia). Chemical Cross-linkingâChemical cross-linking was performed in isolated mitochondria depleted of ATP. To deplete mitochondrial ATP mitochondria were treated with apyrase (10 units/ml) and oligomycin (10 Î¼m) for 10 min at 25 Â°C in import buffer lacking bovine serum albumin. Disuccinimidyl glutarate was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mm and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.8. Mitochondria were reisolated and mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodecoration. MiscellaneousâSonication experiments were performed according to Rowley et al. (41Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were diluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated in the presence of various concentrations of KCl. Separation into membrane and supernatant fraction was controlled by immunodecoration with antibodies against the marker proteins ADP/ATP-Carrier (AAC) and Mge1. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (36Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Popov-Celeketic D. Berg A. Hell K. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31608-31614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells Containing a Tim14 Variant That Lacks the Transmembrane Segment Are Compromised in GrowthâTim14 consists of an N-terminal intermembrane space (IMS) domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segment, and a positively charged amphipathic helix followed by a highly conserved part including the J domain (Fig. 1A). To determine the function of the IMS domain and the membrane anchor we generated N-terminal truncation mutants. The Tim14Î60 mutant lacks the N-terminal IMS domain of Tim14. This domain is not required for targeting of Tim14 to mitochondria. It is the transmembrane segment together with the following amphipathic helix that apparently forms an internal mitochondrial targeting signal. To target the conserved C-terminal part of Tim14 (Tim14Î98) to the matrix space it was fused to the presequence of the subunit 9 of the F1Fo-ATPase. Upon import of the fusion protein pSu9Tim14Î98 into mitochondria the presequence was proteolytically removed. Yeast strains were constructed that express these truncated forms instead of wild type Tim14 (37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Drop dilution tests were performed on plates containing rich glucose medium (YPD). Deletion of the N-terminal intermembrane space tail of Tim14 did not affect growth (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing Tim14 without the TM segment showed reduced growth rates, in particular at the higher temperature of 37 Â°C. Thus, the TM segment of Tim14 is important but not essential for the function of Tim14, whereas its N-terminal IMS domain plays no or only a minor role. Import of Matrix Proteins into Mitochondria Is Affected in Tim14 Mutant Lacking the Transmembrane SegmentâBecause Tim14 functions in the mitochondrial import motor of the TIM23 translocase, we tested whether the observed growth defects correlate with defects in the import of substrates of the TIM23 translocase. The pre-subunit Î² of F1-ATPase showed decreased import rates into isolated mitochondria containing Tim14Î98 as compared with mitochondria harboring wild type Tim14 but similar import rates with mitochondria containing Tim14Î60 (Fig. 2A). The same was observed for the inner membrane preprotein CoxVa, which requires a functional import motor (Fig. 2B). In contrast, import rates of CoxVa-(Î26â89) whose transport is independent of the import motor were not significantly altered in mitochondria from both mutants (Fig. 2C). Normal import rates were also observed for the precursor of Tim23, a substrate of the TIM22 translocation pathway (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the import defects observed are not due to secondary effects such as lowered membrane potential. In summary, the translocation of preproteins that depend on the import motor is specifically affected in the Tim14Î98 mutant. The import defects correspond to the reported growth phenotype. The TM Segment of Tim14 Stabilizes the Interaction with the TIM23 ComplexâWe characterized the interactions of the mutant proteins with the inner membrane and the TIM23 complex. First, salt extractions of mitochondrial membranes were performed. Mitochondria isolated from the different Tim14 strains were sonicated in the presence of increasing concentrations of salt. Membrane vesicles and associated proteins were then separated and proteins were analyzed by immunodecoration with antibodies against Tim14 (Fig. 3A). Wild type Tim14, as well as Tim14Î60, were found in the membrane fraction at all KCl concentrations tested (Fig. 3A). The Tim14Î98 mutant protein was associated with the membrane at KCl concentrations lower than 250 mm. An increasing fraction of the protein was released to the supernatant fraction at higher salt. This shows that Tim14 is attached to the inner membrane even in the absence of the TM segment. However, this association is sensitive to high ionic strength. To analyze the association of Tim14 variants with the TIM23 translocase, mitochondria were lysed in digitonin-containing buffer and coimmunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies against the integral membrane component Tim17 and the motor component Tim16. Antibodies against Tim17 depleted Tim17 and Tim23 from mitochondrial extracts of cells harboring wild type Tim14 or Tim14Î60 (Fig. 3B). In addition, from these extracts a portion of Tim44 and to a lesser extent Tim14 and Tim16 were isolated together with Tim17. Antibodies against Tim16 depleted Tim14Î60 and Tim16 from the mitochondrial extracts and also precipitated part of Tim44, Tim23, and Tim17. Neither the interaction with Tim16 nor the interaction with the integral Tim23Â·Tim17 core complex and Tim44 were affected by the lack of the IMS domain of Tim14. Apparently, this domain does not play a role in the stability of the TIM23 translocase. In the Tim14Î98 mutant, on the other hand, antibodies against Tim16 coprecipitated Tim14Î98, but neither Tim44, nor Tim23 and Tim17 in significant amounts (Fig. 3B). This shows that the Tim14 and Tim16 subcomplex is stable in the absence of the first 98 amino acid residues of Tim14. In contrast, an interaction of the truncated Tim14 with Tim44 and the Tim23Â·Tim17 core complex was not detected. Antibodies against Tim17 pulled down Tim17 together with Tim23 and a part of Tim44. Only minor amounts of Tim16 and Tim14Î98 were found in the precipitate. Part of Tim16 is associated with the TIM23 translocase in a subcomplex together with Mdj2, a non-essential homolog of Tim14 (36Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Popov-Celeketic D. Berg A. Hell K. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31608-31614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interactions of low affinity might be missed when mitochondria are lysed even with very mild detergents. Therefore, we performed cross-linking experiments in intact mitochondria. As previously reported, Tim14 can be cross-linked to Tim44 and Tim16 (21Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we observed cross-linked adducts of the Tim14 variants with Tim16, indicating the presence of intact Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplexes (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Even with the Tim14Î98 mutant mitochondria a cross-linked adduct of Tim14 protein to Tim44 was observed (lower panel). In this mutant Tim44 was also cross-linked to Tim16 (upper panel). This indicates that the Tim14Î98Â·Tim16 complex is in close proximity to Tim44 in intact mitochondria. We conclude from the cross-linking experiments that the Tim14Î98 mutant protein still interacts with the TIM23 translocase. However, this interaction is less stable than in the wild type. Together, the results suggest a stabilizing effect by the TM segment of Tim14 on the association of the TIM23 core with the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex. The N-terminal Part of Tim16 Is Important for Growth of Yeast CellsâThe Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex contains another moderately hydrophobic segment in addition to the transmembrane segment of Tim14. This segment is present in the conserved N terminus of Tim16 and was predicted to contain a mitochondrial targeting signal, albeit with a relatively low score (42Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). We tested whether the N terminus is indeed able to function as targeting signal. To this end, we fused the first 29 amino acid residues in front of a passenger protein, mouse DHFR, to generate Tim16-(1â29)DHFR. This fusion protein could be imported into the mitochondrial matrix space. Its translocation required the presence of a mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the first 29 amino acid residues of Tim16 have the potential to act as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Processing of the fusion protein was not observed. This is consistent with the lack of processing of the full-length Tim16 (24Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Tim16, in contrast to matrix targeting signals, is highly conserved in terms of amino acid sequence. This suggested a role also in the function of the protein. We addressed this by expressing a version of Tim16 that lacked the first 24 amino acid residues. To allow targeting of the truncated protein to mitochondria the mitochondrial presequence from the subunit 9 of the F1FO-ATPase was fused to a Tim16 that lacked its N-terminal 24 amino acid residues (pSu9Tim16Î24). Upon import into mitochondria the presequence of the fusion protein was proteolytically removed (Tim16Î24). The growth rate of cells expressing Su9Tim16Î24 was strongly reduced as compared with cells expressing wild type Tim16 (Fig. 4C). The N terminus of Tim16 obviously has another important function in addition to its role as a targeting signal. Cells Expressing Tim16 Lacking the Hydrophobic N-terminal Segment Show Reduced Mitochondrial Import of Matrix ProteinsâPreproteins that require the import motor of the TIM23 translocase showed strongly decreased import rates into mitochondria containing Tim16Î24 compared with mitochondria containing wild type Tim16 (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, minor import defects were observed for a motor-independent preprotein CoxVa that lacks the domain located in the matrix (CoxVa-(Î26â89)) and for the ADP/ATP-Carrier AAC, a substrate of the TIM22 complex (Fig. 5, C and D). The results show that the hydrophobic N-terminal segment of Tim16 is crucial for the function of the import motor. The N Terminus of Tim16 Is Crucial for Stable Association of the Tim16Â·Tim14 Subcomplex with the TIM23 ComplexâTo analyze the role of the hydrophobic segment of Tim16 we checked the association of Tim16Î24 with the inner membrane and the TIM23 translocase. Upon salt extraction of mitochondrial membranes, up to 60% of Tim16Î24 was released from the membrane fraction at â¼250 mm salt (Fig. 6A). In contrast, full-length Tim16 was observed mainly in the membrane fraction at all salt concentrations. We conclude that the N-terminal segment of Tim16 takes part in the membrane attachment of Tim16. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to analyze interactions of the Tim16Î24 with components of the TIM23 translocase. The interaction with Tim14 in the Tim16Â·Tim14 subcomplex was not affected. However, neither Tim44 nor the Tim23Â·Tim17 core complex was co-isolated using antibodies against Tim16 from the extract of the Tim16 mutant (Fig. 6B). Consistent results were obtained with antibodies against Tim17. Truncated Tim16 and Tim14 could not be co-isolated with the Tim23Â·Tim17 core complex. Thus, the interaction of the Tim16Â·Tim14 subcomplex with the core complex is not stable in the absence of the hydrophobic segment of Tim16 upon detergent lysis. Cross-linking experiments showed that Tim16Î24 forms a stable complex with Tim14 (Fig. 6C, upper panel). A cross-linked adduct of Tim16Î24 and Tim44 was detected that was slightly smaller in size than the Tim16Â·Tim44 cross-linked adduct observed in mitochondria containing wild type Tim16 (lower panel). In addition, Tim14 was cross-linked to Tim44 in mitochondria containing Tim16Î24 (upper panel). Thus, at least portions of the subcomplex of Tim14 with truncated Tim16 are still in contact with Tim44. However, these interactions appear to be rather labile, as they are not preserved upon detergent lysis of mitochondria. We conclude that the interaction of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex with the TIM23 core complex is severely destabilized in the absence of the hydrophobic N-terminal segment of Tim16. Although not absolutely essential for the interaction with the TIM23 translocase, this segment appears to play a very important role for the binding of Tim16Â·Tim14 subcomplex to the TIM23 translocase. Finally, we analyzed the growth of cells lacking the hydrophobic segments in both proteins, Tim14 and Tim16. Tim14 and Tim16 were replaced by plasmid shuffling with Tim14Î98 and Tim16Î24 in the chromosomal deletion strain lacking TIM14 and TIM16. These cells did not grow at all (Fig. 6D). Deletion of both hydrophobic segments in Tim14 and Tim16 is therefore lethal although the truncated variants of Tim14 and Tim16 can form a complex (37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Most likely, the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex cannot associate with the TIM23 translocase in the absence of both segments. In summary, the N-terminal hydrophobic segments are essential for the functional integration of the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex into the TIM23 complex and for the import of presequence-containing precursor proteins into the mitochondria. In addition to their J and J-like domains that are responsible for the regulation of the activity of mtHsp70, Tim14 and Tim16 have characteristic hydrophobic segments in their N termini. In this report we have analyzed the function of these segments. Both segments have at least two functions. First, they function in the targeting of the proteins to the mitochondria and in their sorting to the inner membrane. Second, they play crucial roles in mediating the association with the TIM23 translocase. Tim14 contains a TM segment followed by a stretch containing positively charged amino acid residues that has the potential to form an amphipathic helix. An import pathway for precursors containing this combination of targeting and sorting elements has been first described for the Bcs1 protein. These elements direct precursor proteins via the TIM23 translocase into the inner membrane with the N terminus facing the intermembrane space (43Foelsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tim14 is not processed following import into mitochondria. A truncated form of Tim14 lacking the N-terminal IMS segment and the TM segment is only able to rescue the deletion of TIM14 when it is imported into mitohondria with a mitochondrial targeting signal (data not shown). Deletion of the N-terminal IMS segment alone does not affect the targeting of the protein. The TM segment apparently functions in translocation of Tim14 into mitochondria. Together with the subsequent amphipathic helix it most likely forms the mitochondrial targeting signal, such as suggested for the Bcs1 protein. The N-terminal domain of Tim16 contains a moderately hydrophobic segment. Its amino acid sequence is conserved between yeast and human. It does not resemble a classical matrix-targeting signal. Furthermore, it is not cleaved off upon import (24Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The first 29 amino acid residues of Tim16 are sufficient to import the passenger protein DHFR into the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, Tim16 belongs to a class of proteins in the matrix space characterized by a conserved nonprocessed N-terminal import signal. How it interacts with the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) and the TIM complexes remains to be elucidated. The N-terminal segments of neither Tim14 nor Tim16 are required for the formation of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex in vivo. In the absence of the first 98 amino acid residues of Tim14 and the first 24 amino acid residues of Tim16 including the hydrophobic segments both proteins were still found in a subcomplex. Thus, the conserved matrix domain of Tim14 and the J-related domain of Tim16 are the conserved parts of the proteins sufficient to assemble the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex. This is consistent with earlier findings in which purified recombinant proteins comprising the conserved matrix part of Tim14 and the J-like domain of Tim16 formed a stable complex (35D'Silva P.R. Schilke B. Walter W. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in the J domain of Tim14 (Pam18) destabilize the interaction between Tim14 and Tim16 in vivo (35D'Silva P.R. Schilke B. Walter W. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The membrane segment of Tim14 and the N-terminal segment of Tim16 stabilize the association of the proteins with the inner membrane. With Tim14 stable association with the membrane was observed at even very high salt concentrations. The interaction between Tim14 and Tim16 in the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex is not affected by the presence of high salt (37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, even in the absence of its moderately hydrophobic segment the part of Tim16 that is in complex with Tim14 is also membrane associated. Tim16 itself was largely found attached to the membrane. The N-terminal domain of Tim16 contributes significantly to this association. The N-terminal segments of both Tim14 and Tim16 are crucial also for the interaction with the TIM23 core translocase. In particular, the N terminus of Tim16 appears to be important for the interaction. Still, the Tim16Î24 mutant strain was viable (37Mokranjac D. Bourenkov G. Hell K. Neupert W. Groll M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4675-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An interaction of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex with the TIM23 translocase might not be essential for functional import or the interaction is more labile and thus not detectable after lysis of mitochondrial membranes. Because the Tim14Â·Tim16 complex can be cross-linked to Tim44 in intact mitochondria of the Tim14 and Tim16 mutants, the latter possibility is very likely. In addition, deletions of both hydrophobic segments in the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex are lethal for yeast cells. These results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial import into the matrix space requires efficient and immediate trapping of the incoming precursor protein at the matrix side of the inner membrane by the associated import motor. Tim44 most likely plays a crucial role in the interaction of Tim14 and Tim16 with the TIM23 complex and represents a potential binding partner for these two components. In its absence Tim14 and Tim16 are not assembled directly or at least only weakly with the TIM23 core complex (21Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Pam17 has been reported to be a component of the import motor (38van der Laan M. Chacinska A. Lind M. Perschil I. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7449-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be a candidate to mediate contact between the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex and the other translocase components. However, Pam17 is not essential for viability of yeast cells, and its deletion does not abrogate the association of Tim14Â·Tim16 with the Tim23 core complex and Tim44. 3D. Mokranjac and K. Hell, unpublished results. The purified N-terminal IMS domain of Tim14 (residues 2â65) expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was reported to bind specifically to Tim17 from mitochondrial extracts (44Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Cell. 2005; 120: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our results indicate that cells expressing Tim14 without the IMS domain contain an intact TIM23 complex and have import rates not different from those of wild type cells. Thus, an interaction of the IMS domain of Tim14 with Tim17 appears not to be crucial for the assembly of the import motor to the TIM23 complex. This is in agreement with the lack of such N-terminal extensions in homologs of other fungi and higher eukaryotes. In summary, the presence of at least one hydrophobic segment in the N termini of Tim16 and Tim14 is essential for the viability of yeast cells. The hydrophobic segments are crucial for the interaction of the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex with the TIM23 translocase at the inner membrane. We conclude that the Tim14Â·Tim16 subcomplex is required to be present at the inner membrane, probably in close contact to the TIM23 translocase, to mediate efficient import of preproteins.

Understanding the specificity of the human cytokine response and exploring the intracellular signaling pathways that relate to the individual mycobacterial antigens are critical for defining the mechanisms responsible for host defense and pathogenesis during tuberculosis (15Jo E.K. Park J.K. Dockrell H.M. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Wei et al. (16Wei J. Dahl J.L. Moulder J.W. Roberts E.A. O'Gaora P. Young D.B. Friedman R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have recently identified the eis gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that was responsible for the enhanced intracellular survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis in the human macrophage cell line U-937. The eis gene has no significant homology to other known genes. Roberts et al. (17Robert E.A. Clark A. McBeth S. Friedman R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5410-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have recently characterized the eis promoter and shown that a 200- and 412-bp region of the promoter was necessary for maximum expression of gfp in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra, respectively. Eis is found to be a non-glycosylated protein. Eis appears primarily in the cytoplasm and in modest amounts in the cell envelope and in the culture supernatant (18Dahl J. Wei J. Moulder J.A. Laal S. Friedman R.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As of now, little is known about the structure and function of Eis and the immunological response to Eis. For gaining insight into the biological role of Eis in the host, we carried out cloning and overexpression of Eis from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The overexpressed protein was purified to homogeneity, and its immunological properties were studied using T-cell proliferation assays. We further examined the role of Eis in MAPK signaling pathways and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokine-inducing activities. We found that the purified Eis recombinant protein inhibits the phosphorylation of extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and subsequent production of TNF-Î± and IL-4. Furthermore, the production of IFN-Î³ and IL-10 by Eis stimulated T-cells was also found to be enhanced.

Overexpression and Purification of Eis ProteinâThe vectors containing the eis gene were transformed into E. coli expression hosts like BL21 (Î»DE3), Rosetta, BL21 (Î»DE3) pLysS, C41 (Î»DE3), and Codon+ cells. Out of these strains, pLysS gave the highest soluble protein expression at 0.5 mm IPTG induced for 6.0 h at 28 Â°C. A single colony was inoculated into LB broth containing 50 Î¼g/ml kanamycin and 34 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 Â°C. The 1.0 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 1.0 liter of LB medium containing antibiotics and grown at 37 Â°C. Cells in logarithmic phase (A600 of 0.6) were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG and grown further for 6.0 h at 28 Â°C. After induction, cells were harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice until it was optically clear. The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The clear supernatant of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Eis was directly loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA superflow (5.0 ml, Qiagen) column. The column was pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The loaded column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The eluted fractions, which were more than 95% pure, were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration through 10.0-kDa cut-off Amicon YM-3 (Millipore). The concentrated protein was estimated using the Bradford reagent and stored at 4 Â°C. The yield of the purified Eis was 10 mg/liter of culture. T-cell ProliferationâT-cells were purified from human blood as described previously (20Julius M.H. Simpson E. Herzenberg L.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1973; 3: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared by Histopaque sedimentation of heparinized (10 units/ml) blood from healthy volunteers (21Boyum A. Scan. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to the pre-equilibrated sterile nylon wool column and incubated for 1.0 h at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. After incubation, T-cells were eluted slowly by adding RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum. The purity of T-cells was analyzed through fluorescence-activated cell sorter by labeling with fluorophore conjugated Î±-CD3, Î±-CD4, Î±-CD8, and Î±-CD14 (supplemental Fig. S1). The purity of T-cells was found to be >90%. 3.5 Ã 105 cells/well were cultured for 96 h in 96-well culture plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. T-cells were not treated with phytohemagglutinin/IL-2. No antibiotics or fungicides were used during the entire period of the culture of the cells. The viability of cells was measured using trypan blue exclusion after 96 h of treatment with Eis. Cells were either stimulated with an increased amount of purified recombinant Eis protein (2.5, 5.0, and 10 Î¼g) or left untreated. Con A (2.5, 5.0, and 10 Î¼g) was used as mitogen for positive control. T-cell proliferative responses were assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation during the last 24 h of 96-h cultures. 0.5 Î¼Ci of [3H]thymidine, specific activity 5.0 Ci/mmol (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre), was added to each well. The cells were harvested and processed by washing on glass fiber filters using an automated cell harvester (Nunc), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured with a scintillation counter. Results are expressed as the means of the cpm of triplicate cultures and Â± S.E. Cytokine AssayâThe supernatant from cultured and stimulated T-cells was sampled for cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-4, IFN-Î³,and IL-10. Cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Pharmingen) were used for detecting TNF-Î±, IL-4, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 in culture supernatant. Assays were performed as specified by the manufacturer, and samples were run in triplicates. Cytokine concentrations in the samples were calculated using standard curves generated from recombinant cytokines, and the results were expressed in picograms or nanograms per milliliter. The difference between triplicate wells was always less than 10% of the mean. The detection limits of the four ELISA assays were: TNF-Î±, 7.8 pg/ml; IL-4, 7.8 pg/ml; IL-10, 7.8 pg/ml; IFN-Î³, 4.7 pg/ml. Graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel software, and error bars referred to standard deviation. As overexpressed recombinant protein of Eis was purified from E. coli, therefore, to rule out the possibility of significant LPS contamination in Eis protein, we studied the production of IL-10 cytokine from T-cells in response to Eis, LPS, and polymyxin treatment either alone or in combination. Polymyxin binds to the lipid A portion of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (22Morrison D.C. Jacob D.M. Immunochemistry. 1976; 13: 813Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). As expected, polymyxin inhibits the production of IL-10 in response to LPS, but there is no change in the production of IL-10 in response to polymyxin and Eis treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). Determination of MAPK PhosphorylationâA total of 3 Ã 105 T-cells were treated with the 10 Î¼g of Eis protein for 96 h. Then cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were boiled with 50 Î¼l of 1 Ã Laemmli sample buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed with specific primary antibodies (ERK1/2, pERK1/2, JAK1, STAT1, and pSTAT1) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were developed using a chemiluminescence assay (ECL). Finally, the results were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using Quantity OneR software from Gel Doc 2000 Bio-Rad. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Expression and PurificationâWe amplified the eis gene from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA (Fig. 1A) and prepared N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Eis using the strain BL21 (Î»DE3) pLysS of E. coli. Induction of E. coli BL21 (Î»DE3) pLysS pET28a/eis by the addition of IPTG resulted in production of recombinant Eis protein predominantly (>90%) in the soluble form (data not shown). Time course studies to optimize IPTG-induced protein expression, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE, demonstrated maximum protein yield to be obtained through induction for 6.0 h at a concentration of 0.5 mm IPTG, 28 Â°C (Fig. 1B). Further, the expression of Eis protein was confirmed with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 1C). Overexpressed recombinant Eis protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of E. coli BL21 (Î»DE3) pLysS pET28a/eis cells using Ni-NTA Superflow column. A single band on SDS-PAGE confirmed the homogeneity of the protein (Fig. 1D). Eis Inhibits T-cell ProliferationâThe effect of Eis on the response of T-cells is shown in Fig. 2A. As expected, Con A stimulated proliferations of T-cells, but the inhibition of T-cell proliferation by Eis is very prominent. Effect of Eis was checked by titrating the various concentrations of Eis (Fig. 2A). Cell viability was not compromised on exposure to Eis as confirmed by the trypan blue exclusion method (data not shown). Further, we checked whether Eis suppresses Con A-induced T-cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2B, Eis inhibited the Con A-mediated proliferation of T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum inhibition observed is â¼3-fold. Cytokine Production and MAPK Phosphorylation in Response to Eis by T-cellsâThe levels of cytokines produced by T-cells following Eis treatment are shown in Fig. 2, CâF. Con A treatment produced significantly higher levels of TNF-Î± and IL-4. In contrast, there were extremely low levels of TNF-Î± and IL-4 production in response to Eis treatment (much below the detection limit of ELISA), which shows clearly that Eis inhibits the production of TNF-Î± and IL-4. Although Eis could inhibit Con A-mediated TNF-Î± production by only 1.5-fold, the effect of Eis on Con A-mediated IL-4 production is very dramatic (Fig. 2, C and D). The production of TNF-Î± is regulated by IL-10 (23Donnelly R.P. Freeman S.L. Hayes M.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1420-1427PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effect of Eis on T-cells for the synthesis of IL-10. Eis induced the production of IL-10 by 20-fold in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 2E). Unexpectedly the production of IFN-Î³ was also found to be enhanced in response to Eis stimulation (Fig. 2F). To rule out the variation in the production of cytokines between individuals, the actual cytokine data points from 15 healthy volunteers were also graphed for TNF-Î±, IL-10, and IFN-Î³ production (Fig. 3). The profile of TNF-Î±, IL-10, and IFN-Î³ cytokine productions in response to Eis treatment in different individuals was found to be similar. The IL-4 production in response to Eis treatment in all the individuals was found to be below detection limit of ELISA (data not shown). Given that MAPKs are critical factors mediating cellular responses to external stimuli and because of the importance of these pathways in inflammatory and other immune responses, we examined the role of Eis protein of M. tuberculosis in the induction of MAPK signaling pathways. Human T-cells were stimulated with 10 Î¼g of purified recombinant Eis protein, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JAK, and STAT was analyzed (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows that lower levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were observed in Eis-treated lanes. Fig. 4B shows the level of total ERKs. Similarly, JAK1 is not detectable in response to Eis treatment (Fig. 4C). Analysis of pSTAT and total STAT did not reveal significant difference in the level of activation upon Eis treatment (Fig. 4, D and E). A control immunoblot probed with standard actin antibodies demonstrated equal loading in each lane (Fig. 4F). The identification of Eis has recently been reported. Eis is involved in the survival of mycobacteria during the infection of macrophages (16Wei J. Dahl J.L. Moulder J.W. Roberts E.A. O'Gaora P. Young D.B. Friedman R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Eis is expressed only when the clinical isolate was replicating in activated macrophages (24Cappelli G. Volpe P. Sanduzzi A. Sacchi A. Colizzi V. Mariani F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7262-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about how Eis mediates its functional activity. Our main goal here was to characterize the biological role of Eis protein. The main question we posed in this study was whether Eis could affect the host immune response. The data presented here showed that (i) the stimulation of human T-cells with the Eis protein of M. tuberculosis has an inhibitory effect on Con A-mediated T-cell proliferation in vitro, (ii) stimulation of T-cells in vitro with the Eis protein inhibits ERK1/2 and JAK activation, and (iii) production of TNF-Î±, IL-4, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 is modulated by Eistreated T-cells. Although secretion of TNF-Î± and IL-4 is inhibited by Eis-treated T-cells, the IFN-Î³ and IL-10 production is higher in Eis-stimulated T-cells. Down-regulation of TNF-Î± expression in response to Eis treatment shows that Eis is able to impair the host defense of tuberculosis. MAPKs are evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways that play important roles in the transduction of signals in the innate immune responses of plants, insects, and mammals (25Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). The activation of intracellular signaling pathways and subsequent inflammatory cytokines can be induced by different stimuli in different cell types (26Rao K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the Eis-dependent down-regulation of ERK and JAK pathway in T-cells impairs the secretion of TNF-Î± and IL-4. The production of IFN-Î³ and IL-10 was found to be more. Demissie et al. (27Demissie A. Wassie L. Abebe M. Aseffa A. Rook G. Zumla A. Andersen P. Doherty T.M. the VASCEL Study GroupInfect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have reported the elevated levels of IL-4 and reduced levels of IFN-Î³. There are several reports that link inverse correlation between TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ levels (28Condos R. Rom W.N. Liu Y.M. Schluger N.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Tramontana J.M. Utaipat U. Molloy A. Akarasewi P. Burroughs M. Makonkawkeyoon S. Johnson B. Klausner J.D. Rom W. Kaplan G. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 384-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eis is found to elicit strong TH1 response, i.e. elevated IFN-Î³ expression associated with lower expression of IL-4. The 38-kDa lipoprotein is also reported to elicit a strong TH1 response (30Fonseca D.P. Benaissa-Trouw B. van Engelen M. Kraaijeveld A. Snippe H. Verheul A.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4839-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although IFN-Î³ inhibits the proliferation of TH2 cells (31Gajewski T.F. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4245-4252PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fernandez-Botran R. Sanders V.M. Mosmann T.R. Vitetta E.S. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), IL-4 preferentially stimulates growth of TH2 cells (32Fernandez-Botran R. Sanders V.M. Mosmann T.R. Vitetta E.S. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Greenbaum L.A. Horowitz J.B. Woods A. Pasqualini T. Reich E.P. Bottomly K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1555-1560PubMed Google Scholar). IL-10 inhibits the synthesis of cytokines by TH1 cells. Increased production of IFN-Î³ and IL-10 by Eis-stimulated T-cells shows that there is an Eis-mediated disturbance of cross regulation of T-cells, which may impair the balance between TH1 and TH2 response, and this imbalance could be the main action of Eis, which could be a factor of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Gaining mechanistic insight into the Eis-mediated altered TH1/TH2 imbalance may help in understanding the implications for enhanced survival of M. tuberculosis in host, which may further contribute toward development of a myriad of strategies for fighting tuberculosis.

Among various virulence factors expressed by GCS and GGS isolates from human infections, M and M-like proteins are considered important because of their anti-phagocytic activity. In addition, protein G has been implicated in the accumulation of IgG on the bacterial surface through non-immune binding. The function of this interaction, however, is still unknown. Using isogenic mutants lacking protein G or the M-like protein FOG (group G streptococci), respectively, we could show that FOG contributes substantially to IgG binding. A detailed characterization of the interaction between IgG and FOG revealed its ability to bind the Fc region of human IgG and its binding to the subclasses IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. FOG was also found to bind IgG of several animal species. Surface plasmon resonance measurements indicate a high affinity to human IgG with a dissociation constant of 2.4 pm. The binding site was localized in a central motif of FOG. It has long been speculated about anti-opsonic functions of streptococcal Fc-binding proteins. The presented data for the first time provide evidence and, furthermore, indicate functional differences between protein G and FOG. By obstructing the interaction between IgG and C1q, protein G prevented recognition by the classical pathway of the complement system. In contrast, IgG that was bound to FOG remained capable of binding C1q, an effect that may have important consequences in the pathogenesis of GGS infections.

Carriage of GCS and GGS in the throat and on the skin is often asymptomatic. However, reports from different parts of the world are accumulating demonstrating that they are emerging as important human pathogens (1Cohen-Poradosu R. Jaffe J. Lavi D. Grisariu-Greenzaid S.

Individual processes contributing to the immune defense against GGS are still elusive, and the knowledge about how GGS undermine and obstruct the actions of the immune system is fragmentary. Before the development of a specific immune response, the innate immune system constitutes a first line of defense against intruding bacteria. Part of the innate immune defense is the complement system that has two major functions. One is to kill bacteria by forming lytic complexes on the bacterial membrane, referred to as membrane attack complex. The other one is to facilitate the actions of the cellular immune response. The complement cascade produces anaphylatoxins to attract phagocytes; other complement reactions opsonize the bacteria, promoting extracellular bactericidal actions and phagocytosis (5Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar, 6Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 7Tenner A.J. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2547-2552PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bobak D.A. Gaither T.A. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria have evolved diverse protective mechanisms to prevent the actions of the complement system. The membrane attack complex is thought to be inefficient in killing Gram-positive bacteria due to their resistant cell wall (9Joiner K. Brown E. Hammer C. Warren K. Frank M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 845-849PubMed Google Scholar). C5a-peptidase of Streptococcus pyogenes, which has a homologue in GGS, cleaves and thereby inactivates a potent anaphylatoxin (10Wexler D.E. Chenoweth D.E. Cleary P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8144-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Cleary P.P. Peterson J. Chen C. Nelson C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2305-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M proteins of S. pyogenes prevent opsonization by C4b by recruiting plasma proteins like fibrinogen or C4b-binding protein. A recent study suggests that fibrinogen bound to M protein interferes with the deposition of C4b2a, the C3 convertase of the classical pathway, on the bacterial surface (12Carlsson F. Sandin C. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A recently defined fibrinogen-binding M-like protein of GGS referred to as FOG was shown to exert anti-phagocytic activity on neutrophils by forming fibrinogen aggregates (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The complement cascade can be initiated by three different pathways; that is, the classical, the lectin, or the alternative pathway. A triggering step of the classical pathway is the binding of factor C1q to aggregated or antigen-bound IgG. Factor C1q together with the serine proteases C1r and C1s forms the C1 complex. The interaction with IgG induces conformational changes in C1q that lead to the activation of the serine proteases of the C1 complex. This sets off the classical pathway by cleaving C2 and C4, thus leading to the formation of opsonins and anaphylatoxins (5Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar). Moreover, C1q itself acts as an opsonin, eliciting antibacterial actions of phagocytes (7Tenner A.J. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2547-2552PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bobak D.A. Gaither T.A. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kishore U. Reid K.B. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). GCS and GGS accumulate IgG on their surface by non-immune binding. A major protein that is responsible for the high capacity accumulation of IgG on GGS is protein G (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate for the first time that FOG also contributes in accumulating human IgG on the GGS surface and present a detailed characterization of the interaction between IgG and FOG. The influence of the IgG accumulations on recognition by human C1q was investigated. The data revealed an anti-opsonic function of protein G. In contrast to protein G, FOG did not interfere with the interaction between IgG and C1q. The results suggest opposed functions of the IgG interactions of FOG and of protein G in human infections. Growth Conditions and Bacterial StrainsâStrains G41 and G148 are throat isolates collected at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. Strain G45 was collected at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Australia. G41 and G45 carry protein FOG on their surface, and G148 naturally lacks protein FOG. Streptococci were routinely grown in Todd-Hewitt (Difco) liquid medium in 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. Proteins and LabelingâRecombinant protein FOG and its truncated forms were produced and purified as described in Johansson et al. (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cloning of the truncated constructs was modified. PCR products of the primer sets listed below were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector between the BamHI and the SalI cleavage site. The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent Escherichia coli HB101 cells. To clone the following truncated constructs, the respective primer sets were used: FOG B2-C2 (BamHI B2, SalI C2), FOG S-C2 (BamHI S, SalI C2), FOG B2-S (BamHI B2, SalI S), FOG B2-aa304 (BamHI B2, SalI aa304), FOG S-region (BamHI S, SalI S), FOG aa305-S (BamHI aa305, SalI S), and FOG aa305-C1 (BamHI aa305, SalI C1). The sequences of coding strand primers were 5â²-GCGGATCCGCTTATACTGTAAAAGAGCACC-3â² (BamHI B2), 5â²-GCGGATCCGAAGCTGAAAAATTAGCTAAAGAAGG-3â² (BamHI S), and 5â²-GCGGATCCAAGCTAAAACAACTTGAAACTATCAAC-3â² (BamHI aa305). The sequences of non-coding strand primers were 5â²-GCTGTCGACTTATTAAAGTTCAGCAGTCAAGTTTGCTA-3â² (SalI C2), 5â²-GCTGTCGACTTATTATGCTTTGTCGCTTGCTAATTGTTC-3â² (SalI S), 5â²-GCTGTCGACTTATTAAGCAAGCTCTTGCTCTTGTTTCTC-3â² (SalI aa304), and 5â²-GCTGTCGACTTATTATTGCTTCTTAGCTTCACGTGATGC-3â² (SalI C1). If not indicated otherwise, protein G, human fibrinogen, human IgG, IgG subclasses, and papain-treated IgG fragments were purchased from Sigma, and C1q was from Calbiochem. Radiolabeling of proteins was carried out using Iodobeads (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled proteins were separated from unincorporated iodine using PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Slot BlotsâProtein preparations were applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Milliblot-D system. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Tween 20 (block buffer) for 3 Ã 20 min at 22 Â°C and then incubated with radiolabeled FOG (200,000 cpm/ml block buffer) for 3 h. Membranes were washed 3 Ã 20 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and bound ligand was detected using the Fuji Imaging System. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) MeasurementsâProtein interactions were studied in a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB) using 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, as the running buffer. A CM5 sensor chip was activated by a 4-min injection of 0.05 m n-hydroxysuccinimide, 0.2 m n-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in water. Human IgG (11 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was diluted 1:1000 in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Injection of 25 Î¼l at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min led to immobilization of 1000 response units of human IgG. Residual reactive groups were inactivated by a 6-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Interaction measurements were carried out at a flow rate of 60 Î¼l/min. Surface regeneration was achieved by injection of two 30-s pulses of 0.2% SDS in water. The BIAevaluation 3.0 software was used for further analysis of the data. Shown curves represent the difference between the signal of the IgG-coupled surface and of a deactivated control surface devoid of protein. They were further corrected by subtraction of the curve that was obtained after injection of running buffer alone. Buffer injection led to responses less than five response units. Construction of the FOG Deletion and the Protein G Deletion MutantsâIsolation of chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain G45 was performed using the BIORAD Instagene Matrix solution as described by the manufacturer. All restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The sequence of the fog gene was derived from accession number AY600861 and served as basis for the selection of fog-specific oligonucleotides. The sequence of the protG gene was derived from accession number X06173. For construction of the FOG deletion mutant, a 697-bp internal fragment of fog was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides Fog_mut1 (GCGGAGAATACATACGATAGATGG) and Fog_mut2_MunI_overlap (ccgggcaattgccgggCTAACTCTTGCTGCTTCTGAGC). For construction of the protein G deletion mutant, a 557-bp internal fragment of protG was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides ProtG_ko (AAATCGTAGTTTCAAATTTGTCG) and protG_ko_MunI_overlap (ccgggcaattgccgggAAATCAGATAAGCCATCTGTTGC). For amplification of the aad9 gene (accession number M69221), oligonucleotides Spc1_MunI_overlap (cccggcaattgcccggATCGATTTTCGTTCGTGAATAC) and Spc2_AvrII_overlap (gcgcctaggcgcggcCCAATTAGAATGAATATTTCCC) were used. By application of overlap extension PCR (16Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar), the fog and protG fragments were fused to the aad9 gene, respectively, and ligated into the cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) generating pCR2.1-fog-aad9 and pCR2.1-protG-aad9. The fog-aad9 and the protG-aad9 cassettes were subsequently ligated into the thermosensitive shuttle vector pJRS233 (17Perez-Casal J. Okada N. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using vector-harboring restriction sites BamHI and XhoI, resulting in vector pISA14 and vector pIF2, respectively. E. coli DH5Î± clones carrying the recombinant plasmids were selected on spectinomycin as indicated above. Plasmid isolations were performed using the Qiagen Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The plasmids pISA14 and pIF2 were introduced into competent G45 bacteria by electroporation as described by McLaughlin and Ferretti (18McLaughlin R.E. Ferretti J.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 185-193PubMed Google Scholar). After selection of erythromycin-resistant GGS at 30 Â°C and verification of the presence of the plasmid by PCR using vector-priming oligonucleotides M13 forward and M13 reverse, a temperature shift to 37 Â°C led to transient integration of pISA14 and pIF2 into the streptococcal genome at the designated fogI and protG locus, respectively. Correct insertion of the plasmids in the mutants, leading to interruption of the fog gene after amino acid 261, and interruption of the protG gene after amino acid 163 were confirmed by sequencing as well as Southern blot hybridization using an aad9-specific probe. Sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), and analysis of the obtained DNA sequences was performed using DNASTAR SeqManII Version 5.05 software. Southern Blot HybridizationâChromosomal DNA from GGS was digested with either BamHI, EcoRI, or HindIII, separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and blotted onto positively charged nylon membrane (Macherey-Nagel). Digoxigenin labeling and detection of aad9-specific PCR probe was performed with the PCR DIG probe synthesis and detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Binding AssayâOvernight cultures of bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 1400 Ã g for 10 min and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Binding of radiolabeled IgG and fibrinogen was performed as described (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dinkla K. Rohde M. Jansen W.T. Carapetis J.R. Chhatwal G.S. Talay S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasma and Protein AbsorptionâOvernight cultures of GGS were washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended to give a concentration of 0.5 g of bacteria/ml (wet weight/volume). A 100-Î¼l bacterial suspension was incubated with human blood plasma (10 Î¼l, 1 h, 37 Â°C) or isolated C1q (2 Î¼g, 1 h, 37 Â°C). In some experiments bacteria were pre-absorbed with human IgG (10 Î¼g, 30 min, room temperature) or Fc fragment of human IgG (2 Î¼g, 30 min, room temperature) and washed twice with PBS before the addition of C1q. After a final incubation, the bacteria were washed three times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 30 Î¼l of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.0, for 15 min. Before SDS-PAGE, the samples were neutralized by the addition of 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingâSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions in a 12% separating gel. For immunoblots, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with a dilution of the appropriate goat anti-serum (anti-C1q, Calbiochem). Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 3-aminophthalhydrazide (1.25 mm), p-coumaric acid (225 mm), and 0.01% H2O2. Mapping of Binding Regions on IgG Coupled to ImmunobeadsâAs described in Frick et al. (21Frick I.M. WikstrÃ¶m M. ForseÃ©n S. Drakenberg T. Gomi H. SjÃ¶bring U. BjÃ¶rck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8532-8536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Immunobeads (ImmunobeadsÂ® Reagent Activated Immunobead Matrix, Santa Ana, CA) were coupled with human IgG. Optimal binding of radiolabeled protein FOG was assessed by incubating beads and protein in Veronal-buffered saline (pH 7.35, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% gelatin) for 90 min at 22 Â°C. Beads were then washed twice with 0.01 m EDTA in Veronal-buffered saline containing 0.05% gelatin, and the amount of radiolabeled protein (in cpm) bound to the beads was counted on a Wallac Wizard 1470 automatic gamma counter. For competition experiments, increasing amounts of proteins G and FOG in 0.2 ml were used to compete for binding to 0.1 ml IgG-coupled immunobeads in the presence of radiolabeled FOG (â¼12 ng or 30,000 cpm in 0.1 ml of Veronal buffer, pH 7.35, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% gelatin). Incubation and washing steps are described above. Characteristics of Protein FOG Regarding IgG BindingâProtein FOG was shown to be a major surface protein that is common in clinical isolates of GGS (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recombinant FOG showed affinity for the immunoglobulin IgG (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the interaction is virtually uncharacterized. The primary structure of FOG does not contain any sequences with significant homology to the IgG binding motif of protein G, the major IgG binding molecule on the surface of GGS (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). To allow a first comparison between these IgG-binding proteins, recombinant FOG that represents the mature protein after sortase cleavage (amino acids (aa) 1â557, Fig. 1) was tested for binding to IgG of different animal species (Table 1), to different subclasses of human IgG (Fig. 2A) and its papain fragments Fc and Fab (Fig. 2B). Radiolabeled FOG bound to immobilized human, equine, murine, monkey, guinea pig, porcine, and rabbit IgG in ligand blot experiments. A low but considerable signal was detected for canine IgG, but no binding was detectable for caprine, ovine, rat, or bovine IgG (Table 1). In contrast to protein G, which is known to bind all the four subclasses of human IgG (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar), FOG bound to human IgG-subclasses IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 but not IgG3 (Fig. 2A). As opposed to a clear signal for binding to Fc-fragment, the signal obtained for Fab fragment was faint (Fig. 2B). To further characterize the interaction with IgG, FOG was examined in SPR measurements for binding to immobilized human IgG, revealing a dissociation constant of 2.4 pm (Fig. 3A); thus, an interaction of high affinity.TABLE 1Binding of FOG to IgG from human and different animal species in ligand blotSpeciesBinding in ligand blotBovine-Canine+Caprine-Equine+++Guinea pig+++Human+++Monkey+++Murine+++Ovine-Porcine+++Rabbit+++Rat- Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Binding of FOG to different IgGs.

Amounts of immobilized IgG are indicated to the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Binding of recombinant FOG to human IgG studied by surface plasmon resonance measurements. Measurements were carried out at different concentrations (2. 5, 5, and 10 Î¼g/ml) of the soluble analyte FOG (A), B2-C2 (B), S-C2 (C), B2-S (D), S-region (E), B2-aa304 (F), and FOG1-B (G), respectively. Injection of the analyte started at t = 0 s and stopped at t = 120 s. Only proteins with an intact S region showed concentration-dependent interaction with immobilized human IgG. A control measurement with glutathione S-transferase is shown in H. RU, response units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of the IgG Binding Region of FOGâIt was described previously that a truncated form of FOG (aa 1â278 of the mature protein), which was referred to as FOG1-B, did not bind IgG, indicating that the C-terminal part (aa 279â578) of the bacterial protein is crucial for the interaction with the immunoglobulin (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To localize the responsible IgG binding region, suitable recombinant FOG fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and tested in ligand blot experiments (Fig. 1) and SPR measurements (Fig. 3, BâG) for binding to human IgG. Both approaches gave identical results. In control experiments glutathione S-transferase did not show any binding to IgG either in ligand blots (data not shown) or in SPR measurements (Fig. 3H). In accordance with previous experiments (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), FOG1-B did not bind IgG (Fig. 3G). The minimal motif tested positive for IgG binding (aa 233â339) was the S-region of FOG (Fig. 3E). Truncation after amino acid 304 (B2-aa304) abolished the interaction completely (Fig. 3F). Constructs that started with amino acid 305 (aa305-S and aa305-C1) were also not capable of binding IgG (Fig. 1). For the interaction between the S-region and IgG, a dissociation constant of 890 pm was determined by SPR measurements. However, when the FOG fragment comprised the S-region together with flanking regions like the B2 domain (B2-S, Fig. 3D), the C-repeats C1 and C2 (S-C2; Fig. 3C), or both the B2 and the C-repeats (B2-C2; Fig. 3B), its affinity for IgG was significantly increased. This was judged by the dissociation constants measured by SPR of 610, 480, and 220 pm, respectively. These data imply that the flanking regions contributed to the structural integrity of the binding motif that was localized in the S-region of FOG. FOG Accumulates IgG on the Bacterial SurfaceâTo test whether FOG contributes to binding IgG to the bacterial surface, the fog gene of strain G45 was interrupted to generate a FOG-deficient mutant (G45ÎFOG). Insertion of the destructive DNA element was tested by Southern blot, and in contrast to lysates of the wild type strain, lysates of the mutant did not contain the protein FOG (results not shown). Binding of fibrinogen was abolished in G45ÎFOG (Fig. 4A), corroborating previous data about FOG-mediated fibrinogen binding to GGS (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additionally, by disrupting the prtG gene, a protein G-deficient mutant (G45ÎproteinG) was generated. When binding of radiolabeled human IgG to whole bacteria was examined (Fig. 4B), the wild type strain had the highest capacity for IgG. It bound 69â80% of the labeled IgG. Strain G45ÎFOG had a clearly decreased capacity but was capable of binding more than 57% of the IgG even at the lowest bacterial concentration tested. Strain G45ÎproteinG had even lower capacity for IgG, but still, considerable binding of the immunoglobulin was measured (25â65%). The results indicate that FOG, like protein G, contributes substantially in accumulating IgG on the GGS surface. Influence of Fc-binding GGS Proteins on the Interaction between IgG and the C1 ComplexâTo gain insight into the biological functions of the Fc-binding proteins of GGS, their interaction with the triggering component of the classical pathway of the complement system, the C1 complex, was examined. Because both FOG and protein G bind IgG to the surface of GGS (Fig. 4B) by interacting with its Fc-region, it was interesting to test if such surface-bound IgG is recognized by factor C1q or whether FOG or protein G interferes with C1q binding. To test binding of human C1q to whole bacteria, GGS isolates that were known to carry FOG and protein G (G41 and G45) or protein G only (G148) were chosen. When comparative absorption experiments were performed, the FOG-positive strains G41 (Fig. 5) and G45 (see Fig. 7A), but not the FOG-negative strain G148 (Fig. 5), bound C1q from non-immune human blood plasma. The three subunits of C1q (25â30 kDa) were resolved and detected in Western blot using an anti-serum specific against human C1q.FIGURE 7Examination of C1q binding using a FOG-deficient and a protein G-deficient mutant. A, binding of C1q to G45 (lanes 1 and 3) and to G45ÎFOG (lanes 2 and 4) from blood plasma (lanes 1 and 2) and after consecutive incubation with IgG and C1q (lanes 3 and 4). wt, wild type. B, binding of C1q to G45 (lane 1) and to G45ÎproteinG (lane 2) from blood plasma. The samples in A and B were examined by analyzing the bacterial eluates in Western blot. Mr standards are indicated to the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To dissect the system of occurring interactions, isolated C1q was added to the bacteria with or without preincubation with human IgG (Fig. 6A). Neither FOG-positive bacteria (G41) nor FOG-negative bacteria (G148) bound isolated C1q, indicating that direct binding of C1q to the GGS surface is of negligible magnitude. After preincubation, both GGS strains accumulated similar amounts of IgG, but only the FOG-positive strain G41 bound C1q. Experiments with the Fc fragment of IgG paralleled those results, demonstrating that a non-immune interaction with Fc-binding proteins is involved for the C1q binding (Fig. 6B, for Fc binding see also Fig. 2B). The quantity of bound C1q, however, was considerably lower, so that only the subunit with the strongest signal was detected in the Western blot. To test FOG-dependent C1q binding in the same genetic background, experiments were carried out with strain G45 and its FOG-deficient mutant (G45ÎFOG). Incubated with nonimmune plasma, G45 but not G45ÎFOG bound C1q on its surface, unambiguously identifying FOG as the responsible protein (Fig. 7A). Consecutive incubation with IgG and C1q verified that the FOG-mediated C1q binding was IgG-dependent (Fig. 7A). Moreover, the protein G-deficient mutant (G45Îprotein G) retained binding of C1q to the bacterial surface, further emphasizing protein FOG as the responsible protein (Fig. 7B). On the surface of G148 as well as on the FOG-deficient mutant G45ÎFOG, the major IgG binding molecule is protein G. The experiments, thus, demonstrate that binding of protein G to IgG efficiently prevents opsonization by C1q. On the surface of G41 and G45, however, a second population of IgG, bound via FOG, was present. This population was capable of binding C1q. Competition experiments with IgG coupled to immunobeads demonstrated that binding of radiolabeled FOG could be inhibited by the addition of protein G (Fig. 8A). This indicates an overlap in the targeted binding motifs on IgG and suggests that simultaneous binding of FOG and protein G to one heavy chain of IgG did not occur. In summary, the experiments demonstrate that FOG facilitates an IgG-dependent binding of C1q on GGS under non-immune conditions and even in the presence of other plasma proteins (e.g. fibrinogen), whereas protein G counteracts opsonization by the first component of the classical pathway, the C1 complex. We, therefore, propose the model depicted in Fig. 8B. Binding of immunoglobulins is a key event in immune defense being crucial for the development of humoral immune response and contributing to innate immunity. Such host responses greatly depend on antigen binding. Streptococci have evolved a variety of proteins for non-immune binding of IgG. The role of these interactions is thought to be inactivation of IgG, but the consequences of such binding are widely understudied. On the bacterial surface non-immune binding of immunoglobulins and the mode of binding may have an important influence on the recognition by Fc receptors on phagocytes as well as on recognition by the first step of the classical pathway of the complement system, the C1 complex. The latter point has been addressed in this study. One major IgG-binding protein of GGS is protein G (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that soluble protein G does not interfere with the binding of subcomponent C1q to IgG (23Berge A. Kihlberg B.M. SjÃ¶holm A.G. BjÃ¶rck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a role of protein G in protection against the classical pathway was arguable. However, the interactions in solution may not necessarily represent those occurring at the streptococcal surface where protein G is arrayed on the cell wall of GGS with a defined orientation and spacing and where protein G is present as a full-length protein. Also, it cannot be excluded that co-factors on the bacterial surface contribute to the ability of protein G to arrest IgG. Comparing protein G and FOG-expressing strains (G41, G45) with strains deficient for FOG (G148, G45ÎFOG) revealed that the IgG population attached to the GGS surface by non-immune binding to protein G does not promote or even allow considerable binding of C1q to the bacterial surface. Although contribution of hitherto unknown co-factors cannot be excluded, the presented results clearly indicate that interaction with protein G abolishes the capability of IgG to bind C1q. We, therefore, conclude that they reflect a function of protein G, which is to prevent activation of the classical pathway of complement. Protein G interacts with the interface region of Fc, which connects the CÎ³2 with the CÎ³3 domain of IgG (24Stone G.C. SjÃ¶bring U. BjÃ¶rck L. SjÃ¶quist J. Barber C.V. Nardella F.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar, 25Reis K.J. Ayoub E.M. Boyle M.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3098-3102PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ãkerstrom B. BjÃ¶rck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of C1q-interaction is localized in the C-terminal part of the CÎ³2 domain of IgG (27Duncan A.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The close vicinity of these sites may allow protein G to interfere sterically, preventing the interaction with C1q. Competition between FOG and protein G for IgG binding indicates that the binding site for FOG is also in or close to the interface region but distant enough not to interfere with binding of C1q to the CÎ³2 domain. M-like protein FOG is found on a large number of clinical GGS isolates from human patients (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Like protein G, FOG can be an abundant surface component of GGS. Its mode of IgG binding differs clearly from that of protein G, which manifests itself in allowing the interaction between FOG-bound IgG and C1/C1q. To our knowledge this is the first report about non-immune binding of IgG to bacteria that can lead to recruitment of this early component of the classical pathway of complement to the bacterial surface. Unlike protein G, which binds all subclasses of human IgG (15BjÃ¶rck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar), FOG binds the subclasses IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 but not IgG3 (Fig. 2A). Notably, IgG1 was found to be efficient in binding of C1q and C1 activation. This suggests that FOG-bound IgG1 triggers the complement cascade, which at first sight appears disadvantageous for the streptococci. A protective effect of FOG in a whole blood phagocytosis assay (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicates that anti-phagocytic actions of FOG overcome possible detrimental effects of IgG and C1q binding. Among those anti-phagocytic actions is the formation of FOG/fibrinogen aggregates that exert an anti-phagocytic effect on neutrophils, as reported recently (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also recently, it was described that fibrinogen, bound by M5 to the surface of S. pyogenes, reduces the amount of classical pathway C3 convertase on the bacterial surface, diminishing deposition of downstream components of the complement system (12Carlsson F. Sandin C. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar function of FOG is conceivable. The majority of GGS isolates that cause human infections are equipped with M or M-like proteins (28Simpson W.J. Robbins J.C. Cleary P.P. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 3: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Many possess FOG or homologues of FOG (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Nitsche D.P. Johansson H.M. Frick I.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together with protein G such strains possess two differently specialized tools to handle IgG. The role of protein G is to act as an anti-opsonin that blocks an important interaction of the innate immune system. Protein FOG contributes to accumulating IgG molecules on the surface of GGS but does not interfere with the interaction between IgG and C1. A potential initiation of the classical pathway due to FOG may not be a threat for the bacteria since FOG is a potent anti-phagocytic factor (13Johansson H.M. MÃ¶rgelin M. Frick I.M. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Production of anaphylatoxins due to a triggered complement cascade and possible induction of inflammatory responses, however, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of GGS infections. We are indebted to Lars BjÃ¶rck and Dick HeinegÃ¥rd for valuable and encouraging discussions. We are grateful to Bianka Karge and Ulla Johannesson for expert technical assistance."

This transition brings catalytic residues into place to enable ATP hydrolysis, and at the same time it causes a swing of the myosin lever arm into a primed state, which is a prerequisite for the power stroke. By introducing point mutations into a subdomain interface at the base of the myosin lever arm at positions Lys84 and Arg704, we caused modulatory changes in the equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke, which we could accurately resolve using the fluorescence signal of single tryptophan Dictyostelium myosin II constructs. Our results shed light on a novel role of the recovery stroke: fine-tuning of this reversible equilibrium influences the functional properties of myosin through controlling the effective rates of ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release. After ATP binding the myosin head undergoes a large structural rearrangement called the recovery stroke.

Our results shed light on a novel role of the recovery stroke: fine-tuning of this reversible equilibrium influences the functional properties of myosin through controlling the effective rates of ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release. Various steps of the myosin mechanochemical cycle are linked to large conformational changes of the motor domain, which contains the actin and ATP binding sites as well as the converter region that forms the base of the extended lever arm domain. The converter/lever arm module is thought to amplify the structural changes occurring at the ATPase active site to produce a large working stroke (1Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 2Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 161-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Upon interacting with ATP, the motor domain undergoes a crystallographically identified large structural rearrangement before hydrolysis takes place. During this transition, the movement of the switch-2 loop of the active site toward the Î³-phosphate of ATP brings catalytically important residues to their active positions. This open-closed transition of switch-2 is coupled to a large rotation of the lever arm (from down to a primed up state), and thus the conformational rearrangement has been termed the recovery stroke, which constitutes the priming of the myosin head in an actin-detached state. Rebinding of myosin to actin in the post-recovery (up) conformation is a prelude to the power stroke and force generation (3Zeng W. Conibear P.B. Dickens J.L. Cowie R.A. Wakelin S. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Bagshaw C.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies on a Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain construct containing a single ATP-sensitive tryptophan sensor (W501+ located in the relay-converter module) have revealed the correspondence between identified structural states and ATPase intermediates (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A.

In the model shown in Reaction 1, ATP binding to apo-myosin (Mapo) 3The abbreviation used is: M, myosin; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. (K1k2) is followed by the recovery stroke (K3a), which is reversible and rapid compared with the subsequent hydrolysis step (K3b). Following hydrolysis, the reversal of the recovery stroke (K4) is thought to occur before the actual release of Pi (k5). Reaction 1 and the current study deals with the myosin ATPase in the absence of actin, where lever arm motions are uncoupled from the performance of external work. ADP release (K6K7) occurs practically as a reversal of the ATP binding process. (Reaction 1 ignores possible protein structural and/or dynamic differences between the MdownÂ·ATP, MdownÂ·ADP, and MdownÂ·ADPÂ·Pi states.) The above mechanism gives rise to the hypothesis that a shift in the equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke (K3a) will have an effect on the apparent rate constant of ATP hydrolysis (because appkH = k3bK3a/(1+K3a) + k-3b). Furthermore, because Pi release is thought to occur in the switch-2 open (down) conformation, the reversal of the recovery stroke (K4) may influence the steady-state ATPase rate, which is controlled by the effective rate of Pi release. Thus, besides its role in ATP hydrolysis and priming the myosin head, the recovery stroke may be important in fine-tuning the steady-state distribution of myosin molecules in up and down lever arm orientations and, in turn, the strong and weak actin binding states during the contractile cycle. To test this hypothesis, we designed Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain mutants to perturb the recovery stroke selectively. This step is accompanied by a large rotation of the converter region that causes disruption of its interface to the N-terminal subdomain of the myosin head (Fig. 1, A and B). One good candidate for a directed change in the interaction pattern of this interface is the Lys84 (N-terminal subdomain)-Arg704 (converter) residue pair. In the down (pre-recovery) conformation the two side chains, unusually, run almost parallel to each other and their positive charges are separated by only â¼0.5 nm (Fig. 1A). In the up (post-recovery) structure this complex is disrupted (Fig. 1B), implying that the introduction of site-directed substitutions in these positions will possibly affect the recovery stroke equilibrium constant. We constructed and characterized the K84M point mutant in which the positive charge of Lys84 was removed and the side chain replaced by a roughly isosteric one and R704E in which we intended to convert the originally repulsive Lys84-Arg704 interaction into a salt bridge. We introduced these point mutations into the W501+ single tryptophan construct, which has been shown to enable very sensitive resolution of the recovery stroke, while retaining essentially identical kinetic properties to the wild-type enzyme (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In later sections we will refer to the W501+ control as âwild-typeâ for simplicity. Protein Expression and PurificationâAll constructs used in this study are derivatives of the M761 Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain (6Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Construction of the plasmid for the W501+ motor domain containing the point mutations W36F, W432F, and W584F was described earlier (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The W501+ construct was further mutagenized to yield the K84M and R704E mutants as described previously (7Kovacs M. Toth J. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Bagshaw C.R. Nyitray L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The pDXA-3H expression vector was used for constitutive expression of the motor domains (8Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium AX3 cells were transformed and cultured and the recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma). Purity of the preparations (>95%) was checked by 9% SDS-PAGE. Nucleotides and Nucleotide Analog ComplexesâATP (special quality, vanadate-free) was from Roche Applied Science. Other nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. The MÂ·ADPÂ·BeFx complex was prepared by incubation of 5â20 Î¼m motor domain, 50 Î¼m ADP, 3 mm NaF, 50 Î¼m BeCl2 for 30 min. The MÂ·ADPÂ·AlF4 complex was made similarly but with 50 Î¼m AlCl3 instead of BeCl2 and incubation for at least 2 h. Kinetic and Spectroscopic MeasurementsâAll measurements were carried out in a buffer comprising 20 mm TES, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 as described previously (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R.

J. 2002; 366: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reaction profiles were analyzed by fitting to exponential functions using Origin v7.5 (Microcal Software). Molecular Dynamics SimulationsâProtein Data Bank structure 1FMW and its single point mutants were used as inputs in the modeling studies. Energy minimization and subsequent 5-ns molecular dynamics equilibration were performed with the GROMACS program package (10Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). 17800 explicit water molecules surrounded the proteins during calculations. Structural Integrity of the MutantsâMolecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutant proteins in a water box showed that the amino acid substitutions did not cause significant structural changes even in the vicinity of the targeted side chains and that the structures were stable over a 5-ns time scale (Fig. 1, CâE). The charge separation between Lys84 and Glu704 in the R704E mutant was rather similar to that between Lys84 and Arg704 of the wild-type enzyme (0.5 nm). Also, the side chain of Met84 in the K84M mutant adopted a very similar conformation to the corresponding Lys84 of the wild-type construct and had a similar proximity to Arg704. Steady-state ATPase ActivitiesâThe basal (actin-free) steady-state ATPase activity of K84M was â¼1.5 times, and that of R704E was â¼3 times, higher than that of the wild-type construct (Table 1). In addition to the NADH-linked assay, ATPase activities were confirmed by multiple turnover tryptophan fluorescence (as described in Ref. (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R.

Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Reaction 1). Fig. 2 shows tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the studied constructs in the absence of nucleotide, and in ADP and ATP. The extent of the quench caused by ADP was similar in all constructs, whereas the fluorescence increase on ATP addition was markedly smaller in R704E than in the other two constructs. The blue shifts characteristic of both ADP and ATP binding to apo-W501+ were not affected by the mutations (Fig. 2). We measured the temperature dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence emission of the studied constructs (Fig. 3, AâC). The slope of the temperature dependence of the wild-type construct in the absence of nucleotide, in ADP, and ADPÂ·AlF4 (an ADPÂ·Pi analog) was similar to that of free tryptophan, implying that the motor domain adopts three distinct conformations with different fluorescence intensities in these cases (apo in the absence of nucleotide, down in ADP, and up in ADPÂ·AlF4) (Fig. 3A) (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence was clearly different in ATP and in the ATP analogs ADPÂ·BeFx and AMPPNP. The intermediate intensities and markedly different slopes in these cases have been interpreted by means of the formation of a temperature-dependent reversible equilibrium of the down and up states, i.e. the recovery stroke (Fig. 3A) (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the apo, ADP (down), and ADPÂ·AlF4 (up) states, the K84M and R704E constructs showed similar profiles to those of the wild type, indicating that the gross structures of these states are unchanged by the mutations (Fig. 3, AâC). For ADPÂ·BeFx and AMPPNP, the equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke (K3a) could be calculated from fluorescence intensities as K3a = (Fx - Fdown)/(Fup - Fx) where Fx, Fdown, and Fup are fluorescence intensities in the presence of the given nucleotide, ADP (down state), and ADPÂ·AlF4 (up state), respectively. The equilibrium parameters showed that the K84M mutation, and even more so the R704E mutation, caused marked shifts in favor of the down conformation (Table 1). In ATP the situation is more complex because the apparent equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke (appK3a) is also affected by the hydrolysis step (appK3a = K3a(1 + K3b), Reaction 1), but a shift toward the down state in R704E is evident even in this case (Fig. 3, AâC). Although the mutations shifted the equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke (K3a) several times, these have only small perturbations in the overall energetic profile of this step. The small ÎGo associated with the recovery stroke is composed of a large enthalpy increase (ÎHo = 50â100 kJ/mol) and a compensating entropic contribution (Fig. 3, D and E, Table 1) in all mutants and the wild type. Kinetics of ATP InteractionâOn mixing the W501+ motor domain with ATP in the stopped-flow, the two-step ATP binding process (K1k2 in Reaction 1) is followed by the more rapid recovery stroke (K3a) and the subsequent hydrolysis step (K3b) (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the initial phase of the tryptophan fluorescence transients is dictated by nucleotide binding (K1k2), but the amplitude of this phase will be set by the equilibrium constant of the oncoming rapid recovery stroke (K3a). Because the W501 fluorescence intensity in the down state is lower and in the up state is higher than that in the apo state, the initial phase can be either a burst (fluorescence increase) or a quench (fluorescence drop), depending on the value of K3a. After this initial phase, there is a subsequent fluorescence enhancement indicating that the hydrolysis step (K3b â« 1) pulls the reaction over to result in the predominance of the high fluorescence MupÂ·ADPÂ·Pi state (Reaction 1). The observed rate constant (kobs) of this second phase (i.e. the apparent rate constant of ATP hydrolysis, appkH) will be a composite of the recovery stroke equilibrium constant and the rate constants of the hydrolysis step (appkH = k3bK3a/(K3a + 1) + k-3b; Reaction 1) (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The dependence of the kobs of the initial phase on ATP concentration was quasilinear in all mutants, showing signs of saturation above 1 mm ATP (K1 â¤ 10-3 Î¼m-1, data not shown). The plots had slopes (K1k2) â¼ 0.5 Î¼m-1 s-1 at 5 Â°C, and â¼1 Î¼m-1 s-1 at 20 Â°C, consistent with earlier wild-type data and showing little effect of the mutations on ATP binding kinetics (Table 1) (4Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, a more pronounced initial quench (or a lack of an initial burst) together with a slower second phase (smaller appkH) in the mutants compared with the wild-type demonstrated a marked reduction in the recovery stroke equilibrium constant (K3a) caused by the mutations (Fig. 4, A and B). Fig. 4C shows the kobs of the second phase at 20 Â°C plotted against ATP concentration. A marked reduction in the maximal kobs was observed in K84M and even more in R704E. This tendency held throughout the temperature range studied (5â20 Â°C, Fig. 4D). Analysis of the amplitude data of the stopped-flow transients also highlighted the correspondence between the recovery stroke equilibrium constant (K3a) and the apparent rate constant of the hydrolysis step (appkH). The fluorescence levels after the initial phase were lower in K84M and even more in R704E than in the wild-type (indicating a smaller K3a), whereas in the second phase ATP hydrolysis (K3b) pulled the reaction to the high fluorescence MupÂ·ADPÂ·Pi state in all cases (Fig. 4E, Reaction 1). Kinetics of the Recovery StrokeâBecause the recovery stroke is much faster than both the preceding and subsequent steps, its kinetics can be investigated only by its selective perturbation using relaxation kinetic techniques (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following a rapid pressure-jump, the motor domain-nucleotide analog (ADPÂ·BeFx and AMPPNP) complexes showed conformational relaxation of the reversible and pressure-sensitive recovery stroke (Fig. 5A). The kobs of these tryptophan fluorescence transients is the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants (kobs = k3a + k-3a). k3a and k-3a in the ADPÂ·BeFx and AMPPNP complexes of the motor domain could thus be determined from the kobs of the pressure-jump records and the K3a equilibrium constants determined in equilibrium fluorescence measurements (Fig. 3, Table 1). Fig. 5B shows that the shift toward the down state (a reduction in K3a) caused by the mutations is brought about predominantly by a reduction in k3a, whereas the reverse rate constant (k-3a) remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, in the Arrhenius plots of these rate constants the slopes of ln k3a or ln k-3a versus 1/T were very similar in all constructs, whereas the k3a values of the mutants were markedly offset from those in the wild-type (Fig. 5, C and D). This means that the mutations caused a reduction in the pre-exponential term of the Arrhenius equation, but the exponential term remained largely unchanged (k = A exp(E#/RT) where A is the pre-exponential term and E# is the activation energy; Table 2).TABLE 2Arrhenius parameters of the recovery strokeRate constantaRate constants were extracted from the predominant phase of pressure jump records. They were calculated from the pressure jump kobs (=k3a + kâ3a) values and the K3a (=k3a/kâ3a) values calculated from steady-state fluorescence intensities (Figs. 3 and 5, Table I).

Differences between wild-type and mutants were within experimental error Open table in a new tab Kinetics of ADP Binding and ReleaseâOn mixing with excess ADP in the stopped-flow, all constructs showed a single exponential quench in tryptophan fluorescence (traces not shown). Analysis of the hyperbolic dependence of kobs on ADP concentration (kobs = k-6[ADP]/(K7 + [ADP]) + k6) showed that the initial low affinity binding step (K7) was not affected by the mutations, whereas the rate constant of the subsequent isomerization (k-6) was slightly reduced (Fig. 6A, Table 1, Reaction 1). The rate constants of ADP dissociation (k6) were determined by chasing experiments in which the motor domainÂ·ADP complexes were mixed with high concentrations of ATP in the stopped-flow (Fig. 6B). The mutations had no profound effect on either k6 or the overall ADP binding equilibrium constant (Keq = K7K6; Table 2). Selective Perturbation of the Recovery Stroke by Subdomain InteractionsâWe aimed to selectively perturb the myosin recovery stroke by converting the repulsive Lys84-Arg704 interaction into a weak attraction in the K84M mutant and a salt bridge in the R704E construct (Fig. 1). These mutations are located at the N-terminal subdomain-converter interface, which is far from the nucleotide binding pocket. As judged from the kinetics of nucleotide binding to and release from the mutants as well as molecular dynamic simulations, the substitutions did not affect the overall structure of the nucleotide binding site (Fig. 1). However, the mutations had a distinct effect on the recovery stroke that involves marked conformational rearrangements involving distant parts of the molecule. Thus, the studied mutations modulated surface charges sufficiently to have an effect on recovery stroke kinetics, but they did not override the structures of the start and end points of this transition. In all constructs ADP induced the same pre-recovery (switch-2 open or lever arm down) state and ADPÂ·AlF4 induced the post-recovery (switch-2 closed or lever arm up) state, as judged by W501 emission intensity (Fig. 3, AâC). Other attractive forces across the subdomain interface in the wild type must dominate over the repulsive force between Lys84 and Arg704 in the down state in order to bring them to within 0.5 nm. The wild-type Lys84-Arg704 repulsive interaction exists only in the down state, and we show that this state becomes more favorable in the order wild-type â K84M â R704E. It should be noted that the R704E mutation would also disrupt a salt bridge to Glu755 within the same subdomain; however, this appears to have little consequence on the overall properties of this construct. In particular, in the K84M mutant where the Arg704-Glu755 salt bridge was intact, the kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the recovery stroke were perturbed in the same direction as in the R704E construct. The Recovery Stroke Is Coupled to ATP Hydrolysis and Pi ReleaseâBy characterizing the transient fluorescence profiles of the interaction of the mutants with ATP and their steady-state ATPase activity, we demonstrate that even a moderate decrease in the equilibrium constant of the rapid and reversible recovery stroke causes significant slowing of ATP hydrolysis, which takes place after the recovery stroke (Fig. 4, Table 1, Reaction 1). Conversely, Pi release, which is the rate-limiting step of the basal ATPase cycle and takes place after the reversal of the recovery stroke (K4), is accelerated by the same mutations (Table 1, Reaction 1). This finding is consistent with earlier work in which trinitrophenylation of Lys84 caused a marked increase in the basal steady-state ATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin II because the pre-recovery state became predominant during the enzymatic cycle (13Ajtai K. Peyser Y.M. Park S. Burghardt T.P. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6428-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mechanism of the Recovery StrokeâWe show that the studied mutations selectively decreased the forward rate constant of the recovery stroke (k3a), whereas they did not have a remarkable effect on the reverse rate constant (k-3a) (Fig. 5B, Table 2). The structural basis of the asymmetric effect is the disruption of the subdomain interface containing residues 84 and 704 upon the recovery stroke that moves these residues â¼3.8 nm apart from each other (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Because only a short-range interaction can be formed between these side chains, the mutations do not affect the reverse rate constant (k-3b). It is surprising that, although the mutations targeted a specific side chain interaction that could be expected to have an enthalpic character, the pre-exponential factor changed rather than the apparent activation energy of the recovery stroke (Fig. 5, C and D, Table 2). The mutations investigated in the present study affect short-range interactions in the pre-recovery conformation, and therefore they limit the entry into the pathway leading to the conformational change and possibly reshape the diffusion landscape in the initial part of the pathway. The recent simulations of the reaction coordinate of the myosin recovery stroke using Conjugate Peak Refinement provide some indications as to the nature of this pathway (14Fischer S. Windshugel B.

Protein conformational changes that gate enzyme activity and protein folding are likely to share these characteristics. Role of the Recovery Stroke Equilibrium in the Myosin MechanismâBy affecting the effective rate of ATP hydrolysis and Pi release, the equilibrium constant of the recovery stroke may influence the distribution of steady-state enzymatic intermediates during the functioning of myosins. Given the widely varying actin affinities of these intermediates, this effect may also influence the duty ratio, i.e. the fractional occupancy of strongly actin-bound myosin states during steady-state ATPase cycling. The duty ratio is a key functional parameter for the effective functioning of different motors. (For instance, ensemble motors such as muscle myosin II exhibit a low duty ratio, whereas single-molecule stepping by myosin V requires a high duty ratio.) Indeed, the ATP hydrolysis step is quite reversible in most myosins examined: the apparent equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis of enzyme-bound ATP (appKH) is between 0.3 and 9 for various myosins (15Bagshaw C.R.

Because the chemical step is coupled to the recovery stroke (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the recovery stroke equilibrium constant (K3a) is likely to be a key modulator of appKH in most cases (in case of quasi-irreversible ATP binding, appKH = K3aK3b/(1 + K3a + K3aK3b); Reaction 1). appKH, in turn, can significantly influence the duty ratio by limiting the rate of entry into the strong binding actomyosin complex. Interestingly, Arg704 is highly conserved among at least eight myosin classes (including myosins I, II, and V) whereas Lys84 is only conserved within class II myosins (19Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Thus, the residues mutated in the current study may even play a role in the functional diversity of myosins, which hypothesis needs further investigation."

The viral promoter carries three cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs), which are recognized by the cellular transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Tax binds to GC-rich sequences that immediately flank the CREs. The coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 binds to this promoter-bound ternary complex, which promotes the initiation of HTLV-1 transcription. Protein kinase A phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 facilitates transcription from cellular CREs by recruiting CBP/p300 via its KIX domain. However, it remains controversial whether CREB phosphorylation plays a role in Tax transactivation. In this study, we biochemically characterized the quaternary complex formed by Tax, CREB, KIX, and the viral CRE by examining the individual molecular interactions that contribute to Tax stabilization in the complex. Our data show KIX, Ser133-phosphorylated CREB, and vCRE DNA are all required for stable Tax incorporation into the complex in vitro. Consonant with a fundamental role for CREB phosphorylation in Tax recruitment to the complex, we found that CREB is highly phosphorylated in a panel of HTLV-1-infected human T-cell lines. Significantly, we show that Tax is directly responsible for promoting elevated levels of CREB phosphorylation. Together, these data support a model in which Tax promotes CREB phosphorylation in vivo to ensure availability for Tax transactivation. Because pCREB has been implicated in leukemogenesis, enhancement of CREB phosphorylation by the virus may play a role in the etiology of adult T-cell leukemia.

Although the vast majority of individuals infected with the retrovirus remain asymptomatic for life, 2â5% go on to develop this aggressive leukemia (1Matsuoka M. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 2-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Expression of the HTLV-1-encoded Tax protein is strongly linked to the development of ATL. Tax is a potent transcription factor that strongly activates transcription, and thus replication, of the HTLV-1 genome. Tax stimulates viral transcription by binding the minor groove of the GC-rich DNA sequences that flank the CRE elements within three conserved 21-bp enhancers (2Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lenzmeier B.A. Baird E.E. Dervan P.B. Nyborg J.K. J. Mol.

These enhancers, called viral cyclic AMP response elements (vCREs), are located within the promoter of the provirus. Tax also interacts with the cellular transcription factor CREB, which binds the off-consensus CRE octanucleotide centered within each vCRE. These interactions enable formation of a ternary complex that is critical for activation of viral transcription by Tax.The TaxÂ·CREBÂ·vCRE complex recruits the multifunctional cellular coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralogue p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter, forming a quaternary complex that enables strong transcriptional activation through the intrinsic properties of these coactivators (6Lemasson I.

CBP/p300 are necessary for mediating activated transcription by a large number of transcription factors, although they do not directly bind DNA. CBP was originally discovered and named for its interaction with protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) (11Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Ser133-phosphorylated CREB binds to the KIX domain of CBP (â¼amino acids 585â680), which is composed of three Î±-helices that form a compact hydrophobic core (12Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A shallow hydrophobic groove on the surface of the core serves as the binding site for the kinase-inducible domain of phosphorylated CREB. Tax also binds KIX, both free in solution and when assembled in the ternary complex (7Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).The role of CREB phosphorylation in Tax transactivation remains controversial after over a decade of study. Previous studies have shown that CREB phosphorylation was not necessary for optimal Tax transactivation, whereas other studies have found that PKA stimulation increases Tax transactivation (14Kadison P. Poteat H.T. Klein K.M. Faller D.V. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Poteat H.T. Kadison P. McGuire K. Park L. Sodroski J. Haseltine W. J.

This question has been difficult to address in vivo because of the pleiotropic effects of CREB phosphorylation and the wide variety of cell lines studied. A basal level of CREB phosphorylation exists even in unstimulated and serum-starved conditions, and phosphorylation-defective CREB mutants may exert global effects on transcription with obvious ramifications for Tax transactivation. The precise role of CREB phosphorylation in Tax transactivation remains elusive.In this report, we sought to better characterize the detailed molecular interactions that contribute to the formation and stabilization of the Tax-containing quaternary complex. We demonstrate that strong Tax binding to the KIX domain of CPB/p300 requires viral CRE DNA and phosphorylated CREB. Additionally, we find that KIX greatly stabilizes Tax binding to the CREBÂ·vCREÂ·DNA complex. Further, we show that the incorporation of phosphorylated CREB is required for formation of a stable complex containing Tax, KIX, and vCRE DNA. Our data support a concerted mechanism of complex formation in which Tax, pCREB, and the KIX domain of CBP/p300 are all required for optimal binding at the HTLV-1 promoter.Based on these in vitro results showing the importance of pCREB for Tax stability in the complex, we investigated levels of CREB phosphorylation in HTLV-1-infected cells. We observed higher levels of intracellular pCREB in a panel of HTLV-1-infected versus uninfected T-cell lines. Significantly, we found that Tax expression directly enhanced CREB phosphorylation. These observations suggest that Tax promotes CREB phosphorylation in vivo to ensure sufficient pCREB availability for promoter-bound complex formation and robust Tax transactivation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsâBacterially expressed CREB A (17Franklin A.A.

Full-length His6-tagged p300 was expressed from recombinant baculovirus in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (19Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8123-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CREB A is a naturally occurring splice variant (amino acids 1â327) where Ser119 corresponds to Ser133 in human CREB B (amino acids 1â341) (20Berkowitz L.A. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5258-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion, we will use the Ser133 nomenclature throughout this work. The KIX domain of CBP used in this study is 85% identical to the p300 KIX domain. Amino acid differences fall largely outside of the minimal KIX domain, which includes the region of pCREB and Tax interaction. All proteins were dialyzed against TM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), aliquotted, and stored at â70 Â°C. CREB was phosphorylated using the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A by incubating 1.6 Î¼m CREB in a reaction containing 3.3 Î¼m ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 55 units of PKA (Sigma) in a 25-mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6. Successful CREB phosphorylation was confirmed by the absence of [Î³-32P]ATP incorporation following cold phosphorylation. To confirm PKA singly phosphorylates CREB at Ser133, we performed a kinase assay on wild-type CREB and CREB S133A using recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma) and [Î³-32P]ATP.OligonucleotidesâThe top strand sequence of the complementary oligonucleotides used in the experiments described herein are as follows. CRE core sequences are underlined.

A, The KIX domain and full-length p300 stabilize Tax binding. Immobilized vCREâ² DNA (5 nm) was incubated with pCREB (25 nm), Tax (25 nm), and either GST-KIX (25 nm) or full-length p300 (25 nm), as indicated. Lanes 5 and 6 are duplicate reactions, except lane 5 lacks the nonspecific competitors present in all other reactions. Samples were washed, and DNA-bound proteins were separated on a 10â20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot using a mixture of antibodies against CREB, the His6 tag, and GST.B, Tax binding precisely correlates with KIX binding to the vCRE. Increasing amounts of GST-KIX-(588â683) (2.5, 5, 12.5 nm) were added into binding reactions containing biotinylated vCREâ² DNA (5 nm), pCREB (12.5 nm), and Tax (12.5 nm). A biotinylated modified half-CRE with no GC-rich flanks (lane 2) was included as a negative control for Tax; it binds pCREB with a reduced affinity compared with the full consensus CRE. Tax input (20%) is shown in lane 1.A Western blot was first performed using an anti-His6 antibody to detect Tax (upper panel). The blot was then incubated with a mixture of antibodies against CREB and GST (lower panel). Each DNA pulldown experiment was repeated at least three times. Molecular weight markers are indicated at left. C, KIX increases the affinity of Tax for the vCREÂ·pCREB complex. EMSAs were performed with Î³-32P-end-labeled vCRE probe (0.15 nm), pCREB (1.5 nm), and increasing amounts of Tax (25â75 nm). Binding reactions were carried out in the absence (lanes 1â9) or presence (lanes 10â18) of GST-KIX-(588â683) (50 nm). Each nucleoprotein complex is indicated. The concentration of Tax at the midpoint of the transition from the binary to the ternary complex (lanes 1â9) and the binary to the quaternary complex (lanes 10â18) was used to calculate the apparent Kd of Tax for vCREÂ·pCREB and vCREÂ·pCREBÂ·KIX.

As before (Fig. 2B), a reaction containing a modified CRE half-site, pCREB, GST-KIX, and Tax is included as a negative control for Tax (lane 2). Samples were washed, and bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Consecutive Western blots were performed using antibodies against Tax (anti-His6), CREB, and GST-KIX (anti-GST). Tax input (20%) is shown in lane 1. Molecular weight markers are indicated at left. C, pCREB, Tax, and KIX are all needed for strong quaternary complex formation. Binding reactions for EMSAs contained Î³-32P-end-labeled viral CRE DNA probe (0.3 nm/reaction) and constant amounts of CREB (3.6 nm) or pCREB (1.8 nm), in the presence or absence of Tax (95 nm). GST-KIX-(588â683) was added to the reactions in increasing amounts (0.9, 7.4, and 36.8 nm, lanes 3â5 and 8â10, or 300 and 700 nm, lanes 12 and 13). Binding reactions were analyzed on a 5% native gel. Note that the pCREBÂ·DNA complex migrates with slightly reduced mobility relative to the CREBÂ·DNA complex. D, CREB is phosphorylated by PKA only at serine 133. In vitro phosphorylation of purified recombinant CREB and a CREB point mutant (serine 133 changed to alanine) was performed in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP and PKA. Proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by PhosphorImager.

All were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. An anti-Tax monoclonal antibody (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) was also used for detecting transfected Tax.GST Pulldown AssaysâGST pulldown experiments were performed as previously described (21Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of protein and DNA in each reaction are given in the figure legends. Bound proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for subsequent Western blot analysis.DNA Pulldown AssaysâDNA pulldown experiments were performed using streptavidin-coated-agarose beads (Novagen). Biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single CRE element were bound to streptavidin-agarose beads by incubating 90 min at 25 Â°C according to the manufacturer's directions. The amount of DNA bound was quantified by measuring the A260 of the DNA-containing supernatant before and after streptavidin-agarose bead binding. DNA-bound beads were stored in a 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 0.02% sodium azide solution and washed with 0.5Ã TM buffer before use in assays. Purified proteins were added to aliquots of the streptavidin-agarose bead-bound DNA in 0.5Ã TM buffer with 0.6 ng/Î¼l poly(dA)Â·poly(dT) and 39 nm bovine serum albumin added as nonspecific competitors, incubated 45 min at 4 Â°C, and washed three times to remove unbound proteins. DNA-bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10 or a 10â20% gradient SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for detection by Western blot analysis.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)âEMSAs were performed by incubation of the indicated amount of purified CREB, Tax, or GST-KIX-(588â683) in 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 Î¼m ZnSO4, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm EDTA containing 32P-end-labeled viral CRE probe and 250 ng/ml poly(dA)Â·poly(dT) in a 20-Î¼l reaction volume. Binding reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min and resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (49:1 (w/w), acrylamide: N,Nâ²-methylenebisacrylamide) in a buffer containing 0.04 m TrisÂ·HCl, 0.306 m glycine, pH 8.5, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Gels were dried and visualized by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection AssayâBoth HTLV-1-infected (SLB-1, MT-2, C8166) and uninfected (Jurkat, CEM, Molt-4) human T-cell lines were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. For whole cell extract preparation, cells were serum-starved by cultivation in the presence of 0.5% serum 24 h prior to harvest. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with 10 Î¼m forskolin. Cells were lysed and resuspended in SDS sample dyes. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. For transient transfection assays, cells were transfected with a constant amount of DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum) for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Tax (pSG-Tax) (22Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Gal4-CREB (Stratagene), and pUC19 as indicated in the experiment.Image ProcessingâThe ImageQuant program (GE Healthcare) was used to quantify results. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop, with minor adjustments made to brightness/contrast as needed (Î³ was kept at 1). No bands were obscured or altered. Images were annotated in PowerPoint. All experiments presented in this report were shown to be reproducible in at least three independent trials.RESULTSThe Viral CRE and pCREB Enhance Tax Binding to the KIX Domain of CBPâTranscriptional activation of HTLV-1 requires, in part, the formation of a viral CRE-bound complex composed of Tax, CREB, and CBP/p300. However, a careful biochemical characterization of the precise molecular interactions that contribute to complex stability has not been performed. To carry out this study, we first examined whether Tax binding to the KIX domain of CBP is affected by vCRE DNA and/or pCREB. Purified GST-KIX-(588â683) was bound to glutathione-agarose beads and used in a GST pulldown assay together with full-length, purified, recombinant Tax and increasing amounts of purified, recombinant, PKA-phosphorylated human CREB A (pCREB). Binding reactions were performed in the absence or presence of double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying the viral CRE or cellular CRE DNA. The cellular CRE possesses a higher affinity CREB binding site than the vCRE and lacks the GC-rich flanking sequences required for Tax binding. The cellular CRE thus serves as a negative control for complex formation with Tax. The amount of Tax bound to GST-KIX was determined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 1A shows that Tax was poorly recruited to GST-KIX in the absence of DNA (lanes 2â5). The cellular CRE DNA only modestly enhanced Tax binding, consistent with the fact that this sequence lacks the GC-rich flanks (Fig. 1A, lanes 10â13). The addition of viral CRE DNA resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of Tax associated with GST-KIX (Fig. 1A, lanes 6â9). Importantly, we found that pCREB is also required for Tax recruitment to GST-KIX, as only small amounts of Tax bound to KIX in the absence of pCREB (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 6, 10). Titration of pCREB in the presence of the vCRE DNA yielded significantly more Tax binding to the complex (Fig. 1A, lanes 6â9). In binding reactions that contained both vCRE DNA and pCREB, we observed up to a 100-fold increase in Tax association with GST-KIX. In the presence of vCRE DNA, Tax and pCREB binding precisely correlated, further underscoring the importance of pCREB in the Tax-KIX interaction (Fig. 1B). Together, these experiments support previous studies demonstrating the importance of the GC-rich flanking sequences in the Tax-DNA interaction (2Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell.

We extend these observations to show that the vCRE DNA, together with pCREB, synergistically enhance Tax association with KIX. We performed the reciprocal experiment to that shown in Fig. 1A to test whether DNA and Tax enhanced pCREB association with GST-KIX. Fig. 1C shows that Tax modestly enhanced pCREB binding (â¼3-fold), but only in the presence of the vCRE DNA (lanes 5â8). These data show that pCREB has a much greater effect on Tax binding in the quaternary complex than Tax has on pCREB. Fig. 1D shows that Tax directly interacts with KIX without DNA or pCREB, as previously shown (9Yan J.P. Garrus J.E. Giebler H.A. Stargell L.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Mol.

However, this interaction is dramatically weaker than the Tax-KIX interaction in the presence of pCREB and DNA: 25 nm Tax was used in the binding reaction shown in Fig. 1A, whereas 1 Î¼m Tax was used in the binding reaction shown in Fig. 1D.Strong Tax Binding to the Viral CRE Requires the KIX Domain of CBPâTo investigate the effect of KIX on Tax binding, we performed DNA pulldown assays using complementary oligonucleotides in which a biotin group was added to the 5â²-end of the upper strand, enabling immobilization on streptavidin-agarose beads. The binding site, called vCREâ², carried the full vCRE sequence with a single base pair change to convert the off-consensus CRE to a consensus sequence. We have shown Tax recruitment to vCREâ² and vCRE is identical; however, CREB binds the vCREâ² with a slightly higher affinity than to the natural vCRE. We first used the DNA pulldown assay to evaluate the ability of KIX to stabilize Tax in the pCREBÂ·DNA complex. We compared GST-KIX-(588â683) with full-length p300 to assess the physiological relevance of our results. We observed a similar enhancement in Tax binding in the presence of KIX and p300 (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 4â6). We obtained similar results using purified, full-length CBP (data not shown). These data indicate that the KIX domain, and the full-length coactivators, play a role in the stabilization of Tax in the quaternary complex. We next evaluated the effect of KIX on Tax binding by performing a titration of KIX-(588â683) into DNA pulldown reactions containing Tax, pCREB, and vCREâ². We found that Tax binding to the vCREâ² DNA in complex with pCREB was strongly dependent on the presence of KIX in the reaction, giving an â¼70-fold increase in Tax binding relative to the absence of KIX (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 3â6). Tax and KIX binding precisely correlated in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B, lower panel). A biotinylated half-CRE site was used as a negative control for Tax binding (Fig. 2B, lane 2). EMSAs with 32P-labeled vCRE DNA were then used to more quantitatively assess the effect of KIX on Tax stability in the complex. We compared the apparent affinity of Tax for pCREBÂ·DNA versus pCREBÂ·KIXÂ·DNA (Fig. 2C). The apparent affinity of Tax for each complex was established by determining the Tax concentration at the midpoint of the binding transition from the binary to the ternary, and the ternary to quaternary complex. We found that the apparent affinity of Tax for the pCREBÂ·DNA complex was 60-fold higher in the presence of KIX (Fig. 2C). The binding of Tax reveals the presence of KIX in the complex, as it shifts to a higher position on the gel than pCREBÂ·TaxÂ·DNA (8Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E.

This result clearly highlights the importance of the KIX domain in stabilization of Tax in the complex.CREB Phosphorylation Is Necessary for Stable Tax Binding to Viral C"

Here we employed complementary footprinting techniques and show that the enzyme binds to a newly synthesized duplex of approximately seven to eight base pairs.

The protection pattern helps to define the trajectory of the nucleic acid substrate. Lys81, Lys98, Lys100, Lys106, Arg158, Arg386, and Arg394 probably interact with the bound RNA. The selective protection of amino acids of the arginine-rich region in helix T points to RNA-induced conformational rearrangements.

Dis. 2005; 5: 558-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which comprises other human pathogens, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, as well as yellow fever virus. The single (plus)-stranded HCV RNA genome encodes a polyprotein, which is processed into several smaller mature structural proteins, including the capsid protein (C), the envelope proteins (E1 and E2), and the nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). Initial cis cleavage through NS2âNS3 releases the NS3 protein, which, in turn, continues to process the precursor (for a review, see Ref. 3Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Nature. 2005; 436: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). NS5B is a 65-kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is capable of initiating RNA synthesis de novo, in the absence of a primer (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E.

Crystallographic snapshots of initial stages of the reaction that include ternary or quaternary complexes of NS5B with a bound RNA template and nucleotide substrates are not yet available. Modeling studies, on the basis of structures of the apoenzyme, suggest that the enzyme must undergo extensive conformational changes to accommodate the newly synthesized double-stranded RNA (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I.

The structure of HCV NS5B is reminiscent of a human right hand, although, in contrast to many other DNA or RNA polymerases with a similar fold, extensive interaction between the âthumbâ and the tips of the âfingersâ subdomains encircle the active site of NS5B (8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 9Ago H. Adachi T.

A Î²-hairpin or flap that comprises residues Leu443 to Ile454 and the C-terminal tail of the protein are both located in the vicinity of the active site and may cause steric conflicts with the newly synthesized double-stranded primer-template (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I.

At the same time, it should be noted that the precise positioning of the C terminus remains to be defined, because most of the structural and biochemical studies were performed with C-terminally truncated proteins to facilitate expression and purification procedures. HCV NS5B has also been co-crystallized with GTP (11Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition to the active site, the authors show that GTP can bind to the thumb domain in close proximity to the fingertip Î1 loop that is involved in interdomain interactions between the thumb and fingers. Although this allosteric GTP site lies 30 AÌ away from the polymerase active site, it is implicated in the regulation of dynamic interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains (12Cai Z. Yi M. Zhang C. Luo G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11607-11617Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Sarisky R.T. Gutshall L. Thomson M. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12207-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A complex of NS5B with a short RNA oligomer (rU5) provides structural information with regard to interaction between the 5â²-end of the single-stranded template at the entrance channel of the substrate (14O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jager J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The 3â²-end of the RNA substrate is seen in the vicinity of the active site, and it is evident that binding of the short oligomer does not affect the overall fold of the enzyme. However, it remains to be seen whether longer, biologically relevant substrates affect the conformation of the enzyme and how such substrates are accommodated. Structural information in this regard may provide the basis for a better understanding of both initiation and elongation processes. Here we employed two complementary footprinting methods that were designed to characterize the RNA-protein interface. RNA footprinting revealed that the NS5B enzyme is in contact with approximately seven to eight newly synthesized residues, and mass spectrometric nucleoprotein footprinting enabled us to identify specific lysines and arginines that are involved in RNA binding. Moreover, the protection pattern in the thumb subdomain points to structural rearrangements that affect intradomain interactions at the C-terminal region of the NS5B enzyme. Chemicals and Nucleic AcidâThe RNA template sequences used in this study were 5â²-AACAGUUUCCUUUUCUCUCC-3â² (T20-RNA), and 5â²-AACTTTTAGTCTTTTTTTTTTTTCTCC-3â² (T27-DNA), with the underlined base as the unique site of chain termination. The dinucleotide 5â²-GG-3â² served as a primer. Both RNA and DNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purified on 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels containing 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA, followed by elution from gel slices in a buffer containing 500 mm NH4Ac and 0.1% SDS. 5â²-End labeling of the GG primer was conducted with [Î³-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). NTPs were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and 3â²-dCTP was purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies. N-Hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin) and p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG) were purchased from Pierce and freshly resuspended in solution prior to use. Expression and Purification of HCV NS5BâThe HCV NS5B sequence (BK) inserted into the expression vector pET-22 (Novagen) was expressed as a C-terminal truncated enzyme (NS5BÎ21) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified utilizing a combination of metal ion affinity and ion exchange chromatography (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All mutant enzymes were generated through site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. All sequences were confirmed by sequencing at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. RNA Synthesis and Rescue AssayâStandard chain termination reaction mixtures consisted of 1 Î¼m RNA template, 1 Î¼m HCV NS5B, and 0.25 Î¼m radiolabeled GG primer in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. Reactions were started by adding 10 Î¼m GTP plus ATP and 3 Î¼m 3â²-dCTP with T20-RNA template and typically incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For the rescue reaction, 125 Î¼m PPi, 100 Î¼m CTP, and 5 Î¼m 3â²-dUTP were added to the chain termination mix for 30 min. The reactions were stopped and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 Â°C, and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) Protection AssayâRNA/DNA duplexes were generated by mixing together 1 Î¼m HCV NS5B and 0.25 Î¼m radiolabeled GG primer in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. Reactions were started by adding 10 Î¼m GTP plus ATP and 3 Î¼m 3â²-dCTP with T27-DNA template. After chain termination, the footprinting reaction was initiated by adding 0.015 units of E. coli RNase H (Fermentas) with 8 mm MgCl2, incubated at 37 Â°C for 2 and 5 min. Surface Topology Analysis of the Nucleoprotein ComplexâThe surface topology analyses of lysine and arginine residues were conducted as described previously (15Shkriabai N. Datta S.A. Zhao Z. Hess S. Rein A. Kvaratskhelia M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4077-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Kvaratskhelia M. Hess S. Qu Y. Zou Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32775-32783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, in parallel experiments, the preformed nucleoprotein complex comprising 1 Î¼m purified NS5B and equimolar 20-mer RNA T20-RNA was compared with the free protein. Surface accessibility of lysine residues was monitored using 100 Î¼m NHS-biotin in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. NHS-biotin reacts specifically with primary amines, resulting in the covalent addition of a biotin molecule (226 Da) to lysine residues with the concomitant release of N-hydroxysuccinimide. The biotinylation reactions were carried out at 25 Â°C for 40 min and were terminated by the addition of 10 mm (final concentration) lysine in its free amino acid form. To monitor surface accessibility of arginine residues, NS5B-RNA complexes were preformed and subjected to HPG modification in 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm boric acid, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. HPG reacts with guanidino groups on arginines, resulting in the 132-Da mass increment. The reactions were carried out at 30 Â°C for 40 min in the dark and were quenched with 10 mm (final concentration) arginine in its free amino acid form. Following treatments, the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and NS5B was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The band of interest was excised and extensively destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. SDS was removed by washing the gel pieces with ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and vacuum-desiccated. Samples were digested with 1 Î¼g of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at room temperature. The supernatant was then recovered for MS and MS/MS analysis. MS and MS/MS AnalysisâMS spectra were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and quadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) techniques. MALDI-TOF experiments were performed using a Kratos Axima-CRF instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) and Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. MS and MS/MS analyses were carried out using a Waters Q-TOF-II instrument equipped with a nanoelectrospray source and a Waters NanoAcquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph. Peptides were separated with Waters 5-Î¼m Symmetry C18 180 Î¼m Ã 20-mm precolumn and a Waters 3.5-Î¼m Symmetry C18, 75 Î¼m Ã 100-mm column using a linear gradients of 5â60% for 30 min. MS/MS sequence data and the MASCOT automated peptide search engine (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com) were used to identify NS5B peptide peaks from the NCBInr primary sequence data base, and the matched peaks were identified on the MS spectra. For accurate quantitative analysis of the modified peptide peaks, at least two unmodified proteolytic peptide peaks were used as internal controls. A protection was considered to be significant when the intensity of a modified peak formed upon treatment of the free protein was reduced by at least 85% in the context of the nucleoprotein complex. Data were reproducibly compiled and analyzed from six independent experimental groups. NS5B Protects RNA from E. coli RNase H CleavageâIn order to determine the size of the newly synthesized RNA that interacts with NS5B during RNA synthesis, we used E. coli RNase H as a tool to obtain footprints of the enzyme on its nucleic acid substrate. RNase H cleaves the RNA moiety of RNA/DNA hybrids (17Hausen P. Stein H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the NS5B enzyme was shown to be able to synthesize RNA on a single-stranded DNA template, which is a prerequisite for this approach (18Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gutshall L. Kim M.J. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12526-12536Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast to most nucleases that cleave double-stranded RNA, E. coli RNase H cleaves randomly, almost after each residue in the RNA/DNA duplex region. To initiate RNA synthesis, we employed a short radiolabeled dinucleotide RNA primer (Fig. 1A). The reaction can be specifically blocked through incorporation of a 3â²-dCMP chain terminator at position 19, which generates a stable, arrested elongation complex (Fig. 1B, control lane (C)). The nucleoprotein interaction can be destabilized at higher temperatures, which renders the RNA/DNA duplex fully accessible to RNase H cleavage (Fig. 1B, lane +). In contrast, nondenaturing conditions limit the RNase H-mediated cleavage to the 5â²-end of the template and reveal a protected region of 11 residues (Fig. 1B, lane â). Thus, the NS5B enzyme appears to interact with approximately seven to eight base pairs of a newly synthesized RNA/DNA duplex, considering that E. coli RNase H interacts with at least four RNA residues downstream from the scissile bond (19Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of NS5B in complex with the short rU5 fragment suggests that the enzyme is also in contact with approximately five nucleotides of the template 5â²-overhang (14O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jager J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These measurements are consistent with recent modeling studies (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar); however, the trajectory of the bound nucleic acid and putative conformational changes upon RNA binding remain to be characterized. Protein FootprintingâWe employed a mass spectrometric protein footprinting approach to identify specific amino acids that interact with the RNA substrate. This method was proven successful in the characterization of a variety of protein nucleic acid interactions and consistently revealed functionally important amino acid contacts (15Shkriabai N. Datta S.A. Zhao Z. Hess S. Rein A. Kvaratskhelia M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4077-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Kvaratskhelia M. Hess S. Qu Y. Zou Y. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 15988-15993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our studies, lysines and arginines were chemically modified with NHS-biotin and hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG), respectively, to compare surface topologies of NS5B and the NS5B-RNA complex. For these experiments, we utilized the natural RNA substrate, since the specific contacts between DNA and NS5B may be different. The first important step to successfully adopt this method to characterize the NS5B-RNA interface was to determine optimal concentrations of the modifying reagents under which the integrity of the preassembled complex would be preserved. For this purpose, we examined RNA synthesis in the presence of increasing concentrations of NHS-biotin and HPG, respectively. The specific set up allowed us to assess the enzymatic activity at two stages (Fig. 2A). NS5B initiates RNA synthesis from a GG primer at the 3â²-end of the RNA template. The elongation of the primer stops when the enzyme incorporates a chain terminator at position 16. It is then possible to rescue RNA synthesis to generate a full-length product (20-mer) through the addition of pyrophosphate (PPi), which promotes the excision of 3â²-dCMP (22D'Abramo C.M. Cellai L. Gotte M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 indicates that treatment of NS5B (Apo-E) with increasing concentrations of NHS-biotin or HPG, prior to the addition of the RNA template, results in the progressive decrease in the generation of the chain-terminated product (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, the preformed elongation complex with the incorporated chain terminator is significantly more resistant to inactivation by the modifying agents. The rescue of chain-terminated RNA synthesis is blocked at higher concentrations of NHS-biotin or HPG. Thus, functionally important lysines and arginines appear to be modified, which, in turn, impedes RNA binding to the isolated enzyme. In contrast, in the context of the nucleoprotein complex, the same amino acids are shielded from chemical modification through preformed protein-nucleic acid contacts. Fig. 2 indicates that 100 Î¼m NHS-biotin and 200 Î¼m HPG did not significantly disrupt the preformed NS5B-RNA complex, whereas the same treatment of the apoenzyme completely blocked the initiation of RNA synthesis. Therefore, these concentrations of modifying reagents were chosen to compare surface topologies of the isolated enzyme and NS5B prebound to a 20-mer RNA template. MS and MS/MS Analysis of Modified Peptides within the NS5B-RNA ComplexâTo generate small peptide fragments amenable to MS and MS/MS analyses, treated free NS5B and NS5B-RNA complex were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the purified protein bands were excised and exposed to in-gel proteolysis. Representative MS and MS/MS profiles are illustrated in Fig. 3. A and B show typical MALDI-TOF data and a Q-TOF spectrum of biotin-modified peptides, respectively. Internal fragmentation of the precursor ion primarily yielded y-ions, providing sequence information read from the C to N terminus. Our data indicate that 13 lysines and 14 arginines are readily susceptible to modification in the free protein (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab Comparative surface topology studies of free protein versus the nucleoprotein complex revealed lysines and arginines shielded from modification in the presence of RNA. Representative segments of the mass spectra showing protection of specific basic residues in the presence of bound RNA are depicted in Fig. 3C. Lys81, Lys100, and Lys106 are protected from biotinylation in the presence of RNA, whereas Lys151 remains solvent-accessible in the presence and absence of RNA. Fig. 3D shows two typical HPG-modified peptides containing Arg505 (protected) and Arg503 (unprotected). A summary of all modified residues is given in Table 1. Of the 13 lysines and 14 arginines readily susceptible to modification in the free protein, eight lysines and six arginines were protected in the NS5B-RNA complex. Positioning of Modified Lysines and Arginines on the Surface of NS5BâThe peptides detected by MALDI-TOF analysis cover about 90% of the sequence of NS5B (Fig. 4A). The modified residues were found in each subdomain of the protein exposed to solvent. The majority of protected residues are located within the fingers and thumb subdomains that are known to shape the nucleic acid binding channel of RNA and DNA polymerases. The structure of NS5B reveals that the protected residues, with the exception of Arg501 and Arg505, are all clustered at the side of the protein that is facing the active site within the palm. Thus, this region appears to define the surface area for RNA binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the basic residues that were not protected in our experiments are randomly spread on the outer surface of the protein. Mutational Analysis of the Protected ResiduesâTo confirm the functional importance of the residues identified by the mass spectrometric analysis, we next replaced the basic amino acids Arg and Lys with Glu. The placement of an acidic residue in the putative nucleic acid binding channel may result in electrostatic repulsion of the phosphate backbone, which should translate into functional defects. Alternative mutations to uncharged residues could be less informative, since neutralizing a single positive charge out of a large network of basic contacts may have only marginal effects. The purified mutant enzymes were compared with wild-type NS5B for enzymatic activity (see supplemental Fig. S1). The quantitative analysis of RNA synthesis is summarized in Fig. 5. Aside from R501E, all of the mutations in NS5B resulted in a 75â95% loss of activity, compared with the wild-type enzyme. In particular, the effect on enzymatic activity was most severe in the case of mutations at position 98, 100, 106, 158, 386, 394, and 491. These residues are distantly located from the active site, which suggests an important role of these residues in RNA binding. Two selected residues, Lys212 and Arg278, that did not exhibit any protection in our mass spectrometric experiments were mutated to glutamic acid for the control experiments. These mutations had no apparent effect on NS5B activity (data not shown). Like other viral RNA polymerases, HCV NS5B is capable of initiating RNA synthesis de novo in the absence of a primer (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6275-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of HCV NS5B and structures of the related BVDV and phage Ï6 enzymes show an obstructed active site that cannot accommodate a double-stranded nucleic acid substrate (10Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 25Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For HCV NS5B, the primer exit is blocked by the C-terminal tail and the Î²-hairpin (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Therefore, NS5B must undergo major conformational changes in order to accommodate the double-stranded RNA product. The mechanism of this process remains elusive, largely because the interaction between NS5B and its nucleic acid substrate is underexplored. In this study, we conducted RNA footprinting experiments with the double strand-specific E. coli RNase H, and found that the enzyme interacts with approximately seven to eight nucleotides of the primer. These findings are in good agreement with the predicted length of the bound duplex region on the basis of modeling studies with the apoenzyme (8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Moreover, RNase H-mediated cleavage of the released RNA/DNA duplex provides direct evidence to show that NS5B does not unwind the newly synthesized primer strand from its complementary template (9Ago H.

Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Intracellular strand displacement of the viral genome probably requires the contribution of other viral and/or cellular partners of the replication complex, including the helicase domain of NS3 (27Lai V.C. Dempsey S. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Zhong W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Piccininni S. Varaklioti A. Nardelli M. Dave B. Raney K.D. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45670-45679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To identify residues of NS5B that play important roles in nucleoprotein interactions, we used lysine- and arginine-modifying reagents and examined surface topologies of free protein versus the complex through mass spectrometric analyses. Our detailed footprinting approach allowed us to identify several amino acids protected from modification in the nucleoprotein complex by direct contacts with RNA or protein conformational change induced upon RNA binding. Of 27 lysines and arginines (13 lysines plus 14 arginines) accessible to chemical modifications in the free protein, 14 were shielded in the presence of RNA. The importance of these basic residues for NS5B enzymatic functions was confirmed by mutational analysis. Fig. 6A illustrates the interactions between a short 4-mer RNA fragment and the template entrance channel of NS5B on the basis of the crystal structure of the binary complex (14O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jager J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Lys98 and Lys100 are protected from chemical modification, and these residues are seen in close proximity, within 4AÌ, to the 5â²-end of the RNA. Lys270 is likewise protected; however, the distance of â¼12 AÌ between the primary amino group and the bound RNA appears to be too long to support any direct interaction with the substrate. In this case, the protection from the modifying reagent is likely to be attributable to conformational changes upon RNA binding. Structures of HCV NS5B in the absence of RNA show Thr12 of the Î1 loop within 6 AÌ of the amino group of Lys270, whereas the structure of the binary complex points to a shortened distance that shows the hydroxyl and amino groups of Thr12 and Lys270 within 4 AÌ. Thus, our footprinting results are in good agreement with the available crystallographic data and suggest that the intradomain interaction between Thr12 and Lys270 is stabilized in the presence of the nucleic acid substrate. The protection pattern of the footprinting analyses helps to define the trajectory of the exiting RNA product. Lys81, Lys106, Arg386, and Arg394 are protected in the presence of RNA, and each of these residues is located in the vicinity of a modeled, double-stranded nucleic acid substrate (Fig. 6B). Lys81 is part of a long loop between Î±-helixes C and D, and Lys106 is in the putative RNA-contacting Î±-helix E that could interact with the primer (8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Peptides containing Lys81 or Lys106 can be cross-linked to the bound RNA, which is consistent with our data (29Kim Y.C. Russell W.K. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Thomson M. Russell D.H. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38011-38019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Arg386 and Arg394 are located within a region that includes Î±-helix O, which appears to contact newly synthesized RNA in close proximity to the active site. Superimposing the structures of NS5B and HIV-1 RT in complex with primer-template provided support for this notion (4Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M. De Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar); however, the trajectory of the double-stranded RNA, which is reasonably well defined through Lys81, is difficult to predict using only the molecular modeling approach. The data also show protection of residues Arg51, Arg154, Lys155, Arg158, and Arg491, all of which are located in close proximity to the cavity forming the active site of NS5B (Fig. 6C). Residues Arg154, Lys155, and Arg158 are part of the conserved motif F, which is located in the loop Î2 (30Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows Arg158 within 4AÌ of the 3â² terminus of the bound template, whereas the side chains of Arg154 and Lys155 point away from the nucleic acid substrate. However, it is difficult to unambiguously ascertain whether these residues, together with Lys51 and Lys491, are directly in contact with the bound RNA or whether their protection from chemical modification is a result of a conformational change upon substrate binding. Peptides 142â154 and 155â168 can be directly cross-linked to short oligonucleotides (29Kim Y.C. Russell W.K. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Thomson M. Russell D.H. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38011-38019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which is indicative of direct interactions with the bound RNA. In contrast, Lys151, which is unprotected in our experiments, is completely exposed to the solvent and cannot participate in NTP or RNA binding without significant rearrangements. These data are in agreement with mutational analyses, implying that no basic residue is required at this position (31Labonte P. Axelrod V. Agarwal A. Aulabaugh A. Amin A. Mak P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38838-38846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The two additional amino acids protected from the chemical probes are Arg501 and Arg505. According to our model, these positions are too far away from the bound RNA to allow direct nucleoprotein contacts (Fig. 6B). We consider two different scenarios to explain the observed protection pattern in this region. One possibility is that these residues may be shielded from modification due to protein-protein interactions that are triggered upon RNA binding. Pull-down assays revealed that nucleolin recognizes Î±-helix T, which includes Arg501 and Arg505 (32Hirano M. Kaneko S. Yamashita T. Luo H. Qin W. Shirota Y. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the same authors have previously reported that this helix may be involved in intermolecular NS5B interaction (33Qin W. Luo H. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Yamashita T. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2132-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the specific protection pattern of arginines in helix T suggests that protein-protein interaction may not play a role in this regard. Arg508 is protected in the absence and in the presence of RNA, whereas Arg501 and Arg505 are solely protected in the presence of RNA, and both Arg503 and Arg510 are modified under both conditions. Protein-protein interactions in this region would probably diminish the accessibility of each of these adjacently positioned residues. We suggest that the nuances of the protection pattern are better explained through conformational changes upon RNA binding. We consider inter- and/or intradomain interactions in this regard. The side chains of Arg503 and Arg510 lie on the same side of helix T and point to the fingertip Î1 loop, whereas Arg508, Arg501, and Arg505 lie on the other side of the helix, and their side chains point to the C-terminal loop region between residues Leu525 and Leu534. Interdomain interaction between helix T and the fingertip Î1 loop (residues 11â44) has been reported (34Biswal B.K. Cherney M.M. Wang M. Chan L. Yannopoulos C.G. Bilimoria D. Nicolas O. Bedard J. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18202-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Biswal B.K. Wang M. Cherney M.M. Chan L. Yannopoulos C.G. Bilimoria D. Bedard J.

Carfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29765-29770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Specifically, the enzyme can exist in âopenâ or âclosedâ conformations in which these interdomain interactions are modulated. Several nonnucleosidic inhibitors were shown to freeze the enzyme in an open, presumably inactive conformation. In contrast, extended interdomain interactions have been linked to a closed, active form of the enzyme. Together, these data suggested that the contacts between Helix T and the fingertip D1 loop are flexible. Our findings provide support for this notion, given that Arg503 and Arg510 are accessible. Both residues are also accessible in the presence of single-stranded RNA, which likewise points to an open conformation or flexible interdomain interaction in the nucleoprotein complex. However, the bound RNA template appears to affect the intradomain interaction between helix T and the adjacent C-terminal loop. Arg501 and Arg505 are the only arginines in helix T that become protected in the presence of RNA. These data suggest that the loop that comprises residues Leu525âLeu534 moves closer to helix T under these conditions. This scenario can be interpreted as a consequence of a steric conflict between the C terminus of the NS5B enzyme and the bound RNA. As proposed for the double-stranded substrate, it appears that the C-terminal region moves from its position in the apoenzyme to accommodate the single-stranded RNA template. Taken together, the comparison of surface topologies of free NS5B with the nucleoprotein complex suggests that single-stranded RNA can occupy the entire nucleic acid binding channel. The 3â²-end of the template is not specifically positioned in close proximity to the active center to allow de novo initiation to occur. This result indicates that the single-stranded template binds preferentially to the entire channel to maximize contacts. Alternatively, a given population of nucleoprotein complexes can exist as a heterogeneous mixture, and the RNA can freely move in the nucleic acid binding groove. In either case, the 3â²-end of the template is not specifically recognized by the NS5B enzyme. It is thus possible that the presence of nucleotide substrates is required to properly position the template for initiation, which remains to be elucidated. Our footprinting experiments suggest that this NS5B-RNA complex characterized in this study reasonably mimics the elongation state. The protection pattern around the nucleic acid binding groove is likely to be similar; however, the conformational change or rearrangement at the C-terminal region may be more pronounced or even different in nature when the enzyme needs to accommodate double-stranded RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2119178232,"Overactive bladder syndrome (OBS) results from disturbances of bladder function. Bladder smooth muscle (detrusor) exhibits spontaneous rhythmic activity (tone) independent of neurogenic control, which is enhanced in patients with OBS. We have now uncovered a prominent role for the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in regulating rabbit detrusor smooth muscle tone and contraction. S1P-induced contraction of detrusor muscle was dependent on stretch and intracellular calcium. Although detrusor expresses the S1P receptors S1P1 and S1P2, only S1P2 appeared to be involved in S1P-induced contraction, since SEW2871 (S1P1 agonist) and dihydro-S1P (potent agonist for all S1P receptors except S1P2) were poor contractile agents. In agreement, the S1P2 antagonist JTE013 inhibited S1P-induced contraction. The fast, transient muscle contraction (phasic) mediated by S1P was dependent on phospholipase C (PLC) whereas the slower, sustained contraction (tonic) was not. Surprisingly, the immunosuppressant FTY720-phosphate, an agonist for all S1P receptors except S1P2, had distinct contractile properties and also induced slow, sustained contraction. Thus, FTY720-phosphate and/or S1P may regulate calcium channels in an S1P receptor-independent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that S1P may regulate detrusor smooth muscle tone and suggest that dysregulation of complex S1P signaling might contribute to OBS."

Mammalian UAP56 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sub2p) and its functional homologs belong to the conserved DECD box class of ATP-dependent RNA helicases that play important functional roles in multiple aspects of DNA and RNA metabolism (1de la Cruz J.

They are essential in a number of organisms, including yeast, nematode, and fruit fly (2Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). UAP56/Sub2p is directly involved in pre-messenger RNA splicing and nuclear export of messenger RNAs in S. cerevisiae and in metazoan cells (3Reed R. Hurt E.

Sub2p is also critical for the export of mRNAs of both intron-containing and intron-less genes (7Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Lei E.P.

Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). THO is a transcription-elongation complex, and in yeast, in addition to Hpr1p, it contains three other nonessential proteins, Mft1p, Tho2p, and Thp2p (10Jimeno S. Rondon A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Once recruited, the major function of Sub2p in mRNA export is the recruitment of mRNA adapter Yra1p to elongating transcripts (8Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sub2p and Yra1p together with THO form the TREX complex that was suggested to physically link the transcription apparatus to mRNA export steps (7Strasser K. Hurt E.

Although the recruitment of Yra1p to intron-containing messages depended on Sub2p, its recruitment to intron-less genes was found to be unaffected in a sub2-85 ts mutant strain.

Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It was suggested that removal of Sub2p from Yra1p in the nucleus allows Mex67p to target mature mRNPs to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Because Mex67p is not essential in wild type S. pombe cells for mRNA export, these results led us to propose that Uap56p was not removed from mRNPs, rather it played a critical role in NPC targeting and the export of mRNAs. S. pombe Uap56p was originally identified as a suppressor of a cold-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain (Înam8 prp40HA) (13Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that it is physically and functionally linked to two mRNA export factors as follows: Rae1p, an NPC-associated essential mRNA export factor, and Mlo3p, an S. pombe homolog of Yra1p/Aly (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mlo3p and Rae1p do not interact with each other directly, but they could be linked via Uap56p in a ternary protein complex in vitro (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another mRNA export factor Dss1p could similarly link Mlo3p and Rae1p in vitro. Based on biochemical and in vivo experiments, we proposed that Uap56p and Dss1p-mediated links are critical for targeting mature mRNPs to the NPC (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we further explored Uap56p functions in mRNA export. Our results indicate that Uap56p does not function as an RNA-dependent helicase in mRNA export. However, its ability to bind RNA is important for exporting mRNA. We found a functionally important NES within Uap56p that mediates direct interactions with Rae1p. Loss of the NES function abrogates Rae1p interaction as well as ability to export mRNA. Taken together, these properties are consistent with Uap56p functioning as an export carrier of mRNA in S. pombe. Strains and CultureâBasic cell culture techniques used in this study were as described previously (14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar, 15Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). The construction of the null strain of uap56 was as described (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The strains used in this study were as follows: wild type cells hâ leu1-32 ura4-D18, hâ Îuap56/pREP42x-uap56, hâ prp2-1 (16Kaufer N.F. Potashkin J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hânup184â1 rae1-167/pREP81X-rae1 (17Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Shen R. Dhar R. Genetics. 1999; 152: 827-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid ConstructionsâThe coding sequence for uap56 was amplified from the genomic DNA and inserted into pREP42X vector (18Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 19Forsburg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To get a genomic construct, the gene for uap56 along with its promoter and 3â²-untranslated region were inserted into an S. pombe vector pRL1 that carried the auxotropic marker LEU2 gene of S. cerevisiae. This plasmid was further used to make mutations within the uap56 coding sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to introduce GK100â101DA, DECD to DEAD, DECD to EEAD, Q297R F320A, or R382AR385AR388A (RNA binding domain) mutations using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Plasmids for bacterial expression of N-terminal GST fusions of proteins were made using pGEX5X-3 vector. Spot Assay for GrowthâGrowth conditions used have been described previously (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly (OD = 0.5), cells were serially diluted and plated on YEA or EMM media. Growth was monitored after 3 days at 30 Â°C. In Situ HybridizationâIn situ hybridization method used was described previously (20Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)50 carrying an Î±-digoxigenin at its 3â²-end was used as the hybridization probe, and rhodamine-anti-digoxigenin was used for detecting the hybridization signal by using fluorescence microscopy. DAPI was used to stain DNA in the nucleus. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsâAll proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21 using the standard purification protocols. For GST and GST fusion proteins, GSH-Sepharose beads from Amersham Biosciences were used. Proteins were eluted using 250 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were dialyzed with the universal binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm KoAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) (21Kunzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For binding reactions, GST and GST fusion proteins were bound to GSH-Sepharose and incubated with 35S-Rae1p protein. The labeled Rae1p protein was synthesized using in vitro coupled transcription translation rabbit reticulocyte kit from Promega. Binding reactions were performed in the universal binding buffer (21Kunzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were separated on 4â12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was then exposed to x-ray film. To detect the amount of Sepharose-bound proteins used in the binding reactions, polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against Uap56p were used. Standard chemiluminescent detection methods (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to detect the proteins. RT-PCRâTotal RNA was extracted from S. pombe wild type and uap56 mutant cells using a Qiagen RNA extraction kit. Î²-Tubulin cDNA synthesis was performed using the Titan one-step RT-PCR kit supplied by Roche Applied Science. The products were analyzed on agarose gels. CHIPâChromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assays were performed by following published methods using polyclonal antibodies against Uap56p and Rae1p (22Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Chromatin DNA was sonicated to 0.5â1-kb size fragments and then immunoprecipitated. Gene-specific PCR primers for different regions of Î²-actin gene were used to amplify the precipitated DNA. For control amplification, primer sets for a nontranscribed region was included in each PCR. The sequence of the primer set was 5â²-CAACAGGAGCGCTATAATAA-3â² and 5â²-CAGATAGCTTGGATAGATATG-3â².[Î±-32P]dCTP was added to the PCR. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using the PhosphorImager. S. pombe NES AssayâThe construction of the S. pombe vector, pAG177, for in vivo nuclear export assay has been described previously (24Thakurta A.G. Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Bharathi A. Kozak L. Whiteford C. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Dhar R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2571-2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The details of this assay have been briefly described under âResults.â HeLa Cell Nuclear Export AssayâNuclear export assay in HeLa cells was performed according to the method described previously (25Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Saha T. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17434-17442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). DNA sequence coding for specific NES segments of interest was fused to glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and GFP DNA sequences in Gr-GFP vector. The details of the export assay are described in the figure legends. S. pombe Uap56p Is Not an Essential Splicing FactorâS. pombe uap56 is an essential gene for growth (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A null strain of uap56 (Îuap56/pREP42X-uap56) was kept viable by expressing Uap56p from a thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter in pREP42X vector by growing cells in the absence of B1 (henceforth referred to as âB1 condition). Growth in [Î±-32P] presence of B1 (referred to as +B1 condition) results in depletion of Uap56p and inhibits growth. As a putative RNA-helicase, Uap56p contains a characteristic ATP-binding motif AKSGMGKT, the conserved catalytic DECD box, and the RNA-binding motif shown in Fig. 1A (5Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When the GKT motif was mutated to GNT in the ATP binding domain, both the ATPase activity and splicing were inhibited in S. cerevisiae sub2 mutant cells (5Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We made mutations within the ATP binding domain of Uap56p (GK to DA) to determine the role of these mutations in splicing and mRNA export in S. pombe. When the DECD box of mammalian Uap56 or S. cerevisiae Sub2p was mutated to DEAD or EEAD, its RNA helicase and splicing functions were inhibited (5Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The conserved cystine and aspartic acid residues are located at the catalytic core and are thought to stabilize the SAT loop (28Shi H. Cordin O. Minder C.M. Linder P. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17628-17633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test the role of these mutations in splicing and mRNA export, we introduced these mutations in uap56. Previous biochemical work in S. cerevisiae eIF4A showed a single arginine to alanine mutation within the RNA binding domain was sufficient to drastically reduce cross-linking of eIF4A to RNA and its helicase activity (27Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on these experiments, we generated a triple mutant Uap56p (R382A/R385A/R388A) by replacing all three conserved arginine residues in the RNA-binding motif it shares with the helicase family members (1de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We then set out to test the roles of the ATP-binding mutant, the DECD box mutant, and the RNA-binding mutant in growth, splicing, and mRNA export. Surprisingly, Îuap56 expressing the ATP mutant protein (G100D/K101A) or the DEAD or EECD mutant proteins were able to grow like the wild type strain (Fig. 1B). For comparison, Îuap56 strain expressing uap56 (âB1 condition) grew like the wild type strain. But when Uap56p was depleted (+B1 condition) growth of Îuap56 strain was inhibited (Fig. 1B). Îuap56 cells expressing the RNA-binding triple mutant (R382A/R385A/R388A) were also viable (Fig. 1B) and grew only slightly slower than the wild type cells suggesting that the loss of RNA binding also did not affect the essential function of Uap56p. To test the efficacy of pre-messenger RNA splicing, total RNA was extracted from Îuap56 cells expressing Uap56p, depleted for Uap56p, or Îuap56 cells expressing putative ATP-binding (G100D/K101A), RNA-helicase (DEAD or EEAD), or RNA-binding (R382A/R385A/R388A) mutant proteins. A pair of primers flanking the ends of the coding sequence of the intron-carrying Î²-tubulin gene was used for RT-PCR to amplify cDNA from its transcripts (29Kozak L. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Thakurta A.G. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33580-33589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNA extracted from Îuap56 cells expressing Uap56p produced a single RT-PCR product of â¼1400 bp, consistent with a fully spliced mRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Interestingly, RNA made from the cells depleted for Uap56p also gave a single product consistent with fully spliced Î²-tubulin transcripts (Fig. 1C, lane 3). For two other intron-containing genes dss1 and rae1, similar results were obtained (data not shown). As a control for spliced and unspliced transcripts, we used prp2-1 ts allele, which is known to inhibit RNA splicing at the restrictive temperature (16Kaufer N.F. Potashkin J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR performed on total RNA extracted from prp2-1 mutant cells at the permissive temperature (27 Â°C) produced a product consistent with normal splicing of the Î²-tubulin transcript (Fig. 1C, lane 4). However, RNA isolated from cells grown at the nonpermissive conditions (37 Â°C, 3 h) produced a higher molecular weight RT-PCR product (â¼1730 bp) consistent with unspliced mRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 5). The data shown above suggest that loss of Uap56p does not result in the corresponding splicing defect. However, in the depletion experiments we could not rule out the possibility that a small amount of Uap56p was still present under depletion conditions that was sufficient for splicing. Because mutation in ATP-binding and DECD box motifs are known to inhibit splicing (5Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we tested the efficiency of splicing by ATP-binding or the DECD box mutants. Total RNA was isolated from the cultures of Îuap56 cells expressing either G100D/K101A, DEAD, or the EEAD mutant proteins. In all cases, RT-PCR-generated products were consistent with fully spliced Î²-tubulin messenger RNAs (Fig. 1C, lanes 6â8). Finally, we tested whether pre-mRNA was fully spliced in cells expressing the RNA-binding Uap56p mutant protein. We found that the RT-PCR product obtained from cells expressing this mutant protein did not have any defect in the splicing of Î²-tubulin mRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 9). These results strongly suggest that Uap56 is not required for splicing of pre-mRNAs in wild type S. pombe cells. It is not known whether the enzymatic activity of Uap56p/Sub2p is essential for the nuclear export of mRNA in eukaryotic cells. These results allowed us to investigate whether any of these properties affect mRNA export in S. pombe (see below). Intact RNA-binding Motif by Uap56p Is Required for mRNA ExportâS. pombe cells expressing the ATP-binding, the DECD box, or the RNA-binding mutant Uap56p proteins are viable. We wanted to know if these mutant cells could support nuclear export of mRNA. As expected, wild type and Îuap56 cells expressing Uap56p had normal mRNA export (Fig. 1D, panels a and b), and cells depleted for Uap56p accumulated poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus (Fig. 1D, panel c). Surprisingly, however, Îuap56 cells expressing the ATP-binding mutant protein, G100D/K101A, had no detectable accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus (Fig. 1D, panel d), demonstrating that presumptive loss of ATP binding did not affect the ability of Uap56p to export mRNA. We also found that Îuap56 cells expressing Uap56p with DEAD or the EEAD mutations did not inhibit nuclear export of mRNA (Fig. 1D, panels e and f). Because helicase activity presumably requires intact catalytic residues as well as an ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, these results indicate that putative enzymatic functions of Uap56p are not essential for driving mRNA export in S. pombe. In contrast, we found extensive nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation in the cells expressing the RNA-binding mutant protein (Fig. 1D, panel g). Taken together, these results indicate that Uap56 functions in mRNA export presumably as a component of the nuclear export complex rather than as an enzyme. The functional requirement of RNA binding further suggests that Uap56p may directly interact with mRNAs for mediating their export. Uap56p May Shuttle between the Nucleus and the CytoplasmâIn human and yeast cell, Uap56p/Sub2p is stably located in the nucleus. Uap56p/Sub2p is recruited to the transcripts during elongation and is thought to be released from the mRNP complex before the complex is targeted to the NPC (2Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our previous results suggest that Uap56p is likely targeted to the NPC (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We wanted to know if Uap56 can exit the nucleus. GFP fused to full-length Uap56p at the C terminus localized to the nucleus (4Thakurta A.G. Gopal G. Yoon J.H. Kozak L. Dhar R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2512-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (reproduced here in Fig. 2B, panel a). First, we determined the region of Uap56p that contains the nuclear import signal. Different segments of Uap56p were fused to GFP at the C terminus, and their cellular localization was determined (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that GFP fusion of the N-terminal half (1â250 aa) of Uap56p localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2B, panel c). In contrast, the C-terminal half (251â434 aa) showed a diffused localization (Fig. 2B, panel b). Within the N-terminal half of Uap56p, we found that a GFP fusion of residues 1â216 aa, 1â100 aa, and 101â250 aa were diffused, whereas that of 50â250 aa was nuclear but less than that observed for the 1â250-aa fragment (N) (Fig. 2B, panels dâg)). Based on these analyses, the N terminus of Uap56 appears to contain a bipartite nuclear import signal, located between 1â100 and 216â250 aa. We next explored if Uap56p contains an NES by using a previously described nuclear export assay in S. pombe. The construction of the S. pombe vector, pAG177, for in vivo nuclear export assay has been described previously (24Thakurta A.G. Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Bharathi A. Kozak L. Whiteford C. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Dhar R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2571-2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pAG177 contains RNA-binding motifs (RRM) of crp79 fused to GFP at the C terminus. To identify an NES within Uap56, DNA fragments for various portions of the coding sequences were inserted between the RRM and the GFP encoding sequences creating RRM-NES-GFP fusions. Plasmids expressing the RRM-NES-GFP fusions were transformed into rae1-167 nup184-1/pREP81X-rae1 SL27 double mutant. The RRM-GFP (pAG177) control fusion protein is cytoplasmic when Rae1p is expressed (âB1) in the double mutant (Fig. 2D, panel a). Under synthetic lethal conditions when Rae1p is depleted, mRNA accumulates in the nucleus and retains the fusion protein (Fig. 2D, panel b). However, in the presence of NES the fusion protein can exit the nucleus showing a diffused localization of the fusion protein throughout the cell, indicative of a functional NES (25Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows a schematic diagram of the fragments used in the nuclear export assay. By using this assay, we found that a region between 250 and 434 aa (Fig. 2D, panels c and d) of Uap56p but not 1â250 aa (data not shown) was capable of exporting the RRM-NES-GFP fusion in SL27 cells under synthetic lethal conditions. But the fusion protein relocated to the nucleus in the double mutant following inactivation of Rae1-167p at 35 Â°C for 30 min (Fig. 2D, compare panels c, d, and e). These data suggest that under synthetic lethal conditions the fusion protein was not immobilized in the cytoplasm by some retention mechanism. By deletion analyses, the NES activity was mapped between 250 and 350 aa (Fig. 2D, panel f). A further deletion of 250â280 aa or 282â350 aa substantially damaged the export activity (Fig. 2D, panels g and h). Thus, we conclude that the full NES is contained within the 250â350-aa region. We next made several mutations within the NES (250â350 aa) to identify residues that are critical for mediating nuclear export of the fusion protein. Among these residues we identified two single mutations Q297R and F320A within the 100-aa region (Fig. 2C) that caused partial loss of the nuclear export activity (data not shown). When these two mutations were combined, there was a significant loss of nuclear export of the fusion protein as judged by the nuclear localization of the RRM-NES (Q297R/F320A)-GFP fusion (Fig. 2D, panel i). To further test whether the NES property is evolutionarily conserved, we used a HeLa cell-based nuclear export assay. For this assay, as described previously (24Thakurta A.G. Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Bharathi A. Kozak L. Whiteford C. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Dhar R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2571-2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the test export sequence was inserted between DNA fragments encoding Gr and GFP, and its ability to export the fusion was tested. As a positive control, nuclear export activity from Rev-NES was used, whereas Gr-GFP was used as a negative control (Fig. 2E). By using this assay we confirmed that the 250â350 aa of Uap56p was able to export a Gr-GFP fusion from the HeLa cell nucleus (Fig. 2E). The same sequence carrying the Q297R/F320A double mutations was unable to export Gr-GFP under the conditions of the export assay (Fig. 2E). Thus, Uap56p contains a conserved nuclear export signal within the C-terminal half between the 250- and 350-aa region. Taken together, Uap56p carries a nuclear import and a conserved nuclear export signal raising the possibility that it shuttles between the two cellular compartments. Mutations within the NES Region Inhibit Growth and mRNA ExportâWe next tested the role of the NES in mRNA export and growth. Cells expressing the NES mutant Uap56p grew slower than Îuap56 cells expressing the wild type Uap56p (Fig. 3A). Therefore, mutations within the NES affected cellular growth. In parallel we tested the level of mRNA export in the strains expressing mutant Uap56p (Fig. 3B, panels câe). The presence of Uap56p Q297R led to some loss of function as Îuap56 cells expressing the mutant protein accumulated poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus (Fig. 3B, panel c). In the case of Uap56p F320A, there was a distinct pattern of poly(A)+ RNA at the nuclear pore suggesting a loss of Uap56p function affecting movement of mRNA at the NPC (Fig. 3B, panel d and inset). When Q297R and F320A mutations were combined in Uap56p, the double mutant accumulated mRNA in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, panel e). These results suggest that the functional integrity of NES i"
