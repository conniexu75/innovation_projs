https://openalex.org/W4288950914,"Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a Lévy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma's dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked."
https://openalex.org/W4289222991,"Social capital-the strength of an individual's social network and community-has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1-8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES-which we term economic connectedness-is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12-14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at https://www.socialcapital.org ."
https://openalex.org/W4289261048,"We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coronary artery disease (CAD) incorporating nearly a quarter of a million cases, in which existing studies are integrated with data from cohorts of white, Black and Hispanic individuals from the Million Veteran Program. We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis. This study highlights the value of diverse populations in further characterizing the genetic architecture of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W4289261763,"To date, most expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, which investigate how genetic variants contribute to gene expression, have been performed in heterogeneous brain tissues rather than specific cell types. In this study, we performed an eQTL analysis using single-nuclei RNA sequencing from 192 individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 eGenes, a substantial fraction (46%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level eQTLs affected more constrained genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level eQTLs. Integration of brain cell type eQTLs with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed novel relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For most GWAS loci, a single gene co-localized in a single cell type, providing new clues into disease etiology. Our findings demonstrate substantial contrast in genetic regulation of gene expression among brain cell types and reveal potential mechanisms by which disease risk genes influence brain disorders. Bryois et al. mapped genetic variants regulating gene expression in eight major brain cell types. They found a large number of cell-type-specific genetic effects and leveraged their results to identify novel putative risk genes for brain disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4289261231,"Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies are approved for the treatment of RAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but the emergence of resistance mutations restricts their efficacy. We previously showed that RAS, BRAF and EGFR mutant alleles, which appear in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during EGFR blockade, decline upon therapy withdrawal. We hypothesized that monitoring resistance mutations in blood could rationally guide subsequent therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies. We report here the results of CHRONOS, an open-label, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial exploiting blood-based identification of RAS/BRAF/EGFR mutations levels to tailor a chemotherapy-free anti-EGFR rechallenge with panitumumab (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03227926 ; EudraCT 2016-002597-12). The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of this strategy. In CHRONOS, patients with tissue-RAS WT tumors after a previous treatment with anti-EGFR-based regimens underwent an interventional ctDNA-based screening. Of 52 patients, 16 (31%) carried at least one mutation conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and were excluded. The primary endpoint of the trial was met; and, of 27 enrolled patients, eight (30%) achieved partial response and 17 (63%) disease control, including two unconfirmed responses. These clinical results favorably compare with standard third-line treatments and show that interventional liquid biopsies can be effectively and safely exploited in a timely manner to guide anti-EGFR rechallenge therapy with panitumumab in patients with mCRC. Further larger and randomized trials are warranted to formally compare panitumumab rechallenge with standard-of-care therapies in this patient setting."

https://openalex.org/W4289224897,"Abstract Low levels of social interaction across class lines have generated widespread concern 1–4 and are associated with worse outcomes, such as lower rates of upward income mobility 4–7 . Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis in our companion paper 7 . We show that about half of the social disconnection across socioeconomic lines—measured as the difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status (SES) friends between people with low and high SES—is explained by differences in exposure to people with high SES in groups such as schools and religious organizations. The other half is explained by friending bias—the tendency for people with low SES to befriend people with high SES at lower rates even conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the structure of the groups in which people interact. For example, friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and lower in religious organizations than in schools and workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-SES friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in the share of students with high SES across high school cohorts, we show that increases in high-SES exposure lead low-SES people to form more friendships with high-SES people in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus, socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast, when friending bias is high, increasing cross-SES interactions among existing members may be necessary to increase economic connectedness. To support such efforts, we release privacy-protected statistics on economic connectedness, exposure and friending bias for each ZIP (postal) code, high school and college in the United States at https://www.socialcapital.org ."
https://openalex.org/W4289261776,"The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, is abundantly expressed in both the brain and periphery. Here, we present evidence that peripheral apoE isoforms, separated from those in the brain by the blood–brain barrier, differentially impact Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and cognition. To evaluate the function of peripheral apoE, we developed conditional mouse models expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 in the liver with no detectable apoE in the brain. Liver-expressed apoE4 compromised synaptic plasticity and cognition by impairing cerebrovascular functions. Plasma proteome profiling revealed apoE isoform-dependent functional pathways highlighting cell adhesion, lipoprotein metabolism and complement activation. ApoE3 plasma from young mice improved cognition and reduced vessel-associated gliosis when transfused into aged mice, whereas apoE4 compromised the beneficial effects of young plasma. A human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell model recapitulated the plasma apoE isoform-specific effect on endothelial integrity, further supporting a vascular-related mechanism. Upon breeding with amyloid model mice, liver-expressed apoE4 exacerbated brain amyloid pathology, whereas apoE3 reduced it. Our findings demonstrate pathogenic effects of peripheral apoE4, providing a strong rationale for targeting peripheral apoE to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Mouse models expressing liver apoE in the absence of brain apoE reveal detrimental effects of peripheral apoE4 associated with Alzheimer’s risk on cognition and amyloid pathology through compromising vascular integrity and function."
https://openalex.org/W4289261425,"Transposon-associated transposase B (TnpB) is deemed an ancestral protein for type V, Cas12 family members, and the closest ancestor to UnCas12f1. Previously, we reported a set of engineered guide RNAs supporting high indel efficiency for Cas12f1 in human cells. Here we suggest a new technology whereby the engineered guide RNAs also manifest high-efficiency programmable endonuclease activity for TnpB. We have termed this technology TaRGET (TnpB-augment RNA-based Genome Editing Technology). Having this feature in mind, we established TnpB-based adenine base editors (ABEs). A Tad-Tad mutant (V106W, D108Q) dimer fused to the C terminus of dTnpB (D354A) showed the highest levels of A-to-G conversion. The limited targetable sites for TaRGET-ABE were expanded with engineered variants of TnpB or optimized deaminases. Delivery of TaRGET-ABE also ensured potent A-to-G conversion rates in mammalian genomes. Collectively, the TaRGET-ABE will contribute to improving precise genome-editing tools that can be delivered by adeno-associated viruses, thereby harnessing the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4289261207,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a prime oncogene that is frequently amplified in glioblastomas. Here we demonstrate a new tumour-suppressive function of EGFR in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas regulated by EGFR ligands. Constitutive EGFR signalling promotes invasion via activation of a TAB1–TAK1–NF-κB–EMP1 pathway, resulting in large tumours and decreased survival in orthotopic models. Ligand-activated EGFR promotes proliferation and surprisingly suppresses invasion by upregulating BIN3, which inhibits a DOCK7-regulated Rho GTPase pathway, resulting in small hyperproliferating non-invasive tumours and improved survival. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas reveal that in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas, a low level of EGFR ligands confers a worse prognosis, whereas a high level of EGFR ligands confers an improved prognosis. Thus, increased EGFR ligand levels shift the role of EGFR from oncogene to tumour suppressor in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas by suppressing invasion. The tumour-suppressive function of EGFR can be activated therapeutically using tofacitinib, which suppresses invasion by increasing EGFR ligand levels and upregulating BIN3. Guo et al. show that ligand-induced EGFR activation suppresses invasion by upregulating BIN3 and inhibiting DOCK7-regulated Rho GTPase activity in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma, which is in contrast to the known oncogenic role for EGFR signalling."
https://openalex.org/W4289262498,"Background Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) affects four million people worldwide annually and has an estimated lifetime prevalence of 5−10% in the general population. Worldwide, there are significant heterogeneities in coping approaches of healthcare systems with PUD in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Quantifying and benchmarking health systems’ performance is crucial yet challenging to provide a clearer picture of the potential global inequities in the quality of care. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the health-system quality-of-care and inequities for PUD among age groups and sexes worldwide. Methods Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2019. Principal-Component-Analysis was used to combine age-standardized mortality-to-incidence-ratio, disability-adjusted-life-years-to-prevalence-ratio, prevalence-to-incidence-ratio, and years-of-life-lost-to-years-lived-with-disability-into a single proxy named Quality-of-Care-Index (QCI). QCI was used to compare the quality of care among countries. QCI’s validity was investigated via correlation with the cause-specific Healthcare-Access-and-Quality-index, which was acceptable. Inequities were presented among age groups and sexes. Gender Disparity Ratio was obtained by dividing the score of women by that of men. Results Global QCI was 72.6 in 1990, which increased by 14.6% to 83.2 in 2019. High-income-Asia-pacific had the highest QCI, while Central Latin America had the lowest. QCI of high-SDI countries was 82.9 in 1990, which increased to 92.9 in 2019. The QCI of low-SDI countries was 65.0 in 1990, which increased to 76.9 in 2019. There was heterogeneity among the QCI-level of countries with the same SDI level. QCI typically decreased as people aged; however, this gap was more significant among low-SDI countries. The global Gender Disparity Ratio was close to one and ranged from 0.97 to 1.03 in 100 of 204 countries. Conclusion QCI of PUD improved dramatically during 1990–2019 worldwide. There are still significant heterogeneities among countries on different and similar SDI levels."
https://openalex.org/W4289261711,"Mammalian neocortical neurons span one of the most diverse cell type spectra of any tissue. Cortical neurons are born during embryonic development, and their maturation extends into postnatal life. The regulatory strategies underlying progressive neuronal development and maturation remain unclear. Here we present an integrated single-cell epigenomic and transcriptional analysis of individual mouse and marmoset cortical neuron classes, spanning both early postmitotic stages of identity acquisition and later stages of neuronal plasticity and circuit integration. We found that, in both species, the regulatory strategies controlling early and late stages of pan-neuronal development diverge. Early postmitotic neurons use more widely shared and evolutionarily conserved molecular regulatory programs. In contrast, programs active during later neuronal maturation are more brain- and neuron-specific and more evolutionarily divergent. Our work uncovers a temporal shift in regulatory choices during neuronal diversification and maturation in both mice and marmosets, which likely reflects unique evolutionary constraints on distinct events of neuronal development in the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W4289262072,"The mosquito Aedes koreicus (Edwards, 1917) is a recent invader on the European continent that was introduced to several new places since its first detection in 2008. Compared to other exotic Aedes mosquitoes with public health significance that invaded Europe during the last decades, this species' biology, behavior, and dispersal patterns were poorly investigated to date.To understand the species' population relationships and dispersal patterns within Europe, a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI or COX1) gene was sequenced from 130 mosquitoes, collected from five countries where the species has been introduced and/or established. Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing techniques were combined to generate the first complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomic sequences of Ae. koreicus from the European region. The complete genome of Ae. koreicus is 879 Mb. COI haplotype analyses identified five major groups (altogether 31 different haplotypes) and revealed a large-scale dispersal pattern between European Ae. koreicus populations. Continuous admixture of populations from Belgium, Italy, and Hungary was highlighted, additionally, haplotype diversity and clustering indicate a separation of German sequences from other populations, pointing to an independent introduction of Ae. koreicus to Europe. Finally, a genetic expansion signal was identified, suggesting the species might be present in more locations than currently detected.Our results highlight the importance of genetic research of invasive mosquitoes to understand general dispersal patterns, reveal main dispersal routes and form the baseline of future mitigation actions. The first complete genomic sequence also provides a significant leap in the general understanding of this species, opening the possibility for future genome-related studies, such as the detection of 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism' markers. Considering its public health importance, it is crucial to further investigate the species' population genetic dynamic, including a larger sampling and additional genomic markers."
https://openalex.org/W4289340233,"Aggressive driving is a significant road safety problem and is likely to get worse as the situations that provoke aggression become more prevalent in the road network (e.g. as traffic volumes and density increase and the grey fleet expands). In addition, driver frustration and stress, also recognised as triggers for aggression, are likely to stay high because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated burdens, leading to increased aggression. However, although drivers report that other drivers are becoming more aggressive, self-report data suggests that the prevalence of aggression has not changed over time. This may be due to the methods used to define and measure aggression. This study sought to clarify whether self-reported aggression has increased over a five-year period and across three different types of aggression: verbal aggression, aggressive use of the vehicle and personal physical aggression. The influence of COVID-19 lockdowns on own and others' driving styles was also investigated. A total of 774 drivers (males = 66.5%, mean age = 48.7; SD = 13.9) who had been licensed for at least five years (M = 30.6, SD = 14.3), responded to an online survey and provided retrospective frequencies for their current aggression (considered pre-COVID-19 lockdowns) and five years prior. Two open ended questions were included to understand perceived changes in driving styles (own and others) during the COVID-19 pandemic. One third (33%) of drivers believed they were more aggressive now than five years ago but 61% of the sample believed other drivers were more aggressive now than five years ago. Logistic regression analyses on changes in self-reported aggression (same or decreased vs increased) showed the main factor associated with increases in aggressive driving was the perception that other drivers' aggression had increased. Further, almost half the sample (47%) reported that other drivers had become riskier and more dangerous during, and soon after, the COVID-19 lockdowns. These results show that the driving environment is seen as becoming more aggressive, both gradually and as a direct result of COVID-19 lockdowns. The data indicate that this perceived increase in aggression is likely to provoke higher levels of aggression in some drivers. Campaigns to reduce aggression on the roads need to focus on changing road culture and improving interactions, or perceived interactions, among road users."

However, the application of titanium alloys in ultra-precision field is limited by the poor machinability. There are difficulties in obtaining the optical surface. In this study, the possibility for obtaining optically graded surfaces of titanium alloys by ultra-precision polishing was investigated. Before the ultra-precision polishing, ultra-precision turning with a single point diamond tool was used to get all sample surfaces. But, titanium alloy is difficult to obtain good surface quality by ultra-precision diamond turning. The samples results confirmed that most of the surface roughness values are higher than 30 nm. In order to explore the polishing process, a large number of ultra-precision polishing experiments were conducted. In addition, the effects of different ultra-precision polishing parameters on the surface profiles of titanium alloy Ti6Al4V were investigated in depth. The results show that the average values of surface roughness of titanium alloy parts with ultra-precision turning can be further reduced by 70% or so by ultra-precision polishing. Using a reasonable combination of high spindle speed and large cutting depth, the value of surface roughness can even be lower than 2 nm."
https://openalex.org/W4289345632,"The recent advance in massively parallel sequencing has enabled accurate microbiome profiling at a dramatically lowered cost. Then, the human microbiome has been the subject of intensive investigation in public health and medicine. In the meanwhile, researchers have developed lots of microbiome data analysis methods, protocols, and/or tools. Among those, especially, the web platforms can be highlighted because of the user-friendly interfaces and streamlined protocols for a long sequence of analytic procedures. However, existing web platforms can handle only a categorical trait of interest, cross-sectional study design, and the analysis with no covariate adjustment. We therefore introduce here a unified web platform, named MiCloud, for a binary or continuous trait of interest, cross-sectional or longitudinal/family-based study design, and with or without covariate adjustment. MiCloud handles all such types of analyses for both ecological measures (i.e., alpha and beta diversity indices) and microbial taxa in relative abundance on different taxonomic levels (i.e., phylum, class, order, family, genus and species). Importantly, MiCloud also provides a unified analytic protocol that streamlines data inputs, quality controls, data transformations, statistical methods and visualizations with vastly extended utility and flexibility that are suited to microbiome data analysis. We illustrate the use of MiCloud through the United Kingdom twin study on the association between gut microbiome and body mass index adjusting for age. MiCloud can be implemented on either the web server ( http://micloud.kr ) or the user’s computer ( https://github.com/wg99526/micloudgit )."
https://openalex.org/W4289518107,"This article discusses and compares statistical designs of basket trial, from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Baskets trials are used in oncology to study interventions that are developed to target a specific feature (often genetic alteration or immune phenotype) that is observed across multiple tissue types and/or tumor histologies. Patient heterogeneity has become pivotal to the development of non-cytotoxic treatment strategies. Treatment targets are often rare and exist among several histologies, making prospective clinical inquiry challenging for individual tumor types. More generally, basket trials are a type of master protocol often used for label expansion. Master protocol is used to refer to designs that accommodates multiple targets, multiple treatments, or both within one overarching protocol. For the purpose of making sequential decisions about treatment futility, Simon's two-stage design is often embedded within master protocols. In basket trials, this frequentist design is often applied to independent evaluations of tumor histologies and/or indications. In the tumor agnostic setting, rarer indications may fail to reach the sample size needed for even the first evaluation for futility. With recent innovations in Bayesian methods, it is possible to evaluate for futility with smaller sample sizes, even for rarer indications. Novel Bayesian methodology for a sequential basket trial design based on predictive probability is introduced. The Bayesian predictive probability designs allow interim analyses with any desired frequency, including continual assessments after each patient observed. The sequential design is compared with and without Bayesian methods for sharing information among a collection of discrete, and potentially non-exchangeable tumor types. Bayesian designs are compared with Simon's two-stage minimax design."
https://openalex.org/W4289521123,"The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge (ABCD-NP-Challenge) is a community-driven competition that challenges competitors to develop algorithms to predict fluid intelligence scores from T1-w MRI images. In this work, a two-step deep learning pipeline is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of fluid intelligence scores. In terms of the first step, the main contributions of this study include the following: (1) the concepts of the residual network (ResNet) and the squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) are utilized to improve the original 3D U-Net; (2) in the segmentation process, the pixels in symmetrical brain regions are assigned the same label; (3) to remove redundant background information from the segmented regions of interest (ROIs), a minimum bounding cube (MBC) is used to enclose the ROIs. This new segmentation structure can greatly improve the segmentation performance of the ROIs in the brain as compared with the classical convolutional neural network (CNN), which yields a Dice coefficient of 0.8920. In the second stage, MBCs are used to train neural network regression models for enhanced nonlinearity. The fluid intelligence score prediction results of the proposed method are found to be superior to those of current state-of-the-art approaches, and the proposed method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 82.56 on a test data set, which reflects a very competitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W4289262006,"Understanding habitat selection of top predators is critical to predict their impacts on ecological communities and interactions with humans, particularly in recovering populations. We analyzed habitat selection in a recovering population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) in south-central Indiana using a Random Forest model. We predicted that bobcats would select forest habitat and forest edges but avoid agriculture to maximize encounters with prey species. We also predicted that bobcats would avoid developed areas and roads to minimize potential antagonistic interactions with humans. Results partially supported our predictions and were consistent with bobcats in the early stages of population expansion. Bobcats exhibited elevated use near forest edges, thresholds of avoidance near agriculture, and thresholds of selection for low and intermediate habitat heterogeneity. Bobcats exhibited peak probability of use 1-3 km from major roads, >800 m from minor roads, and <1km from developed areas, suggesting tradeoffs in reward for high-quality hunting areas and mortality risk. Our Random Forest model highlighted complex non-linear patterns and revealed that most shifts in habitat use occurred within 1 km of the edge of each habitat type. These results largely supported previous studies in the Midwest and across North America but also produced refinements of bobcat habitat use in our system, particularly at habitat boundaries. Refined models of habitat selection by carnivores enable improved prediction of the most suitable habitat for recovering populations and provides useful information for conservation."

Aside from contagion by aerosols, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous on surfaces that millions of people handle daily. Therefore, controlling this pandemic involves the reduction of potential infections via contaminated surfaces. We developed antiviral surfaces by preparing suspensions of copper and cupric oxide nanoparticles in two different polymer matrices, poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyepoxide. For total copper contents as low as 5%, the composite material showed remarkable antiviral properties against the HCoV‐OC43 human coronavirus and against a model lentivirus and proved well-resistant to accelerated aging conditions. Importantly, we showed that the Cu/CuO mixture showed optimal performances. This product can be implemented to produce a simple and inexpensive coating with long-term antiviral properties and will open the way to developing surface coatings against a broad spectrum of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2."

Modifiable lifestyle factors (such as physical behaviors and nutritional habits) may be involved in sarcopenia etiology. European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older Population (EWGOSP2) established a cut-off point for sarcopenia diagnosis based on the European population and they recommend the use of a regional normative population. However, no sufficient data on sarcopenia prevalence is presently available in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this project aims to define appropriate reference values from healthy Saudi young adults (Phase I) and to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in Saudi Arabia (Phase II) and examine selected modifiable lifestyle correlates of sarcopenia (Phase I, II). Methods The project will involve two phases. Phase I will include 1532 healthy Saudi young adults aged between 20–40 years. While, Phase II will include 1532 Saudi older adults aged ≥50 years. The study will measure vital signs, anthropometrics, muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength using handgrip strength and maximal isometric strength, physical function using short physical performance battery, and 6-minute walk test to measure aerobic endurance. To explore the associations between lifestyle behaviors with sarcopenia indices, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be evaluated subjectively using Global Physical Activity Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and objectively via ActivPAL accelerometers. A three-day dietary food record will also be used to evaluate dietary intake. Additionally, EuroQOL five-dimension questionnaire will be utilized to assess health-related quality of life.

Their spatial distribution is important for effective pandemic treatment and daily prevention in cities. This paper used the Kernel Density Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) and shortest distance methods to calculate the accessibility of designated COVID-19 Fangcang hospitals and fever clinics in the Wuhan Metropolitan Development Zone. Their equality was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Lorentz curve. Several results were obtained: (1) The facilities’ accessibility declines radial from the central to peripheral areas. (2) Most of the demand points in the study area can reach the medical facilities for COVID-19 pandemic treatment within 60 minutes. (3) For the spatial distribution of these facilities, the equality evaluated for different time thresholds differed significantly, with long time thresholds having better equality than for short time thresholds. (4) While the distances distribution of fever clinics is balanced, the equality gap in various areas remains enormous when considering population distribution. Suggestions for optimizing the spatial distribution of pandemic treatment medical facilities in Wuhan are proposed, and which will serve as references for the planning of Wuhan’s pandemic medical facilities in the future."

In this study, a biodegradable chitosan microneedle patch to deliver meloxicam for managing pain in cattle was tested. The potential of reuse of the polymeric solution to fabricate the patches, optimization of fabrication, morphological analysis of the microneedle patch and analysis of preservation of the chemical composition after sterilization were evaluated. In-vitro analysis consisted of studying in-vitro penetration mechanical properties, compression testing analysis of microneedle patch, and in-vitro drug release analysis. In-vivo studies were performed to analyze the dissolution capability of the microneedle patch. Results regarding the physical characteristics, chemical composition, and mechanical properties confirmed that rheological properties of the chitosan solution, present significant differences over time, demonstrating that reusing the solution on the fourth day results in failure patches. Morphological characteristics and chemical composition studies revealed that the process of sterilization (ethylene oxide gas) needed for implanting the patches into the skin did not affect the properties of microneedle patches. In-vitro studies showed that approximately 33.02 ± 3.88% of the meloxicam was released over 7 days. A full penetration of the microneedles into the skin can be obtained by applying approximately 3.2 N. In-vivo studies demonstrated that microneedle patches were capable of swelling and dissolving, exhibiting a dissolution percentage of more than 50% of the original height of microneedle after 7 days. No abnormal tissue, swelling, or inflammation was observed in the implanted area. The results of this work show that chitosan biodegradable microneedle patches may be useful to deliver meloxicam to improve pain management of cattle with positive effects for commercial manufacturing."

The Amhara region is one of the major teff producers regions in the country. However, information on the phenolic content of the region's teff varieties is limited. Seventy-two teff samples were collected from three administrative zones (West Gojjam zone, Awi zone, and East Gojjam zone) of the Amhara region of Ethiopia.

The total flavonoid contents expressed as catechin equivalent, CE (i.e., under alkaline conditions) and quercetin equivalent, Q.E (i.e., under the methanolic solution of AlCl3) were found to be in the range of 7.66 ± 0.60-57.36 ± 3.87 mg C.E and 15.45 ± 0.15-113.12 ± 3.09 mg Q.E per 100 g of teff samples, respectively. The corresponding total polyphenol content (TPC), described as gallic acid equivalent (G.A.E.), was in the range of 46.21 ± 1.20-133.32 ± 5.44 mg G.A.E. The results showed that the mean TPC value of the teff samples from the West Gojjam zone was enriched with polyphenol than samples from the Awi zone and East Gojjam. Furthermore, it was noted that the mean TPC and TFC values did not vary significantly between samples of the East Gojjam and Awi zone (p > 0.05). In contrast, a significant difference in mean TPC and TFC-Q.E were noted between the sampling zone of East Gojjam and West Gojjam and between West Gojjam and Awi zones (p < 0.05). These significant variations in TPC and TFC might be due to observable variations in the agroecological zones and the genetic-make-up of the samples. Person correlation indicated a significant positive correlation matrix between the three variables (p = 0.01). The teff samples were trying to be classified based on their geographical origin using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and biplots. Accordingly, the variance explained by component 1 (PC1) is 67.2%, and the variance explained by component 2 (PC2) is 20.0%."

The aperiodic crystals which are composed of two different dielectrics submit to Cantor sequence. Defects in Cantor crystals can greatly enhance the localization of electric field, which induces the optical fractal effect. The number of optical fractal states increases exponentially with the generation number of Cantor sequence. Moreover, the optical fractal characteristics depend on the incident angle of light, of which the fractal states may split/incorporate by modulating the value of incident angle. This study could be utilized for band-pass filters and reflectors."
https://openalex.org/W4289545445,"House dust mite (HDM) allergens cause inflammatory responses and chronic allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which HDM induces C–C chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) expression to promote chronic inflammation and airway remodeling in an HDM-induced bronchial asthma mouse model. We showed that HDM increased CCL20 levels via the Akt-ERK1/2-C/EBPβ pathway. To investigate the role of CCL20 in chronic airway inflammation and remodeling, we made a mouse model of CCL20-induced bronchial asthma. Treatment of anti-CCL20Ab in this mouse model showed the reduced airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammatory cell infiltration into peribronchial region by neutralizing CCL20. In addition, CCL20 induced the Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation through NLRP3 deubiquitination and transcriptional upregulation in BEAS-2B cells. As expected, anti-CCL20Ab markedly suppressed NLRP3 activation induced by CCL20. Moreover, HDM-induced CCL20 leads to epithelial–mesenchymal transition in the lung epithelium which appears to be an important regulator of airway remodeling in allergic asthma. We also found that anti-CCL20Ab attenuates airway inflammation and remodeling in an HDM-induced mouse model of bronchial asthma. Taken together, our results suggest that HDM-induced CCL20 is required for chronic inflammation that contributes airway remodeling in a mouse model of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W4289262475,"There are few examples of interventions designed to promote physical activity (PA) in adults with Cystic fibrosis (CF). Increasing levels of habitual PA may be more feasible and result in greater compliance than conventional exercise training inventions which give little or no attention to long-term PA behaviour. Despite this there is limited research exploring perceptions of PA among adults with CF. The study aimed to understand the ecological correlates of PA in adults with CF and to involve individuals with CF, their families (where applicable) and clinicians in a formative process to inform the development of an ecological approach to PA promotion in this population.An iterative approach was utilised, whereby findings from earlier phases of the research informed subsequent phases. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore patients' perceptions of PA, devised using the PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. Followed by, focus groups to discuss the perceived barriers, facilitators and opportunities for PA participation and how this information could inform the development and delivery of a PA intervention. Separate focus groups were conducted with individuals with CF (n = 11) and their families and CF MDT members. Thematic analysis was used to construct themes.Physical and mental wellbeing manifested as both barriers and facilitators of PA. CF is characterised by a progressive decline in physical function, which presents as a number of challenging symptoms and set-backs for an individual with CF. PA represents an opportunity for participants to slow the rate of this decline and manage the symptoms associated with the condition. Enjoyment was an important facilitator of PA. Exercise professionals and family reinforce PA behaviour, particularly during adolescence.PA promotion should form part of routine CF care with additional exercise professional support during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W4289517945,"Background Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating, OMIM %114110) is a complex disorder with multifactorial causes. Emotional strains and social stress increase symptoms and lead to a vicious circle. Previously, we showed significantly higher depression scores, and normal cortisol awakening responses in patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH). Stress reactivity in response to a (virtual) Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) has not been studied so far. Therefore, we measured sweat secretion, salivary cortisol and alpha amylase (sAA) concentrations, and subjective stress ratings in affected and non-affected subjects in response to a TSST-VR. Method In this pilot study, we conducted TSST-VRs and performed general linear models with repeated measurements for salivary cortisol and sAA levels, heart rate, axillary sweat and subjective stress ratings for two groups (diagnosed PFH (n = 11), healthy controls (n = 16)). Results PFH patients showed significantly heightened sweat secretion over time compared to controls ( p = 0.006), with highest quantities during the TSST-VR. In both groups, sweating ( p &lt; 0.001), maximum cortisol levels ( p = 0.002), feelings of stress ( p &lt; 0.001), and heart rate ( p &lt; 0.001) but not sAA ( p = 0.068) increased significantly in response to the TSST-VR. However, no differences were detected in subjective ratings, cortisol concentrations and heart rate between PFH patients and controls ( p all &gt; 0.131). Conclusion Patients with diagnosed PFH showed stress-induced higher sweat secretion compared to healthy controls but did not differ in the stress reactivity with regard to endocrine or subjective markers. This pilot study is in need of replication to elucidate the role of the sympathetic nervous system as a potential pathway involved in the stress-induced emotional sweating of PFH patients."

Taking advantage of the selective dependence of cancer cells on high glucose and combining glucose deprivation with these agents could produce therapeutic synergy.In this study we examined the effect of glucose as well as its deprivation, and antagonism using the non-metabolized analogue 2-deoxy glucose, on the proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-231, YS1.2 and pII and one normal breast cell line, using the MTT assay. Motility was quantitatively assessed using the wound healing assay. Lactate, as the end product of anaerobic glucose metabolism, secreted into culture medium was measured by a biochemical assay. The effect of paclitaxel and doxorubicin on cell proliferation was tested in the absence and presence of low concentrations of glucose using MTT assay.In all cell lines, glucose supplementation enhanced while glucose deprivation reduced both their proliferation and motility. Lactate added to the medium could substitute for glucose. The inhibitory effects of paclitaxel and doxorubicin were significantly enhanced when glucose concentration was decreased in the culture medium, requiring 1000-fold lesser concentration to achieve a similar degree of inhibition to that seen in glucose-containing medium.Our data show that a synergy was obtained by combining paclitaxel and doxorubicin with glucose reduction to inhibit cancer cell growth, which in vivo, might be achieved by applying a carbohydrate-restricted diet during the limited phase of application of chemotherapy; this could permit a dose reduction of the cytotoxic agents, resulting in greater tolerance and lesser side effects."

https://openalex.org/W4289521070,"Behaviors and vocalizations associated with aggression are essential for animals to survive, reproduce, and organize social hierarchy. Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are highly aggressive and frequently emit calls. We took advantage of these features to study the relationship between vocalizations and aggressive behaviors in virgin and sexually experienced male and female Mongolian gerbils through the same-sex resident-intruder test. Both sexes of resident gerbils exhibited aggressive responses toward intruders. Multiparous females exhibited the most aggressive responses among the four groups. We also confirmed two groups of vocalizations during the encounters: high-frequency (>24.6 kHz) and low-frequency (<24.6 kHz). At the timing of high-frequency vocalizations observed during the tests, the vast majority (96.2%) of the behavioral interactions were non-agonistic. While, at the timing of low-frequency vocalizations observed during the tests, around half (45%) of the behavioral interactions were agonistic. Low-frequency vocalizations were observed mainly during encounters in which multiparous females were involved. These results suggest that high- and low-frequency vocalizations relate to non-agonistic and agonistic interactions, respectively. In addition to affecting aggressive behavior, sexual experience also affects vocalization during encounters. These findings provide new insights into the modulatory effects of sex and sexual experience on vocalizations during agonistic encounters."

Indeed, several imaging techniques have been developed and optimized in the last decades, but an optimal method has not been described yet. The combination of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a focused ion beam (FIB), represents a pioneering and interesting tool to allow the investigation of the relationship occurring at the interface between cells and biomaterials, including titanium. However, major caveats concerning the nature of the biological structures, which are not conductive materials, and the physico-chemical properties of titanium (i.e. color, surface topography), require a fine and accurate preparation of the sample before its imaging. Hence, the aim of the present work is to provide a suitable protocol for cell-titanium sample preparation before imaging by SEM-FIB. The concepts presented in this paper are also transferrable to other fields of biomaterials research."
https://openalex.org/W4289521457,"Auto-grading of short answer questions is considered a challenging problem in the processing of natural language. It requires a system to comprehend the free text answers to automatically assign a grade for a student answer compared to one or more model answers. This paper suggests an optimized deep learning model for grading short-answer questions automatically by using various sizes of datasets collected in the Science subject for students in seventh grade in Egypt. The proposed system is a hybrid approach that optimizes a deep learning technique called LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) with a recent optimization algorithm called a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The GWO is employed to optimize the LSTM by selecting the best dropout and recurrent dropout rates of LSTM hyperparameters rather than manual choice. Using GWO makes the LSTM model more generalized and can also avoid the problem of overfitting in forecasting the students' scores to improve the learning process and save instructors' time and effort. The model's performance is measured in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the Pearson correlation coefficient, and R-Square. According to the simulation results, the hybrid GWO with the LSTM model ensured the best performance and outperformed the classical LSTM model and other compared models such that it had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient value, the lowest RMSE value, and the best R square value in all experiments, but higher training time than the traditional deep learning model."
https://openalex.org/W4289636394,"The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and its connection to endothelial cell–cell junctions determine the barrier function of endothelial cells. The proper regulation of barrier opening/closing is necessary for the normal function of vessels, and its dysregulation can result in chronic and acute inflammation leading to edema formation. By using atomic force microscopy, we show here that thrombin-induced permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, associated with actin stress fiber formation, stiffens the cell center. The depletion of the MEK/ERK kinase BRAF reduces thrombin-induced permeability prevents stress fiber formation and cell stiffening. The peripheral actin ring becomes stabilized by phosphorylated myosin light chain, while cofilin is excluded from the cell periphery. All these changes can be reverted by the inhibition of ROCK, but not of the MEK/ERK module. We propose that the balance between the binding of cofilin and myosin to F-actin in the cell periphery, which is regulated by the activity of ROCK, determines the local dynamics of actin reorganization, ultimately driving or preventing stress fiber formation."

Specifically, by adding the target detection phase before the behavior recognition algorithm, the body region in the video can be accurately extracted to reduce the interference of redundant and unnecessary background noises, and at the same time, the inappropriate images can be replaced, which has reached the role of balance background trade-off, and finally, the neural network can learn the human behavior information with emphasis. By adding fragmentation and stochastic sampling, the long-time time-domain modeling of the whole video session can be established, so that the model can obtain video-level expression ability. Finally, the improved loss function is used for behavior recognition to solve the problem of classification difficulty and possible sample imbalance. In addition, we conducted the hyperparametric experiment, the ablation experiment and the contrast experiment on different open source and benchmark datasets. Compared with other commonly used behavior recognition algorithms, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the related deep learning-based methods used in behavior recognition are reviewed at the beginning of this paper, and the challenges in behavior recognition and future research directions are prospected at the end of this paper, which will undoubtedly play a double role in the work of later researchers."
https://openalex.org/W4289262130,"Farming new species and promoting polyculture can enhance aquaculture sustainability. This implies to define the rearing conditions that meet the ecological requirements of a target species and/or to assess if different species can live in the same farming environment. However, there is a large number of rearing conditions and/or taxon combinations that can be considered. In order to minimise cumbersome and expensive empirical trials to explore all possibilities, we introduce a tool, AquaDesign. It is based on a R-script and package which help to determine farming conditions that are most likely suitable for species through in silico assessment. We estimate farming conditions potentially suitable for an aquatic organism by considering the species niche. We define the species n-dimensional niche hypervolume using a correlative approach in which the species niche is estimated by relating distribution data to environmental conditions. Required input datasets are mined from several public databases. The assistant tool allows users to highlight (i) abiotic conditions that are most likely suitable for species and (ii) combinations of species potentially able to live in the same abiotic environment. Moreover, it offers the possibility to assess if a particular set of abiotic conditions or a given farming location is potentially suitable for the monoculture or the polyculture of species of interest. Our tool provides useful pieces of information to develop freshwater aquacultures. Using the large amount of biogeographic and abiotic information available in public databases allows us to propose a pragmatic and operational tool even for species for which abiotic requirements are poorly or not available in literature such as currently non-produced species. Overall, we argue that the assistant tool can act as a stepping stone to promote new aquatic productions which are required to enhance aquaculture sustainability."

From these analyses, we determined that transcription factors (TFs) of E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. nuttalli are associated mainly with the LIM family, while the TFs in E. invadens are associated with the RRM_1 family. In addition, we identified that EHI_044890 regulates 121 genes in E. histolytica, EDI_297980 regulates 284 genes in E. dispar, ENU1_120230 regulates 195 genes in E. nuttalli, and EIN_249270 regulates 257 genes in E. invadens. Finally, we identified that three types of processes, Macromolecule metabolic process, Cellular macromolecule metabolic process, and Cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, are the main biological processes for each network. The results described in this work can be used as a basis for the study of gene regulation in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W4289262293,"The hallmarks of biological processes that underlie the development of cancer have been long recognized, yet, existing therapeutic treatments cannot prevent cancer from continuing to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This work was aimed at exploring the extent to which the cell-membrane proteins are implicated in triggering cancer hallmark processes, and assessing the ability to pinpoint tumor-specific therapeutic targets through a combined membrane proteome/cancer hallmark perspective. By using GO annotations, a database of human proteins associated broadly with ten cancer hallmarks was created. Cell-membrane cellular subfractions of SKBR3/HER2+ breast cancer cells, used as a model system, were analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry, and high-quality proteins (FDR<3%) identified by at least two unique peptides were mapped to the cancer hallmark database. Over 1,400 experimentally detected cell-membrane or cell-membrane associated proteins, representing ~18% of the human cell-membrane proteome, could be matched to the hallmark database. Representative membrane constituents such as receptors, CDs, adhesion and transport proteins were distributed over the entire genome and present in every hallmark category. Sustained proliferative signaling/cell cycle, adhesion/tissue invasion, and evasion of immune destruction emerged as prevalent hallmarks represented by the membrane proteins. Construction of protein-protein interaction networks uncovered a high level of connectivity between the hallmark members, with some receptor (EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR, MTOR, CSF1R), antigen (CD44), and adhesion (MUC1) proteins being implicated in most hallmark categories. An illustrative subset of 138 hallmark proteins that included 42 oncogenes, 24 tumor suppressors, 9 oncogene/tumor suppressor, and 45 approved drug targets was subjected to a more in-depth analysis. The existing drug targets were implicated mainly in signaling processes. Network centrality analysis revealed that nodes with high degree, rather than betweenness, represent a good resource for informing the selection of putative novel drug targets. Through heavy involvement in supporting cancer hallmark processes, we show that the functionally diverse and networked landscape of cancer cell-membrane proteins fosters unique opportunities for guiding the development of novel therapeutic interventions, including multi-agent, immuno-oncology and precision medicine applications."

Although it is critical to understand the factors that contribute to short inter-pregnancy interval to reduce the risk of these negative outcomes, adequate evidence about the factors in the urban context is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to assess the duration of the inter-pregnancy interval and its predictors among pregnant women in urban South Ethiopia.A community-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 2171 pregnant women in five geographically diverse urban settings in South Ethiopia. For the analysis, a Cox gamma shared frailty (random-effect) model was used. Adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with a 95% CI was used to assess significant predictors. The median hazard ratio (MHR) used to report clustering effect.The median duration of the inter-pregnancy interval was 22 months, 95% CI (21, 23), with an inter-quartile range of 14 months. Maternal age ≥30 years [AHR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.97], having no formal education [AHR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.78], contraceptive non-use [AHR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.94, 2.66], breastfeeding for <24 months [AHR = 4.92, 95% CI: 3.95, 6.12], death of recent child [AHR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.41, 5.97], plan pregnancy within 24 months [AHR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.35], lack of discussion with husband [AHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.60] and lack of husband encouragement about pregnancy spacing [AHR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.48] were predictors of short inter-pregnancy interval. Adjusting for predictors, the median increase in the hazard of short inter-pregnancy interval in a cluster with higher short inter-pregnancy interval is 30% [MHR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43] than lower cluster.In the study settings, the duration of the inter-pregnancy interval was shorter than the World Health Organization recommendation. There is a need to improve contraceptive use and breastfeeding duration to maximize the inter-pregnancy interval. Men's involvement in reproductive health services and advocacy for women's reproductive decision-making autonomy are fundamental. The contextual disparities in the inter-pregnancy interval suggests further study and interventions."

We analyzed patients' mobility level, through the Perme ICU Mobility Score (Perme Score) of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The Perme Mobility Index (PMI) was calculated [PMI = ΔPerme Score (ICU discharge-ICU admission)/ICU length of stay], and patients were categorized as ""improved"" (PMI > 0) or ""not improved"" (PMI ≤ 0).

Collectives are vulnerable to hidden-profile environments, where task-relevant information is unevenly distributed across individuals. To do well in this task, information aggregation must equally weigh minority and majority views against simple but inefficient majority-based decisions. In an experimental design, human volunteers working in teams of 10 were asked to solve a hidden-profile prediction task. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn people's hidden information distribution by observing how people's judgments correlated over time. A bot was designed to sample responses from the VAE latent embedding to selectively support opinions proportionally to their under-representation in the team. We show that the presence of a single bot (representing 10% of team members) can significantly increase the polarization between minority and majority opinions by making minority opinions less prone to social influence. Although the effects on hybrid team performance were small, the bot presence significantly influenced opinion dynamics and individual accuracy. These findings show that self-supervized machine learning techniques can be used to design algorithms that can sway opinion dynamics and group outcomes."

In society, one of the most visible forms of violence is young people violence, whereas they, adolescents and young adults, are the main victims of such violence. There was limited information on the burden of violence and factors among this age group. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of violence and its associated factors among youth in Northwest, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted to estimate the magnitude of violence among youth in Northwest, Ethiopia. Data were taken from the mega project entitled assessment of common health problem and risky health behavior among youth. Youth violence was the dependent variable whereas the socio-demographic variables and substance use were the independent-variables. The bivariate logistic regression model was employed to identify associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to determine factors associated with violence. Results From the total 1765 representatives of the youth population,1597 (90.5%) youth participated in the study. Overall, the prevalence of violence among youth aged 15–24 years for the last 12 months was 21.5%. In the multivariable logistic regression model, factors significantly associated with violence were being married and divorced (AOR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.13, 2.79) and (AOR = 5.67, 95%CI: 2.93, 10.99), respectively, living with mother’s only (AOR = 1.85,95%CI: 1.28, 2.66) and father’s only (AOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.30, 4.63), and substance use (AOR = 2.38,95% CI: 1.56, 3.66). Conclusions The prevalence of violence among youth was high compared to other studies. Special emphasis Should be given for youth violence in order to manage the victims as well as for preventing and controlling the identified factors through strengthening policies and strategies."
