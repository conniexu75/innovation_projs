To delineate the underlying projection-specific circuit mechanisms, we employed optogenetics to control mesopontine cholinergic neurons at somata and at divergent projections within distinct midbrain areas. Bidirectional manipulation of PPN cholinergic cell bodies exerted opposing effects on locomotor behavior and reinforcement learning. These motor and reward effects were separable via limiting photostimulation to PPN cholinergic terminals in the ventral substantia nigra pars compacta (vSNc) or to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), respectively. LDT cholinergic neurons also form connections with vSNc and VTA neurons; however, although photo-excitation of LDT cholinergic terminals in the VTA caused positive reinforcement, LDT-to-vSNc modulation did not alter locomotion or reward. Therefore, the selective targeting of projection-specific mesopontine cholinergic pathways may offer increased benefit in treating movement and addiction disorders.

The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a heterogeneous brainstem structure that contains cholinergic (ChAT), glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurons (Benarroch, 2013Benarroch E.E.

Disord. 2009; 24: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that PPN ChAT neurons play key roles in both motor and non-motor behaviors (Morita et al., 2014Morita H. Hass C.J. Moro E. Sudhyadhom A. Kumar R. Okun M.S.

Parkinson’s disease patients with gait disorders and postural instability display degeneration of the PPN ChAT neurons, and the severity of balance deficits is correlated with a reduction in PPN ChAT-neuron numbers and activity (Bohnen et al., 2009Bohnen N.I.

In parkinsonian non-human primate models, chemical lesion of PPN ChAT neurons is necessary and sufficient to impair gait and balance (Karachi et al., 2010Karachi C. Grabli D. Bernard F.A. Tandé D. Wattiez N. Belaid H. Bardinet E. Prigent A. Nothacker H.P. Hunot S. et al.Cholinergic mesencephalic neurons are involved in gait and postural disorders in Parkinson disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition to affecting motor behavior, ChAT-neuron-selective chemical lesions of the PPN also affect drug-seeking behavior (Lança et al., 2000Lança A.J. Adamson K.L. Coen K.M. Chow B.L.

These studies suggest that PPN ChAT neurons are instrumental for normal function in movement and reward reinforcement; however, they do not identify the downstream effectors. The PPN projects to multiple targets in the basal ganglia, midbrain, cerebellum, thalamus, and the reticular formation (Ballanger et al., 2009Ballanger B. Lozano A.M. Moro E. van Eimeren T. Hamani C.

Whether selectively and temporarily enhancing the tonic activity of PPN ChAT neurons, without affecting PPN glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, is sufficient to recruit SNc and VTA neurons and to regulate the aforementioned behaviors is unknown. A strategy that enables specific modulation of ChAT projections without perturbing glutamatergic and GABAergic projections can facilitate both in vitro and in vivo characterization of ChAT circuitry originated in the PPN. To dissect out the behavioral effect of ChAT signaling along each PPN-to-midbrain circuit, we have employed optogenetic tools (Gradinaru et al., 2009Gradinaru V. Mogri M. Thompson K.R. Henderson J.M.

Electrical and chemical interventions, which are commonly used to study the anatomy and physiology of the PPN, do not offer the spatiotemporal or cell-type specificity required to selectively harness specific PPN ChAT projections to the VTA and SNc or to examine differences in PPN cell connectivity with SNc and VTA nuclei. Highlighting the requirement for precise spatial targeting of neuronal manipulations, it is noteworthy that the dorsal and ventral tiers of the SNc (dSNc and vSNc) project to distinct sub-regions of the striatum and may have differential vulnerability to neurodegenerative assaults (Hassan and Benarroch, 2015Hassan A. Benarroch E.E. Heterogeneity of the midbrain dopamine system: Implications for Parkinson disease.Neurology. 2015; 85: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, they merit investigation as separate subnuclei. We found that optogenetic modulation of PPN ChAT somata altered both motor activity and reward reinforcement, whereas targeted photo-stimulation of PPN ChAT terminals in the vSNc or VTA granted separable control of these physiological processes. Importantly, these results do not rule out cholinergic control of midbrain functions from non-PPN sources. Indeed, as shown before (Chen and Lodge, 2013Chen L. Lodge D.J.

Neurophysiol. 2013; 110: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Lodge and Grace, 2006Lodge D.J. Grace A.A.

Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 58: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and confirmed here, ChAT neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) also formed functional connections with midbrain neurons. While photo-excitation of these connections in the VTA regulated reward reinforcement, photoexcitation of LDT ChAT terminals in the vSNc did not alter locomotion, which contrasts with the effects of PPN-originating cholinergic modulation. Therefore, ChAT projections from the PPN and the LDT to the vSNc and VTA play distinct roles in regulating motor and reward behaviors. Previous studies (Benarroch, 2013Benarroch E.E.

As these techniques often lacked cell specificity, ChAT connections were neither imaged in intact form nor were they selectively stimulated without also perturbing glutamatergic and GABAergic connections. We injected adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying Cre-dependent (double-floxed inverse open reading frame [DIO]) ChR2-eYFP into the PPN of ChAT-Cre rats to selectively label ChAT neurons and their projections (Figure 1A). To visualize the projections to the SNc and VTA, we used PACT clearing (Treweek et al., 2015Treweek J.B. Chan K.Y. Flytzanis N.C. Yang B. Deverman B.E. Greenbaum A. Lignell A. Xiao C. Cai L.

We observed ChR2-eYFP-labeled axonal fibers from PPN ChAT neurons within both the dorsal and ventral tiers of the SNc (dSNc and vSNc) as well as within the VTA (Figures 1B and 1C). We confirmed the functional properties of these connections by performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SNc and VTA neurons adjacent to ChR2-expressing PPN ChAT axonal fibers in live midbrain slices of ChR2-injected rats (Figure 1D). ChAT neurons usually form connections with downstream neurons through non-synaptic volume transmission (Miwa et al., 2011Miwa J.M. Freedman R. Lester H.A. Neural systems governed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: emerging hypotheses.Neuron. 2011; 70: 20-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since ACh released in response to a short stimulation epoch is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase before reaching its receptors, long stimulation epochs are necessary in order for ACh to accumulate and subsequently activate ACh receptors. Therefore, to increase our probability of detecting existing functional ChAT transmission, we applied 5–10 s continuous blue light stimulation (Figures 1E–1G). Under these conditions, we detected inward currents in 33%, 24%, and 44% of vSNc, dSNc, and VTA neurons, respectively (Figures 1E–1I). Meanwhile, blue light accelerated neuronal firing (Figures 1E–1G and 1J). These data suggest that PPN ChAT neurons form excitatory connections with SNc and VTA neurons. Midbrain neurons contain both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors (nAChRs and mAChRs) (Drenan and Lester, 2012Drenan R.M. Lester H.A.

Role of tegmental cholinergic neurons in dopaminergic activation, antimuscarinic psychosis and schizophrenia.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1995; 12: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and either are capable of mediating the response to light-induced ChAT release. We observed photocurrents that were not significantly changed by atropine, a mAChR antagonist, but that were significantly blocked by mecamylamine (MEC), a nAChR antagonist (Figure 1K; Figures S1A and S1D); furthermore, MEC also blocked the enhancement of firing in response to photo-excitation (Figure 1E). These data suggest that nAChRs predominantly mediate the connectivity between PPN ChAT neurons and SNc/VTA neurons. Given that nAChRs modulate neurotransmitter release in midbrain (Dani and Bertrand, 2007Dani J.A. Bertrand D. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms of the central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), the nAChRs that mediate the photocurrents could be located on the recorded neurons or on afferent terminals releasing other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or GABA. To define where these nAChRs are located, we further characterized the pharmacological properties of the photocurrents. We observed that bicuculline (10 μM, Bic), a GABAA receptor blocker, did not affect the photocurrents in midbrain neurons, but 10 μM MEC blocked these currents (Figure 1K; Figures S1B and S1E). In some midbrain neurons (8/18), the photocurrents were completely blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists (APV and CNQX), whereas, in other neurons (10/18), the combined application of APV and CNQX only partially reduced the currents, and MEC blocked the remaining currents (Figure 1K; Figures S1C and S1F). These results suggest that nAChRs both in afferent glutamatergic terminals and in midbrain neurons are important targets of endogenously released ACh from PPN. The above optogenetic tracing data (Figures 1B and 1C) support the hypothesis that the SNc and VTA are downstream targets of PPN ChAT neurons. Since the SNc and VTA are involved in locomotion and reward reinforcement (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010Bromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O.

Dissecting the diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36: 336-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it follows that PPN ChAT activity may impact locomotion and reward reinforcement. To test this hypothesis, we selectively and reversibly manipulated opsin-expressing PPN ChAT neurons in freely behaving rats. Similar to previous studies (Jenkinson et al., 2009Jenkinson N. Nandi D. Muthusamy K. Ray N.J. Gregory R. Stein J.F. Aziz T.Z. Anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the pedunculopontine nucleus.Mov. Disord. 2009; 24: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), our data illustrate that ChAT neurons reside throughout the PPN and account for almost half of all neurons in both the rostral and caudal PPN (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figure S2A). To tailor practical optogenetic stimulation paradigm (i.e., duration and frequency) to modulate neurons within their spiking capability, we therefore characterized the biophysical properties of PPN ChAT neurons using brain-slice patch-clamp recordings (Figures 2C–2H). Most PPN neurons fired spontaneously at <10 Hz (Figure S2B). When increasing steps of depolarizing current were injected into PPN neurons, the firing rates of ChAT neurons increased more than non-ChAT neurons (Figure 2E; Table S1), consistent with our data showing that ChAT neurons had higher input resistance (Figure 2F). The optimal stimulation duration to evoke reliable single action potential for PPN neurons was 10 ms (Figures 2G and 2H; Figures S2C and S2D; Table S2). Thus, we applied 10 ms light pulses to evoke action potentials in the following ex vivo and in vivo experiments involving optogenetic excitation. To achieve optogenetic control of PPN ChAT neurons, we stereotaxically delivered AAV5-DIO- ChR2-eYFP or Arch3.0-eYFP genes into the PPN of ChAT-Cre rats (Chow et al., 2010Chow B.Y. Han X. Dobry A.S.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in PPN brain slices (Figures S3A and S3D) confirmed functional expression levels of virally transduced ChR2 and Arch3 in PPN neurons: blue and green light stimulation evoked robust photocurrents in recorded cells (Figures 3D and 3L; Figures S3C, S3E, and S3F) and effectively modified the firing patterns (Figures 3E and 3L). Opsin expression was specific to ChAT neurons (Figures 3C and 3K). Additionally, blue light pulses (10 ms) reliably evoked inward currents (Figure S3E) and action potentials (Figures 3E–3H) in PPN ChAT neurons expressing ChR2 (Figure S3A). To understand the behavioral contributions of PPN ChAT neurons, we monitored freely moving rats for changes in locomotor activity in response to photo-modulation of opsin-expressing PPN ChAT neurons. For photo-excitation, we applied 20 Hz stimuli (Figure 4A; Figure S4A) because: 20 Hz is higher than the average spontaneous firing rates (<12 Hz) of PPN neurons shown in our in vitro data (Figure S2B; Table S1) and in previous in vivo studies (Norton et al., 2011Norton A.B.

However, research is still needed to further elaborate potential relationships between nutrition, gut microbiota and host’s health by means of a suitable animal model. The present study examined the effect of two different diets on microbial composition and activity by using the pig as a model for humans. Eight pigs were equally allotted to two treatments, either fed a low-fat/high-fiber (LF), or a high-fat/low-fiber (HF) diet for 7 weeks. Feces were sampled at day 7 of every experimental week. Diet effects on fecal microbiota were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR, DNA fingerprinting and metaproteomics. Furthermore, fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles and ammonia concentrations were determined. Gene copy numbers of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria (P<0.001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P<0.05) were higher in the LF pigs, while Enterobacteriaceae were more abundant in the HF pigs (P<0.001). Higher numbers of proteins affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae were also present in the HF samples. Proteins for polysaccharide breakdown did almost exclusively originate from Prevotellaceae. Total and individual fecal SCFA concentrations were higher for pigs of the LF treatment (P<0.05), whereas fecal ammonia concentrations did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). Results provide evidence that beginning from the start of the experiment, the LF diet stimulated beneficial bacteria and SCFA production, especially butyrate (P<0.05), while the HF diet fostered those bacterial groups which have been associated with a negative impact on health conditions. These findings correspond to results in humans and might strengthen the hypothesis that the response of the porcine gut microbiota to a specific dietary modulation is in support of using the pig as suitable animal model for humans to assess diet-gut-microbiota interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2336153618,"ABA has been widely acknowledged to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and signaling during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between these two hormones are largely unexplored. In the present study, exogenous ABA treatment obviously promoted fruit ripening as well as ethylene emission, whereas NDGA (Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis) application showed the opposite biological effects. Combined RNA-seq with time-course RT-PCR analysis, our study not only helped to illustrate how ABA regulated itself at the transcription level, but also revealed that ABA can facilitate ethylene production and response probably by regulating some crucial genes such as LeACS4, LeACO1, GR and LeETR6. In addition, investigation on the fruits treated with 1-MCP immediately after ABA exposure revealed that ethylene might be essential for the induction of ABA biosynthesis and signaling at the onset of fruit ripening. Furthermore, some specific transcription factors (TFs) known as regulators of ethylene synthesis and sensibility (e.g. MADS-RIN, TAGL1, CNR and NOR) were also observed to be ABA responsive, which implied that ABA influenced ethylene action possibly through the regulation of these TFs expression. Our comprehensive physiological and molecular-level analysis shed light on the mechanism of cross-talk between ABA and ethylene during the process of tomato fruit ripening."

Whether prebiotics can reduce intestinal generation of these microbial metabolites and improve insulin resistance in CKD patients not yet on dialysis remains unknown. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 40 patients with eGFR between 15 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patients were randomized to sequential treatment with prebiotic arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) (10 g twice daily) and maltodextrin for 4 weeks, or vice versa, with a 4-week wash-out period between both intervention periods. Serum levels and 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate, p-cresyl glucuronide, indoxyl sulfate, trimethylamine N-oxide and phenylacetylglutamine were determined at each time point using liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). A total of 39 patients completed the study. We observed no significant effect of AXOS on serum p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.42), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.59), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.70) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.41) and a small, albeit significant decreasing effect on serum trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.04). There were neither effect of AXOS on 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.31), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.23), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.87) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.43), nor on 24h urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.97). In addition, we observed no significant change in HOMA-IR (P 0.93). In conclusion, we could not demonstrate an influence of prebiotic AXOS on microbiota derived uremic retention solutes and insulin resistance in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Further study is necessary to elucidate whether prebiotic therapy with other characteristics, higher cumulative exposure or in different patient populations may be of benefit.

Toxicogenetic ablation of CINs in young mice reproduced these behavioral and neuronal defects, suggesting that age-related deficits in PF-to-CIN function reduce the ability of older individuals to resolve conflict between actions, likely contributing to impairments in adaptive goal-directed action and executive control in aging. Goal-directed actions allow individuals to exert control over the environment in the service of desires and basic needs. Shifts in environmental conditions can require adaptation of previously successful strategies, which often involves the integration of new learning with pre-existing memories. However, it has long been known that during memory updating, new and old learning can actively interfere, resulting in conflict and, eventually, forgetting (Melton and Irwin, 1987Melton A.W. Irwin J.M. The influence of degree of interpolated learning on retroactive inhibition and the overt transfer of specific responses. By Arthur W. Melton, Jean McQueen Irwin, 1940.Am. J.

Rev. 1957; 64: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In the context of normal aging, this type of memory interference is well documented in animals and humans undergoing different memory tasks (Friedman and Castel, 2013Friedman M.C. Castel A.D.

Aging. 2014; 29: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Encoding the action-outcome (A-O) associations necessary for goal-directed action has been attributed to the activity of projection neurons in posterior dorsal striatal territories, in particular the posterior dorsomedial striatum (Shiflett et al., 2010Shiflett M.W. Brown R.A. Balleine B.W. Acquisition and performance of goal-directed instrumental actions depends on ERK signaling in distinct regions of dorsal striatum in rats.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Yin et al., 2005Yin H.H. Ostlund S.B. Knowlton B.J. Balleine B.W. The role of the dorsomedial striatum in instrumental conditioning.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Several studies have previously shown that manipulations of posteromedial striatal function during instrumental learning disrupt the encoding of the associations that constitute goal-directed learning and that mediate choice between distinct courses of action (Balleine et al., 2009Balleine B.W. Liljeholm M. Ostlund S.B. The integrative function of the basal ganglia in instrumental conditioning.Behav. Brain Res. 2009; 199: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). From an adaptive perspective, acetylcholine in the posterior striatum has recently been found to play a critical role in the integration of new and previously acquired goal-directed learning; indeed, the integrity of the parafascicular thalamic afferents (PFs) regulating cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (PF-to-CIN pathway) was found to be essential to prevent interference throughout this process (Bradfield et al., 2013Bradfield L.A. Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B. Balleine B.W. The thalamostriatal pathway and cholinergic control of goal-directed action: interlacing new with existing learning in the striatum.Neuron. 2013; 79: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Accordingly, adaptation of striatal synaptic processes appears to depend on cholinergic tone; in the absence of acetylcholine, new learning is likely to undergo interference from existing learning, perhaps through dysregulation of striatal projection neurons (Aoki et al., 2015Aoki S. Liu A.W. Zucca A. Zucca S. Wickens J.R. Role of striatal cholinergic interneurons in set-shifting in the rat.J.

Cholinergic modulation of cognitive processing: insights drawn from computational models.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although an overall decline of striatal systems has been reported in physiological and pathological aging (Selden et al., 1994Selden N. Geula C. Hersh L. Mesulam M.M. Human striatum: chemoarchitecture of the caudate nucleus, putamen and ventral striatum in health and Alzheimer’s disease.Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether interference in A-O encoding occurs in normal aging and, in particular, whether the aged striatum can efficiently update pre-existing learning when A-O relationships change. Here, we investigated the functional integrity of the PF-to-CIN pathway in aged mice and assessed their capacity to adapt to changes in initially acquired A-O contingencies. To provide direct evidence that an age-related PF-to-CIN deficit causes interference in goal-directed learning, we specifically disrupted this circuit through targeted ablation of CINs in young transgenic mice. Finally, we examined the effect of these alterations on the initiation of goal-directed action and the function of projection neurons in the posterior striatum using extensive profiling of neuronal activity. Activity of CINs in posterior striatal regions is largely governed by the glutamatergic inputs originating from caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei, such as the PF (Ding et al., 2010Ding J.B.

Input from the frontal cortex and the parafascicular nucleus to cholinergic interneurons in the dorsal striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the striatum, CINs provide the main source of acetylcholine (Bolam et al., 1984Bolam J.P. Wainer B.H. Smith A.D. Characterization of cholinergic neurons in the rat neostriatum. A combination of choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry, Golgi-impregnation and electron microscopy.Neuroscience. 1984; 12: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and are known to confer critical modulation to striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in synchrony with the dopaminergic signal originating in the midbrain (Aosaki et al., 2010Aosaki T.

Striatal dopamine release is triggered by synchronized activity in cholinergic interneurons.Neuron. 2012; 75: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The PF-to-CIN pathway is, therefore, considered essential to modulate associative plasticity in dorsal striatal regions (Goldberg and Reynolds, 2011Goldberg J.A. Reynolds J.N. Spontaneous firing and evoked pauses in the tonically active cholinergic interneurons of the striatum.Neuroscience. 2011; 198: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and its projection to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) has been recently shown to be critical for proper integration of new memories with pre-existing memories during adaptation of goal-directed action (Bradfield et al., 2013Bradfield L.A. Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B. Balleine B.W.

On this account, and given that behavioral flexibility is commonly impaired in aging, we sought to investigate the degree of functional preservation of the PF-to-CIN pathway in the pDMS of naive young (2–3 months old [m.o.]) and aged (20–22 m.o.) mice. We first assessed the relative activity of PF neurons by detecting phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6), a widely used neuronal activity marker (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B.C. Laurent V. Valjent E. Balleine B.W.

Molecular profiling of activated neurons by phosphorylated ribosome capture.Cell. 2012; 151: 1126-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We found a modest but significant reduction of p-rpS6 signal in PF neurons of aged mice (t(14) = 2.298, p < 0.05) (Figure 1B), suggesting minor deficits in upstream PF-to-CIN circuits. We next compared the extent of cortico- and thalamostriatal inputs in these mice through quantification of VGluT1+ (cortical) and VGluT2+ (thalamic) terminals in the pDMS (Lei et al., 2013Lei W. Deng Y. Liu B. Mu S. Guley N.M. Wong T. Reiner A. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and ultrastructural study of VGLUT2 thalamic input to striatal projection neurons in rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 2013; 521: 1354-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and 1D). Double immunofluorescence analysis showed a remarkable decrease of VGluT2+ terminal density in aged mice (t(14) = 2.646, p < 0.05), whereas VGluT1+ processes in the same images remained unchanged (t(14) = 0.620, p = 0.545) (Figure 1D). We next studied whether CINs of the pDMS consistently presented age-related alterations in their neuronal firing. We used young (2 m.o.) and aged (22 m.o.) ChATBAC-eGFP reporter mice, which allow visualizing CINs in slices through their intrinsic expression of eGFP, as confirmed by post hoc biocytin labeling (Figure 1E). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirmed the characteristic features of CINs, which were unchanged in young and aged groups (Figure S1, available online). Cell-attached recordings in the presence of synaptic blockers revealed that both young and aged CINs presented tonic firing activity (Figure 1F), although the frequency of action potential firing was significantly higher in aged cells (t(36) = −2.999, p < 0.01) (Figure 1G). However, firing patterns in young CINs were more irregular, as revealed by the higher incidence of burst-like activity (Figure 1F) and a higher coefficient of variation of action potential firing (t(25.77) = 2.649, p < 0.05) (Figure 1H). To test whether the changes in rate/pattern measured in slice preparations are reflective of activity changes of CINs in vivo, we used detection of p-rpS6 immunofluorescence, which has been shown to be particularly sensitive to burst-firing activity in CINs (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B.C. Laurent V. Valjent E. Balleine B.W. Striatal cholinergic interneurons display activity-related phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e53195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Confocal analysis of nearly 300 CINs in the pDMS revealed a clear decrease in p-rpS6 signal intensity in aged as compared to young mice (t(203.98) = 2.323, p = 0.021) (Figures 1I and 1J), in line with their decreased propensity to undergo burst firing. Together, these data provide clear evidence of functional alterations at both ends of the PF-to-CIN pathway in aged mice. In light of recent studies reporting impairments in the acquisition of goal-directed action in healthy aged individuals (de Wit et al., 2014de Wit S. van de Vijver I. Ridderinkhof K.R. Impaired acquisition of goal-directed action in healthy aging.Cogn. Affect. Behav. Neurosci. 2014; 14: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we next sought to compare the ability of young and aged mice to encode different A-O associations during goal-directed learning, based on procedures of instrumental conditioning that we previously established in rats (Bradfield et al., 2013Bradfield L.A. Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B. Balleine B.W. The thalamostriatal pathway and cholinergic control of goal-directed action: interlacing new with existing learning in the striatum.Neuron. 2013; 79: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). After mild food restriction, the mice were trained to press two levers (actions A1 and A2), each delivering calorically equivalent but differently flavored food outcomes (O1 and O2) (instrumental training). Both young and aged mice escalated their lever press (LP) performance as the effort required to obtain outcomes increased (Figures 2B and 2D): mixed ANOVA (within-subject factor was training and between-subjects factor was age) showed that both age groups increased LP responding throughout the different periods of instrumental training (F(23,506) = 85.017, p < 0.001). However, this performance was significantly influenced by age, as there was a significant training × age interaction (F(23,506) = 10.64, p < 0.001) and a main effect of age (F(1,22) = 27.17, p < 0.001) (Figures 2B and 2D). Importantly, lever pressing on the two levers (A1 and A2) was similar within each group throughout training. Regardless of their different LP rates, separate one-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVAs revealed that both age groups showed clear acquisition of instrumental behavior (results for young were as follows: F(23, 253) = 57.37, p < 0.001; results for aged were as follows: F(23,253) = 29.02, p < 0.001), suggesting that the initial A-O associations were correctly encoded. To directly confirm this association, we exposed all animals to a first-outcome-specific devaluation test (initial devaluation) (Figure 2A), which evaluated the effect of satiety to one or the other outcome on the choice between the two trained instrumental actions (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W. Dickinson A. Goal-directed instrumental action: contingency and incentive learning and their cortical substrates.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). If the mice correctly encoded these contingencies (i.e., A1-O1 and A2-O2), satiety on one of the outcomes (e.g., O1) should reduce performance of the action associated with this particular outcome (A1; devalued) relative to performance of the other, still valued action (A2; valued). To test this prediction, mice were given unrestricted access to either O1 or O2 for 1 hr followed by a choice extinction test, in which both levers were available but no outcome was delivered. Two-way RM ANOVAs (within-subjects factors were trial and lever) revealed that all mice displayed significantly different LP rates on the valued and devalued levers in the course of the two consecutive trials (results for young were as follows: F(1,11) = 6.62, p = 0.026; results for aged were as follows: F(1,11) = 11.16, p = 0.007). This indicated that both age groups correctly encoded the A-O contingencies during training, as was reflected in their choice: all mice significantly reduced their performance toward the action that, during training, delivered the sated outcome (which became devalued) relative to the other action (which remained valued) (Figure 2C). Therefore, these results showed that despite an overall reduction in LP performance with aging, the initial encoding of A-O contingencies is not affected by age. Next, we assessed in these mice whether A-O encoding was appropriately adjusted when a new set of contingencies was introduced. The mice were retrained for 5 days on the reversed contingencies (reversal contingencies were as follows: A1-O2; A2-O1) before being exposed to a second outcome devaluation test (new devaluation) (Figure 2A). Reversal of contingencies did not affect performance across sessions, as both young and aged groups continued to gradually increase their LP rates (Figure 2D). The new outcome-specific devaluation test revealed that the most recent A-O contingencies were correctly integrated in young mice: again, performance of the action that, after reversal, delivered the now devalued outcome was reduced compared to the other action (F(1,11) = 12.92, p = 0.004) (Figure 2E). In contrast, aged mice responded similarly on both levers, indicating a deficit in encoding the new set of A-O contingencies upon reversal (F(1,11) = 2.03, p = 0.182) (Figure 2E). Video recordings of the new devaluation test revealed the specificity of this effect: whereas young mice showed a clear choice toward the lever predicting the valued outcome (Movie S1), aged mice showed no evidence that they could either express the current or recall the previous contingencies (Movie S2), indicating that in aged mice, pre-existing and new learning interfered with one another, resulting in conflicted selection of goal-directed action. In order to establish the link between the PF and CIN deficits observed in aged mice and their ability to integrate new with prior learning during goal-directed action, we undertook a toxicogenetic approach so as to specifically interrupt the PF-to-CIN pathway in the pDMS. Our strategy consisted of inducing a downstream interruption of this circuit in young transgenic mice by selectively ablating CINs in the pDMS, thus leaving other synaptic targets of the PF in the striatum (such as the striatal projection neurons; Castle et al., 2005Castle M. Aymerich M.S. Sanchez-Escobar C. Gonzalo N. Obeso J.A. Lanciego J.L. Thalamic innervation of the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways in the rat: ipsi- and contralateral projections.J. Comp.

We used the DT-iDTR system, which relies on the specific vulnerability of transgenic mice to low doses of diphtheria toxin (DT) conferred by targeted expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) to the cells of interest (Buch et al., 2005Buch T.

USA. 2015; 112: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In young ChAT-Cre+/− iDTR+/− transgenic mice (2–3 m.o.) selectively expressing iDTR in CINs (ChAT-Cre:iDTR), we bilaterally microinjected a very low dose of DT (1 μl at 150 pg/μl) or its vehicle (PBS, controls) into the pDMS through stereotaxic surgery (Figure 3A). Confocal microscopy confirmed that CINs had been selectively ablated only in the pDMS of DT-injected mice, sparing surrounding DARPP-32+ immunoreactive SPNs (Figures 3B and 3C). Three weeks after surgery, ChAT-Cre:iDTR mice were exposed to the same goal-directed learning and outcome-specific devaluation procedures used above (see Figure 2A). We found that both PBS- and DT-injected groups displayed no difference in the acquisition of goal-directed responses throughout the experiment (Figures 3D and 3F): mixed ANOVA (within-subject factor was training and between-subjects factor was treatment) revealed a significant elevation of LP performance as training days progressed (F(4.51, 99.2) = 271.96, p < 0.0001), but with no significant training × treatment interaction (F(4.51, 99.2) = 1.829, p = 0.121). Moreover, when exposed to the first outcome-specific devaluation test (initial devaluation), both PBS- and DT-treated mice significantly reduced their rate of responding toward the devalued outcome at the expense of the valued one (Figure 3E): three-way mixed ANOVA (within-subject factors were trial and lever and between-subjects factor was treatment) revealed a highly significant overall effect of lever (F(1, 22) = 17.56, p < 0.0001), but not lever × treatment interaction (F(1, 22) = 0.17, p = 0.682). This showed that depletion of CINs in the pDMS did not affect acquisition of instrumental actions and initial A-O contingencies. We then assessed the ability of these mice to adjust the initial A-O encoding to a change in contingencies. The mice were retrained on the reversed contingencies and exposed to a second outcome devaluation test (new devaluation; see Figure 2A). We found that the new A-O relationships were not correctly integrated in DT-treated mice, which presented a conflicted choice over the levers predicting valued and devalued outcomes (Figure 3G). Accordingly, a three-way mixed ANOVA now revealed a nonsignificant overall effect of lever (F(1, 22) = 0.747, p = 0.397), although with a significant lever × treatment interaction (F(1, 22) = 4.24, p < 0.05). Separate two-way RM ANOVAs (within-subject factors were trial and lever) also supported this conclusion, revealing a significant effect of lever in PBS-treated (F(1, 11) = 5.642, p < 0.05), but not DT-treated (F(1, 11) = 0.629, p = 0.444), mice. Together, these results showed that disrupting the PF-to-CIN pathway in young ChAT-Cre:iDTR mice by selectively depleting CINs in the pDMS reproduced the interference between pre-existing and new associations during goal-directed learning observed previously in aged mice. Based on previous studies showing improved reversal learning through cholinergic manipulations (Tait et al., 2013Tait D.S. Chase E.A. Brown V.J. Tacrine improves reversal learning in older rats.Neuropharmacology. 2013; 73: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we next explored the possibility of rescuing the above interference by manipulating the activity of CINs in aged mice using the hM3Dq designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADDs) approach that induces burst-like firing in response to the synthetic drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Alexander et al., 2009Alexander G.M. Rogan S.C. Abbas A.I. Armbruster B.N. Pei Y. Allen J.A. Nonneman R.J. Hartmann J. Moy S.S. Nicolelis M.A. et al.Remote control of neuronal activity in transgenic mice expressing evolved G protein-coupled receptors.Neuron. 2009; 63: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). We first demonstrated that selective expression of hM3Dq in striatal CINs of young ChAT-Cre+/+ mice resulted in a marked increase of p-rpS6 signal after 30 and 60 min of the injection of CNO (Figures S2A–S2C), likely reflecting burst-like firing (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012Bertran-Gonzalez J. Chieng B.C. Laurent V. Valjent E. Balleine B.W. Striatal cholinergic interneurons display activity-related phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e53195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Next, we subjected a group of aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq mice (20–24 m.o.) to similar instrumental and outcome devaluation procedures as above (Figure S2D). As we had found earlier in aged WT (wild-type) mice (see Figure 2), aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq mice were able to devalue initial A-O contingencies (F(1,10) = 12.84, p < 0.01) but failed to adjust their learning when contingencies were reversed (F(1,10) = 0.47, p = 0.50) (Figures S2E–S2H). Importantly, CNO did not reduce instrumental performance during reversal in aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq mice (Figure S2G) but failed to improve their capacity to recall the new set of contingencies, as they too expressed a conflicted choice during the new devaluation test (F(1,10) = 1.89, p = 0.19) (Figure S2H). Confocal microscopy confirmed that the activity of CINs had been successfully enhanced by CNO in all aged mice, as revealed by the strong treatment × hM3Dq expression interaction (F(1,2930) = 17.38, p < 0.0001) (Figure S2I). Although the magnitude of the genetic manipulation could have been insufficient to restore function in aged CINs, our results strongly suggest that a global nonmodulated increase of activity of the target neurons in the PF-to-CIN pathway is not a suitable strategy to promote the interlacing between initial and new learning in aged mice; therefore, a fine modulation of PF afferents in the striatum is more likely to be required to precisely and timely modulate the activity of CINs during the integration of new learning (Bradfield et al., 2013Bradfield L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2337030209,"While transcriptional controls over the size and relative position of cortical areas have been identified, less is known about regulators that direct acquisition of area-specific characteristics. Here, we report that the transcription factor Ctip1 functions in primary sensory areas to repress motor and activate sensory programs of gene expression, enabling establishment of sharp molecular boundaries defining functional areas. In Ctip1 mutants, abnormal gene expression leads to aberrantly motorized corticocortical and corticofugal output connectivity. Ctip1 critically regulates differentiation of layer IV neurons, and selective loss of Ctip1 in cortex deprives thalamocortical axons of their receptive ""sensory field"" in layer IV, which normally provides a tangentially and radially defined compartment of dedicated synaptic territory. Therefore, although thalamocortical axons invade appropriate cortical regions, they are unable to organize into properly configured sensory maps. Together, these data identify Ctip1 as a critical control over sensory area development."
https://openalex.org/W2339330884,"The European high Alps are internationally renowned for their dairy produce, which are of huge cultural and economic significance to the region. Although the recent history of alpine dairying has been well studied, virtually nothing is known regarding the origins of this practice. This is due to poor preservation of high altitude archaeological sites and the ephemeral nature of transhumance economic practices. Archaeologists have suggested that stone structures that appear around 3,000 years ago are associated with more intense seasonal occupation of the high Alps and perhaps the establishment of new economic strategies. Here, we report on organic residue analysis of small fragments of pottery sherds that are occasionally preserved both at these sites and earlier prehistoric rock-shelters. Based mainly on isotopic criteria, dairy lipids could only be identified on ceramics from the stone structures, which date to the Iron Age (ca. 3,000–2,500 BP), providing the earliest evidence of this practice in the high Alps. Dairy production in such a marginal environment implies a high degree of risk even by today’s standards. We postulate that this practice was driven by population increase and climate deterioration that put pressure on lowland agropastoral systems and the establishment of more extensive trade networks, leading to greater demand for highly nutritious and transportable dairy products."
https://openalex.org/W2338374686,"The leucocyte-specific phosphatase CD45 is present in two main isoforms: the large CD45RA and the short CD45RO. We have recently shown that distinctive expression of these isoforms distinguishes natural killer (NK) populations. For example, co-expression of both isoforms identifies in vivo the anti tumor NK cells in hematological cancer patients. Here we show that low CD45 expression associates with less mature, CD56bright, NK cells. Most NK cells in healthy human donors are CD45RA+CD45RO-. The CD45RA-RO+ phenotype, CD45RO cells, is extremely uncommon in B or NK cells, in contrast to T cells. However, healthy donors possess CD45RAdimRO- (CD45RAdim cells), which show immature markers and are largely expanded in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Blood borne cancer patients also have more CD45RAdim cells that carry several features of immature NK cells. However, and in opposition to their association to NK cell progenitors, they do not proliferate and show low expression of the transferrin receptor protein 1/CD71, suggesting low metabolic activity. Moreover, CD45RAdim cells properly respond to in vitro encounter with target cells by degranulating or gaining CD69 expression. In summary, they are quiescent NK cells, with low metabolic status that can, however, respond after encounter with target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2337910491,"Nautilus is often used as an analogue for the ecology and behavior of extinct externally shelled cephalopods. Nautilus shell grows quickly, has internal growth banding, and is widely believed to precipitate aragonite in oxygen isotope equilibrium with seawater. Pieces of shell from a wild-caught Nautilus macromphalus from New Caledonia and from a Nautilus belauensis reared in an aquarium were cast in epoxy, polished, and then imaged. Growth bands were visible in the outer prismatic layer of both shells. The thicknesses of the bands are consistent with previously reported daily growth rates measured in aquarium reared individuals. In situ analysis of oxygen isotope ratios using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with 10 μm beam-spot size reveals inter- and intra-band δ18O variation. In the wild-caught sample, a traverse crosscutting 45 growth bands yielded δ18O values ranging 2.5‰, from +0.9 to -1.6 ‰ (VPDB), a range that is larger than that observed in many serial sampling of entire shells by conventional methods. The maximum range within a single band (~32 μm) was 1.5‰, and 27 out of 41 bands had a range larger than instrumental precision (±2 SD = 0.6‰). The results from the wild individual suggest depth migration is recorded by the shell, but are not consistent with a simple sinusoidal, diurnal depth change pattern. To create the observed range of δ18O, however, this Nautilus must have traversed a temperature gradient of at least ~12°C, corresponding to approximately 400 m depth change. Isotopic variation was also measured in the aquarium-reared sample, but the pattern within and between bands likely reflects evaporative enrichment arising from a weekly cycle of refill and replacement of the aquarium water. Overall, this work suggests that depth migration behavior in ancient nektonic mollusks could be elucidated by SIMS analysis across individual growth bands."
https://openalex.org/W2338020438,"Malaria control efforts have been continuously stymied by drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, which typically originate in Southeast Asia prior to spreading into high-transmission settings in Africa. One earlier proposed explanation for Southeast Asia being a hotbed of resistance has been the hypermutability or “Accelerated Resistance to Multiple Drugs” (ARMD) phenotype, whereby multidrug-resistant Southeast Asian parasites were reported to exhibit 1,000-fold higher rates of resistance to unrelated antimalarial agents when compared to drug-sensitive parasites. However, three recent studies do not recapitulate this hypermutability phenotype. Intriguingly, genome sequencing of recently derived multidrug-resistant Cambodian isolates has identified a high proportion of DNA repair gene mutations in multidrug-resistant parasites, suggesting their potential role in shaping local parasite evolution. By adapting fluctuation assays for use in P. falciparum, we have examined the in vitro mutation rates of five recent Cambodian isolates and three reference laboratory strains. For these studies we also generated a knockout parasite line lacking the DNA repair factor Exonuclease I. In these assays, parasites were typed for their ability to acquire resistance to KAE609, currently in advanced clinical trials, yielding 13 novel mutations in the Na+/H+-ATPase PfATP4, the primary resistance determinant. We observed no evidence of hypermutability. Instead, we found evidence of a mild mutator (up to a 3.4-fold increase in mutation rate) phenotype in two artemisinin-resistant Cambodian isolates, which carry DNA repair gene mutations. We observed that one such mutation in the Mismatch Repair protein Mlh1 contributes to the mild mutator phenotype when modeled in yeast (scmlh1-P157S). Compared to basal rates of mutation, a mild mutator phenotype may provide a greater overall benefit for parasites in Southeast Asia in terms of generating drug resistance without incurring detrimental fitness costs."
https://openalex.org/W2340651676,"Changes in the coral reef complex can affect predator-prey relationships, resource availability and niche utilisation in the associated fish community, which may be reflected in decreased stability of the functional traits present in a community. This is because particular traits may be favoured by a changing environment, or by habitat degradation. Furthermore, other traits can be selected against because degradation can relax the association between fishes and benthic habitat. We characterised six important ecological traits for fish species occurring at seven sites across a disturbed coral reef archipelago in Indonesia, where reefs have been exposed to eutrophication and destructive fishing practices for decades. Functional diversity was assessed using two complementary indices (FRic and RaoQ) and correlated to important environmental factors (live coral cover and rugosity, representing local reef health, and distance from shore, representing a cross-shelf environmental gradient). Indices were examined for both a change in their mean, as well as temporal (short-term; hours) and spatial (cross-shelf) variability, to assess whether fish-habitat association became relaxed along with habitat degradation. Furthermore, variability in individual traits was examined to identify the traits that are most affected by habitat change. Increases in the general reef health indicators, live coral cover and rugosity (correlated with distance from the mainland), were associated with decreases in the variability of functional diversity and with community-level changes in the abundance of several traits (notably home range size, maximum length, microalgae, detritus and small invertebrate feeding and reproductive turnover). A decrease in coral cover increased variability of RaoQ while rugosity and distance both inversely affected variability of FRic; however, averages for these indices did not reveal patterns associated with the environment. These results suggest that increased degradation of coral reefs is associated with increased variability in fish community functional composition resulting from selective impacts on specific traits, thereby affecting the functional response of these communities to increasing perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2340583917,"Assessments of climate change impacts on forests and their vitality are essential for semi-arid environments such as Central Asia, where the mountain regions belong to the globally important biodiversity hotspots. Alterations in species distribution or drought-induced tree mortality might not only result in a loss of biodiversity but also in a loss of other ecosystem services. Here, we evaluate spatial trends and patterns of the growth-climate relationship in a tree-ring network comprising 33 juniper sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in eastern Uzbekistan and across Kyrgyzstan for the common period 1935-2011. Junipers growing at lower elevations are sensitive to summer drought, which has increased in intensity during the studied period. At higher elevations, juniper growth, previously favored by warm summer temperatures, has in the recent few decades become negatively affected by increasing summer aridity. Moreover, response shifts are observed during all seasons. Rising temperatures and alterations in precipitation patterns during the past eight decades can account for the observed increase in drought stress of junipers at all altitudes. The implications of our findings are vital for the application of adequate long-term measures of ecosystem conservation, but also for paleo-climatic approaches and coupled climate-vegetation model simulations for Central Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2337407118,"Desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and alkylated DBT derivatives present in transport fuel through specific cleavage of carbon-sulfur (C-S) bonds by a newly isolated bacterium Chelatococcus sp. is reported for the first time. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the products of DBT degradation by Chelatococcus sp. showed the transient formation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) which was subsequently converted to 2-methoxybiphenyl (2-MBP) by methylation at the hydroxyl group of 2-HBP. The relative ratio of 2-HBP and 2-MBP formed after 96 h of bacterial growth was determined at 4:1 suggesting partial conversion of 2-HBP or rapid degradation of 2-MBP. Nevertheless, the enzyme involved in this conversion process remains to be identified. This production of 2-MBP rather than 2-HBP from DBT desulfurization has a significant metabolic advantage for enhancing the growth and sulfur utilization from DBT by Chelatococcus sp. and it also reduces the environmental pollution by 2-HBP. Furthermore, desulfurization of DBT derivatives such as 4-M-DBT and 4, 6-DM-DBT by Chelatococcus sp. resulted in formation of 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-biphenyl and 2-hydroxy –3, 3/- dimethyl-biphenyl, respectively as end product. The GC and X-ray fluorescence studies revealed that Chelatococcus sp. after 24 h of treatment at 37°C reduced the total sulfur content of diesel fuel by 12% by per gram resting cells, without compromising the quality of fuel. The LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digested intracellular proteins of Chelatococcus sp. when grown in DBT demonstrated the biosynthesis of 4S pathway desulfurizing enzymes viz. monoxygenases (DszC, DszA), desulfinase (DszB), and an NADH-dependent flavin reductase (DszD). Besides, several other intracellular proteins of Chelatococcus sp. having diverse biological functions were also identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Many of these enzymes are directly involved with desulfurization process whereas the other enzymes/proteins support growth of bacteria at an expense of DBT. These combined results suggest that Chelatococcus sp. prefers sulfur-specific extended 4S pathway for deep-desulphurization which may have an advantage for its intended future application as a promising biodesulfurizing agent."
https://openalex.org/W2340473678,"Over the past century, the endangered Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) has experienced a severe contraction in demography and geographic range because of habitat loss, poaching, and prey depletion. In its historical home in Northeast China, there appears to be a single tiger population that includes tigers in Southwest Primorye and Northeast China; however, the current demographic status of this population is uncertain. Information on the abundance, distribution and genetic diversity of this population for assessing the efficacy of conservation interventions are scarce. We used noninvasive genetic detection data from scats, capture-recapture models and an accumulation curve method to estimate the abundance of Amur tigers in Northeast China. We identified 11 individual tigers (6 females and 5 males) using 10 microsatellite loci in three nature reserves between April 2013 and May 2015. These tigers are confined primarily to a Hunchun Nature Reserve along the border with Russia, with an estimated population abundance of 9–11 tigers during the winter of 2014–2015. They showed a low level of genetic diversity. The mean number of alleles per locus was 2.60 and expected and observed heterozygosity were 0.42 and 0.49, respectively. We also documented long-distance dispersal (~270 km) of a male Amur tiger to Huangnihe Nature Reserve from the border, suggesting that the expansion of neighboring Russian populations may eventually help sustain Chinese populations. However, the small and isolated population recorded by this study demonstrate that there is an urgent need for more intensive regional management to create a tiger-permeable landscape and increased genetic connectivity with other populations."

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 34 patients (men, 19; women, 15; mean age, 14.5 ± 9.7 years) with pathologically proven Ewing sarcoma. They had undergone F-18 FDG PET/CT as part of a pretreatment workup between September 2006 and April 2012. In this analysis, patients were classified by age, sex, initial location, size, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The relationship between FDG uptake and survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test and Cox’s proportional hazards regression model. Results The median survival time for all 34 subjects was 999 days and the median SUV by using PET/CT was 5.8 (range, 2–18.1). Patients with a SUVmax ≤ 5.8 survived significantly longer than those with a SUVmax > 5.8 (median survival time, 1265 vs. 656 days; p = 0.002). Survival was also found to be significantly related to age (p = 0.024), size (p = 0.03), and initial tumor location (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher SUVmax (p = 0.003; confidence interval [CI], 3.63–508.26; hazard ratio [HR], 42.98), older age (p = 0.023; CI, 1.34–54.80; HR, 8.59), and higher stage (p = 0.03; CI, 1.21–43.95; HR, 7.3) were associated with worse overall survival. Conclusions SUVmax measured by pretreatment F-18-FDG PET/CT can predict overall survival in patients with Ewing sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2341316588,"Background Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer is controversial. There are unresolved tensions and disagreements amongst experts, and clinical guidelines conflict. This both reflects and generates significant uncertainty about the appropriateness of screening. Little is known about general practitioners’ (GPs’) perspectives and experiences in relation to PSA testing of asymptomatic men. In this paper we asked the following questions: (1) What are the primary sources of uncertainty as described by GPs in the context of PSA testing? (2) How do GPs experience and respond to different sources of uncertainty? Methods This was a qualitative study that explored general practitioners’ current approaches to, and reasoning about, PSA testing of asymptomatic men. We draw on accounts generated from interviews with 69 general practitioners located in Australia (n = 40) and the United Kingdom (n = 29). The interviews were conducted in 2013–2014. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Uncertainty in PSA testing was identified as a core issue. Findings Australian GPs reported experiencing substantially more uncertainty than UK GPs. This seemed partly explainable by notable differences in conditions of practice between the two countries. Using Han et al’s taxonomy of uncertainty as an initial framework, we first outline the different sources of uncertainty GPs (mostly Australian) described encountering in relation to prostate cancer screening and what the uncertainty was about. We then suggest an extension to Han et al’s taxonomy based on our analysis of data relating to the varied ways that GPs manage uncertainties in the context of PSA testing. We outline three broad strategies: (1) taking charge of uncertainty; (2) engaging others in managing uncertainty; and (3) transferring the responsibility for reducing or managing some uncertainties to other parties. Conclusion Our analysis suggests some GPs experienced uncertainties associated with ambiguous guidance and the complexities of their situation as professionals with responsibilities to patients as considerably burdensome. This raises important questions about responsibility for uncertainty. In Australia in particular they feel insufficiently supported by the health care system to practice in ways that are recognisably consistent with ‘evidence based’ professional standards and appropriate for patients. More work is needed to clarify under what circumstances and how uncertainty should be communicated. Closer attention to different types and aspects of the uncertainty construct could be useful."
https://openalex.org/W2338479336,"Anterior gradient (AG) proteins have a thioredoxin fold and are targeted to the secretory pathway where they may act in the ER, as well as after secretion into the extracellular space. A newt member of the family (nAG) was previously identified as interacting with the GPI-anchored salamander-specific three-finger protein called Prod1. Expression of nAG has been implicated in the nerve dependence of limb regeneration in salamanders, and nAG acted as a growth factor for cultured newt limb blastemal (progenitor) cells, but the mechanism of action was not understood. Here we show that addition of a peptide antibody to Prod1 specifically inhibit the proliferation of blastema cells, suggesting that Prod1 acts as a cell surface receptor for secreted nAG, leading to S phase entry. Mutation of the single cysteine residue in the canonical active site of nAG to alanine or serine leads to protein degradation, but addition of residues at the C terminus stabilises the secreted protein. The mutation of the cysteine residue led to no detectable activity on S phase entry in cultured newt limb blastemal cells. In addition, our phylogenetic analyses have identified a new Caudata AG protein called AG4. A comparison of the AG proteins in a cell culture assay indicates that nAG secretion is significantly higher than AGR2 or AG4, suggesting that this property may vary in different members of the family."
https://openalex.org/W2338997494,"Jellyfish are of particular concern for marine finfish aquaculture. In recent years repeated mass mortality episodes of farmed fish were caused by blooms of gelatinous cnidarian stingers, as a consequence of a wide range of hemolytic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic properties of associated cnidocytes venoms. The mauve stinger jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca (Scyphozoa) has been identified as direct causative agent for several documented fish mortality events both in Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea aquaculture farms. We investigated the effects of P. noctiluca envenomations on the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata by in vivo laboratory assays. Fish were incubated for 8 hours with jellyfish at 3 different densities in 300 l experimental tanks. Gill disorders were assessed by histological analyses and histopathological scoring of samples collected at time intervals from 3 hours to 4 weeks after initial exposure. Fish gills showed different extent and severity of gill lesions according to jellyfish density and incubation time, and long after the removal of jellyfish from tanks. Jellyfish envenomation elicits local and systemic inflammation reactions, histopathology and gill cell toxicity, with severe impacts on fish health. Altogether, these results shows P. noctiluca swarms may represent a high risk for Mediterranean finfish aquaculture farms, generating significant gill damage after only a few hours of contact with farmed S. aurata. Due to the growth of the aquaculture sector and the increased frequency of jellyfish blooms in the coastal waters, negative interactions between stinging jellyfish and farmed fish are likely to increase with the potential for significant economic losses."
https://openalex.org/W2339050199,"The mammary gland is able to detect and react to bacterial intrusion through innate immunity mechanisms, but mammary inflammation can also result from antigen-specific adaptive immunity. We postulated that innate and adaptive immune responses could synergize to trigger inflammation in the mammary gland. To test this hypothesis, we immunized cows with the model antigen ovalbumin and challenged the sensitized animals with either Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as innate immunity agonist, ovalbumin as adaptive immunity agonist, or both agonists in three different udder quarters of lactating cows. There was a significant amplification of the initial milk leukocytosis in the quarters challenged with the two agonists compared to leukocytosis in quarters challenged with LPS or ovalbumin alone. This synergistic response occurred only with the cows that developed the ovalbumin-specific inflammatory response, and there were significant correlations between milk leukocytosis and production of IL-17A and IFN-γ in a whole-blood ovalbumin stimulation assay. The antigen-specific response induced substantial concentrations of IL-17A and IFN-γ in milk contrary to the response to LPS. Such a synergy at the onset of the reaction of the mammary gland suggests that induction of antigen-specific immune response with bacterial antigens could improve the initial immune response to infection, hence reducing the bacterial load and contributing to protection."
https://openalex.org/W2342278127,"Objective Team-based learning (TBL) is an increasingly popular teaching method in medical education. However, TBL hasn’t been well-studied in the ophthalmology clerkship context. This study was to examine the impact of modified TBL in such context and to assess the student evaluations of TBL. Methods Ninety-nine students of an 8-year clinical medicine program from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University, were randomly divided into four sequential units and assigned to six teams with the same faculty. The one-week ophthalmology clerkship module included traditional lectures, gross anatomy and a TBL module. The effects of the TBL module on student performance were measured by the Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT), the Group Readiness Assurance Test (GRAT), the Group Application Problem (GAP) and final examination scores (FESs). Students’ evaluations of TBL were measured by a 16-item questionnaire. IRAT and GRAT scores were compared using a paired t-test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and subgroup analysis compared the effects among quartiles that were stratified by the Basic Ophthalmology Levels (BOLs). The BOLs were evaluated before the ophthalmology clerkship. Results In TBL classes, the GRAT scores were significantly higher than the IRAT scores in both the full example and the BOL-stratified groups. It highlighted the advantages of TBL compared to the individual learning. Quartile-stratified ANOVA comparisons showed significant differences at FES scores (P < 0.01). In terms to IRAT, GRAT and GAP scores, there was no significant result. Moreover, IRAT scores only significantly differed between the first and fourth groups. The FES scores of the first three groups are significantly higher than the fourth group. Gender-specific differences were significant in FES but not the IRAT. Overall, 57.65% of student respondents agreed that TBL was helpful. Male students tended to rate TBL higher than female students. Conclusion The application of modified TBL to the ophthalmology clerkship curriculum improved students’ performance and increased students’ engagement and satisfaction. TBL should be further optimized and developed to enhance the educational outcomes among multi-BOLs medical students."
https://openalex.org/W2336878519,"Protein kinases are key regulatory nodes in cellular networks and their function has been shown to be intimately coupled with their structural flexibility. However, understanding the key structural mechanisms of large conformational transitions remains a difficult task. CDK2 is a crucial regulator of cell cycle. Its activity is finely tuned by Cyclin E/A and the catalytic segment phosphorylation, whereas its deregulation occurs in many types of cancer. ATP competitive inhibitors have failed to be approved for clinical use due to toxicity issues raised by a lack of selectivity. However, in the last few years type III allosteric inhibitors have emerged as an alternative strategy to selectively modulate CDK2 activity. In this study we have investigated the conformational variability of CDK2. A low dimensional conformational landscape of CDK2 was modeled using classical multidimensional scaling on a set of 255 crystal structures. Microsecond-scale plain and accelerated MD simulations were used to populate this landscape by using an out-of-sample extension of multidimensional scaling. CDK2 was simulated in the apo-form and in complex with the allosteric inhibitor 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). The apo-CDK2 landscape analysis showed a conformational equilibrium between an Src-like inactive conformation and an active-like form. These two states are separated by different metastable states that share hybrid structural features with both forms of the kinase. In contrast, the CDK2/ANS complex landscape is compatible with a conformational selection picture where the binding of ANS in proximity of the αC helix causes a population shift toward the inactive conformation. Interestingly, the new metastable states could enlarge the pool of candidate structures for the development of selective allosteric CDK2 inhibitors. The method here presented should not be limited to the CDK2 case but could be used to systematically unmask similar mechanisms throughout the human kinome."
https://openalex.org/W2341345159,"Wheat production is threatened by water shortages and groundwater over-draft in the North China Plain (NCP). In recent years, winter wheat has been increasingly sown extremely late in early to mid-November after harvesting cotton or pepper. To improve water use efficiency (WUE) and guide the extremely late sowing practices, a 3-year field experiment was conducted under two irrigation regimes (W1, one-irrigation, 75 mm at jointing; W2, two-irrigation, 75 mm at jointing and 75 mm at anthesis) in 3 cultivars differing in spike size (HS4399, small spike; JM22, medium spike; WM8, large spike). Wheat was sown in early to mid-November at a high seeding rate of 800-850 seeds m(-2). Average yields of 7.42 t ha(-1) and WUE of 1.84 kg m(-3) were achieved with an average seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) of 404 mm. Compared with W2, wheat under W1 did not have yield penalty in 2 of 3 years, and had 7.9% lower seasonal ET and 7.5% higher WUE. The higher WUE and stable yield under W1 was associated with higher 1000-grain weight (TGW) and harvest index (HI). Among the 3 cultivars, JM22 had 5.9%-8.9% higher yield and 4.2%-9.3% higher WUE than WM8 and HS4399. The higher yield in JM22 was attributed mainly to higher HI and TGW due to increased post-anthesis biomass and deeper seasonal soil water extraction. In conclusion, one-irrigation with a medium-sized spike cultivar JM22 could be a useful strategy to maintain yield and high WUE in extremely late-sown winter wheat at a high seeding rate in the NCP."
https://openalex.org/W2338169850,"A novel yellow-green leaf mutant yellow-green leaf-1 (ygl-1) was isolated in self-pollinated progenies from the cross of maize inbred lines Ye478 and Yuanwu02. The mutant spontaneously showed yellow-green character throughout the lifespan. Meanwhile, the mutant reduced contents of chlorophyll and Car, arrested chloroplast development and lowered the capacity of photosynthesis compared with the wild-type Lx7226. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a recessive nuclear gene. The ygl-1 locus was initially mapped to an interval of about 0.86 Mb in bin 1.01 on the short arm of chromosome 1 using 231 yellow-green leaf individuals of an F2 segregating population from ygl-1/Lx7226. Utilizing four new polymorphic SSR markers, the ygl-1 locus was narrowed down to a region of about 48 kb using 2930 and 2247 individuals of F2 and F3 mapping populations, respectively. Among the three predicted genes annotated within this 48 kb region, GRMZM2G007441, which was predicted to encode a cpSRP43 protein, had a 1-bp nucleotide deletion in the coding region of ygl-1 resulting in a frame shift mutation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that YGL-1 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues and its expression level was not significantly affected in the ygl-1 mutant from early to mature stages, while light intensity regulated its expression both in the ygl-1 mutant and wild type seedlings. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of some genes involved in chloroplast development were affected in the six-week old ygl-1 plants. These findings suggested that YGL-1 plays an important role in chloroplast development of maize."
https://openalex.org/W2339596341,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major causative agent of neonatal meningitis due to its ability to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS). It has been demonstrated that GBS can invade human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC), a primary component of the BBB; however, the mechanism of intracellular survival and trafficking is unclear. We previously identified a two component regulatory system, CiaR/H, which promotes GBS intracellular survival in hBMEC. Here we show that a GBS strain deficient in the response regulator, CiaR, localized more frequently with Rab5, Rab7 and LAMP1 positive vesicles. Further, lysosomes isolated from hBMEC contained fewer viable bacteria following initial infection with the ΔciaR mutant compared to the WT strain. To characterize the contribution of CiaR-regulated genes, we constructed isogenic mutant strains lacking the two most down-regulated genes in the CiaR-deficient mutant, SAN_2180 and SAN_0039. These genes contributed to bacterial uptake and intracellular survival. Furthermore, competition experiments in mice showed that WT GBS had a significant survival advantage over the Δ2180 and Δ0039 mutants in the bloodstream and brain."
https://openalex.org/W2337407464,"Diagnosis of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) depends primarily on renal biopsy, which is expensive and requires hospitalization, creating a demand for noninvasive diagnostic method for this disease. We used DNA microarray analysis to search for genes whose expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could distinguish between patients with CGN and healthy volunteers (HVs). We selected immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and membranous nephropathy (MN) as typical forms of CGN. The mRNA level of the gene encoding interferon (IFN)-alpha-inducible protein 27, IFI27, which is preferentially expressed in podocytes of glomeruli, was lower in PBMCs of IgAN and MN patients than in those of HVs. This result was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the IFI27 mRNA level was reduced in PBMCs of patients with other types of chronic glomerulonephritis. IFI27 immunohistochemical staining of biopsied specimens also confirmed reduced expression of IFI27 protein in IgAN and MN patients. Based on these results, we propose that IFI27 could serve as a noninvasive diagnostic marker for CGNs using peripheral blood."
https://openalex.org/W2338486154,"The spatial distribution of genetic diversity has been long considered as a key component of policy development for management and conservation of marine fishes. However, unraveling the population genetic structure of migratory fish species is challenging due to high potential for gene flow. Despite the shallow population differentiation revealed by putatively neutral loci, the higher genetic differentiation with panels of putatively adaptive loci could provide greater resolution for stock identification. Here, patterns of population differentiation of small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) were investigated by genotyping 15 highly polymorphic microsatellites in 337 individuals of 15 geographic populations collected from both spawning and overwintering grounds. Outlier analyses indicated that the locus Lpol03 might be under directional selection, which showed a strong homology with Grid2 gene encoding the glutamate receptor δ2 protein (GluRδ2). Based on Lpol03, two distinct clusters were identified by both STRUCTURE and PCoA analyses, suggesting that there were two overwintering aggregations of L. polyactis. A novel migration pattern was suggested for L. polyactis, which was inconsistent with results of previous studies based on historical fishing yield statistics. These results provided new perspectives on the population genetic structure and migratory routes of L. polyactis, which could have significant implications for sustainable management and utilization of this important fishery resource."
https://openalex.org/W2342055224,"The Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2, Angpt2) growth factor is a context-dependent antagonist/agonist ligand of the endothelial Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase and known to promote tumour angiogenesis and metastasis. Angiopoietin antagonists have been tested in clinical cancer trials in combination with VEGF-based anti-angiogenic therapy, including sunitinib, which is widely used as a first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). However, little is known about Ang2 protein expression in human tumours and the correlation of tumour Ang2 expression with tumour vascularization, tumour cell proliferation and response to anti-angiogenic therapies. Here, we evaluated, using immunohistochemistry, the expression of Ang2, CD31 and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in the primary kidney cancer from 136 mRCC patients, who received first-line sunitinib after nephrectomy. Ang2 protein expression was restrained to RCC tumour vessels, and correlated with tumour vascularization and response to sunitinib. High pre-therapeutic Ang2 expression, and more strongly, combined high expression of both Ang2 and CD31, were associated with a high clinical benefit rate (CBR). Low cancer Ki-67 expression, but not Ang2 or CD31 expression, was associated with favourable progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to patients with high Ki-67 expression (PFS 6.5 vs. 10.6 months, P = 0.009; OS, 15.7 vs. 28.5 months, P = 0.015). In summary, in this study to investigate endothelial Ang2 in mRCC patients treated with first-line sunitinib, high cancer Ang2 expression was associated with the CBR, but not PFS or OS, whereas low Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with long PFS and OS."
https://openalex.org/W2338743643,"Aim β-catenin signaling is a major oncogenic pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since β-catenin phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase 1ε (CK1ε) results in its degradation, mutations affecting these phosphorylation sites cause β-catenin stabilization. However, the relevance of missense mutations in non-phosphorylation sites in exon 3 remains unclear. The current study explores significance of such mutations in addition to addressing the clinical and biological implications of β-catenin activation in human HCC. Methods Gene alteration in exon3 of CTNNB1, gene expression of β-catenin targets such as glutamate synthetase (GS), axin2, lect2 and regucalcin (RGN), and protein expression of β-catenin were examined in 125 human HCC tissues. Results Sixteen patients (12.8%) showed conventional missense mutations affecting codons 33, 37, 41, and 45. Fifteen additional patients (12.0%) had other missense mutations in codon 32, 34, and 35. Induction of exon3 mutation caused described β-catenin target gene upregulation in HCC cell line. Interestingly, conventional and non-phosphorylation site mutations were equally associated with upregulation of β-catenin target genes. Nuclear localization of β-catenin was associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.0461). Of these patients with nuclear β-catenin localization, loss of described β-catenin target gene upregulation showed significant poorer overall survival than others (p = 0.0001). Conclusion This study suggests that both conventional and other missense mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1 lead to β-catenin activation in human HCC. Additionally, the mechanism of nuclear β-catenin localization without upregulation of described β-catenin target genes might be of clinical importance depending on distinct mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2339371527,"Although microbial activity and associated iron (oxy)hydroxides are known in general to affect the environmental dynamics of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenearsonic acid (roxarsone), the mechanistic understanding of the underlying biophysico-chemical processes remains unclear due to limited experimental information. We studied how Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 -a widely distributed metal-reducing bacterium, in the presence of dissolved Fe(III), affects roxarsone transformations and biogeochemical cycling in a model aqueous system. The results showed that the MR-1 strain was able to anaerobically use roxarsone as a terminal electron acceptor and to convert it to a single product, 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzene arsonic acid (AHBAA). The presence of Fe(III) stimulated roxarsone transformation via MR-1-induced Fe(III) reduction, whereby the resulting Fe(II) acted as an efficient reductant for roxarsone transformation. In addition, the subsequent secondary Fe(III)/Fe(II) mineralization created conditions for adsorption of organoarsenic compounds to the yielded precipitates and thereby led to arsenic immobilization. The study provided direct evidence of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1-induced direct and Fe(II)-associated roxarsone transformation. Quantitative estimations revealed a candidate mechanism for the early-stage environmental dynamics of roxarsone in nature, which is essential for understanding the environmental dynamics of roxarsone and successful risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2337902969,"The release of corifollitropin alfa simplifies daily injections of short-acting recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (rFSH), and its widely-used protocol involves short-acting gonadotropins supplements and a fixed GnRH antagonist regimen, largely based on follicle size. In this study, the feasibility of corifollitropin alfa without routine pituitary suppression was evaluated. A total of 288 patients were stimulated by corifollitropin alfa on cycle day 3 following with routine serum hormone monitoring and follicle scanning every other day after 5 days of initial stimulation, and a GnRH antagonist (0.25 mg) was only used prophylactically when the luteinizing hormone (LH) was ≧ 6 IU/L (over half of the definitive LH surge). The incidence of premature LH surge (≧ 10 IU/L) was 2.4% (7/288) before the timely injection of a single GnRH antagonist, and the elevated LH level was dropped down from 11.9 IU/L to 2.2 IU/L after the suppression. Two hundred fifty-one patients did not need any antagonist (87.2% [251/288]) throughout the whole stimulation. No adverse effects were observed regarding oocyte competency (fertilization rate: 78%; blastocyst formation rate: 64%). The live birth rate per OPU cycle after the first cryotransfer was 56.3% (161/286), and the cumulative live birth rate per OPU cycle after cyrotransfers was 69.6% (199/286). Of patients who did and did not receive GnRH antagonist during stimulation, no significant difference existed in the cumulative live birth rates (78.4% vs. 68.3%, p = 0.25). The results demonstrated that the routine GnRH antagonist administration is not required in the corifollitropin-alfa cycles using a flexible and hormone-depended antagonist regimen, while the clinical outcome is not compromised. This finding reveals that the use of a GnRH antagonist only occasionally may be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2338303794,"We investigated whether adding ultrafine (nano-scale) oxygen-carrying bubbles to water concurrently with dissolved carbon-dioxide (CO2) could result in safe, long-duration anesthesia for fish.To confirm the lethal effects of CO2 alone, fishes were anesthetized with dissolved CO2 in 20°C seawater. Within 30 minutes, all fishes, regardless of species, died suddenly due to CO2-induced narcosis, even when the water was saturated with oxygen. Death was attributed to respiration failure caused by hypoxemia. When ultrafine oxygen-carrying bubbles were supplied along with dissolved CO2, five chicken grunts were able to remain anesthetized for 22 hours and awoke normally within 2-3 hours after cessation of anesthesia.The high internal pressures and oxygen levels of the ultrafine bubbles enabled efficient oxygen diffusion across the branchia and permitted the organismal oxygen demands of individual anesthetized fish to be met. Thus, we demonstrated a method for safe, long-duration carbon dioxide anesthesia in living fish under normal water temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2339339536,"Results from studies comparing the diversity and specificity of the TCR repertoires expressed by conventional (Tconv) and regulatory (Treg) CD4+ T cell have varied depending on the experimental system employed. We developed a new model in which T cells express a single fixed TCRα chain, randomly rearranged endogenous TCRβ chains, and a Foxp3-GFP reporter. We purified CD4+Foxp3- and CD4+Foxp3+ cells, then performed biased controlled multiplex PCR and high throughput sequencing of endogenous TCRβ chains. We identified >7,000 different TCRβ sequences in the periphery of 5 individual mice. On average, ~12% of TCR sequences were expressed by both conventional and regulatory populations within individual mice. The CD4+ T cells that expressed shared TCR sequences were present at higher frequencies compared to T cells expressing non-shared TCRs. Furthermore, nearly all (>90%) of the TCR sequences that were shared within mice were identical at the DNA sequence level, indicating that conventional and regulatory T cells that express shared TCRs are derived from common clones. Analysis of TCR repertoire overlap in the thymus reveals that a large proportion of Tconv and Treg sharing observed in the periphery is due to clonal expansion in the thymus. Together these data show that there are a limited number of TCR sequences shared between Tconv and Tregs. Also, Tconv and Tregs sharing identical TCRs are found at relatively high frequencies and are derived from common progenitors, of which a large portion are generated in the thymus."

https://openalex.org/W2336283380,"Alteration of leaf surface phenotypes due to virus infection has the potential to affect the likelihood of colonisation by insect vectors, or to affect their feeding activities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viruses that rely on insects for their transmission, and which can be sensitive to the polarization of light, affect the percentage polarization of light reflected from leaves. We also set out to discover whether a correlation exists between the expression of ECERIFERUM (CER) genes involved in cuticular wax synthesis and the polarization of the light reflected from the leaf surfaces. It was found that the aphid-vectored viruses Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) caused significant reductions in the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves of Nicotiana tabacum, whereas the non-insect-vectored viruses Tobacco mosaic virus and Pepino mosaic virus did not induce this effect. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there was little difference in the impacts of CMV and the non-insect-vectored Turnip vein clearing virus on polarization reflection, with both viruses increasing the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves. There was a trend towards increased accumulation of CER6 transcripts in N. tabacum and A. thaliana when infected with aphid-vectored viruses. No significant effect of infection on trichome densities was found in A. thaliana, suggesting that alterations to the formation of cuticular waxes may be the more likely phenotypic change on the leaf surface contributing to the changes in polarization reflection. The possible impacts and adaptive significance of these effects with regard to viral transmission by insects are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2340098898,"The keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are the structural proteins of hair fibers and are thought to play an important role in determining the physical properties of hair fibers. These proteins are activated in a striking sequential and spatial pattern in the keratinocytes of hair fibers. Thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanism that underlies the specific transcriptional activity of these genes. In this study, sheep KRTAP 3–3 and KRTAP11-1 genes were found to be highly expressed in wool follicles in a tissue-specific manner. Subsequently, the promoter regions of the two genes that contained the 5′ flanking/5′ untranslated regions and the coding regions were cloned. Using an in vivo transgenic approach, we found that the promoter regions from the two genes exhibited transcriptional activity in hair fibers. A much stronger and more uniformly expressed green fluorescent signal was observed in the KRTAP11-1-ZsGreen1 transgenic mice. In situ hybridization revealed the symmetrical expression of sheep KRTAP11-1 in the entire wool cortex. Consistently, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the pattern of ZsGreen1 expression in the hair cortex of transgenic mice matches that of the endogenous KRTAP11-1 gene, indicating that the cloned promoter region contains elements that are sufficient to govern the wool cortex-specific transcription of KRTAP11-1. Furthermore, regulatory regions in the 5′ upstream sequence of the sheep KRTAP11-1 gene that may regulate the observed hair keratinocyte specificity were identified using in vivo reporter assays."

https://openalex.org/W2337079716,"This study aimed to measure changes in socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and smoking cessation due to the 2006 smoking ban in Luxembourg. Data were derived from the PSELL3/EU-SILC (Panel Socio-Economique Liewen Zu Letzebuerg/European Union--Statistic on Income and Living Conditions) survey, which was a representative survey of the general population aged ≥16 years conducted in Luxembourg in 2005, 2007, and 2008. Smoking prevalence and smoking cessation due to the 2006 smoking ban were used as the main smoking outcomes. Two inequality measures were calculated to assess the magnitude and temporal trends of socioeconomic inequalities in smoking: the prevalence ratio and the disparity index. Smoking cessation due to the smoking ban was considered as a positive outcome. Three multiple logistic regression models were used to assess social inequalities in smoking cessation due to the 2006 smoking ban. Education level, income, and employment status served as proxies for socioeconomic status. The prevalence of smoking decreased by 22.5% between 2005 and 2008 (from 23.1% in 2005 to 17.9% in 2008), but socioeconomic inequalities in smoking persisted. Smoking prevalence decreased by 24.2% and 20.2% in men and women, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant. Smoking cessation in daily smokers due to the 2006 smoking ban was associated with education level, employment status, and income, with higher percentages of quitters among those with a lower socioeconomic status. The decrease in smoking prevalence after the 2006 law was also associated with a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities, including differences in education level, income, and employment status. Although the smoking ban contributed to a reduction of such inequalities, they still persist, indicating the need for a more targeted approach of smoke-free policies directed toward lower socioeconomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2338025420,"In the Kappa effect, two visual stimuli are given, and their spatial distance affects their perceived temporal interval. The classical model assumes constant speed while a competing Bayesian model assumes a slow speed prior. The two models are based on different assumptions about the statistical structure of the environment. Here we introduce a new visual experiment to distinguish between these models. When fit to the data, both the two models replicated human response, but the slowness model makes better behavioral predictions than the speed constancy model, and the estimated constant speed is close to the absolute threshold of speed. Our findings suggest that the Kappa effect appears to be due to slow speeds, and also modulated by spatial variance."
https://openalex.org/W2341177748,"The identification of temporal protein complexes would make great contribution to our knowledge of the dynamic organization characteristics in protein interaction networks (PINs). Recent studies have focused on integrating gene expression data into static PIN to construct dynamic PIN which reveals the dynamic evolutionary procedure of protein interactions, but they fail in practice for recognizing the active time points of proteins with low or high expression levels. We construct a Time-Evolving PIN (TEPIN) with a novel method called Deviation Degree, which is designed to identify the active time points of proteins based on the deviation degree of their own expression values. Owing to the differences between protein interactions, moreover, we weight TEPIN with connected affinity and gene co-expression to quantify the degree of these interactions. To validate the efficiencies of our methods, ClusterONE, CAMSE and MCL algorithms are applied on the TEPIN, DPIN (a dynamic PIN constructed with state-of-the-art three-sigma method) and SPIN (the original static PIN) to detect temporal protein complexes. Each algorithm on our TEPIN outperforms that on other networks in terms of match degree, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and function enrichment etc. In conclusion, our Deviation Degree method successfully eliminates the disadvantages which exist in the previous state-of-the-art dynamic PIN construction methods. Moreover, the biological nature of protein interactions can be well described in our weighted network. Weighted TEPIN is a useful approach for detecting temporal protein complexes and revealing the dynamic protein assembly process for cellular organization."

Objective Through a validated toxicovigilance program (SAT-HULP) we examined the characteristics of acute poisoning cases (APC) attended in the Emergency Department (ED) of La Paz Hospital (Madrid, Spain) and assessed their economic impact on the health system. Material and Methods The active poisoning surveillance system performs a daily search for cases in the hospital´s computerized case records. Found cases are entered into a database for recording of type of poisoning episode, reasons for exposure, causative agent, signs and symptoms and treatment. We carried out a cross-sectional epidemiological study with analytical projection, based on an impact study on cost per survivor. The data for the costs attributable to cases of APC observed at HULP (outpatients and inpatients) was obtained from the based on the information provided by the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) through the corresponding hospital discharge reports (available through SAT-HULP). Results During the first 30 month of SAT-HULP operation we found a total of 3,195 APC, a cumulative incidence rate of 1.75% of patients attended in the ED. The mean (SD) patient age was 40.9 (17.8) years and 51.2% were men. Drug abuse accounted for 47.5% of the cases. Suicide attempt was the second most frequent category (38.1%) and other causes accounted for 14.5% of APC. The total cost of hospital care for our hospital rose to €1,825,263.24 (approximately €730,105.30/year) resulting in a permanent occupation of 4 beds/year. Conclusions SAT-HULP constitutes a validated toxicovigilance tool, which continuously integrates available data in real-time and helps health services manage APC data flexibly, including the consumption of resources from the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2337265514,"Polyandry is more widespread than anticipated from Bateman's principle but its ultimate (evolutionary) causes and proximate (mechanistic) correlates are more difficult to pinpoint than those of polygyny. Here, we combined mating experiments, quantification of reproductive traits and microsatellite genotyping to determine the fitness implications of polyandry in two predatory mite species, where males are highly polygynous (up to 45 fertilized females during life), whereas females range from monandry to various polyandry levels. The medium-level polyandrous (up to eight male mates possible) Neoseiulus californicus received clear direct and indirect benefits: multiply mated females produced more offspring with higher survival chances over longer times than singly mated females. In contrast, singly and multiply mated females of the low-level polyandrous (commonly two male mates at maximum) Phytoseiulus persimilis produced similar numbers of offspring having similar survival chances. In both species, multiple mating resulted in mixed offspring paternities, opening the chance for indirect fitness benefits such as enhanced genetic compatibility, complementarity and/or variability. However, the female re-mating likelihood and the paternity chance of non-first male mates were lower in P. persimilis than in N. californicus. Regarding proximate factors, in both species first mating duration and female re-mating likelihood were negatively correlated. Based on occasional fertilization failure of first male mates in P. persimilis, and mixed offspring paternities in both species, we argue that fertilization assurance and the chance to gain indirect fitness benefits are the ultimate drivers of polyandry in P. persimilis, whereas those of N. californicus are higher offspring numbers coupled with enhanced offspring viability and possibly other indirect fitness benefits. Overall, the adaptive significance and proximate events well reflected the polyandry levels. Our study provides a key example for linking behavioral experiments, quantification of reproductive traits and paternity analysis via offspring genotyping to explain the evolution of differing levels of polyandry."
https://openalex.org/W2338099427,"The role of breast screening in breast cancer mortality declines is debated. Screening impacts cancer mortality through decreasing the number of advanced cancers with poor diagnosis, while cancer treatment works through decreasing the case-fatality rate. Hence, reductions in cancer death rates thanks to screening should directly reflect reductions in advanced cancer rates. We verified whether in breast screening trials, the observed reductions in the risk of breast cancer death could be predicted from reductions of advanced breast cancer rates.The Greater New York Health Insurance Plan trial (HIP) is the only breast screening trial that reported stage-specific cancer fatality for the screening and for the control group separately. The Swedish Two-County trial (TCT)) reported size-specific fatalities for cancer patients in both screening and control groups. We computed predicted numbers of breast cancer deaths, from which we calculated predicted relative risks (RR) and (95% confidence intervals). The Age trial in England performed its own calculations of predicted relative risk.The observed and predicted RR of breast cancer death were 0.72 (0.56-0.94) and 0.98 (0.77-1.24) in the HIP trial, and 0.79 (0.78-1.01) and 0.90 (0.80-1.01) in the Age trial. In the TCT, the observed RR was 0.73 (0.62-0.87), while the predicted RR was 0.89 (0.75-1.05) if overdiagnosis was assumed to be negligible and 0.83 (0.70-0.97) if extra cancers were excluded.In breast screening trials, factors other than screening have contributed to reductions in the risk of breast cancer death most probably by reducing the fatality of advanced cancers in screening groups. These factors were the better management of breast cancer patients and the underreporting of breast cancer as the underlying cause of death. Breast screening trials should publish stage-specific fatalities observed in each group."
https://openalex.org/W2339962388,"Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) are generated by power lines and household electrical devices. In the last several decades, some evidence has shown an association between ELF-MF exposure and depression and/or anxiety in epidemiological and animal studies. The mechanism underlying ELF-MF-induced depression is considered to involve adrenal steroidogenesis, which is triggered by ELF-MF exposure. However, how ELF-MFs stimulate adrenal steroidogenesis is controversial. In the current study, we investigated the effect of ELF-MF exposure on the mouse adrenal cortex-derived Y-1 cell line and the human adrenal cortex-derived H295R cell line to clarify whether the ELF-MF stimulates adrenal steroidogenesis directly. ELF-MF exposure was found to significantly stimulate adrenal steroidogenesis (p < 0.01–0.05) and the expression of adrenal steroid synthetic enzymes (p < 0.05) in Y-1 cells, but the effect was weak in H295R cells. Y-1 cells exposed to an ELF-MF showed significant decreases in phosphodiesterase activity (p < 0.05) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration (p < 0.01) and significant increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration (p < 0.001–0.05) and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (p < 0.05). The increase in cAMP was not inhibited by treatment with NF449, an inhibitor of the Gs alpha subunit of G protein. Our results suggest that ELF-MF exposure stimulates adrenal steroidogenesis via an increase in intracellular cAMP caused by the inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity in Y-1 cells. The same mechanism may trigger the increase in adrenal steroid secretion in mice observed in our previous study."
https://openalex.org/W2337412587,"Déjà vu and tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) are retrieval-related subjective experiences whose study relies on participant self-report. In four experiments (ns = 224, 273, 123 and 154), we explored the effect of questioning method on reported occurrence of déjà vu and TOT in experimental settings. All participants carried out a continuous recognition task, which was not expected to induce déjà vu or TOT, but were asked about their experiences of these subjective states. When presented with contemporary definitions, between 32% and 58% of participants nonetheless reported experiencing déjà vu or TOT. Changing the definition of déjà vu or asking participants to bring to mind a real-life instance of déjà vu or TOT before completing the recognition task had no impact on reporting rates. However, there was an indication that changing the method of requesting subjective reports impacted reporting of both experiences. More specifically, moving from the commonly used retrospective questioning (e.g. “Have you experienced déjà vu?”) to free report instructions (e.g. “Indicate whenever you experience déjà vu.”) reduced the total number of reported déjà vu and TOT occurrences. We suggest that research on subjective experiences should move toward free report assessments. Such a shift would potentially reduce the presence of false alarms in experimental work, thereby reducing the overestimation of subjective experiences prevalent in this area of research."
https://openalex.org/W2338196586,"Increased left ventricular (LV) twist and untwisting rate (LV twist mechanics) are essential responses of the heart to exercise. However, previously a large variability in LV twist mechanics during exercise has been observed, which complicates the interpretation of results. This study aimed to determine some of the physiological sources of variability in LV twist mechanics during exercise. Sixteen healthy males (age: 22 ± 4 years, O2peak: 45.5 ± 6.9 ml∙kg-1∙min-1, range of individual anaerobic threshold (IAT): 32–69% of O2peak) were assessed at rest and during exercise at: i) the same relative exercise intensity, 40%peak, ii) at 2% above IAT, and, iii) at 40%peak with hypoxia (40%peak+HYP). LV volumes were not significantly different between exercise conditions (P > 0.05). However, the mean margin of error of LV twist was significantly lower (F2,47 = 2.08, P < 0.05) during 40%peak compared with IAT (3.0 vs. 4.1 degrees). Despite the same workload and similar LV volumes, hypoxia increased LV twist and untwisting rate (P < 0.05), but the mean margin of error remained similar to that during 40%peak (3.2 degrees, P > 0.05). Overall, LV twist mechanics were linearly related to rate pressure product. During exercise, the intra-individual variability of LV twist mechanics is smaller at the same relative exercise intensity compared with IAT. However, the absolute magnitude (degrees) of LV twist mechanics appears to be associated with the prevailing rate pressure product. Exercise tests that evaluate LV twist mechanics should be standardised by relative exercise intensity and rate pressure product be taken into account when interpreting results."
https://openalex.org/W2337851564,"Immunoproteasomes, harboring the active site subunits β5i/LMP7, β1i/LMP2, and β2i/MECL1 exert protective, regulatory or modulating functions during infection-induced immune responses. Immunoproteasomes are constitutively expressed in hematopoietic derived cells, constituting the first line of defense against invading pathogens. To clarify the impact of immunoproteasomes on the innate immune response against Streptococcus pneumoniae, we characterized the progression of disease and analyzed the systemic immune response in β5i/LMP7-/- mice. Our data show that β5i/LMP7 deficiency, which affected the subunit composition of proteasomes in murine macrophages and liver, was accompanied by reduced transcription of genes encoding immune modulating molecules such as pentraxins, ficolins, and collectins. The diminished opsonin expression suggested an impaired humoral immune response against invading pneumococci resulting in an aggravated systemic dissemination of S. pneumoniae in β5i/LMP7-/- mice. The impaired bacterial elimination in β5i/LMP7-/- mice was accompanied by an aggravated course of pneumonia with early mortality as a consequence of critical illness during the late phase of disease. In summary our results highlight an unsuspected role for immuno-subunits in modulating the innate immune response to extracellular bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2341676321,"Scaling behaviors of the global monthly sea surface temperature (SST) derived from 1870-2009 average monthly data sets of Hadley Centre Sea Ice and SST (HadISST) are investigated employing detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The global SST fluctuations are found to be strong positively long-range correlated at all pertinent time-intervals. The value of scaling exponent is larger in the tropics than those in the intermediate latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres. DFA leads to the scaling exponent α = 0.87 over the globe (60°S~60°N), northern hemisphere (0°N~60°N), and southern hemisphere (0°S~60°S), α = 0.84 over the intermediate latitude of southern hemisphere (30°S~60°S), α = 0.81 over the intermediate latitude of northern hemisphere (30°N~60°N) and α = 0.90 over the tropics 30°S~30°N [fluctuation F(s) ~ sα], which the fluctuations of monthly SST anomaly display long-term correlated behaviors. Furthermore, the larger the standard deviation is, the smaller long-range correlations (LRCs) of SST in the corresponding regions, especially in three distinct upwelling areas. After the standard deviation is taken into account, an index χ = α * σ is introduced to obtain the spatial distributions of χ. There exists an obvious change of global SST in central east and northern Pacific and the northwest Atlantic. This may be as a clue on predictability of climate and ocean variabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2336294378,"Does the Finneson–Cooper score reflect the true value of predicting surgical success before discectomy? The aim of this study was to identify reliable predictors for surgical success two year after surgery for patients with LDH. Prospective analysis of 154 patients with LDH who underwent single-level lumbar discectomy was performed. Pre- and post-surgical success was assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) over a 2-year period. The Finneson-Cooper score also was used for evaluation of the clinical results. Using the ODI, surgical success was defined as a 30% (or more) improvement on the ODI score from the baseline. The ODI was considered the gold standard in this study. Finally, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive power of the Finneson–Cooper score in predicting surgical success were calculated. The mean age of the patients was 49.6 (SD = 9.3) years and 47.4% were male. Significant improvement from the pre- to post-operative ODI scores was observed (P < 0.001). Post-surgical success was 76.0% (n = 117). The patients’ rating on surgical success assessments by the ODI discriminated well between sub-groups of patients who differed with respect to the Finneson–Cooper score. Regarding patients’ surgical success, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the Finneson-Cooper ratings correlated with success rate. The findings indicated that the Finneson–Cooper score was reflective of surgical success before discectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2338463070,"Constrained ordination methods aims at finding an environmental gradient along which the species abundances are maximally separated. The species response functions, which describe the expected abundance as a function of the environmental score, are according to the ecological fundamental niche theory only meaningful if they are bell-shaped. Many classical model-based ordination methods, however, use quadratic regression models without imposing the bell-shape and thus allowing for meaningless U-shaped response functions. The analysis output (e.g. a biplot) may therefore be potentially misleading and the conclusions are prone to errors. In this paper we present a log-likelihood ratio criterion with a penalisation term to enforce more bell-shaped response shapes. We report the results of a simulation study and apply our method to metagenomics data from microbial ecology."
