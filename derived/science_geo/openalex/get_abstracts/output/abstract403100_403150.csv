Identification of a robust, reproducible, novel set of in vivo FMRP targets FMRP targets encode key pre- and postsynaptic proteins and autism candidate genes FMRP stalls ribosomes along the coding region of its mRNA targets Acute and genetic loss of FMRP relieves stalling and increases protein synthesis Fragile X syndrome (FXS) was the first genetic disorder to link RNA regulation to human cognitive function. Loss of function of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes FXS (Verkerk et al., 1991Verkerk A.J. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.H. Kuhl D.P. Pizzuti A. Reiner O. Richards S.

FMRP is an RNA binding protein (RNABP) whose function is incompletely understood, but is believed to be involved in translational regulation (Bassell and Warren, 2008Bassell G.J. Warren S.T.

Some activity-regulated translational control pathways have been identified, such as the ERK and mTOR pathways regulating initiation (Hoeffer and Klann, 2010Hoeffer C.A.

A specific set of transcripts and the proteins regulating them to mediate synaptic plasticity remain to be defined. In the brain, FMRP is present in the neuronal cell body, proximal dendrites, and axons (Christie et al., 2009Christie S.B. Akins M.R. Schwob J.E. Fallon J.R. The FXG: a presynaptic fragile X granule expressed in a subset of developing brain circuits.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1514-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the majority of FMRP is associated with polyribosomes (Feng et al., 1997bFeng Y. Gutekunst C.A. Eberhart D.E. Yi H.

Moreover, a missense mutation in the second RNA binding domain (I304N) abolishes FMRP polyribosome association (Zang et al., 2009Zang J.B. Nosyreva E.D. Spencer C.M. Volk L.J. Musunuru K. Zhong R.

Genet. 1993; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Studies of Fmr1 knockout (KO) and I304N mice have documented a number of defects in synaptic plasticity (Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009Pfeiffer B.E. Huber K.M. The state of synapses in fragile X syndrome.Neuroscientist. 2009; 15: 549-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Zang et al., 2009Zang J.B. Nosyreva E.D. Spencer C.M. Volk L.J. Musunuru K.

These observations suggest that FMRP regulates the translation of proteins important for proper synaptic function, yet there is no consensus as to how it might do so. In vitro, exogenous FMRP appears to bind and repress translation of a variety of transcripts including reporter mRNA (Laggerbauer et al., 2001Laggerbauer B. Ostareck D. Keidel E.M. Ostareck-Lederer A. Fischer U. Evidence that fragile X mental retardation protein is a negative regulator of translation.Hum. Mol.

The fragile X mental retardation protein inhibits translation via interacting with mRNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In dividing fibroblast cells, it has been suggested that transgenic Flag-tagged FMRP represses translation during elongation, but extrapolating this finding to endogenous FMRP in neurons is difficult (Ceman et al., 2003Ceman S. O'Donnell W.T. Reed M. Patton S. Pohl J. Warren S.T. Phosphorylation influences the translation state of FMRP-associated polyribosomes.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Underscoring the uncertainty of such a connection, Napoli et al., 2008Napoli I. Mercaldo V. Boyl P.P. Eleuteri B. Zalfa F. De Rubeis S. Di Marino D. Mohr E. Massimi M. Falconi M. et al.The fragile X syndrome protein represses activity-dependent translation through CYFIP1, a new 4E-BP.Cell. 2008; 134: 1042-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar found that nonpolyribosomal FMRP in synaptoneurosomes can repress translation by inhibiting cap-dependent initiation through interaction with the eIF4E-BP, CYFIP1. However, this is likely to account for only a small fraction of FMRP function in vivo as the vast majority of the protein is polyribosome-associated. A key to understanding FMRP function is to identify its RNA targets. Efforts have been made to identify specific FMRP target mRNAs by coimmunoprecipitation (IP) and microarray analysis (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D.

Beckel-Mitchener A. Purk T.P. Becker K.G. Barret T. Liu L. Carbonetto S. Weiler I.J. Greenough W.T. Eberwine J. RNA cargoes associating with FMRP reveal deficits in cellular functioning in Fmr1 null mice.Neuron. 2003; 37: 417-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and bioinformatic approaches (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D.

However, these approaches do not identify RNA binding sites within transcripts, have inherent signal to noise issues (Mili and Steitz, 2004Mili S. Steitz J.A.

Darnell R.B. RNA processing and its regulation: global insights into biological networks.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and are hampered by difficulties in bioinformatic prediction of complex RNA folding (Darnell et al., 2001Darnell J.C. Jensen K.B.

(2005a). Kissing complex RNAs mediate interaction between the Fragile-X mental retardation protein KH2 domain and brain polyribosomes. Genes Dev. 19, 903–918.Google Scholar). The net result is that they have met with limited success either in deriving a consensus set of FMRP mRNA targets, in identifying mRNAs that can be validated as targets in genetic systems, or in defining FMRP function. We recently developed a general means of identifying RNA-protein interaction sites in vivo termed crosslinking-IP (CLIP) (Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010Licatalosi D.D. Darnell R.B. RNA processing and its regulation: global insights into biological networks.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, Darnell, 2010Darnell R.B. HITS-CLIP: panoramic views of protein-RNA regulation in living cells.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2010; 1: 266-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). CLIP uses ultraviolet irradiation to penetrate tissue and create a covalent bond between proteins and RNA molecules that are in direct contact (within a bond-length). CLIP, particularly when combined with high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP), has been able to identify functional RNA-protein interaction sites in various contexts. Here we have applied HITS-CLIP to the mouse brain in order to identify FMRP-mRNA interactions. We have used the resulting set of robust FMRP targets to drive in vitro and in vivo functional assays that define the molecular role of FMRP in controlling translation. To develop FMRP CLIP (Figure 1A ), we took advantage of the observation that 85%–90% of FMRP is associated with polyribosomes in the brain (Figures 1B–1D) as a purification step (Stefani et al., 2004Stefani G. Fraser C.E. Darnell J.C. Darnell R.B. Fragile X mental retardation protein is associated with translating polyribosomes in neuronal cells.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7272-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This eliminated detectable background RNA from IPed FMRP-RNA crosslinked complexes (Figure 1E). After RT-PCR amplification of crosslinked RNAs, products were readily detected from wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1 KO brain (Figure 1F). Using this protocol, we performed five biologic replicates using two independent antibodies to FMRP. To assess the specificity and reproducibility of FMRP RNA binding we repeated CLIP in biologic replicate using a second protocol (Figure 1A) crosslinking intact brain slices, increasing the stringency of denaturation, and purifying Hu:RNA complexes (Darnell et al., 2009Darnell J.C. Fraser C.E. Mostovetsky O. Darnell R.B. Discrimination of common and unique RNA-binding activities among Fragile X mental retardation protein paralogs.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3164-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) from the same lysate as a control for specificity (Figures 1G–1I). We analyzed FMRP-crosslinked RNA tags from these seven independent experiments. Overall, 22 million tags were unambiguously mapped to the mouse genome, and after elimination of PCR duplicates, 163,904 unique sequences were analyzed (Table S1 available online). The results were very reproducible, with high correlations seen between exonic tag number per gene in CLIP experiments using different anti-FMRP antibodies, purification protocols and sequencing platforms (Figures S1A and S1B ). The results were specific, as little correlation was seen between FMRP mRNA targets and either Hu targets or those of another neuronal RNABP, Nova (Figures S1C and S1D). Importantly, the number of FMRP tags per transcript showed little correlation with transcript abundance or length (Figures S1E and S1F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that FMRP reproducibly crosslinks to a subset of brain mRNAs in a manner distinct from other neuronal RNABPs. We next defined the set of FMRP-mRNA interactions. We identified transcripts to which FMRP reproducibly crosslinked across the seven independent experiments, and used the number of unique tags per transcript in each experiment to rank the targets, allowing us to determine a chi-square score and false discovery rate (FDR) for each target based on rank and reproducibility. We identified a stringent set of 842 FMRP target transcripts (FDR < 0.01) (Tables S2A–S2C). These FMRP targets were detectable with both antibodies (100%), using both CLIP protocols (100%), different sequencing platforms (100%), and were biologically reproducible (99% were detectable in at least six of seven experiments). It is likely that this analysis underestimates the true number of FMRP-regulated mRNAs; in addition to the conservative FDR threshold, some targets are likely to be rare, present in only a fraction of cells, or to interact with FMRP only under specific conditions. Therefore the absence of crosslinking to any one mRNA should be interpreted with caution. Comparison of FMRP mRNA targets with a target list previously generated using FMRP-RNA co-IP (RIP-CHIP) from mouse brain (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D. et al.Microarray identification of FMRP-associated brain mRNAs and altered mRNA translational profiles in fragile X syndrome.Cell. 2001; 107: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) found significant overlap. Fifty-four percent of RIP-CHIP targets (p = 2.4 × 10−121; Table S2C and Table S3A) were present in the FMRP CLIP target list, accounting for 24% of CLIP targets. However, despite the fact that our conditions were much more stringent than those used in RIP-CHIP, our data conservatively identified 661 novel FMRP mRNA targets not found previously. We used the DAVID Bioinformatics database to analyze the gene ontology (GO) terms assigned to them. The 842 FMRP targets were compared with the total mRNA population present within the polyribosomal fractions from which FMRP:RNA complexes were captured, and independently with a database of the transcriptome of neurons purified from mouse brain at similar ages (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A and Table S3B). In both analyses, proteins encoded by FMRP-bound transcripts were enriched in those related to neuronal and synaptic transmission and regulation of small GTPase mediated signaling. FMRP was crosslinked to multiple members of many gene families (Table S2B). We also compared FMRP target mRNAs to the curated data set of mouse brain synaptic proteins (Croning et al., 2009Croning M.D. Marshall M.C. McLaren P. Armstrong J.D. Grant S.G. G2Cdb: the Genes to Cognition database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D846-D851Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This identified an especially strong overlap with the postsynaptic proteome (32% of FMRP targets, p = 2.1 × 10−83; Figure 2B and Tables S3A and S3C). Strikingly, a significant fraction of the mGluR5 (62%, p = 5.8 × 10−22; Tables S3A and S3D) and NMDAR (34%, p = 7.4 × 10−23; Tables S3A and S3E) receptor complex proteins were FMRP targets. Moreover, comparison with a presynaptic proteome database (Abul-Husn et al., 2009Abul-Husn N.S. Bushlin I. Morón J.A. Jenkins S.L. Dolios G. Wang R. Iyengar R. Ma'ayan A. Devi L.A. Systems approach to explore components and interactions in the presynapse.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 3303-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) revealed that FMRP also binds mRNAs encoding approximately one-third of the proteins in the presynaptic proteome (p = 6.4 × 10−33; Figure 2B and Tables S3A and S3F). We used Ingenuity software to identify the top pathways enriched in FMRP targets (Figure S2A and Table S4). The most significant overlaps included synaptic signaling pathways: synaptic long-term potentiation, glutamate receptor signaling, neuropathic pain signaling, GABA receptor signaling, synaptic LTD, and CREB signaling in neurons. Intracellular signaling pathways enriched in FMRP targets (p < 0.05) included calcium, PKA, PLC, G protein coupled receptor, RhoA, cAMP, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This suggests a direct role for FMRP in regulating translation of the pre- and postsynaptic proteome and synaptic plasticity, likely underlying cognitive and behavioral changes in patients with FXS, as well as epilepsy and altered pain sensitivity (Price et al., 2007Price T.J.

Self-injurious behavior in young boys with fragile X syndrome.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2003; 118A: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). FXS is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), accounting for up to 5% of all cases (Kelleher and Bear, 2008Kelleher III, R.J. Bear M.F. The autistic neuron: troubled translation?.Cell. 2008; 135: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and 90% of affected males show autistic behaviors (Hernandez et al., 2009Hernandez R.N. Feinberg R.L. Vaurio R. Passanante N.M. Thompson R.E. Kaufmann W.E. Autism spectrum disorder in fragile X syndrome: a longitudinal evaluation.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2009; 149A: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Comparison of the 842 FMRP target genes with 117 evaluable candidate genes from the SFARI database of autism candidate genes (http://gene.sfari.org) (Basu et al., 2009Basu S.N. Kollu R. Banerjee-Basu S. AutDB: a gene reference resource for autism research.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D832-D836Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) revealed a highly significant overlap with 28 FMRP targets (24%, p = 1.0 × 10−8; Table S3A), including several well-studied autism candidate genes such NLGN3, NRXN1, SHANK3, PTEN, TSC2, and NF1 (Table S5). The ability of FMRP to repress translation of target mRNAs (see below) suggests that FXS, and by extension, some cases of ASD, may result from the overexpression of specific dosage-sensitive genes through loss of translational suppression. Gene overexpression can occur due to copy number variations (CNVs) caused by de novo segmental duplications, and several CNV association studies have established links to ASD (Pinto et al., 2010Pinto D. Pagnamenta A.T. Klei L. Anney R. Merico D. Regan R. Conroy J. Magalhaes T.R. Correia C. Abrahams B.S. et al.Functional impact of global rare copy number variation in autism spectrum disorders.Nature. 2010; 466: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, Sebat et al., 2007Sebat J. Lakshmi B. Malhotra D. Troge J. Lese-Martin C. Walsh T. Yamrom B. Yoon S. Krasnitz A. Kendall J. et al.Strong association of de novo copy number mutations with autism.Science. 2007; 316: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). We found a significant number (25/196) of candidate autism susceptibility genes in duplicated loci are FMRP targets (Table S3A and Table S5; p = 0.001). CNVs due to deletions showed less overlap and did not reach significance (12/121, p = 0.28). Taken together, the overlap between FMRP target transcripts and genes linked to the ASDs, particularly overexpressed genes, provides a new connection between loss of function of FMRP and the development of autistic symptoms in patients. Sixty-six percent of FMRP mRNA binding was within the coding sequence (CDS), with no specific position relative to the start and stop codons, and with lower tag density in the 3′ or 5′ UTRs. In comparison, RNA tags of the neuronal Hu proteins mapped predominantly to the 3′ UTR of target transcripts (Figure 2C). This distribution of FMRP binding could arise in a population analysis from the sum of binding at unique positions in different transcripts. To exclude this possibility, we examined FMRP binding to individual targets, which also showed an even distribution of tags along the CDS (Figure 2D and Figures S2B–S2G), whereas in contrast, Hu binding to its top-ranked targets was restricted to very specific binding sites in 3′ UTRs (Figure 2E). The distribution of FMRP binding was unexpected. FMRP crosslinking to the CDS is not easily reconciled with findings that most FMRP appears to be associated with actively translating polyribosomes and that this association is sensitive to EDTA and RNase (Stefani et al., 2004Stefani G.

Treating N2a cells with puromycin or hippuristanol, an inhibitor of translation initiation, suggested that, after ribosomal “run-off,” FMRP was associated with mRNAs still loaded with several ribosomes, in contrast to ribosomal protein P0 (rpP0) or poly(A) binding protein (PABP) (Figure S3A ). Thus FMRP appears to associate with the CDS of transcripts on which some of the ribosomes may be stalled. To assess the role of endogenous FMRP on translation of individual neuronal mRNAs, we developed an in vitro translation system programmed with endogenous brain polyribosomes (the “IVTEBP system”) to maintain normal RNA-protein stoichiometry (Figure 3A ). In the presence of puromycin at 30°C, ribosomal run-off was evident within 2 min, plateaued by 15 min, and was saturable, as neither a 10-fold increase in puromycin nor incubation for up to 45 min caused additional run-off (Figure S3). No loss of polyribosome integrity was observed in parallel reactions incubated with cycloheximide (CHX) at 30°C for up to 45 min, ruling out nuclease activity. Ribosomal run-off could be detected in the presence of hippuristanol, reflecting natural ribosome release at the stop codon (Figure 3B). This run-off was accompanied by 35S-methionine incorporation in a time- and brain polyribosome-dependent manner that was"

In higher organisms, an antiviral innate immune response is triggered by the recognition of viral nucleic acids by germline-encoded pathogen recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (Barbalat et al., 2011Barbalat R.

Several TLRs, including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9, detect viral RNA and DNA in the endosome, whereas RLRs bind to viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Both TLR and RLR pathways activate signaling cascades that lead to the production of an arsenal of effector molecules that suppress viral replication and assembly. Prominent among the antiviral molecules are type I interferons, including IFNα and IFNβ, which activate the JAK-STAT pathway to fight viral infection. RLRs comprise RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, all of which contain an RNA helicase domain (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009Yoneyama M. Fujita T. RNA recognition and signal transduction by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T.

RIG-I also contains a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) that binds to viral RNA harboring 5′-triphosphate (5′-pppRNA) (Hornung et al., 2006Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzózka K. Jung A. Kato H.

RIG-I and MDA5 detect distinct classes of RNA viruses (Kato et al., 2006Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T.

Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two CARD domains in tandem at the N terminus, whereas LGP2 lacks the CARD domains. The binding of viral RNA to the C termini of RIG-I and MDA5 presumably induces a conformational change that exposes the N-terminal CARD domains, which interact with the CARD domain of the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS (also known as IPS1, VISA, or CARDIF) (Kawai et al., 2005Kawai T.

MAVS then activates the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3, respectively. NF-κB and IRF3 translocate into the nucleus, where they function cooperatively to induce type I interferons and other antiviral molecules (McWhirter et al., 2005McWhirter S.M. Tenoever B.R. Maniatis T. Connecting mitochondria and innate immunity.Cell. 2005; 122: 645-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of signal transduction in the RIG-I pathway, we have recently established a cell-free system in which viral RNA triggers the activation of IRF3 and IKK in cytosolic extracts in the presence of mitochondria (Zeng et al., 2010Zeng W. Sun L. Jiang X. Chen X. Hou F. Adhikari A. Xu M. Chen Z.J. Reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway reveals a signaling role of unanchored polyubiquitin chains in innate immunity.Cell. 2010; 141: 315-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using this system, we discovered that the CARD domains of RIG-I bind to unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains and that this binding is important for RIG-I activation. The binding of full-length RIG-I to ubiquitin chains depends on ATP and 5′-pppRNA, suggesting that RIG-I activation involves sequential binding of viral RNA and unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I RD and CARDs, respectively. We have also shown that mitochondria isolated from virus-infected cells can activate IKK and TBK1 in the cytoplasm and that this activity depends on MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane (Zeng et al., 2009Zeng W. Xu M. Liu S. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Key role of Ubc5 and lysine-63 polyubiquitination in viral activation of IRF3.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 315-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, K63 polyubiquitination also plays an important role in TBK1 activation by MAVS. The mechanism by which MAVS is activated by RIG-I and ubiquitin chains is still not understood. The nature of the active form of MAVS has also remained a mystery. In this report, we show that MAVS forms very large aggregates after viral infection and that these aggregates are highly potent in activating IRF3 in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, these aggregates form self-perpetuating fiber-like polymers that can efficiently convert endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. These properties closely resemble prions, which are infectious protein conformations found in pathological as well as physiological conditions (Chien et al., 2004Chien P. Weissman J.S. DePace A.H. Emerging principles of conformation-based prion inheritance.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010Halfmann R. Lindquist S.

Serio T.R. The prion hypothesis: from biological anomaly to basic regulatory mechanism.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Initially found to be the causative agent of fatal neurological diseases (Prusiner, 1998Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar) —including Scrapies in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or “mad cow disease”) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in human—the prion PrP is the founding member of a growing list of proteins that can form self-perpetuating aggregates, several of which have evolved to serve physiological functions. For example, several prions in fungi regulate phenotypic switches that may confer selectable advantages (Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010Halfmann R. Lindquist S. Epigenetics in the extreme: prions and the inheritance of environmentally acquired traits.Science. 2010; 330: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the prion-based conformational switch can be a robust epigenetic mechanism that regulates protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Properties of prions include fibrous aggregates, resistance to detergent and protease, and most importantly, the ability to “infect” the endogenous protein and convert the native conformation into fibrous aggregates. Strikingly, MAVS possesses all of these prion-like properties. The formation of MAVS aggregates leads to a gain of function, and the conformational switch is highly efficient and tightly regulated by viral infection. Also quite remarkably, in vitro incubation of RIG-I and mitochondria in the presence of K63 polyubiquitin chains efficiently converts endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. To understand how MAVS is activated by viral infection, we used differential centrifugation to isolate crude mitochondria (P5) from HEK293T cells, which were infected with Sendai virus (+SeV) or were not infected (−SeV). The mitochondrial proteins were extracted in a buffer containing the nonionic detergent n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside (DDM; 1%) and then fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with a MAVS antibody, whereas other aliquots were incubated with 35S-IRF3 and HEK293T cytosolic extracts in the presence of ATP. The dimerization of IRF3, which is caused by its phosphorylation by TBK1 and represents the hallmark of its activation, was measured by native gel electrophoresis (Panne et al., 2007Panne D. McWhirter S.M. Maniatis T. Harrison S.C. Interferon regulatory factor 3 is regulated by a dual phosphorylation-dependent switch.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22816-22822Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Yoneyama et al., 2002Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fujita T. Control of IRF-3 activation by phosphorylation.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A , viral infection led to the formation of a very large complex containing MAVS, which activated IRF3 in the cytosol. This complex was much larger than 26S proteasome and sedimented toward the bottom of the centrifuge tube containing 50%–60% sucrose. We have previously shown that our MAVS antibody, which was raised against residues 131–291 of MAVS, detected two major bands on SDS-PAGE (Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). The upper band represents full-length MAVS, whereas the lower band is a truncated form of MAVS, which lacks the N terminus but retains the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Interestingly, only the full-length MAVS formed a large complex capable of activating IRF3. Furthermore, almost all full-length MAVS shifted to the large complex in response to viral infection. To visualize MAVS protein in cells, we expressed YFP-tagged MAVS in Mavs-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by retroviral transduction. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that the staining pattern of YFP-MAVS overlapped with that of the mitochondrial marker Mitotracker in the absence of virus infection (Figure 1B). Strikingly, after infection with Sendai virus, YFP-MAVS appeared to form clusters that partially overlapped with Mitotracker, suggesting that MAVS forms aggregates in response to viral infection. The large size of the active MAVS complex, together with our previous observation that MAVS in virus-infected cells is more resistant to detergent extraction (Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar), led us to test whether MAVS forms detergent-resistant aggregates. We employed a method called semidenaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), which was previously used for the detection of prion-like structures (Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins.Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In SDD-AGE, the crude mitochondria (P5) from cells infected with Sendai virus for different lengths of time were resuspended in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS and then separated on 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis in a running buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Figure 1C). Strikingly, a smear of SDS-resistant high-molecular weight MAVS aggregates appeared after 9 hr of viral infection, much like prions (Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins.Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). These aggregates were not detected in cells depleted of MAVS by RNAi, which blocked IRF3 activation by Sendai virus (Figure S1A available online). The kinetics of MAVS aggregate formation correlated with IRF3 activation by mitochondria from the virus-infected cells (Figure 1C). These results indicate that MAVS forms very large and highly active signaling complexes following viral infection. In Figure 1C, we noted that our MAVS antibody could barely detect MAVS on SDD-AGE during the early time course of viral infection but was able to detect MAVS in the same samples when they were separated by the standard SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A major difference between SDD-AGE and SDS-PAGE is the presence of a reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol or BME) in the latter, but not in the former, sample buffer. Interestingly, when crude mitochondria were resuspended in sample buffers containing different concentrations of BME followed by SDD-AGE, the smear of high-molecular weight MAVS aggregates disappeared (Figure 1D). These results suggest that the SDS-resistant MAVS aggregates may contain disulfide bonds and that the functional aggregates are preferentially detected by our MAVS antibody. To determine whether reduction of the MAVS aggregates alters their activity and/or aggregation, we resuspended mitochondria from Sendai virus-infected cells in a buffer containing 1% DDM and 10 mM DTT and then fractionated the mitochondrial extracts by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. MAVS still sedimented as very large particles after the DTT treatment, and these particles were fully capable of activating IRF3 in the cytosol (Figure S1B). Control experiments showed that the DTT-treated particles in high-density sucrose fractions no longer formed detectable MAVS aggregates on SDD-AGE (Figure S1C). Thus, DTT treatment prevented the detection of MAVS aggregates using the SDD-AGE assay but did not cause the breakdown of the MAVS aggregates, which could be isolated by ultracentrifugation. These MAVS aggregates were still active in causing IRF3 dimerization (Figure S1B). However, DTT treatment of cells blocked MAVS aggregation as well as IRF3 activation by Sendai virus (Figure S1D). This effect was more evident when DTT was applied during the early time course of virus infection than during the late time course (Figure S1E). Thus, it is possible that disulfide bond formation facilitates MAVS aggregation, but the maintenance of the MAVS aggregates and its activity does not require the disulfide bonds. In any case, SDD-AGE without a reducing agent provides a sensitive assay for the detection of SDS-resistant, functional MAVS aggregates induced by virus infection. Previous studies have identified several chemicals that inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation triggered by RNA viruses and poly[I:C] (Iwamura et al., 2001Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Induction of IRF-3/-7 kinase and NF-kappaB in response to double-stranded RNA and virus infection: common and unique pathways.Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Among these is the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation through an unknown mechanism. We found that geldanamycin and its analog (17-AAG), at concentrations that inhibited IRF3 activation, also blocked MAVS aggregation induced by Sendai virus (Figure 1E). Further, mitochondria isolated from cells treated with the drugs failed to activate IRF3 when incubated with cytosolic extracts. In contrast, cytosolic extracts from geldanamycin-treated cells could still support IRF3 activation when incubated with mitochondria from virus-infected cells (Figure S1F). Interestingly, the cytosolic extracts from Sendai virus-infected cells were refractory to activation by mitochondria from virus-infected cells (Figure S1F, lane 2), suggesting that some signaling proteins in the cytosol were desensitized following their activation. Taken together, these results suggest that geldanamycin and 17-AAG inhibit IRF3 activation by preventing MAVS aggregation on the mitochondria (see Discussion). To facilitate purification of the active MAVS complex, we generated a HEK293T cell line stably expressing Flag-MAVS. Analysis of the mitochondrial extracts from this cell line by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation revealed that a fraction of Flag-MAVS formed a large complex that is capable of activating IRF3 dimerization even in the absence of viral infection, suggesting that overexpression caused a small fraction of Flag-MAVS to form the active complex (Figure S2A , top). Sendai virus infection caused the vast majority of MAVS to form the active complex (Figure S2A, bottom). However, despite much effort, we were unable to immunoprecipitate the active MAVS complex with antibodies against Flag or MAVS under native conditions. We therefore attempted to carry out immunoprecipitation under a partially denaturing condition that could maintain the activity of the MAVS complex. We found that, when the MAVS complex was solubilized in 2.5M guanidine-HCl and then dialyzed in a buffer containing 0.5 M guanidine-HCl, it could be immunoprecipitated with the Flag antibody, and the dialysis restored its ability to activate IRF3 (Figure S2B). Based on these experiments, we devised a protocol to purify the functional Flag-MAVS particles from Sendai virus-infected cells (Figure 2A and 2B ). As a control, we also purified Flag-MAVS from uninfected cells. In both cases, silver staining of the purified particles revealed a predominant band that corresponded to Flag-MAVS itself (Figure 2B), which was verified by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting (data not shown). Importantly, only Flag-MAVS purified from the virus-infected cells formed aggregates and was capable of activating IRF3 when incubated with cytosolic extracts (Figure 2C). These results suggest that the active MAVS particles consist predominantly of the MAVS protein itself, which likely forms polymers.Figure 2Purification of Active MAVS ParticlesShow full caption(A) A protocol for purification of active Flag-MAVS particles.(B) Silver staining of Flag-MAVS purified from HEK293T cells infected with Sendai virus or not infected.(C) IRF3 dimerization assay using purified Flag-MAVS shown in (B).

MAVS was also analyzed by immunoblotting following SDD-AGE and SDS-PAGE. See also Figure S2. To test directly whether MAVS alone could form functional polymers, we attempted to express and purify recombinant MAVS protein in E. coli. Because full-length MAVS containing the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM) was largely insoluble when expressed in E. coli, we expressed TM-deleted MAVS (MAVSΔTM) in HEK293T cells and then tested its ability to activate IRF3 in cytosolic extracts (Figures S3A and S3B ). Interestingly, although the TM domain is absolutely required for MAVS to activate IRF3 and induce IFN in intact cells (Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar), in vitro incubation of MAVSΔTM with cytosolic extracts led to IRF3 dimerization (Figure S3B, lane 1). This result suggests that the activity of MAVSΔTM is blocked in intact cells by an unknown mechanism but unleashed in the in vitro assay (see below). We took advantage of this assay to test a panel of MAVS deletion mutants and found that the proline-rich region (residues 103–153) and the C terminus (residues 461–540) were dispensable for IRF3 activation, whereas the CARD domain was essential (Figure S3B). Based on these results, we expressed in E. coli a variant of MAVS lacking TM and proline-rich region as a fusion protein with Sumo, a ubiquitin-like protein that is known to facilitate expression of fusion partners in soluble forms. We purified this protein, termed Sumo-MAVS, to apparent homogeneity and found that it potently activated IRF3 in the cytosolic extracts (Figure S3C). Interestingly, when Sumo-MAVS was analyzed by gel filtration on Superdex-200, a fraction of the protein eluted in the void volume, and these high-molecular weight forms activated IRF3 when they were incubated with cytosolic extracts (peak I; Figure 3A ). In contrast, the low-molecular weight forms of Sumo-MAVS had no activity (peak II). Negative-stain electron microscopy of the protein particles showed that Sumo-MAVS in peak I formed large fiber-like polymers, whereas the protein in peak II formed much smaller particles with globular shapes (Figure 3B). When Peak II was stored at 4°C for 1 or 2 days, it gradually converted to peak I, indicating that the low-molecular weight forms of Sumo-MAVS spontaneously formed the fibrous polymers (Figure S3D). Removal of the Sumo tag caused the majority of MAVS to elute in peak I, which was also capable of activating IRF3 (data not shown). We also expressed and purified mouse MAVS lacking the TM domain as a His6-tagged protein. The mouse MAVS protein also formed long fibers and were capable of activating IRF3 in cytosolic extracts (Figure 3C). The average diameter of the mouse MAVS fibers was smaller than that of the human Sumo-MAVS fibers, presumably because the presence of Sumo rendered the fibers thicker. These results suggest that the ability of MAVS to form fibrous polymers is evolutionally conserved and is independent of the purification tags. A hallmark of prions is their ability to convert endogenous proteins from their native conformations into prion-like fibrils. To test whether the MAVS fibrils have the prion-like activity, we incubated the peak I and peak II fractions of Sumo-MAVS with mitochondria from HEK293T cells at room temperature for 30 min and then analyzed endogenous MAVS in the mitochondrial extracts by SDD-AGE (Figure 3D). Significantly, MAVS formed large aggregates after the mitochondria were incubated with peak I, but not peak II. Even highly diluted peak I (∼80 ng/ml Sumo-MAVS; Figure 3D, lane 3), which was not detectable by the MAVS antibody, caused detectable aggregation of endogenous MAVS, suggesting a catalytic mechanism of this conformational conversion, which is reminiscent of prion-like infection. The mitochondria also gained the ability to activate IRF3 after incubation with peak I, and the activity was detectable with a concentration of peak I as low as 16 ng/ml (Figure 3E, lane 6). In contrast, peak II was unable to activate the mitochondria even at high concentrations. High concentrations of Peak I alone modestly activated IRF3, but this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of mitochondria (e.g., compare lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 3E). Most prions form fiber-like structures that are resistant to protease digestion (Tuite and Serio, 2010Tuite M.F. Serio T.R. The prion hypothesis: from biological anomaly to basic regulatory mechanism.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MAVS fibrils are resistant to proteolysis, we fractionated Sumo-MAVS on Superdex-200 and digested peak I and peak II with proteinase K (PK). Two prominent PK-resistant fragments appeared when peak I was digested for 2 hr, whereas such fragments were much less visible in the peak II sample (Figure 4A ). The peak II sample contained a faint band that was relatively resistant to PK, and this band was identified as Hsp70 by mass spectrometry (Figure 4A, lanes 7–10; data not shown). Fractionation of the PK-digested Sumo-MAVS on Superdex-200 led to the separation of two peaks, with the first peak eluting in the void volume, similar to peak I of undigested Sumo-MAVS (Figure 4B). The second peak from the gel filtration column contained predominantly Hsp70, as determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Peak I contained a doublet with molecular weights of ∼30 kDa. Both bands, designated as PK-MAVS, were excised for mass spectrometry, which identified multiple peptides of SUMO and the N terminus of MAVS, but none after residue 218 of MAVS (Figure S4A ). These results suggest that PK-MAVS contains a fragment from Sumo and the N terminus of MAVS, including the entire CARD domain (Figure S4B). Negative-stain electron microscopy of PK-MAVS revealed that it formed long fibers with an average diameter of 12.6 ± 0.69 nm and an overall shape similar to that of the prion PrP (Figure 4C and Figure S4C).Figure S4Characterization of Proteinase K-Resistant MAVS and Mini-MAVS, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Sequencing of PK-MAVS by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).

https://openalex.org/W2004995654,"Despite decades of research, the structure and assembly of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is composed of ∼30 nucleoporins (Nups), remain elusive. Here, we report the genome of the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum (ct) and identify the complete repertoire of Nups therein. The thermophilic proteins show improved properties for structural and biochemical studies compared to their mesophilic counterparts, and purified ctNups enabled the reconstitution of the inner pore ring module that spans the width of the NPC from the anchoring membrane to the central transport channel. This module is composed of two large Nups, Nup192 and Nup170, which are flexibly bridged by short linear motifs made up of linker Nups, Nic96 and Nup53. This assembly illustrates how Nup interactions can generate structural plasticity within the NPC scaffold. Our findings therefore demonstrate the utility of the genome of a thermophilic eukaryote for studying complex molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W2083420798,"During an inflammatory response, neutrophils migrate to the site of infection where they can kill invading pathogens by phagocytosis, secretion of anti-microbicidal mediators or the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are specialized anti-microbial structures comprised of decondensed chromatin decorated with microbicidal agents. Increased amount of NETs have been found in patients suffering from the chronic lung inflammatory disease cystic fibrosis, correlating with increased severity of pulmonary obstruction. Furthermore, acute lung inflammation during influenza A infection is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils into the lung. The role of NETs during virus-mediated lung inflammation is unknown. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated deimination of histone H3 and H4 is required for NET formation. Therefore, we generated a PAD4-deficient mouse strain that has a striking inability to form NETs. These mice were infected with influenza A/WSN, and the disease was monitored at the level of leukocytic lung infiltration, lung pathology, viral replication, weight loss and mortality. PAD4 KO fared comparable to WT mice in all the parameters tested, but they displayed slight but statistically different weight loss kinetics during infection that was not reflected in enhanced survival. Overall, we conclude that PAD4-mediated NET formation is dispensable in a mouse model of influenza A infection."
https://openalex.org/W2023399402,"Type I interferons (IFN) are cytokines that are rapidly secreted upon microbial infections and regulate all aspects of the immune response. In humans 15 type I IFN subtypes exist, of which IFN α2 and IFN β are used in the clinic for treatment of different pathologies. IFN α2 and IFN β are non redundant in their expression and in their potency to exert specific bioactivities. The more recently identified type III IFNs (3 IFN λ or IL-28/IL-29) bind an unrelated cell-type restricted receptor. Downstream of these two receptor complexes is a shared Jak/Stat pathway. Several mechanisms that contribute to the shut down of the IFN-induced signaling have been described at the molecular level. In particular, it has long been known that type I IFN induces the establishment of a desensitized state. In this work we asked how the IFN-induced desensitization integrates into the network built by the multiple type I IFN subtypes and type III IFNs. We show that priming of cells with either type I IFN or type III IFN interferes with the cell's ability to further respond to all IFN α subtypes. Importantly, primed cells are differentially desensitized in that they retain sensitivity to IFN β. We show that USP18 is necessary and sufficient to induce differential desensitization, by impairing the formation of functional binding sites for IFN α2. Our data highlight a new type of differential between IFNs α and IFN β and underline a cross-talk between type I and type III IFN. This cross-talk could shed light on the reported genetic variation in the IFN λ loci, which has been associated with persistence of hepatitis C virus and patient's response to IFN α2 therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1986162414,"Transcription hinders replication fork progression and stability, and the Mec1/ATR checkpoint protects fork integrity. Examining checkpoint-dependent mechanisms controlling fork stability, we find that fork reversal and dormant origin firing due to checkpoint defects are rescued in checkpoint mutants lacking THO, TREX-2, or inner-basket nucleoporins. Gene gating tethers transcribed genes to the nuclear periphery and is counteracted by checkpoint kinases through phosphorylation of nucleoporins such as Mlp1. Checkpoint mutants fail to detach transcribed genes from nuclear pores, thus generating topological impediments for incoming forks. Releasing this topological complexity by introducing a double-strand break between a fork and a transcribed unit prevents fork collapse. Mlp1 mutants mimicking constitutive checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation also alleviate checkpoint defects. We propose that the checkpoint assists fork progression and stability at transcribed genes by phosphorylating key nucleoporins and counteracting gene gating, thus neutralizing the topological tension generated at nuclear pore gated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2101330556,"SSB proteins bind to and control the accessibility of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), likely facilitated by their ability to diffuse on ssDNA. Using a hybrid single-molecule method combining fluorescence and force, we probed how proteins with large binding site sizes can migrate rapidly on DNA and how protein-protein interactions and tension may modulate the motion. We observed force-induced progressive unraveling of ssDNA from the SSB surface between 1 and 6 pN, followed by SSB dissociation at ∼10 pN, and obtained experimental evidence of a reptation mechanism for protein movement along DNA wherein a protein slides via DNA bulge formation and propagation. SSB diffusion persists even when bound with RecO and at forces under which the fully wrapped state is perturbed, suggesting that even in crowded cellular conditions SSB can act as a sliding platform to recruit and carry its interacting proteins for use in DNA replication, recombination and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2052164164,"Focal adhesions (FAs) are macromolecular complexes that provide a linkage between the cell and its external environment. In a motile cell, focal adhesions change size and position to govern cell migration, through the dynamic processes of assembly and disassembly. To better understand the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions, we have developed an analysis system for the automated detection, tracking, and data extraction of these structures in living cells. This analysis system was used to quantify the dynamics of fluorescently tagged Paxillin and FAK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts followed via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF). High content time series included the size, shape, intensity, and position of every adhesion present in a living cell. These properties were followed over time, revealing adhesion lifetime and turnover rates, and segregation of properties into distinct zones. As a proof-of-concept, we show how a single point mutation in Paxillin at the Jun-kinase phosphorylation site Serine 178 changes FA size, distribution, and rate of assembly. This study provides a detailed, quantitative picture of FA spatiotemporal dynamics as well as a set of tools and methodologies for advancing our understanding of how focal adhesions are dynamically regulated in living cells.

https://openalex.org/W2045044466,"Genetic, biochemical, and animal model studies strongly suggest a central role for α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. α-synuclein lacks a signal peptide sequence and has thus been considered a cytosolic protein. Recent data has suggested that the protein may be released from cells via a non-classical secretory pathway and may therefore exert paracrine effects in the extracellular environment. However, proof that α-synuclein is actually secreted into the brain extracellular space in vivo has not been obtained. We developed a novel highly sensitive ELISA in conjugation with an in vivo microdialysis technique to measure α-synuclein in brain interstitial fluid. We show for the first time that α-synuclein is readily detected in the interstitial fluid of both α-synuclein transgenic mice and human patients with traumatic brain injury. Our data suggest that α-synuclein is physiologically secreted by neurons in vivo. This interstitial fluid pool of the protein may have a role in the propagation of synuclein pathology and progression of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966367806,"Metformin, an oral insulin-sensitizing drug, is actively transported into cells by organic cation transporters (OCT) 1, 2, and 3 (encoded by SLC22A1, SLC22A2, or SLC22A3), which are tissue specifically expressed at significant levels in various organs such as liver, muscle, and kidney. Because metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism, drug-drug interaction by inhibition of OCT transporters may be important. So far, comprehensive data on the interaction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with OCTs are missing although PPIs are frequently used in metformin-treated patients. Using in silico modeling and computational analyses, we derived pharmacophore models indicating that PPIs (i.e. omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and tenatoprazole) are potent OCT inhibitors. We then established stably transfected cell lines expressing the human uptake transporters OCT1, OCT2, or OCT3 and tested whether these PPIs inhibit OCT-mediated metformin uptake in vitro. All tested PPIs significantly inhibited metformin uptake by OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC(50)) were in the low micromolar range (3-36 µM) and thereby in the range of IC(50) values of other potent OCT drug inhibitors. Finally, we tested whether the PPIs are also transported by OCTs, but did not identify PPIs as OCT substrates. In conclusion, PPIs are potent inhibitors of the OCT-mediated metformin transport in vitro. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical relevance of this drug-drug interaction with potential consequences on metformin disposition and/or efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2066370313,"Chimpanzees are endangered in their native Africa but in the United States, they are housed not only in zoos and research centers but owned privately as pets and performers. In 2008, survey data revealed that the public is less likely to think that chimpanzees are endangered compared to other great apes, and that this is likely the result of media misportrayals in movies, television and advertisements. Here, we use an experimental survey paradigm with composite images of chimpanzees to determine the effects of specific image characteristics. We found that those viewing a photograph of a chimpanzee with a human standing nearby were 35.5% more likely to consider wild populations to be stable/healthy compared to those seeing the exact same picture without a human. Likewise, the presence of a human in the photograph increases the likelihood that they consider chimpanzees as appealing as a pet. We also found that respondents seeing images in which chimpanzees are shown in typically human settings (such as an office space) were more likely to perceive wild populations as being stable and healthy compared to those seeing chimpanzees in other contexts. These findings shed light on the way that media portrayals of chimpanzees influence public attitudes about this important and endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2146987518,"Mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are causative for inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A proportion of SOD1 mutant protein is misfolded onto the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria in one or more spinal cord cell types. By construction of mice in which mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein is selectively expressed in motor neurons, we demonstrate that axonal mitochondria of motor neurons are primary in vivo targets for misfolded SOD1. Mutant SOD1 alters axonal mitochondrial morphology and distribution, with dismutase active SOD1 causing mitochondrial clustering at the proximal side of Schmidt-Lanterman incisures within motor axons and dismutase inactive SOD1 producing aberrantly elongated axonal mitochondria beginning pre-symptomatically and increasing in severity as disease progresses. Somal mitochondria are altered by mutant SOD1, with loss of the characteristic cylindrical, networked morphology and its replacement by a less elongated, more spherical shape. These data indicate that mutant SOD1 binding to mitochondria disrupts normal mitochondrial distribution and size homeostasis as early pathogenic features of SOD1 mutant-mediated ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2029872746,"Background There is increased risk of cardiovascular disease among HIV seropositive individuals. The prevalence of HIV is highest in sub-Saharan Africa; however, HIV-related cardiovascular risk research is largely derived from developed country settings. Herein, we describe the prevalence of hypertension and obesity in a large HIV treatment program in Kenya. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of a large HIV treatment program in Western Kenya between 2006 and 2009. We calculated the prevalence of hypertension and obesity among HIV+ adults as well as utilized multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between clinical characteristics, HIV-related characteristics, and hypertension. Results Our final sample size was 12,194. The median systolic/diastolic blood pressures were similar for both sexes (male: 110/70 mmHg, female: 110/70 mmHg). The prevalence of hypertension among men and women were 11.2% and 7.4%, respectively. Eleven percent of men and 22.6% of women were overweight/obese (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2). Ordinal logistic regression analyses showed that overweight/obesity was more strongly associated with hypertension among HIV+ men (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.88–3.09) than a higher successive age category (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.40–1.87 comparing 16–35, 36–45 and >45 years categories). Among women, higher age category and overweight/obesity were most strongly associated with hypertension (age category: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.95–2.50, overweight/obesity: OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.50–2.16). Length of time on protease inhibitors was not found to be related to hypertension for men (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.42–6.20) or women (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.37–2.65) after adjustment for CD4 count, age and BMI. Conclusion In Western Kenya, there is a high prevalence of hypertension and overweight/obesity among HIV+ patients with differences observed between men and women. The care of HIV+ patients in sub-Saharan Africa should also include both identification and management of associated cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2026044471,"The SET and MYND Domain (SMYD) proteins comprise a unique family of multi-domain SET histone methyltransferases that are implicated in human cancer progression. Here we report an analysis of the crystal structure of the full length human SMYD3 in a complex with an analog of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methyl donor cofactor. The structure revealed an overall compact architecture in which the “split-SET” domain adopts a canonical SET domain fold and closely assembles with a Zn-binding MYND domain and a C-terminal superhelical 9 α-helical bundle similar to that observed for the mouse SMYD1 structure. Together, these structurally interlocked domains impose a highly confined binding pocket for histone substrates, suggesting a regulated mechanism for its enzymatic activity. Our mutational and biochemical analyses confirm regulatory roles of the unique structural elements both inside and outside the core SET domain and establish a previously undetected preference for trimethylation of H4K20."
https://openalex.org/W2081748846,"Galiellalactone is a potent and specific inhibitor of STAT3 signaling which has been shown to possess growth inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cells expressing active STAT3. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of galiellalactone on prostate cancer stem cell-like cells. We explored the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as a marker for cancer stem cell-like cells in different human prostate cancer cell lines and the effects of galiellalactone on ALDH expressing (ALDH+) prostate cancer cells. ALDH+ subpopulations were detected and isolated from the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and long-term IL-6 stimulated LNCaP cells using ALDEFLUOR® assay and flow cytometry. In contrast to ALDH- cells, ALDH+ prostate cancer cells showed cancer stem cell-like characteristics such as increased self-renewing and colony forming capacity and tumorigenicity. In addition, ALDH+ cells showed an increased expression of putative prostate cancer stem cell markers (CD44 and integrin α2β1). Furthermore, ALDH+ cells expressed phosphorylated STAT3. Galiellalactone treatment decreased the proportion of ALDH+ prostate cancer cells and induced apoptosis of ALDH+ cells. The gene expression of ALDH1A1 was downregulated in vivo in galiellalactone treated DU145 xenografts. These findings emphasize that targeting the STAT3 pathway in prostate cancer cells, including prostate cancer stem cell-like cells, is a promising therapeutic approach and that galiellalactone is an interesting compound for the development of future prostate cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2075800539,"Background The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) is a serious pest of rice in Asia. Development of novel control strategies can be facilitated by comparison of BPH feeding behaviour on varieties exhibiting natural genetic variation, and then elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings BPH feeding behaviour was compared on 12 rice varieties over a 12 h period using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) and honeydew clocks. Seven feeding behaviours (waveforms) were identified and could be classified into two phases. The first phase involved patterns of sieve element location including non penetration (NP), pathway (N1+N2+N3), xylem (N5) [21] and two new feeding waveforms, derailed stylet mechanics (N6) and cell penetration (N7). The second feeding phase consisted of salivation into the sieve element (N4-a) and sieve element sap ingestion (N4-b). Production of honeydew drops correlated with N4-b waveform patterns providing independent confirmation of this feeding behaviour. Conclusions/Significance Overall variation in feeding behaviour was highly correlated with previously published field resistance or susceptibility of the different rice varieties: BPH produced lower numbers of honeydew drops and had a shorter period of phloem feeding on resistant rice varieties, but there was no significant difference in the time to the first salivation (N4-b). These qualitative differences in behaviour suggest that resistance is caused by differences in sustained phloem ingestion, not by phloem location. Cluster analysis of the feeding and honeydew data split the 12 rice varieties into three groups: susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant. The screening methods that we have described uncover novel aspects of the resistance mechanism (or mechanisms) of rice to BPH and will in combination with molecular approaches allow identification and development of new control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2052496074,"Down syndrome (DS) is a developmental disorder associated with mental retardation (MR) and early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). These CNS phenotypes are attributed to ongoing neuronal degeneration due to constitutive overexpression of chromosome 21 (HSA21) genes. We have previously shown that HSA21 associated S100B contributes to oxidative stress and apoptosis in DS human neural progenitors (HNPs). Here we show that DS HNPs isolated from fetal frontal cortex demonstrate not only disturbances in redox states within the mitochondria and increased levels of progenitor cell death but also transition to more gliocentric progenitor phenotypes with a consequent reduction in neuronogenesis. HSA21 associated S100B and amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels are simultaneously increased within DS HNPs, their secretions are synergistically enhanced in a paracrine fashion, and overexpressions of these proteins disrupt mitochondrial membrane potentials and redox states. HNPs show greater susceptibility to these proteins as compared to neurons, leading to cell death. Ongoing inflammation through APP and S100B overexpression further promotes a gliocentric HNPs phenotype. Thus, the loss in neuronal numbers seen in DS is not merely due to increased HNPs cell death and neurodegeneration, but also a fundamental gliocentric shift in the progenitor pool that impairs neuronal production."

However, the optimal experimental parameters for MBD-seq remain unclear and the data analysis remains challenging. In this study, we generated high depth MBD-seq data in MCF-7 cell and developed a bi-asymmetric-Laplace model (BALM) to perform data analysis. We found that optimal efficiency of MBD-seq experiments was achieved by sequencing ∼100 million unique mapped tags from a combination of 500 mM and 1000 mM salt concentration elution in MCF-7 cells. Clonal bisulfite sequencing results showed that the methylation status of each CpG dinucleotides in the tested regions was accurately detected with high resolution using the proposed model.

https://openalex.org/W1983641013,"The Dicer ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzymes process long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that direct RNA interference. Here, we describe the structure and activity of a catalytically active fragment of Kluyveromyces polysporus Dcr1, which represents the noncanonical Dicers found in budding yeasts. The crystal structure revealed a homodimer resembling that of bacterial RNase III but extended by a unique N-terminal domain, and it identified additional catalytic residues conserved throughout eukaryotic RNase III enzymes. Biochemical analyses showed that Dcr1 dimers bind cooperatively along the dsRNA substrate such that the distance between consecutive active sites determines the length of the siRNA products. Thus, unlike canonical Dicers, which successively remove siRNA duplexes from the dsRNA termini, budding-yeast Dicers initiate processing in the interior and work outward. The distinct mechanism of budding-yeast Dicers establishes a paradigm for natural molecular rulers and imparts substrate preferences with ramifications for biological function."
https://openalex.org/W1969661970,"Forkhead Box M1 (Foxm1) is a transcription factor essential for organ morphogenesis and development of various cancers. Although complete deletion of Foxm1 in Foxm1−/− mice caused embryonic lethality due to severe abnormalities in multiple organ systems, requirements for Foxm1 in cardiomyocytes remain to be determined. This study was designed to elucidate the cardiomyocyte-autonomous role of Foxm1 signaling in heart development. We generated a new mouse model in which Foxm1 was specifically deleted from cardiomyocytes (Nkx2.5-Cre/Foxm1fl/f mice). Deletion of Foxm1 from cardiomyocytes was sufficient to disrupt heart morphogenesis and induce embryonic lethality in late gestation. Nkx2.5-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl hearts were dilated with thinning of the ventricular walls and interventricular septum, as well as disorganization of the myocardium which culminated in cardiac fibrosis and decreased capillary density. Cardiomyocyte proliferation was diminished in Nkx2.5-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl hearts owing to altered expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory genes, such as Cdc25B, Cyclin B1, Plk-1, nMyc and p21cip1. In addition, Foxm1 deficient hearts displayed reduced expression of CaMKIIδ, Hey2 and myocardin, which are critical mediators of cardiac function and myocardial growth. Our results indicate that Foxm1 expression in cardiomyocytes is critical for proper heart development and required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardial growth."
https://openalex.org/W2045753365,"Background Due to its complex, dynamic and well-known paleogeography, the Mediterranean region provides an ideal framework to study the colonization history of plant lineages. The genus Linaria has its diversity centre in the Mediterranean region, both in Europe and Africa. The last land connection between both continental plates occurred during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, in the late Miocene (5.96 to 5.33 Ma). Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the colonization history of Linaria sect. Versicolores (bifid toadflaxes), which includes c. 22 species distributed across the Mediterranean, including Europe and Africa. Two cpDNA regions (rpl32-trnLUAG and trnK-matK) were sequenced from 66 samples of Linaria. We conducted phylogenetic, dating, biogeographic and phylogeographic analyses to reconstruct colonization patterns in space and time. Four major clades were found: two of them exclusively contain Iberian samples, while the other two include northern African samples together with some European samples. The bifid toadflaxes have been split in African and European clades since the late Miocene, and most lineage and speciation differentiation occurred during the Pliocene and Quaternary. We have strongly inferred four events of post-Messinian colonization following long-distance dispersal from northern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Greece. Conclusions/Significance The current distribution of Linaria sect. Versicolores lineages is explained by both ancient isolation between African and European populations and recent events of long-distance dispersal over sea barriers. This result provides new evidence for the biogeographic complexity of the Mediterranean region."
https://openalex.org/W1994477303,"Background The molecular phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) is known to comprise highly reproducible changes in gene expression involving striatal signaling genes. Here we test whether individual changes in striatal gene expression are capable of mitigating HD-related neurotoxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings We used protein-encoding and shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors to evaluate the effects of RGS2, RASD2, STEP and NNAT downregulation in HD. Of these four genes, only RGS2 and RASD2 modified mutant htt fragment toxicity in cultured rat primary striatal neurons. In both cases, disease modulation was in the opposite of the predicted direction: whereas decreased expression of RGS2 and RASD2 was associated with the HD condition, restoring expression enhanced degeneration of striatal cells. Conversely, silencing of RGS2 or RASD2 enhanced disease-related changes in gene expression and resulted in significant neuroprotection. These results indicate that RGS2 and RASD2 downregulation comprises a compensatory response that allows neurons to better tolerate huntingtin toxicity. Assessment of the possible mechanism of RGS2-mediated neuroprotection showed that RGS2 downregulation enhanced ERK activation. These results establish a novel link between the inhibition of RGS2 and neuroprotective modulation of ERK activity. Conclusions Our findings both identify RGS2 downregulation as a novel compensatory response in HD neurons and suggest that RGS2 inhibition might be considered as an innovative target for neuroprotective drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2029331795,"Sexual selection, differences in reproductive success between individuals, continues beyond acquiring a mating partner and affects ejaculate size and composition (sperm competition). Sperm and seminal fluid have very different roles in sperm competition but both components encompass production costs for the male. Theoretical models predict that males should spend ejaculate components prudently and differently for sperm and seminal fluid but empirical evidence for independent variation of sperm number and seminal fluid volume is scarce. It is also largely unknown how sperm and seminal fluid variation affect future mating rate. In bedbugs we developed a protocol to examine the role of seminal fluids in ejaculate allocation and its effect on future male mating rate. Using age-related changes in sperm and seminal fluid volume we estimated the lowest capacity at which mating activity started. We then showed that sexually active males allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid volume per mating and predicted that males would be depleted of seminal fluid but not of sperm. We tested (and confirmed) this prediction empirically. Finally, the slightly faster replenishment of seminal fluid compared to sperm did not outweigh the faster decrease during mating. Our results suggest that male mating rate can be constrained by the availability of seminal fluids. Our protocol might be applicable to a range of other organisms. We discuss the idea that economic considerations in sexual conflict research might benefit from distinguishing between costs and benefits that are ejaculate dose-dependent and those that are frequency-dependent on the mating rate per se."
https://openalex.org/W2092543853,"Neurodegeneration is an age-related disorder which is characterised by the accumulation of aggregated protein and neuronal cell death. There are many different neurodegenerative diseases which are classified according to the specific proteins involved and the regions of the brain which are affected. Despite individual differences, there are common mechanisms at the sub-cellular level leading to loss of protein homeostasis. The two central systems in protein homeostasis are the chaperone system, which promotes correct protein folding, and the cellular proteolytic system, which degrades misfolded or damaged proteins. Since these systems and their interactions are very complex, we use mathematical modelling to aid understanding of the processes involved. The model developed in this study focuses on the role of Hsp70 (IPR00103) and Hsp90 (IPR001404) chaperones in preventing both protein aggregation and cell death. Simulations were performed under three different conditions: no stress; transient stress due to an increase in reactive oxygen species; and high stress due to sustained increases in reactive oxygen species. The model predicts that protein homeostasis can be maintained during short periods of stress. However, under long periods of stress, the chaperone system becomes overwhelmed and the probability of cell death pathways being activated increases. Simulations were also run in which cell death mediated by the JNK (P45983) and p38 (Q16539) pathways was inhibited. The model predicts that inhibiting either or both of these pathways may delay cell death but does not stop the aggregation process and that eventually cells die due to aggregated protein inhibiting proteasomal function. This problem can be overcome if the sequestration of aggregated protein into inclusion bodies is enhanced. This model predicts responses to reactive oxygen species-mediated stress that are consistent with currently available experimental data. The model can be used to assess specific interventions to reduce cell death due to impaired protein homeostasis."

In particular, intra- and inter-individual variations in their use of resources has not been adequatly explored, although there is growing evidence that individual organisms can vary considerably in the way they use their habitats and resources.Using δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of serially sampled gladius (an archival tissue), we examined high resolution variations in the trophic niche of five large (>60 cm mantle length) jumbo squids (Dosidicus gigas) that were collected off the coast of Peru. We report the first evidence of large inter-individual differences in jumbo squid foraging strategies with no systematic increase of trophic level with size. Overall, gladius δ(13)C values indicated one or several migrations through the squid's lifetime (∼8-9 months), during which δ(15)N values also fluctuated (range: 1 to 5‰). One individual showed an unexpected terminal 4.6‰ δ(15)N decrease (more than one trophic level), thus indicating a shift from higher- to lower-trophic level prey at that time. The data illustrate the high diversity of prey types and foraging histories of this species at the individual level.The isotopic signature of gladii proved to be a powerful tool to depict high resolution and ontogenic variations in individual foraging strategies of squids, thus complementing traditional information offered by stomach content analysis and stable isotopes on metabolically active tissues. The observed differences in life history strategies highlight the high degree of plasticity of the jumbo squid and its high potential to adapt to environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W1985221995,"Recent experiments in rats have shown the occurrence of a high amplitude slow brain wave in the EEG approximately 1 minute after decapitation, with a duration of 5–15 s (van Rijn et al, PLoS One 6, e16514, 2011) that was presumed to signify the death of brain neurons. We present a computational model of a single neuron and its intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, which shows the physiological mechanism for this observation. The wave is caused by membrane potential oscillations, that occur after the cessation of activity of the sodium-potassium pumps has lead to an excess of extracellular potassium. These oscillations can be described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the sodium and potassium channels, and result in a sudden change in mean membrane voltage. In combination with a high-pass filter, this sudden depolarization leads to a wave in the EEG. We discuss that this process is not necessarily irreversible."
https://openalex.org/W2007824685,"Scarring of the skin is a large unmet clinical problem that is of high patient concern and impact. Wound healing is complex and involves numerous pathways that are highly orchestrated, leaving the skin sealed, but with abnormal organization and composition of tissue components, namely collagen and proteoglycans, that are then remodeled over time. To improve healing and reduce or eliminate scarring, more rapid restoration of healthy tissue composition and organization offers a unique approach for development of new therapeutics. A synthetic collagen-binding peptidoglycan has been developed that inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-1 and 13 (MMP-1 and MMP-13) mediated collagen degradation. We investigated the synthetic peptidoglycan in a rat incisional model in which a single dose was delivered in a hyaluronic acid (HA) vehicle at the time of surgery prior to wound closure. The peptidoglycan treatment resulted in a significant reduction in scar tissue at 21 days as measured by histology and visual analysis. Improved collagen architecture of the treated wounds was demonstrated by increased tensile strength and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of collagen fibril diameters compared to untreated and HA controls. The peptidoglycan's mechanism of action includes masking existing collagen and inhibiting MMP-mediated collagen degradation while modulating collagen organization. The peptidoglycan can be synthesized at low cost with unique design control, and together with demonstrated preclinical efficacy in reducing scarring, warrants further investigation for dermal wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1978617962,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are frequently associated with amyloid deposits in most amyloid diseases, and there is evidence to support their active role in amyloid fibril formation. The purpose of this study was to obtain structural insight into GAG-protein interactions and to better elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GAGs on the amyloid aggregation process and on the related cytotoxicity. To this aim, using Fourier transform infrared and circular diochroism spectroscopy, electron microscopy and thioflavin fluorescence dye we examined the effect of heparin and other GAGs on the fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity of aggregates formed by the amyloidogenic W7FW14 apomyoglobin mutant. Although this protein is unrelated to human disease, it is a suitable model for in vitro studies because it forms amyloid-like fibrils under physiological conditions of pH and temperature. Heparin strongly stimulated aggregation into amyloid fibrils, thereby abolishing the lag-phase normally detected following the kinetics of the process, and increasing the yield of fibrils. Moreover, the protein aggregates were harmless when assayed for cytotoxicity in vitro. Neutral or positive compounds did not affect the aggregation rate, and the early aggregates were highly cytotoxic. The surprising result that heparin induced amyloid fibril formation in wild-type apomyoglobin and in the partially folded intermediate state of the mutant, i.e., proteins that normally do not show any tendency to aggregate, suggested that the interaction of heparin with apomyoglobin is highly specific because of the presence, in protein turn regions, of consensus sequences consisting of alternating basic and non-basic residues that are capable of binding heparin molecules. Our data suggest that GAGs play a dual role in amyloidosis, namely, they promote beneficial fibril formation, but they also function as pathological chaperones by inducing amyloid aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2029417336,"Knowledge of the normal formation of the heart is crucial for the understanding of cardiac pathologies and congenital malformations. The understanding of early cardiac development, however, is complicated because it is inseparably associated with other developmental processes such as embryonic folding, formation of the coelomic cavity, and vascular development. Because of this, it is necessary to integrate morphological and experimental analyses. Morphological insights, however, are limited by the difficulty in communication of complex 3D-processes. Most controversies, in consequence, result from differences in interpretation, rather than observation. An example of such a continuing debate is the development of the pulmonary vein and the systemic venous sinus, or “sinus venosus”. To facilitate understanding, we present a 3D study of the developing venous pole in the chicken embryo, showing our results in a novel interactive fashion, which permits the reader to form an independent opinion. We clarify how the pulmonary vein separates from a greater vascular plexus within the splanchnic mesoderm. The systemic venous sinus, in contrast, develops at the junction between the splanchnic and somatic mesoderm. We discuss our model with respect to normal formation of the heart, congenital cardiac malformations, and the phylogeny of the venous tributaries."
https://openalex.org/W2091457004,"In animals, body-fluid osmolality is continuously monitored to keep it within a narrow range around a set point (∼300 mOsm/kg). Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a cation channel, has been implicated in body-fluid homeostasis in vivo based on studies with the TRPV1-knockout mouse. However, the response of TRPV1 to hypertonic stimuli has not been demonstrated with heterologous expression systems so far, despite intense efforts by several groups. Thus, the molecular entity of the hypertonic sensor in vivo still remains controversial. Here we found that the full-length form of TRPV1 is sensitive to an osmotic increase exclusively at around body temperature using HEK293 cells stably expressing rat TRPV1. At an ambient temperature of 24°C, a slight increase in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was rarely observed in response to hypertonic stimuli. However, the magnitude of the osmosensitive response markedly increased with temperature, peaking at around 36°C. Importantly, the response at 36°C showed a robust increase over a hypertonic range, but a small decrease over a hypotonic range. A TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine, and a nonspecific TRP channel inhibitor, ruthenium red, completely blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i. These results endorse the view that the full-length form of TRPV1 is able to function as a sensor of hypertonic stimuli in vivo. Furthermore, we found that protons and capsaicin likewise synergistically potentiated the response of TRPV1 to hypertonic stimuli. Of note, HgCl2, which blocks aquaporins and inhibits cell-volume changes, significantly reduced the osmosensitive response. Our findings thus indicate that TRPV1 integrates multiple different types of activating stimuli, and that TRPV1 is sensitive to hypertonic stimuli under physiologically relevant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2065966257,"Tetrapod fossil tracks are known from the Middle Devonian (Eifelian at ca. 397 million years ago - MYA), and their earliest bony remains from the Upper Devonian (Frasnian at 375–385 MYA). Tetrapods are now generally considered to have colonized land during the Carboniferous (i.e., after 359 MYA), which is considered to be one of the major events in the history of life. Our analysis on tetrapod evolution was performed using molecular data consisting of 13 proteins from 17 species and different paleontological data. The analysis on the molecular data was performed with the program TreeSAAP and the results were analyzed to see if they had implications on the paleontological data collected. The results have shown that tetrapods evolved from marine environments during times of higher oxygen levels. The change in environmental conditions played a major role in their evolution. According to our analysis this evolution occurred at about 397–416 MYA during the Early Devonian unlike previously thought. This idea is supported by various environmental factors such as sea levels and oxygen rate, and biotic factors such as biodiversity of arthropods and coral reefs. The molecular data also strongly supports lungfish as tetrapod's closest living relative."
https://openalex.org/W2135785283,"Neurons and astrocytes are generated from common neural precursors, yet neurogenesis precedes astrocyte formation during embryogenesis. The mechanisms of neural development underlying suppression and de-suppression of differentiation-related genes for cell fate specifications are not well understood.By using an in vitro system in which NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage, we revealed a novel role for Sin3A in maintaining the suppression of GFAP in NTera-2 cells. Sin3A coupled with MeCP2 bound to the GFAP promoter and their occupancies were correlated with repression of GFAP transcription. The repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. Upon commitment toward an astrocyte-like lineage, Sin3A- MeCP2 departed from the promoter and activated STAT3 simultaneously bound to the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP; meanwhile, olig2 was exported from nuclei to the cytoplasm. This suggested that a three-dimensional or higher-order structure was provoked by STAT3 binding between the promoter and proximal coding regions. STAT3 then recruited CBP/p300 to exon 1 and targeted the promoter for histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. The CBP/p300-mediated histone modification further facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to activate GFAP gene transcription.These results provide evidence that exchange of repressor and activator complexes and epigenetic modifications are critical strategies for cellular differentiation and lineage-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2161654126,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is responsible for a wide range of clinical symptoms. How this bacterium adapts itself to ever-changing host milieu is still a mystery. Recently, small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have received considerable attention for their functions in fine-tuning gene expression at a post-transcriptional level to promote bacterial adaptation. Here we demonstrate that Hfq, an RNA-binding protein, which facilitates interactions between sRNAs and their mRNA targets, is critical for K. pneumoniae virulence. A K. pneumoniae mutant lacking hfq (Δhfq) failed to disseminate into extra-intestinal organs and was attenuated on induction of a systemic infection in a mouse model. The absence of Hfq was associated with alteration in composition of envelope proteins, increased production of capsular polysaccharides, and decreased resistance to H2O2, heat shock, and UV irradiation. Microarray-based transcriptome analyses revealed that 897 genes involved in numerous cellular processes were deregulated in the Δhfq strain. Interestingly, Hfq appeared to govern expression of many genes indirectly by affecting sigma factor RpoS and RpoE, since 19.5% (175/897) and 17.3% (155/897) of Hfq-dependent genes belong to the RpoE- and RpoS-regulon, respectively. These results indicate that Hfq regulates global gene expression at multiple levels to modulate the physiological fitness and virulence potential of K. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2032928756,"Salmonella enterica uses effector proteins translocated by a Type III Secretion System to invade epithelial cells. One of the invasion-associated effectors, SopB, is an inositol phosphatase that mediates sustained activation of the pro-survival kinase Akt in infected cells. Canonical activation of Akt involves membrane translocation and phosphorylation and is dependent on phosphatidyl inositide 3 kinase (PI3K). Here we have investigated these two distinct processes in Salmonella infected HeLa cells. Firstly, we found that SopB-dependent membrane translocation and phosphorylation of Akt are insensitive to the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Similarly, depletion of the PI3K regulatory subunits p85α and p85ß by RNAi had no inhibitory effect on SopB-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Nevertheless, SopB-dependent phosphorylation does depend on the Akt kinases, PDK1 and rictor-mTOR. Membrane translocation assays revealed a dependence on SopB for Akt recruitment to Salmonella ruffles and suggest that this is mediated by phosphoinositide (3,4) P2 rather than phosphoinositide (3,4,5) P3. Altogether these data demonstrate that Salmonella activates Akt via a wortmannin insensitive mechanism that is likely a class I PI3K-independent process that incorporates some essential elements of the canonical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2060006845,"Virotherapy using oncolytic vaccinia virus strains is one of the most promising new strategies for cancer therapy. In this study, we analyzed for the first time the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 in two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HuH7 and PLC/PRF/5 (PLC) in cell culture and in tumor xenograft models. By viral proliferation assays and cell survival tests, we demonstrated that GLV-1h68 efficiently colonized, replicated in, and did lyse these cancer cells in culture. Experiments with HuH7 and PLC xenografts have revealed that a single intravenous injection (i.v.) of mice with GLV-1h68 resulted in a significant reduction of primary tumor sizes compared to uninjected controls. In addition, replication of GLV-1h68 in tumor cells led to strong inflammatory and oncolytic effects resulting in intense infiltration of MHC class II-positive cells like neutrophils, macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells and in up-regulation of 13 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, GLV-1h68 infection of PLC tumors inhibited the formation of hemorrhagic structures which occur naturally in PLC tumors. Interestingly, we found a strongly reduced vascular density in infected PLC tumors only, but not in the non-hemorrhagic HuH7 tumor model. These data demonstrate that the GLV-1h68 vaccinia virus may have an enormous potential for treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma in man."
https://openalex.org/W2069733880,"Phosphatase and TENsin (PTEN) homolog is a negative regulator that takes part in IIS (insulin/insulin-like signaling) and Egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor) activation in Drosophila melanogaster. IIS and Egfr signaling events are also involved in the developmental process of queen and worker differentiation in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Here, we characterized the bee PTEN gene homologue for the first time and begin to explore its potential function during bee development and adult life.Honey bee PTEN is alternatively spliced, resulting in three splice variants. Next, we show that the expression of PTEN can be down-regulated by RNA interference (RNAi) in the larval stage, when female caste fate is determined. Relative to controls, we observed that RNAi efficacy is dependent on the amount of PTEN dsRNA that is delivered to larvae. For larvae fed queen or worker diets containing a high amount of PTEN dsRNA, PTEN knockdown was significant at a whole-body level but lethal. A lower dosage did not result in a significant gene down-regulation. Finally, we compared same-aged adult workers with different behavior: nursing vs. foraging. We show that between nurses and foragers, PTEN isoforms were differentially expressed within brain, ovary and fat body tissues. All isoforms were expressed at higher levels in the brain and ovaries of the foragers. In fat body, isoform B was expressed at higher level in the nurse bees.Our results suggest that PTEN plays a central role during growth and development in queen- and worker-destined honey bees. In adult workers, moreover, tissue-specific patterns of PTEN isoform expression are correlated with differences in complex division of labor between same-aged individuals. Therefore, we propose that knowledge on the roles of IIS and Egfr activity in developmental and behavioral control may increase through studies of how PTEN functions can impact bee social phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2139199048,"Dcc is the key receptor that mediates attractive responses of axonal growth cones to netrins, a family of axon guidance cues used throughout evolution. However, a Dcc homolog has not yet been identified in the chicken genome, raising the possibility that Dcc is not present in avians. Here we show that the closely related family member neogenin may functionally substitute for Dcc in the developing chicken spinal cord. The expression pattern of chicken neogenin in the developing spinal cord is a composite of the distribution patterns of both rodent Dcc and neogenin. Moreover, whereas the loss of mouse neogenin has no effect on the trajectory of commissural axons, removing chicken neogenin by RNA interference results in a phenotype similar to the functional inactivation of Dcc in mouse. Taken together, these data suggest that the chick neogenin is functionally equivalent to rodent Dcc."
https://openalex.org/W2117883007,"Atelopus franciscus is a diurnal bufonid frog that lives in South-American tropical rain forests. As in many other frogs, males produce calls to defend their territories and attract females. However, this species is a so-called ""earless"" frog lacking an external tympanum and is thus anatomically deaf. Moreover, A. franciscus has no external vocal sac and lives in a sound constraining environment along river banks where it competes with other calling frogs. Despite these constraints, male A. franciscus reply acoustically to the calls of conspecifics in the field. To resolve this apparent paradox, we studied the vocal apparatus and middle-ear, analysed signal content of the calls, examined sound and signal content propagation in its natural habitat, and performed playback experiments. We show that A. franciscus males can produce only low intensity calls that propagate a short distance (<8 m) as a result of the lack of an external vocal sac. The species-specific coding of the signal is based on the pulse duration, providing a simple coding that is efficient as it allows discrimination from calls of sympatric frogs. Moreover, the signal is redundant and consequently adapted to noisy environments. As such a coding system can be efficient only at short-range, territory holders established themselves at short distances from each other. Finally, we show that the middle-ear of A. franciscus does not present any particular adaptations to compensate for the lack of an external tympanum, suggesting the existence of extra-tympanic pathways for sound propagation."
https://openalex.org/W1966725123,"Previous work by several laboratories has established that translation of picornavirus RNA requires active eIF2α for translation in cell free systems or after transfection in culture cells. Strikingly, we have found that encephalomyocarditis virus protein synthesis at late infection times is resistant to inhibitors that induce the phosphorylation of eIF2α whereas translation of encephalomyocarditis virus early during infection is blocked upon inactivation of eIF2α by phosphorylation induced by arsenite. The presence of this compound during the first hour of infection leads to a delay in the appearance of late protein synthesis in encephalomyocarditis virus-infected cells. Depletion of eIF2α also provokes a delay in the kinetics of encephalomyocarditis virus protein synthesis, whereas at late times the levels of viral translation are similar in control or eIF2α-depleted HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that eIF2α, contrary to eIF4GI, does not colocalize with ribosomes or with encephalomyocarditis virus 3D polymerase. Taken together, these findings support the novel idea that eIF2 is not involved in the translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA during late infection. Moreover, other picornaviruses such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, mengovirus and poliovirus do not require active eIF2α when maximal viral translation is taking place. Therefore, translation of picornavirus RNA may exhibit a dual mechanism as regards the participation of eIF2. This factor would be necessary to translate the input genomic RNA, but after viral RNA replication, the mechanism of viral RNA translation switches to one independent of eIF2."
https://openalex.org/W1967903072,"In recent decades, astrocytes have emerged as key pieces in the maintenance of normal functioning of the central nervous system. Any impairment in astroglial function can ultimately lead to generalized disturbance in the brain, thus pharmacological targets associated with prevention of astrocyte death are actually promising. Subtype 3 of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3) is present in astrocytes, its activation exerting neuroprotective roles. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that mGluR3 selective agonists prevent nitric oxide (NO)-induced astrocyte death. However, mechanisms responsible for that cytoprotective property are still subject to study. Although inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by mGluR3 activation was extensively reported, the involvement of reduced cAMP levels in the effects of mGluR3 agonists and the association between cAMP decrease and the downstream pathways activated by mGluR3 remain neglected. Thus, we studied intracellular signaling mediating anti-apoptotic actions of mGluR3 in cultured rat astrocytes exposed to NO. In the present work, we showed that the cytoprotective effect of mGluR3 agonists (LY379268 and LY404039) requires both the reduction of intracellular cAMP levels and activation of Akt, as assessed by MTT and TUNEL techniques. Moreover, dibutyryl-cAMP impairs Akt phosphorylation induced by LY404039, indicating a relationship between mGluR3-reduced cAMP levels and PI3K/Akt pathway activation. We also demonstrated, by co-immunoprecipitation followed by western-blot, that the mGluR3 agonists not only induce per se survival-linked interaction between members of the NF-κB family p65 and c-Rel, but also impede reduction of levels of p65-c-Rel dimers caused by NO, suggesting a possible anti-apoptotic role for p65-c-Rel. All together, these data suggest that mGluR3 agonists may regulate cAMP/Akt/p65-c-Rel pathway, which would contribute to the protective effect of mGluR3 against NO challenge in astrocytes. Our results widen the knowledge about mechanisms of action of mGluR3, potential targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders where a pathophysiological role for NO has been established."
https://openalex.org/W2112074130,"Background Migraine is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both migraine and CVD are highly heritable. However, the genetic liability for CVD among migraineurs is unclear. Methods We performed a genome-wide association study for incident CVD events during 12 years of follow-up among 5,122 migraineurs participating in the population-based Women's Genome Health Study. Migraine was self-reported and CVD events were confirmed after medical records review. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and considered a genome-wide p-value <5×10−8 as significant. Results Among the 5,122 women with migraine 164 incident CVD events occurred during follow-up. No SNP was associated with major CVD, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or CVD death at the genome-wide level; however, five SNPs showed association with p<5×10−6. Among migraineurs with aura rs7698623 in MEPE (OR = 6.37; 95% CI 3.15–12.90; p = 2.7×10−7) and rs4975709 in IRX4 (OR = 5.06; 95% CI 2.66–9.62; p = 7.7×10−7) appeared to be associated with ischemic stroke, rs2143678 located close to MDF1 with major CVD (OR = 3.05; 95% CI 1.98–4.69; p = 4.3×10−7), and the intergenic rs1406961 with CVD death (OR = 12.33; 95% CI 4.62–32.87; p = 5.2×10−7). Further, rs1047964 in BACE1 appeared to be associated with CVD death among women with any migraine (OR = 4.67; 95% CI 2.53–8.62; p = 8.0×10−7). Conclusion Our results provide some suggestion for an association of five SNPs with CVD events among women with migraine; none of the results was genome-wide significant. Four associations appeared among migraineurs with aura, two of those with ischemic stroke. Although our population is among the largest with migraine and incident CVD information, these results must be treated with caution, given the limited number of CVD events among women with migraine and the low minor allele frequencies for three of the SNPs. Our results await independent replication and should be considered hypothesis generating for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2080710384,"Systemic administration of the noncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801, has been proposed to model cognitive deficits similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. The present work investigated the ability of a dopamine-binding DNA aptamer to regulate these MK-801-induced cognitive deficits when injected into the nucleus accumbens. Rats were trained to bar press for chocolate pellet rewards then randomly assigned to receive an intra-accumbens injection of a DNA aptamer (200 nM; n = 7), tris buffer (n = 6) or a randomized DNA oligonucleotide (n = 7). Animals were then treated systemically with MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) and tested for their ability to extinguish their bar pressing response. Two control groups were also included that did not receive MK-801. Data revealed that injection of Tris buffer or the random oligonucleotide sequence into the nucleus accumbens prior to treatment with MK-801 did not reduce the MK-801-induced extinction deficit. Animals continued to press at a high rate over the entire course of the extinction session. Injection of the dopamine aptamer reversed this MK-801-induced elevation in lever pressing to levels as seen in rats not treated with MK-801. Tests for activity showed that the aptamer did not impair locomotor activity. Results demonstrate the in vivo utility of DNA aptamers as tools to investigate neurobiological processes in preclinical animal models of mental health disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970049209,"Networks coming from protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, signaling, or metabolism may appear to have “unusual” properties. To quantify this, it is appropriate to randomize the network and test the hypothesis that the network is not statistically different from expected in a motivated ensemble. However, when dealing with metabolic networks, the randomization of the network using edge exchange generates fictitious reactions that are biochemically meaningless. Here we provide several natural ensembles of randomized metabolic networks. A first constraint is to use valid biochemical reactions. Further constraints correspond to imposing appropriate functional constraints. We explain how to perform these randomizations with the help of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and show that they allow one to approach the properties of biological metabolic networks. The implication of the present work is that the observed global structural properties of real metabolic networks are likely to be the consequence of simple biochemical and functional constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2048732556,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) are a novel form of cancer immunotherapy. While preclinical studies in mouse tumor models have shown anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CTLA4 injection or expression, anti-CTLA4 treatment in patients with advanced cancers had disappointing therapeutic benefit. These discrepancies have to be addressed in more adequate pre-clinical models. We employed two tumor models. The first model is based on C57Bl/6 mice and syngeneic TC-1 tumors expressing HPV16 E6/E7. In this model, the HPV antigens are neo-antigens, against which no central tolerance exists. The second model involves mice transgenic for the proto-oncogen neu and syngeneic mouse mammary carcinoma (MMC) cells. In this model tolerance to Neu involves both central and peripheral mechanisms. Anti-CTLA4 delivery as a protein or expression from gene-modified tumor cells were therapeutically efficacious in the non-tolerized TC-1 tumor model, but had no effect in the MMC-model. We also used the two tumor models to test an immuno-gene therapy approach for anti-CTLA4. Recently, we used an approach based on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to deliver the relaxin gene to tumors and showed that this approach facilitates pre-existing anti-tumor T-cells to control tumor growth in the MMC tumor model. However, unexpectedly, when used for anti-CTLA4 gene delivery in this study, the HSC-based approach was therapeutically detrimental in both the TC-1 and MMC models. Anti-CTLA4 expression in these models resulted in an increase in the number of intratumoral CD1d+ NKT cells and in the expression of TGF-β1. At the same time, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which potentially can support anti-tumor T-cell responses, were lower in tumors of mice that received anti-CTLA4-HSC therapy. The differences in outcomes between the tolerized and non-tolerized models also provide a potential explanation for the low efficacy of CTLA4 blockage approaches in cancer immunotherapy trials."
https://openalex.org/W1972967010,"Males of plants with separate sexes are often more prone to attack by herbivores than females. A common explanation for this pattern is that individuals with a greater male function suffer more from herbivory because they grow more quickly, drawing more heavily on resources for growth that might otherwise be allocated to defence. Here, we test this ‘faster-sex’ hypothesis in a species in which males in fact grow more slowly than hermaphrodites, the wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua. We expected greater herbivory in the faster-growing hermaphrodites. In contrast, we found that males, the slower sex, were significantly more heavily eaten by snails than hermaphrodites. Our results thus reject the faster-sex hypothesis and point to the importance of a trade-off between defence and reproduction rather than growth."
https://openalex.org/W2069994876,"Background The transcription factor Tcfap2c has been demonstrated to be essential for various processes during mammalian development. It has been found to be upregulated in various undifferentiated tumors and is implicated with poor prognosis. Tcfap2c is reported to impinge on cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, the physiological consequences of Tcfap2c-expression remain largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Therefore we established a gain of function model to analyze the role of Tcfap2c in development and disease. Induction of the transgene led to robust expression in all tissues (except brain and testis) and lead to rapid mortality within 3–7 days. In the liver cellular proliferation and apoptosis was detected. Accumulation of microvesicular lipid droplets and breakdown of major hepatic metabolism pathways resulted in steatosis. Serum analysis showed a dramatic increase of enzymes indicative for hepatic failure. After induction of Tcfap2c we identified a set of 447 common genes, which are deregulated in both liver and primary hepatocyte culture. Further analysis showed a prominent repression of the cytochrome p450 system, PPARA, Lipin1 and Lipin2. These data indicate that in the liver Tcfap2c represses pathways, which are responsible for fatty acid metabolism. In the intestine, Tcfap2c expression resulted in expansion of Sox9 positive and proliferative active epithelial progenitor cells resulting in dysplastic growth of mucosal crypt cells and loss of differentiated mucosa. Conclusions The transgenic mice show that ectopic expression of Tcfap2c is not tolerated. Due to the phenotype observed, iTcfap2c-mice represent a model system to study liver failure. In intestine, Tcfap2c induced cellular hyperplasia and suppressed terminal differentiation indicating that Tcfap2c serves as a repressor of differentiation and inducer of proliferation. This might be achieved by the Tcfap2c mediated activation of Sox9 known to be expressed in intestinal and hepatic stem/progenitor cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2012402075,"Background T cell development results in the generation of both mature αβ and γδ T cells. While αβ T cells predominate in secondary lymphoid organs, γδ T cells are more abundant in mucosal tissues. PU.1, an Ets family transcription factor, also identified as the spleen focus forming virus proviral integration site-1 (Sfpi1) is essential for early stages of T cell development, but is down regulated during the DN T-cell stage. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we show that in mice specifically lacking PU.1 in T cells using an lck-Cre transgene with a conditional Sfpi1 allele (Sfpi1lck−/−) there are increased numbers of γδ T cells in spleen, thymus and in the intestine when compared to wild-type mice. The increase in γδ T cell numbers in PU.1-deficient mice is consistent in γδ T cell subsets identified by TCR variable regions. PU.1-deficient γδ T cells demonstrate greater proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions/Significance The increase of γδ T cell numbers in Lck-Cre deleter strains, where deletion occurs after PU.1 expression is diminished, as well as the observation that PU.1-deficient γδ T cells have greater proliferative responses than wild type cells, suggests that PU.1 effects are not developmental but rather at the level of homeostasis. Thus, our data shows that PU.1 has a negative influence on γδ T cell expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2072894576,"Background The key epidemiological difference between pandemic and seasonal influenza is that the population is largely susceptible during a pandemic, whereas, during non-pandemic seasons a level of immunity exists. The population-level efficacy of household-based mitigation strategies depends on the proportion of infections that occur within households. In general, mitigation measures such as isolation and quarantine are more effective at the population level if the proportion of household transmission is low. Methods/Results We calculated the proportion of infections within households during pandemic years compared with non-pandemic years using a deterministic model of household transmission in which all combinations of household size and individual infection states were enumerated explicitly. We found that the proportion of infections that occur within households was only partially influenced by the hazard h of infection within household relative to the hazard of infection outside the household, especially for small basic reproductive numbers. During pandemics, the number of within-household infections was lower than one might expect for a given because many of the susceptible individuals were infected from the community and the number of susceptible individuals within household was thus depleted rapidly. In addition, we found that for the value of at which 30% of infections occur within households during non-pandemic years, a similar 31% of infections occur within households during pandemic years. Interpretation We suggest that a trade off between the community force of infection and the number of susceptible individuals in a household explains an apparent invariance in the proportion of infections that occur in households in our model. During a pandemic, although there are more susceptible individuals in a household, the community force of infection is very high. However, during non-pandemic years, the force of infection is much lower but there are fewer susceptible individuals within the household."

Here, we performed a single-molecule polarization modulation to probe the rotation of the helical protrusion of a chaperonin from a hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1. We detected approximately 35° rotation of the helical protrusion immediately after photorelease of ATP. The result suggests that the conformational change from the open lid to the closed lid state is responsible for the approximately 35° rotation of the helical protrusion."

Many factors regulate ADAMTS13-dependent VWF proteolysis through their interaction with VWF. These include coagulation factor VIII, platelet glycoprotein 1bα, and heparin sulfate, which accelerate the cleavage of VWF. Conversely, thrombospondin-1 decreases the rate of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 by competing with ADAMTS13 for the A3 domain of VWF. To investigate whether murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human VWF affect the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 in vitro, eight mAbs to different domains of human VWF were used to evaluate the effects on VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 under fluid shear stress and static/denaturing conditions. Additionally, the epitope of anti-VWF mAb (SZ34) was mapped using recombinant proteins in combination with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The results indicate that mAb SZ34 inhibited proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 in a concentration-dependent manner under fluid shear stress, but not under static/denaturing conditions. The binding epitope of SZ34 mAb is located between A1555 and G1595 in the central A2 domain of VWF. These data show that an anti-VWF mAb against the VWF-A2 domain (A1555-G1595) reduces the proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 under shear stress, suggesting the role of this region in interaction with ADAMTS13."
