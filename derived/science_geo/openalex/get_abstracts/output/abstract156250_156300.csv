Disordered composites made from such localized resonant structures behave as a material with effective negative elastic constants and a total wave reflector within certain tunable sonic frequency ranges. A 2-centimeter slab of this composite material is shown to break the conventional mass-density law of sound transmission by one or more orders of magnitude at 400 hertz."

To facilitate subsequent studies of protein function, we have developed miniaturized assays that accommodate extremely low sample volumes and enable the rapid, simultaneous processing of thousands of proteins. A high-precision robot designed to manufacture complementary DNA microarrays was used to spot proteins onto chemically derivatized glass slides at extremely high spatial densities. The proteins attached covalently to the slide surface yet retained their ability to interact specifically with other proteins, or with small molecules, in solution. Three applications for protein microarrays were demonstrated: screening for protein-protein interactions, identifying the substrates of protein kinases, and identifying the protein targets of small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2144311540,"Freeze and breakup dates of ice on lakes and rivers provide consistent evidence of later freezing and earlier breakup around the Northern Hemisphere from 1846 to 1995. Over these 150 years, changes in freeze dates averaged 5.8 days per 100 years later, and changes in breakup dates averaged 6.5 days per 100 years earlier; these translate to increasing air temperatures of about 1.2 degrees C per 100 years. Interannual variability in both freeze and breakup dates has increased since 1950. A few longer time series reveal reduced ice cover (a warming trend) beginning as early as the 16th century, with increasing rates of change after about 1850."
https://openalex.org/W1997626537,"Magnesium/calcium data from planktonic foraminifera in equatorial Pacific sediment cores demonstrate that tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were 2.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C colder than the present at the last glacial maximum. Glacial-interglacial temperature differences as great as 5 degrees C are observed over the last 450 thousand years. Changes in SST coincide with changes in Antarctic air temperature and precede changes in continental ice volume by about 3 thousand years, suggesting that tropical cooling played a major role in driving ice-age climate. Comparison of SST estimates from eastern and western sites indicates that the equatorial Pacific zonal SST gradient was similar or somewhat larger during glacial episodes. Extraction of a salinity proxy from the magnesium/calcium and oxygen isotope data indicates that transport of water vapor into the western Pacific was enhanced during glacial episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2137814808,"Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, has been shown to be a negative regulator of myogenesis. Here we show that myostatin functions by controlling the proliferation of muscle precursor cells. When C(2)C(12) myoblasts were incubated with myostatin, proliferation of myoblasts decreased with increasing levels of myostatin. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that myostatin prevented the progression of myoblasts from the G(1)- to S-phase of the cell cycle. Western analysis indicated that myostatin specifically up-regulated p21(Waf1, Cip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and decreased the levels and activity of Cdk2 protein in myoblasts. Furthermore, we also observed that in myoblasts treated with myostatin protein, Rb was predominately present in the hypophosphorylated form. These results suggests that, in response to myostatin signaling, there is an increase in p21 expression and a decrease in Cdk2 protein and activity thus resulting in an accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb protein. This, in turn, leads to the arrest of myoblasts in G(1)-phase of cell cycle. Thus, we propose that the generalized muscular hyperplasia phenotype observed in animals that lack functional myostatin could be as a result of deregulated myoblast proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2113964043,"During animal development, cells become progressively more restricted in the cell types to which they can give rise. In the central nervous system (CNS), for example, multipotential stem cells produce various kinds of specified precursors that divide a limited number of times before they terminally differentiate into either neurons or glial cells. We show here that certain extracellular signals can induce oligodendrocyte precursor cells to revert to multipotential neural stem cells, which can self-renew and give rise to neurons and astrocytes, as well as to oligodendrocytes. Thus, these precursor cells have greater developmental potential than previously thought."

In fact, in comparison to other collagen-rich tissues, articular cartilage contains relatively high amounts of the AGE pentosidine. To test the hypothesis that this higher AGE accumulation is primarily the result of the slow turnover of cartilage collagen, AGE levels in cartilage and skin collagen were compared with the degree of racemization of aspartic acid (% d-Asp, a measure of the residence time of a protein). AGE (N ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine,N ε-(carboxyethyl)lysine, and pentosidine) and % d-Asp concentrations increased linearly with age in both cartilage and skin collagen (p < 0.0001). The rate of increase in AGEs was greater in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (p < 0.0001). % d-Asp was also higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (p< 0.0001), indicating that cartilage collagen has a longer residence time in the tissue, and thus a slower turnover, than skin collagen. In both types of collagen, AGE concentrations increased linearly with % d-Asp (p < 0.0005). Interestingly, the slopes of the curves of AGEs versus% d-Asp, i.e. the rates of accumulation of AGEs corrected for turnover, were identical for cartilage and skin collagen. The present study thus provides the first experimental evidence that protein turnover is a major determinant in AGE accumulation in different collagen types. From the age-related increases in % d-Asp the half-life of cartilage collagen was calculated to be 117 years and that of skin collagen 15 years, thereby providing the first reasonable estimates of the half-lives of these collagens.

Indeed, in comparison to other collagen-rich tissues (such as skin), articular cartilage contains relatively high amounts of pentosidine (3Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Amino acids are incorporated into peptides and proteins as thel-enantiomers. During aging, racemization slowly converts the l-form into a racemic mixture of d- andl-forms. Aspartic acid is one of the fastest racemizing amino acids (15Helfman P.M. Bada J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16Masters P.M. Bada J.L. Zigler J.S.J. Nature. 1977; 268: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), so that d-aspartic acid can be detected in proteins that turn over slowly. There is a close relationship between chronological age and d-aspartic acid accumulation in the white matter of the brain (17Man E.H. Sandhouse M.E. Burg J. Fisher G.H. Science. 1983; 220: 1407-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the eye lens (16Masters P.M. Bada J.L. Zigler J.S.J.

Forensic Sci. 1998; 43: 949-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies have shown the age-related accumulation of d-aspartic acid in cartilagenous tissues such as the intervertebral disc (21Ritz S. Schutz H.W. J. Forensic Sci. 1993; 38: 633-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rib cartilage (22Pfeiffer H. Mornstad H. Teivens A. Int. J. Leg.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Measurement of aspartic acid racemization has proven to be a valuable tool to derive quantitative information on protein residence time, i.e.protein turnover (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect.

Differences in the rate of accumulation of these AGEs were then corrected for differences in residence times of these collagens in the tissue, estimated from the degree of racemization of aspartic acid. The results indicate that differences in levels of AGEs in cartilage and skin collagens may be almost solely attributed to differences in the rate of turnover of these proteins.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the present study, AGE levels in cartilage and skin collagen were compared with the degree of racemization of aspartic acid, a measure of the residence time of a protein (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Helfman P.M. Bada J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Borel O. Grimaud L. Delmas P.D. Garnero P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), to provide quantitative data on the relationship between turnover rates and AGE accumulation.AGE Levels in Human Cartilage Collagen and Skin CollagenAfter maturity has been reached (>18 years), CML levels increase linearly with age in both human articular cartilage collagen (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001; Fig. 1 A) and skin collagen (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001; Fig. 1 A). The rate of CML accumulation with age is significantly higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (ANCOVA with age as covariant; p < 0.0001). Consistent with the results for CML, the levels of CEL and pentosidine in cartilage and skin collagen also increase linearly with age (p < 0.0001 in all cases; Fig. 1, B and C), with the rate of accumulation being higher in cartilage than in skin collagen (p < 0.0001 for both; Fig. 1, B andC). Taken together, our data on three different AGEs consistently show that AGE levels in cartilage collagen increase more rapidly with age and eventually reach higher levels than in skin collagen. In the late 1980s, Sell and Monnier (3Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) already reported higher levels of pentosidine in cartilage compared with skin from elderly subjects and suggested that this difference may be due to a higher turnover of skin. Up to this time, no quantitative data on protein turnover have been related to AGE levels to substantiate this suggestion.Rate Constant of Racemization of Aspartic Acid in Cartilage and Skin CollagenUsing % d-Asp levels in cartilage and skin collagen to compare the residence time of collagen in these two tissues assumes that the intrinsic rate constant of aspartic acid racemization at body temperature is identical in both collagens. Because differences in the rate of aspartic acid racemization have been shown to exist between collagens from other sources, e.g.bone and dentin (30Ohtani S. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1998; 19: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36Ohtani S. Kato S. Sugeno H. Growth Dev. Aging. 1996; 60: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar), a comparison of these rates in cartilage and skin collagen was necessary. Therefore, the relation between the rate constant of racemization of l-Asp into d-Asp and temperature was determined for both cartilage and skin collagen in an in vitro heating experiment. The Arrhenius equations, describing the quantitative relation between the rate constant of racemization of aspartic acid (kAsp) and the reciprocal of the absolute heating temperature (1/T), are shown in Fig. 2. This relation is identical for cartilage and skin collagen (ANCOVA with 1/T as covariant;p = 0.58). The temperatures of human knee cartilage and skin are lower than 37 °C but comparable; the intra-articular temperature in the knee joint is 31.7–33.9 °C (37Horvath S.M. Hollander J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1949; 28: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Haimovici N. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 107: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar), and the mean body skin temperature is 32.6 °C (39Choi J.K. Miki K. Sagawa S. Shiraki K. Int. J. Biometeorol. 1997; 41: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Extrapolating the Arrhenius equations to 33 °C shows that the respective rate constants for aspartic acid racemization in cartilage and skin collagen in the human body are 1.78 × 10−6 and 1.71 × 10−6 per year, respectively. Consequently, the % d-Asp levels in cartilage and skin collagen can be used validly as a measure of residence time of the collagen in the tissue.Figure 2The intrinsic rate constant for racemization of aspartic acid is identical in cartilage and skin collagen.Arrhenius plot showing the identical relation between the rate constant for racemization of aspartic acid (kAsp(h)) and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1/T) for bovine cartilage ( ●) and skin (▵) collagen, determined in a heating experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.D. The Arrhenius equations for cartilage (solid line) and skin (dashed line) were ln(kAsp(h)) = −11,347 (1/T) + 14.77 and ln(kAsp(h)) = −11,472 (1/T) + 15.13), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Racemization of Aspartic Acid in Human Cartilage Collagen and Skin CollagenInasmuch as the intrinsic rate constant of aspartic acid racemization at body temperature is identical in human articular cartilage collagen and skin collagen, rates of turnover of these collagens were compared by measuring the degree of racemization of aspartic acid. In both cartilage collagen and in skin collagen, the racemization of aspartic acid (% d-Asp) increases linearly with age (r = 0.95, p < 0.0001, and r = 0.78, p < 0.0001, respectively; Fig. 3). Like the rate of AGE accumulation (Fig. 1), the rate of d-Asp accumulation is also higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (ANCOVA with age as covariant; p < 0.0001). The latter implies that cartilage collagen has a longer residence time in the tissue,i.e. a slower turnover, than skin collagen that may contribute to the observed higher AGE levels in cartilage collagen.Figure 3The % d-Asp increases linearly with chronological age in both cartilage and skin collagen but the accumulation rate is higher in cartilage collagen.Racemization of aspartic acid (% d-Asp) in human articular cartilage collagen (●) and skin collagen (▵).

The rate of AGE accumulation was higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (Fig. 1, A–C), and cartilage collagen had a longer residence time in the tissue, and thus a slower turnover, than skin collagen (Fig. 3). These results strongly suggest that turnover is an important determinant of the rate of AGE accumulation in proteins. Incubation of collagen in high glucose under aerobic conditions (40Wells Knecht M.C. Lyons T.J. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) did not induce aspartic acid racemization, 2N. Verzijl, J. DeGroot, J. M. TeKoppele, S. R. Thorpe, and J. W. Baynes, manuscript in preparation. which confirms that % d-Asp levels provide a measure of protein residence time that is independent of glycation. These results allowed us to examine the direct relation between AGE levels and % d-Asp levels in both collagen types to assess unambiguously the effect of protein turnover on the accumulation of AGEs in cartilage and skin collagen. As such, the relation between AGE and % d-Asp levels represents the rate of accumulation of AGEs normalized for the degree of racemization of aspartic acid,i.e. corrected for turnover.In both human cartilage collagen and skin collagen, CML, CEL, and pentosidine levels increase linearly with % d-Asp (all three AGEs: p < 0.0001 for all data, and see Fig. 4). The highly significant linear relations between AGE levels and % d-Asp in cartilage collagen and in skin collagen indicate that protein turnover indeed is a key factor that determines the rate of AGE accumulation. Furthermore, the relationship between AGE levels and % d-Asp is identical for cartilage collagen and skin collagen (ANCOVA with % d-Asp as covariant; p > 0.5 for all data, and see Fig. 4), which provides additional support to conclude that the rate of protein turnover is an important determinant in AGE accumulation.Figure 4The AGE accumulation rate normalized for the degree of racemization of aspartic acid, i.e.corrected for turnover, is identical for cartilage and skin collagen. A–C show the linear relation between AGE concentrations and % d-Asp for CML (A), CEL (B), and pentosidine (C) in human articular cartilage collagen (●) and skin collagen (▵). Skin samples are those described in the legend to Fig. 1. Cartilage samples are those with both AGE concentrations and % d-Asp ≤125% of the maximum skin collagen values (resulting in 12, 15, and 11 subjects in the age range 3–55 years in A–C, respectively). Linear regression analysis and ANCOVA were performed on all cartilage (solid line) and skin (dotted line) collagen data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cartilage and skin collagen samples for the age range (shown in Fig. 1 and 3) were obtained from two separate groups of donors. To confirm that within a single donor AGE levels and collagen residence time are also higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen, pentosidine and % d-Asp levels were measured in an additional set of paired samples of cartilage and skin collagen of aged donors (n = 6). Again, both the pentosidine content and % d-Asp were significantly higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen (paired Student's t test;p < 0.0001 and p < 0.005, respectively; data not shown).Calculation of Half-lives of Human Cartilage and Skin CollagenAlthough a slow turnover of collagen in articular cartilage has often been indicated (10Maroudas A. Maroudas A. Holborow E.J. Studies in Joint Disease I. Pitman Medical, London1980: 59-86Google Scholar, 11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect.

Res. 1999; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), little experimental evidence exists for such a statement. Based on aspartic acid racemization data of only three cartilage collagen samples, Maroudas et al. (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that the half-life of cartilage collagen is between 100 and 400 years. In the present study, we determined the half-life of articular cartilage collagen more accurately based on a large number of samples (n = 23) covering a broad age range (3–81 years). Based on the model described by Maroudas et al. (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it was calculated that the observed increase in % d-Asp in cartilage collagen of 0.0258 ± 0.0015% per year (mean ± S.D.; Fig. 3, ages 3–81 years) corresponds to a half-life of 117 years (95% confidence interval, 62–480 years).Since the rate constants of aspartic acid racemization in cartilage and skin collagen are identical, % d-Asp values could also be used to calculate the rate of collagen turnover in skin based on this model. For skin collagen, the 0.0115 ± 0.0018% increase in % d-Asp per year (mean ± S.D.; Fig. 3, ages 19–91 years) indicates a half-life of 14.8 years (95% confidence interval: 9.4–22.3 years). Although no data on the half-life of human skin collagen are available in the literature, our data provide a reasonable first estimate.Besides human articular cartilage, aspartic acid racemization has also been studied in the acid-soluble and -insoluble collagen-rich fraction of human rib cartilage (19Pfeiffer H. Mornstad H. Teivens A. Int. J. Leg. Med. 1995; 108: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis from the intervertebral disc (21Ritz S. Schutz H.W. J. Forensic Sci. 1993; 38: 633-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, estimated aspartic acid racemization rates in cartilagenous tissues were 4–10-fold higher (0.108–0.236% d-Asp per year (19Pfeiffer H. Mornstad H. Teivens A. Int. J. Leg. Med. 1995; 108: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Ritz S. Schutz H.W. J.

Unfortunately, the protocols used in these studies result in significant amounts of residual proteoglycans in the collagen preparations. Since the intrinsic rate of aspartic acid racemization in aggrecan, the proteoglycan that is abundantly present in cartilage, is much higher than that in collagen (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitelkaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), residual proteoglycans strongly interfere with the determination of % d-Asp levels in cartilage collagen. Thus, to avoid erroneously high % d-Asp values, we purified cartilage collagen extensively so that the amount of residual proteoglycans was negligible (<3%; see “Experimental Procedures”), explaining why our aspartic acid racemization rates in cartilage are lower than in the above-mentioned studies.Aspartic Acid Racemization in Collagen from Cartilage, Skin, and DentinIn Table I, the in vivo rates of d-Asp accumulation in cartilage and skin collagen (based on Equation 1 and the data presented in Fig. 3) are compared with rates that had previously been determined in purified collagen (11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Ohtani S. Yamamoto K. J. Forensic Sci. 1991; 36: 792-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only collagens in which the activation energy for aspartic acid racemization is comparable (present study and Ref. 36Ohtani S. Kato S. Sugeno H. Growth Dev. Aging. 1996; 60: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar),i.e. have similar intrinsic rates of racemization, are included. The rate of d-Asp accumulation in skin collagen is clearly the slowest and that in dentin collagen the fastest, whereasd-Asp accumulation in cartilage collagen has an intermediate rate. The rate of d-Asp accumulation in cartilage collagen as determined in the present study is close to the rate in cartilage collagen as determined by Maroudas et al.(11Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because Table I compares collagens with similar intrinsic aspartic acid racemization rates, these in vivo rate constants of d-Asp accumulation probably reflect the rate of turnover of the protein. Therefore, we conclude that the rate of collagen turnover is higher in skin than in cartilage (see above), whereas dentin collagen has the slowest rate of turnover.Table Id-Asp accumulation in human collagenTissuekAspHalf-life×10−4 /yearyearsSkin1.1714.8Articular cartilage2.63117Articular cartilage (11)2.74174Dentin (44)5.00>500Comparison of the in vivo rate constants ofd-aspartic acid accumulation with age in the collagen fraction of different human collagen-containing tissues. Open table in a new tab In summary, we have shown that in both cartilage and skin collagen, AGE levels (CEL, CML, and pentosidine) are linearly related to levels of aspartic acid racemization, a direct measure of protein residence time, implying that protein turnover is an important factor in the accumulation of AGEs. Furthermore, consistent with a slower turnover of cartilage collagen compared with skin collagen, both % d-Asp levels and AGE levels are higher in cartilage collagen than in skin collagen. As a result, the rate of accumulation of AGEs corrected for turnover (based on % d-Asp) is similar for cartilage and skin collagen, which provides direct experimental evidence that protein turnover is a major determinant of AGE accumulation. Nonenzymatic glycation is a post-translational modification of proteins in vivo, which is initiated by the spontaneous reaction of sugars with lysine residues in proteins and eventually results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs),1 such asN ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML),N ε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), and pentosidine (1Dunn J.A.

The responder can accept or reject the deal. If the deal is rejected, neither player gets anything. The rational solution, suggested by game theory, is for the proposer to offer the smallest possible share and for the responder to accept it. If humans play the game, however, the most frequent outcome is a fair share. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary approach to the Ultimatum Game. We show that fairness will evolve if the proposer can obtain some information on what deals the responder has accepted in the past. Hence, the evolution of fairness, similarly to the evolution of cooperation, is linked to reputation."

Mice that expressed expanded CUG repeats developed myotonia and myopathy, whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not. Thus, transcripts with expanded CUG repeats are sufficient to generate a DM phenotype. This result supports a role for RNA gain of function in disease pathogenesis."

By selective ablation of PR-A in mice, we show that the PR-B isoform modulates a subset of reproductive functions of progesterone by regulation of a subset of progesterone-responsive target genes. Thus, PR-A and PR-B are functionally distinct mediators of progesterone action in vivo and should provide suitable targets for generation of tissue-selective progestins."

Above 4 kelvin, they are in excellent agreement with model calculations of individual nanotubes and differ markedly from the specific heat of two-dimensional graphene or three-dimensional graphite.

https://openalex.org/W2092553727,"The origin and evolution of photosynthesis have long remained enigmatic due to a lack of sequence information of photosynthesis genes across the entire photosynthetic domain. To probe early evolutionary history of photosynthesis, we obtained new sequence information of a number of photosynthesis genes from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum and the green nonsulfur bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus. A total of 31 open reading frames that encode enzymes involved in bacteriochlorophyll/porphyrin biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic electron transfer were identified in about 100 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple magnesium-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes using a combination of distance, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods indicate that heliobacteria are closest to the last common ancestor of all oxygenic photosynthetic lineages and that green sulfur bacteria and green nonsulfur bacteria are each other's closest relatives. Parsimony and distance analyses further identify purple bacteria as the earliest emerging photosynthetic lineage. These results challenge previous conclusions based on 16S ribosomal RNA and Hsp60/Hsp70 analyses that green nonsulfur bacteria or heliobacteria are the earliest phototrophs. The overall consensus of our phylogenetic analysis, that bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis evolved before chlorophyll biosynthesis, also argues against the long-held Granick hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2032082827,"Commissural axons cross the nervous system midline and then turn to grow alongside it, neither recrossing nor projecting back into ventral regions. In Drosophila, the midline repellent Slit prevents recrossing: axons cross once because they are initially unresponsive to Slit, becoming responsive only upon crossing. We show that commissural axons in mammals similarly acquire responsiveness to a midline repellent activity upon crossing. Remarkably, they also become responsive to a repellent activity from ventral spinal cord, helping explain why they never reenter that region. Several Slit and Semaphorin proteins, expressed in midline and/or ventral tissues, mimic these repellent activities, and midline guidance defects are observed in mice lacking neuropilin-2, a Semaphorin receptor . Thus, Slit and Semaphorin repellents from midline and nonmidline tissues may help prevent crossing axons from reentering gray matter, squeezing them into surrounding fiber tracts."

Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy mitochondrial DNA oxidative phosphorylation nucleotide pair coenzyme Q citrate synthase Epstein-Barr virus Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)1 is a maternally inherited disease characterized by midlife acute or subacute, progressive and bilateral central vision loss due to optic nerve atrophy. At least 17 different mtDNA sequence variants have been associated with LHON (1Brown M.D. Wallace D.C. Clin. Neurosci. 1994; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). However, only four mutations at (np) 3460A, 11778A, 14484C, and 14459A are sufficiently strong risk factors for blindness to be designated “primary” mutations. The primary mutations have been observed in multiple unrelated LHON families, very rarely co-occur with each other, and have not been detected in a large number of control mtDNAs (1Brown M.D. Wallace D.C.

Together, the 3460A, 11778A, 14484C, and 14459A mutations account for greater than 90% of reported LHON cases. With the exception of the 14459A mutation, which is also associated with early onset, generalized dystonia (5Jun A.S. Brown M.D. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6206-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6Jun A.S. Trounce I.A. Brown M.D. Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), LHON is typically the primary clinical manifestation of these mutations. All primary LHON mutations alter mtDNA-encoded intrinsic membrane proteins that contribute to NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.3) or complex I. Complex I is a large, multisubunit enzyme comprised of seven mtDNA-encoded (ND1, -2, -3, -4, -4L, -5, and -6) and roughly 35 nuclear-encoded polypeptides (7Wallace D.C. Brown M.D. Lott M.T. Rimoin D.L. Connor J.M. Pyeritz R.E. Emery A.E.H. Emery and Rimoin's Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, London1996: 277-332Google Scholar). In oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), electrons enter the mitochondrial electron transport chain from NADH + H+ via complex I. In complex I, the electrons transverse a FMN, 5–7 iron-sulfur centers, and ultimately reduce ubiquinone to ubiquinol. From ubiquinol, the electrons are transferred to complex III (ubiquinol:cytochromec oxidoreductase (EC 1.10.2.2)), then to cytochromec, next to complex IV (cytochrome coxidoreductase (EC 1.9.3.1)), and finally to atomic oxygen. Electrons can be donated from succinate to complex II, which then reduces coenzyme Q (CoQ10), bypassing complex I. As electrons transverse complexes I, III, and IV, protons are translocated from the matrix to the inner membrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient (ΔΨ). ΔΨ is utilized by complex V (ATP synthase (EC3.6.1.34)) to condense ADP and inorganic phosphate to ATP. Thus, the addition of ADP to respiring mitochondria increases the respiration rate, as the ADP is phosphorylated (state III), and returns to the basal rate (state IV) when all of the ADP is phosphorylated. The addition of an agent that collapses ΔΨ uncouples electron transport from ATP synthesis, resulting in an accelerated respiration rate. Although the clinical and genetic aspects of LHON have been well studied, we know little about the pathophysiological mechanism(s) that results in central vision loss. Previous studies have investigated the biochemical defects associated with the various primary LHON mutations (8Larsson N.G. Andersen O. Holme E. Oldfors A. Wahlstrom J. Ann.

However, considerable variability exists in the reported results, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions concerning the underlying biochemical dysfunction. Such variation is apparent in assay methodologies (methods for mitochondrial isolation, preparation of submitochondrial particles, substrates employed), starting material (whole cell versus isolated mitochondria respiration), and mitochondrial buffering/storage procedures. There is also discontinuity in the patient cell type studied (leukocytes, platelets, skeletal muscle, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts), and rarely is more than one LHON mutation investigated, making comparative analysis of OXPHOS dysfunction difficult. Finally, some reports have examined insufficient numbers of patients and/or controls to permit a definitive statistical analysis of the results. To further characterize the OXPHOS defects associated with the LHON mutations, we performed respiration and enzymological analysis on lymphoblast mitochondria isolated from a large number of LHON patients containing the 3460A, 11778A, or 14484C mutations. Transmitochondrial cybrids derived from patient lymphoblasts were also subjected to biochemical analysis. Significant respiratory defects were found associated with site I substrates for the 3460A and 11778A mutations and a striking complex I enzyme defect for the np 3460A mutation, all of which transferred in cybrid studies. No significant defects were found for the np 14484C mutation. Together with our previous study, these data indicate that the biochemical defect is most severe for the np 14459A and np 3460A mutations, intermediate for the np 11778A mutation, and mildest for the np 14484C mutation. All patient cell lines reported here were derived from patients who exhibited typical clinical signs of LHON and had an age of onset in young adulthood (16Newman N.J. Lott M.T. Wallace D.C. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1991; 111: 750-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Riordan-Eva P. Sanders M.D. Govan G.G. Sweeney M.G. Da Costa J. Harding A.E. Brain. 1995; 118: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Patient lymphoblastoid cell lines were constructed from five independent male np 3460A patients, six male and one female np 11778A patients, and five male and two female 14484C patients. All subjects were Caucasian except for one 14484C patient, who was an African-American female. Control lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from 13 normal men and six normal women. The age range for the control group was 22–45 years. Twenty lymphoblast controls were used for most respiration studies, 12 of whom were males. Lymphoblast cell lines were established by EBV transformation of leukocytes isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. All EBV-transformed cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Bio-Whitaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell lines had been maintained in culture for 10–20 population doublings at the time of mitochondrial isolation. The WAL-2A-ρ0 line lacks mtDNA and is hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient. It is grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mg/ml glucose, 50 μg/ml uridine, 1 mmpyruvate (GUP medium) containing 1 μg/ml of 6-thioguanine. Transmitochondrial cybrids were prepared by enucleating EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from LHON patients and controls and fusing 2 × 107 mitochondria-containing cytoplasts with the 107 WAL-2A-ρ0, cells by electroshock (18Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cybrids were selected in 75 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mg/ml glucose, and 1 μg/ml 6-thioguanine. Rapid growth of the cybrid cultures was observed 20–28 days postfusion, and cybrid lines were passaged 5–10 population doublings prior to mitochondrial isolation. Genomic DNA was isolated from approximately 106 EBV-transformed lymphoblasts or cybrids using Chelex 100 (Cetus, Emeryville, CA). The 3460A, 11778A, and 14484C LHON mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by mutation-specific restriction endonuclease digestion (3Brown M.D. Torroni A. Reckord C.L. Wallace D.C. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 6: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). All lymphoblastoid cell lines and cybrid constructs were homoplasmic. Procedures for mitochondrial isolation, polarographic analysis, and OXPHOS enzymology of submitochondrial particles have been described (6Jun A.S. Trounce I.A. Brown M.D. Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry assay. Lymphoblast and cybrid mitochondria were assayed at concentrations ranged from 3.5 to 13 mg protein/ml. For respiration analysis of mitochondria, two polarographic runs were performed for each substrate (malate plus pyruvate or malate plus glutamate (site I) and succinate (site II)) involving two additions of ADP (125 nmol for site I and 75 nmol of ADP for site II substrates). The experiment was concluded by the addition of the OXPHOS uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol. All runs were performed with 250–500 μg of mitochondrial protein. The respiratory control ratio is the mean state III respiration rate divided by the mean state IV respiration rate. All mitochondrial isolates included in this study had to have respiratory control ratios of >2 to meet our minimum standard of mitochondrial integrity. The state III ratio is the mean of the state III respiration rates using site I substrates divided by the mean of the state III respiration rates using site II substrates. OXPHOS enzyme activities were assayed on sonicated mitochondria and measured spectrophotometrically with a dual beam UV-visual spectrophotometer (model DW-2000; SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). Complex I activities were assayed in triplicate using 30 μg of mitochondrial protein and monitoring the reduction of 10 μmdecylubiquinone at 272 nm by 30 μm NADH. Consistently, 90–100% of the total complex I activity was rotenone-sensitive. Complex II plus III activities were assayed in duplicate with 15 μg of mitochondrial protein by the antimycin A-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c by succinate. Complex III activities were assayed in duplicate using 7.5 μg of mitochondrial protein by the antimycin A-sensitive oxidation of reduced decylubiquinone by cytochrome c. Complex III activity was 75–100% antimycin A-sensitive. Complex IV activities were determined in duplicate using 7.5 μg of mitochondrial protein by the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of cytochrome c. Citrate synthase (CS) was assayed in duplicate, using 15 μg of mitochondrial protein. p values were calculated by the Mann-Whitney, unpaired, two-tailed test (Instat for Macintosh, version 2.03, Graphpad Software, Inc.). ADP-stimulated (state III) oxygen consumption rates using the site I/complex I substrates (malate + pyruvate or glutamate) were significantly reduced in patient lymphoblasts, relative to controls, for the np 3460A and np 11778A mutants (Table I, top, left column). The np 3640A mutation reduced the state III rate 23–30%, and the np 11778A mutation reduced state III respiration 27–35%, but the np 14484C mutation reduced respiration only 3–12%. The np 11778A mutation also exhibited a significantly slower uncoupled rate (approximately 70% of controls) using complex I substrates. The state III and uncoupled respiration rates for all three mutations were essentially identical to controls using the complex II substrate, succinate. The mutant ADP/O ratios and state IV rates were nearly equivalent to controls in all cases.Table IPolarographic analysis of patient and control lymphoblast and cybrid cell linesSubstrateLHON mutationNumber of cell linesMean respiration ratesADP/O ratioState III ratio (site I/site II)State IIIState IVUncouplednmol O/min/mg mitochondrial proteinLymphoblasts Pyruvate + malate3460A598 ± 2534 ± 11123 ± 132.3 ± 0.60.56 ± 0.10 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.11778A791 ± 18 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.40 ± 11115 ± 31 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.2.5 ± 0.20.50 ± 0.13 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.14484C7123 ± 5140 ± 20140 ± 672.7 ± 0.50.66 ± 0.11 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.Control20140 ± 4142 ± 13168 ± 602.8 ± 0.50.78 ± 0.05 Glutamate + malate3460A5112 ± 13 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.36 ± 9139 ± 322.4 ± 0.30.65 ± 0.08 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.11778A7106 ± 24 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.39 ± 12124 ± 452.3 ± 0.30.57 ± 0.13 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.14484C7141 ± 7137 ± 19159 ± 862.4 ± 0.40.73 ± 0.08Control20145 ± 4136 ± 11173 ± 642.6 ± 0.60.81 ± 0.11 Succinate3460A5174 ± 2760 ± 6244 ± 671.6 ± 0.2NA 1-bNA, not applicable.11778A7188 ± 3166 ± 13257 ± 391.8 ± 0.3NA14484C7194 ± 9875 ± 43319 ± 1671.9 ± 0.6NAControl20179 ± 4560 ± 17247 ± 961.8 ± 0.3NACybrids Pyruvate + malate3460A573 ± 11 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.22 ± 5 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.72 ± 23 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.2.0 ± 0.2 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.0.59 ± 0.15 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.11778A7105 ± 4433 ± 24117 ± 612.9 ± 0.50.63 ± 0.05 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.14484C782 ± 2625 ± 10112 ± 593.0 ± 0.60.62 ± 0.15Control997 ± 2035 ± 10101 ± 202.4 ± 0.30.76 ± 0.10 Glutamate + malate3460A582 ± 2026 ± 1280 ± 292.0 ± 0.40.63 ± 0.10 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.11778A7106 ± 4128 ± 13123 ± 652.8 ± 0.60.64 ± 0.03 1-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.14484C792 ± 2924 ± 11119 ± 732.9 ± 0.80.69 ± 0.14Control999 ± 2235 ± 11102 ± 222.3 ± 0.40.77 ± 0.11 Succinate3460A5130 ± 3340 ± 25163 ± 411.6 ± 0.3NA11778A7165 ± 6246 ± 20274 ± 1511.9 ± 0.3NA14484C7135 ± 3840 ± 21197 ± 782.1 ± 0.5NAControl9130 ± 3751 ± 20161 ± 501.5 ± 0.1NA1-a Statistical significance (p < 0.05) by the two-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.1-b NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab These differences were even more apparent when the state III ratios were calculated. The np 3460A mutation resulted in a 20–28% reduction, the np 11778A mutation a 30–36% reduction, and the np 14484C mutation a 10–15% reduction in the state III ratio, with all three showing significant differences relative to the controls. These results are consistent with the LHON mutations imparting a complex I defect. The complex I-linked state III respiratory defects seen in the np 3460A and 11778A mitochondria were transferred along with the mtDNA into WAL-2A-ρ0-derived transmitochondrial cybrids. The cybrid 3460A state III rates were reduced 16–25%, and the state III ratio was reduced 18–22%, which were significantly different from controls (Table I, bottom). The state III ratios were significantly reduced for the np 11778A mutation as well. However, the state III respiration rates and state III ratios of the np 14484C cybrids remained within the normal range. The uncoupled site I respiration rate for the np 3460 mutant was also significantly reduced. Again, the complex II substrate respiration rates of the mutant cybrids were the same as controls. In a comparison of respiration parameters in control cell lines, transmitochondrial cybrids demonstrated slower respiration rates and lower ADP/O ratios than did the EBV-transformed lymphoblasts. In virtually all comparisons of respiration data between the lymphoblasts and the cybrids, the cybrid cells with the WAL-2A nucleus were 15–40% lower (Table II, top). Normalized respiration rates (state III ratios), however, did not differ between lymphoblast and cybrid controls. Identical results were observed when only those lymphoblasts and cybrids that shared the same mtDNA were compared (Table II, bottom), indicating that the reduced respiratory function in the cybrid nuclear background was probably due to the nuclear genetic background difference instead of statistical sampling error.Table IIComparison of polarography results in control lymphoblasts and cybridsSubstrateCell typeMean respiration ratesADP/O ratioState III ratioState IIIState IVUncouplednmol O/min/mg mitochondrial proteinTotal Pyruvate + malateLymphoblasts; n = 20140 ± 4142 ± 13168 ± 602.8 ± 0.50.78 ± 0.05Cybrids;n = 997 ± 20 (69)2-aNumbers in parentheses indicate percent reduction in cybrid rates or ratios relative to lymphoblast rates or ratios.

Only mitochondria from the np 3460A patients showed a significant defect in enzyme specific activity, a 79% complex I deficiency relative to controls (p < 0.0001) (TableIII, top). This same defect was apparent when normalized to citrate synthase activity, with the np 3460A mitochondria having a 62% reduction in activity (p = 0.0009). The np 11778A mutant mitochondria were also found to have a slight but significant reduction in complex I activity of 25% when normalized to citrate synthase (p = 0.0137).

Open table in a new tab The complex I defect of the np 3460A mutation was transferred along with the mtDNA in transmitochondrial cybrids. In the cybrids, the 3460A complex I specific activity was reduced 73% (p = 0.0010) relative to controls, and the citrate synthase normalized activity was 70% less (p = 0.0010) than control activity (Table III, bottom). Hence, the np 3460A mtDNA mutation imparts a striking defect in complex I activity, which is not seen for the np 11778A and 14484C mutation. The effect of nuclear background on respiration rates was also seen for OXPHOS enzyme specific activities. In virtually every comparison between control cell lines, the mitochondrial enzyme specific activities were reduced 20–30% in the WAL-2A-ρ0 cybrids relative to the lymphoblastoid cell lines (TableIV, top). Surprisingly, the complex III activity was an exception, being higher in the cybrids than in the lymphoblast cell lines. The same alterations were found when only those lymphoblasts and cybrids that shared the same mitochondria were compared (Table IV, bottom). However, as observed in the respiration data, citrate synthase-normalized complex I activity was essentially equivalent between the two groups.Table IVComparison of enzymology results between control lymphoblasts and cybridsCell typeMean specific activityComplex I/CS ratioComplex IComplex II + IIIComplex IIIComplex IVCSnmol substrate/min/mg mitochondrial proteinTotal Lymphoblasts; n = 2253 ± 20311 ± 81474 ± 104596 ± 250599 ± 1910.09 ± 0.02 Cybrids; n = 944 ± 14 (83)4-aNumbers in parenthesis indicate percent reduction in cybrid activities or ratio relative to lymphoblast activities or ratio.

Open table in a new tab The detailed analysis of 19 different patient lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as patient cybrids demonstrates that both the np 3460A and np 11778A mutations impart a moderate complex I respiration defect and that the np 3460A mutation also imparts a severe complex I enzyme defect. The np 3460A complex I defect is similar to that which we previously observed in mitochondria harboring the np 14459A LHON and dystonia mutation. Interestingly, no statistically significant complex I-linked dysfunction could be detected in patients harboring the np 14484C mutation. Combining our analysis of all LHON lymphoblastoid mitochondria thus indicates that the np 14459A and 3460A mutations impart the most severe reduction of complex I function, with the 11778A mutation showing moderate impairment and the 14484C mutation causing little complex I perturbation (Table V). These findings roughly correlate with the clinical features of the LHON mutations. The 14459A mutation causes the most severe symptoms, including LHON and/or early onset, generalized, dystonia due to basal"
https://openalex.org/W2137779370,"We have previously reported that in thrombin-stimulated human platelets, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is phosphorylated on Ser-505 by p38 protein kinase and on Ser-727 by an unknown kinase. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 leads to inhibition of cPLA2 phosphorylation at both Ser-505 and Ser-727 suggesting that the kinase responsible for phosphorylation on Ser-727 is activated in a p38-dependent pathway. By using Chinese hamster ovary, HeLa, and HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type and phosphorylation site mutant forms of cPLA2, we show that phosphorylation of cPLA2 at both Ser-505 and Ser-727 and elevation of Ca2+ leads to its activation in agonist-stimulated cells. The p38-activated protein kinases MNK1, MSK1, and PRAK1 phosphorylate cPLA2 in vitro uniquely on Ser-727 as shown by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, MNK1 and PRAK1, but not MSK1, is present in platelets and undergo modest activation in response to thrombin. Expression of a dominant negative form of MNK1 in HEK293 cells leads to significant inhibition of cPLA2-mediated arachidonate release. The results suggest that MNK1 or a closely related kinase is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-727.

Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), and this technique has been used by many investigators to track cPLA2 phosphorylation in a variety of agonist-stimulated cells (2Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In thrombin- and collagen-activated human platelets, Ser-505 of cPLA2 is phosphorylated by p38 protein kinase (mainly the 2a isoform, also known as stress-activated protein kinase, SAPK-2a) as well as other p38 isoforms that belong to the MAPK family (16Borsch-Haubold A.G.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rigorous protein chemical analysis of phosphorylation of cPLA2 expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system established that this enzyme is phosphorylated on 4 serines (437, 454, 505, and 727) (20de Carvalho M.G.S.

Subsequent studies with human platelets and HeLa cells showed that cPLA2 is exclusively phosphorylated on a subset of these serines (Ser-505 and Ser-727) in response to agonists, and no evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation could be found (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These are the only studies to date in which the sites of cPLA2 phosphorylation have been fully mapped, and they underscore the need for detailed protein chemical analysis rather than the SDS-PAGE gel shift to characterize the phosphorylation of this enzyme in cells. Treatment of platelets with the p38-2a/2b inhibitors SB 203580 and SB 201950 not only decreases phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505 but also on Ser-727 (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J.

The degree of inhibition is agonist-dependent, and this appears to be due to the fact that multiple p38s are activated in agonist-specific ways and that only some of these isoforms are sensitive to SB 203580 (19Borsch-Haubold A.G. Ghomashchi F. Pasquet S. Goedert M. Cohen P. Gelb M.H. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The inhibition data make it likely that Ser-727 is phosphorylated by a kinase that is downstream of p38s in the activation cascade. The present study was therefore designed to test whether MAPK-regulated kinases phosphorylate cPLA2 in vitro, whether they are present in platelets, and to explore the functional significance of Ser-505 and Ser-727 phosphorylation by analysis of three mammalian cell lines stably transfected with phosphorylation site mutants of cPLA2. Dephosphorylated wild type cPLA2 (cPLA2-WT) (treated with phosphatase) and cPLA2 mutants were prepared as described previously (21Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Kinase substrate peptide KKLNRTLSVA was synthesized by Alta Bioscience Ltd. (Birmingham, UK). cPLA2 tryptic phosphopeptides containing phosphoserine at positions 437 (pS437-P), 454 (pS454-P), 505 (pS505-P), and 727 (pS727-P) were obtained as described (16Borsch-Haubold A.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the non-phosphorylated Ser-727 tryptic peptide, pS727-P, was prepared by SynPep (Dublin, CA). All synthetic peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, and their structures and purities were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB 202190) was purchased from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK), and 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD 98059) was kindly provided by D. T. Dudley (23Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein (MBP) and bovine thrombin were purchased from Sigma, and collagen was from Nycomed Arzneimittel (Munich, Germany). Polyclonal anti-MNK1 antiserum was obtained as described (24Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and polyclonal anti-cPLA2 (R11683) was obtained from C. Leslie (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO). Recombinant PRAK1 (see below) expressed in Escherichia coli and the peptide FKRNAAVIDPLQFHMGVER corresponding to residues 384–402 of human MSK1 and conjugated to bovine serum albumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin were injected into sheep at Diagnostic Scotland (Carluke, Ayrshire, UK). The antibodies against PRAK1 and MSK1 were affinity-purified by chromatography on PRAK1-CH-Sepharose or peptide-CH-Sepharose, respectively. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-tagged human MAPK-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) was obtained by infecting insect cells with MNK1 baculovirus as described (24Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). MNK1 was purified and activated, fresh before use, with activated ERK1 (Calbiochem) as described (24Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP-K2) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and activated by p38-2a was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (TCS Biologicals Ltd., Bucks, UK) and stored at −70 °C. An expressed sequence tag clone encoding residues 17–471 of human PRAK1 was kindly provided by the Image consortium, St. Louis (565786-AA137161). The full-length PRAK1 sequence (residues 1–471) was generated by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated repair strategy using the EST clone as a template. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pCR/TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and the sequence verified by DNA sequencing. The vector was then digested with NdeI/XhoI and the cDNA fragment ligated into the same sites of a modified pFastBAC1 vector encoding a hexahistidine tag 5′ to the NdeI site. The resulting pFastBAC-PRAK construct was then used to generate recombinant baculovirus using the Bac-to-Bac methodology (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA for FLAG-MSK1 (25Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was subcloned as aBamHI-KpnI fragment into pFastBACHTb and recombinant baculovirus generated as described for pFastBAC-PRAK1. The resulting viruses, encoding amino-terminally hexahistidine-tagged PRAK1 and MSK1, were used to infect Sf21 cells (1.5 × 106/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The infected cells were harvested 72 h post-infection and the His-tagged PRAK1 and MSK1 proteins purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described previously for protein kinase B-β (26Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% Brij-35, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at −20 °C. PRAK1 and MSK1 were recovered with a yield of 8 and 20 mg/liter of infected Sf21 cells, respectively, and were >90% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. PRAK1 was activated at a concentration of 2 μm with 2 units/ml active GST-p42MAPK (1 milliunit incorporates 1 nmol of phosphate per min into MBP) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.1 mm ATP for 45 min at 30 °C. MSK1 was activated at 300 μg/ml with 10 units/ml GST-p42 MAPK in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The GST-p42 MAPK was removed after activation by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Activated MSK1 and PRAK1 were stored at −20 °C. The activity of kinases were assayed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm magnesium acetate (MSK1 and PRAK1), 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmmagnesium chloride (MNK1) (24Fukunaga R.

Reaction mixtures (20 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and phosphopeptide product was quantified as described (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One microunit of kinase is defined as the amount of enzyme that phosphorylates 1 pmol of substrate peptide per min. With these conditions, maximal velocities at saturating peptide concentration were measured for all kinases (25Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 28Clifton A.D. Young P.R. Cohen R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3.1/Seo(+) mammalian expression vector for mouse cPLA2 has been described (29Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing the cPLA2 mutants (S505A, S727A) were prepared using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) and the primers CACATCATATCCACTGGCTCCCCTGAGAGACTTCAGC (+ complement) and GAACCCATCTCGTTGCGCTGTTTCCCTCAG (+ complement), respectively. The double mutant S505A/S727A was prepared sequentially. The entire coding regions of all mutant cPLA2 vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO-K1 cells and HeLa S3 cells (from ATCC) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectant clones were isolated by limiting dilution in the presence of 250 and 100 μg/ml zeocin for CHO and HeLa cells, respectively. cPLA2 immunoblots were carried out with 4 μg of cell protein per gel lane (10% SDS-PAGE) using a 1:1000 dilution of the R11683 antiserum and ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Establishment of HEK293 cell stable transfectants and analysis of cPLA2 expression by RNA blotting and immunoblotting were carried out as described (29Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3103-3115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In order to establish HEK293 transfectants stably co-expressing cPLA2 and a dominant negative form of MNK-1, cells expressing cPLA2-WT were subjected to a second transfection as described above with mouse dominant negative MNK-1 cDNA, which had been subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) at theBamHI site. The cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). After culture for 1–2 months, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression of each protein was assessed by immunoblotting using anti-cPLA2 and anti-MNK-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The established clones were expanded and used for subsequent experiments. Expression of cPLA2-WT and MNK-1 proteins in HEK293 transfectants was assessed by immunoblot analysis using lysates from 105cells applied to a SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore). The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies (1:5000 dilution for cPLA2-WT and 1:2000 dilutions for MNK-1) for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h, and visualized using the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CHO were grown to 80% confluence in Ham's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in a 24-well plate. Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (200 Ci/mmol, American Radiochemicals). After 20 h at 37 °C, medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with complete medium. Cells were stimulated in 1 ml of complete medium with 1 μmA23187for 10 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 5 min with 1 μm PMA prior to stimulation with ionophore or treated with PMA alone for 15 min. Culture medium was collected, briefly microcentrifuged, and 0.5 ml was submitted to scintillation counting. Cells were dissolved in 1 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1); solvent was removed, and the residue was submitted to scintillation counting to obtain total cell associated counts/min. Arachidonate release is expressed as the percentage of total counts/min released into the medium. HeLa cells were grown to 70% confluence in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmglutamine. Cells were radiolabeled as for CHO cells. For stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μmA23187 for 10 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were treated for 20 min with 1000 units/ml interferon-α (Accurate Chemicals) at 37 °C. Release of counts/min into the medium was quantified as described for CHO cells after the cell suspension was submitted to low speed centrifugation. Arachidonic acid release from A23187-stimulated HEK293 cells was carried out as described (29Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) except that 48-well plates were used (125 μl/well). CHO and HeLa cells were prepared for fluorimetric monitoring of intracellular calcium as described previously (10Glover S. de Carvalho M. Bauburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) except that the fluorophore Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes) was used, and cells were loaded by incubation with 4 μm fluorophore for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with A23187 (1 or 10 μm) while monitoring fluo-3 fluorescence with stirring at 37 °C. pS727 or pS727-P (100 μm) or MBP (100 μm) in the presence of MNK1 kinase buffer (see above) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (250 Ci/mol) in a total volume of 50 μl for 10 min at 30 °C and radiophosphorylated peptide were quantified as described (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For cPLA2 phosphorylation, aliquots of activated kinase (3 microunits or as noted in the figure legends) and 2 μg of purified dephosphorylated wild type cPLA2 or cPLA2 mutant were incubated with kinase buffer, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (250 Ci/mol) in a total volume of 20 μl. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C (or as noted in the figure legends), the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs were taken from dried gels. Radioactivity was quantified by Cerenkov counting of gel slices or by densitometry analysis of exposed x-ray films. To generate radiophosphorylated cPLA2 for peptide mapping, reactions were carried out as above except higher specific activity [γ-32P]ATP was used (1250 Ci/mol) along with 4 μg of cPLA2. Microbore high performance liquid chromatography (mbHPLC) and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography were performed as described previously (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cPLA2 was eluted from gel slices using 50 mmNH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg of carrier cPLA2 protein. Protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and digested with trypsin (20de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on mbHPLC, and synthetic phosphopeptide standards were co-injected with each run. Radioactivity was monitored by Cerenkov counting. For two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps, tryptic digests were separated by electrophoresis followed by ascending thin layer chromatography. In some experiments, peptides were oxidized with performic acid (16Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Five samples each containing 1 μg of cPLA2 were incubated with 70 microunits of activated MNK1 (+MNK1 sample) or with buffer (−MNK1 sample) containing [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min at 30 °C as described above. Samples were pooled in a wide well of a preparative gel, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation reaction gave 5600 cpm (+MNK1) and 1800 cpm (−MNK1) (Cerenkov counting) which corresponds to a substrate phosphorylation of 4.6 and 1.5%, respectively. cPLA2 was eluted from gel slices in the absence of carrier protein as described above. Yield of cPLA2 after purification was 4.23 μg (+MNK1 sample) and 3.18 μg (−MNK1 sample) based on Cerenkov counting. The analysis of the synthetic peptide standard and the native protein tryptic digest was performed by micro-column HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry. The micro-column consisted of a 100 × 365 μm fused silica capillary (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) in which one end was pulled to a 2-μm tip using a laser puller (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) (31Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G.R. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Poros R2 reverse phase material (10 μm, Perspective Biosystems, Framinghan, MA) was packed against the tip to a length of approximately 14 cm. The peptide samples were loaded onto the column according to the method described by Yates et al.(32Yates I., J.R. McCormack A.L. Hayden J.B. Davey M.P. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 380-388Crossref Google Scholar). An HP 1100 binary HPLC pump (Hewlett-Packard Co., Wilmington, DE) was used to deliver the gradient to the column. Buffer A consisted of 0.5% acetic acid, and buffer B consisted of 80:20 acetonitrile:water with 0.5% acetic acid. A flow rate of 150 nl/min through the column was obtained by using a pre-column split. The gradient was ramped from 2% buffer B to 60% buffer B in 30 min. Throughout the gradient, the mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) was programmed for selected ion monitoring of m/z 938.3 followed by MS/MS ofm/z 938.3 and selected ion monitoring of m/z914.4 followed by MS/MS of m/z 914.4. Authentic pS727-P and cPLA2 tryptic digest were analyzed on different HPLC columns to avoid carry-over contamination. Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers into acidic citrate dextrose as anticoagulant, and washed platelets were prepared as described previously (33Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Samples (4–5 × 108platelets/ml) were stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) or collagen (100 μg/ml) as described (33Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nmokadaic acid, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). After pre-clearing lysates with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were incubated with polyclonal anti-MNK1 antiserum (24Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and fresh protein A-Sepharose CL-4B overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 1 mm EGTA and an additional 500 mm NaCl and were washed twice more in TBS-T/EGTA. A final wash was carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, containing 100 μm EGTA. All supernatants were taken off, and pellets were incubated with 50 μl of MNK1 kinase buffer (see above) containing 100 μm MBP and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol) as substrates. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform. Th"
https://openalex.org/W2004432012,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin on leukocytes that binds to selectins. P-selectin binds to an N-terminal region of PSGL-1 that requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines (TyrSO3) and an adjacent core-2-based O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x (C2-O-sLex). We synthesized glycosulfopeptides (GSPs) modeled after this region of PSGL-1 to explore the roles of individual TyrSO3 residues, the placement of C2-O-sLexrelative to TyrSO3, the relative contributions of fucose and sialic acid on C2-O-sLex, and the function of the peptide sequence for binding to P-selectin. Binding of GSPs to P-selectin was measured by affinity chromatography and equilibrium gel filtration. 2-GSP-6, which has C2-O-sLex at Thr-57 and TyrSO3 at residues 46, 48, and 51, bound to P-selectin with high affinity (Kd ∼ 650 nm), whereas an isomeric trisulfated GSP containing C2-O-sLex at Thr-44 bound much less well. Non-sulfated glycopeptide (2-GP-6) containing C2-O-sLex at Thr-57 bound to P-selectin with ∼40-fold lower affinity (Kd∼25 μm). Proteolysis of 2-GP-6 abolished detectable binding of the residual C2-O-sLex-Thr to P-selectin, demonstrating that the peptide backbone contributes to binding. Monosulfated and disulfated GSPs bound significantly better than non-sulfated 2-GP-6, but sulfation of Tyr-48 enhanced affinity (Kd ∼ 6 μm) more than sulfation of Tyr-46 or Tyr-51. 2-GSP-6 lacking sialic acid bound to P-selectin at ∼10% that of the level of the parent 2-GSP-6, whereas 2-GSP-6 lacking fucose did not detectably bind; thus, fucose contributes more than sialic acid to binding. Reducing NaCl from 150 to 50 mm markedly enhanced binding of 2-GSP-6 to P-selectin (Kd ∼ 75 nm), demonstrating the charge dependence of the interaction. These results reveal a stereospecific interaction of P-selectin with PSGL-1 that includes distinct contributions of each of the three TyrSO3residues, adjacent peptide determinants, and fucose/sialic acid on an optimally positioned core-2 O-glycan. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin on leukocytes that binds to selectins. P-selectin binds to an N-terminal region of PSGL-1 that requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines (TyrSO3) and an adjacent core-2-based O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x (C2-O-sLex). We synthesized glycosulfopeptides (GSPs) modeled after this region of PSGL-1 to explore the roles of individual TyrSO3 residues, the placement of C2-O-sLexrelative to TyrSO3, the relative contributions of fucose and sialic acid on C2-O-sLex, and the function of the peptide sequence for binding to P-selectin. Binding of GSPs to P-selectin was measured by affinity chromatography and equilibrium gel filtration. 2-GSP-6, which has C2-O-sLex at Thr-57 and TyrSO3 at residues 46, 48, and 51, bound to P-selectin with high affinity (Kd ∼ 650 nm), whereas an isomeric trisulfated GSP containing C2-O-sLex at Thr-44 bound much less well.

The N terminus of mature human PSGL-1 begins at residue 42, after removal of the signal peptide from residues 1–18 and a propeptide from residues 19–41 (11Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G.

Sulfation of tyrosine residues andO-glycosylation in the mature N-terminal region of PSGL-1 appear necessary for high affinity binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin (4McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the importance of modifications at specific amino acid residues is not well understood. Studies employing site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant PSGL-1, which was co-expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells or COS cells with specific glycosyltransferases, suggested that a core-2 based O-glycan with the sialyl Lewis x (C2-O-sLex) antigen at Thr-57 and at least one of the Tyr residues at Tyr-46, -48 or -51 are required for measurable binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin (12Sako D.

Whether the individual Tyr residues make distinct contributions to P-selectin recognition has not been examined. Mutation of Thr-44 to alanine did not inhibit binding of recombinant PSGL-1, suggesting that an O-glycan at this position does not contribute to binding. However, this residue might beO-glycosylated in hematopoietic cells but not in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. To obtain more precise information about the interaction of P-selectin with O-glycans and TyrSO3 residues on PSGL-1, we recently used purified and recombinant glycosyltransferases and a tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferase to generate synthetic glycosulfopeptides (GSPs) modeled after the mature N-terminal region of PSGL-1. A glycosulfopeptide-6 (GSP-6) was synthesized to contain three TyrSO3 residues at Tyr-46, -48, or -51 and a nearby C2-O-sLex at Thr-57 (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J.

GSP-6 binds to P-selectin with an affinity (Kd ∼ 350 nm) close to that of native, neutrophil-derived PSGL-1 (Kd ∼ 300 nm) (8Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

Consistent with this finding, monomeric forms of full-length PSGL-1 and a trypsin-derived glycosulfopeptide from the N terminus of HL-60 cell-derived PSGL-1 also bind with high affinity to P-selectin (17Epperson T.K. Patel K.D. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7839-7853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the stereospecific contributions of tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation to binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. Substitution of any two of the three tyrosines with phenylalanines in recombinant PSGL-1 impairs the mechanical properties of its bonds with P-selectin in shear flow, but these substitutions could affect peptide structure as well as prevent sulfation (18Ramachandran V. Nollert M.U. Qiu H. Liu W.-J. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Synthetic conjugates that express sLex on different types of O-glycans bind differentially to P-selectin (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M.

Varki A. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, a GSP modeled after the N terminus of PSGL-1 that contains sLex expressed on a core-2 based O-glycan binds much better to P-selectin than an isomeric GSP that contains sLex expressed on an extended core-1 basedO-glycan (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24838-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the position of theO-glycan relative to TyrSO3 residues,i.e. at Thr-44 versus Thr-57, contributes to binding. The interpretation of the effects of amino acid substitutions on post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 has significant limitations because it is difficult to structurally define specific post-translational modifications on recombinant glycoproteins. There is usually microheterogeneity of glycosylation that complicates the interpretation of binding affinities. The use of synthetic, homogeneously glycosylated glycosulfopeptides offers marked advantages, but the tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferase adds sulfate from PAPS donor to all available Tyr residues within the consensus sequence. Thus, enzymatic sulfation does not readily allow sulfation of individual Tyr residues within a peptide that contains multiple Tyr residues (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J.

To gain more insight into the contributions of individual TyrSO3 residues, the peptide backbone, specific sugar residues, and their site-specific contributions, we generated synthetic GSPs modeled after the mature N terminus of human PSGL-1 that contain TyrSO3 residues and O-glycans at specific sites. Our results demonstrate that P-selectin differentially recognizes GSPs containing one, two, or three TyrSO3 residues and that the relative contributions of each TyrSO3 residue differ. P-selectin binds weakly to non-sulfated anionic peptides containing C2-O-sLex, but the O-glycan must be placed at Thr-57 rather than at the alternative site at Thr-44. These studies further extend our knowledge about the roles of peptide, sulfate, and carbohydrate determinants in binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. Glyco(sulfo)peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry. The preloaded Wang resin (p-hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl resin) and liquid reagents and solvents were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Great Britain. Tri-O-acetyl-GalNAc and tyrosine sulfates were incorporated into the peptide during the solid phase peptide synthesis using tri-O-acetyl-GalNAcα-Fmoc-Thr (Glycotech, Rockville, MD) and Fmoc-Tyr(-SO3H)-H sodium salt (Bachem California Inc., Torrance, CA). Other Fmoc amino acid derivatives were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Sulfated peptides 2-GSP(46)-1, 2-GSP(48)-1, 2-GSP(51)-1, 2-GSP(46,48)-1, 2-GSP(46,51)-1, 2-GSP(48,51)-1, and 2-GSP-1 were cleaved from the resin as described (20Kitagawa K. Futaki S. Yagami T. Sumi S. Inoue K. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70–100 mg of resin containing peptide was cleaved in 700 μl of 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5% (v/v) m-cresol for 5 h at 4 °C under continuous stirring. Nonsulfated 2-GP-1 was cleaved from the resin in 700 μl of 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% (v/v) thioanisole and 2.5% (v/v) ethanedithiol for 15 min on ice, and incubation was continued for 1 h 45 min at room temperature under stirring. The cleaved peptides were then precipitated and washed with tert-butyl methyl ether. The dried peptides were dissolved in 30% aqueous acetonitrile to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. An equal volume of methanol was added, and the free sulfhydryl of the C-terminal cysteine was converted into S-S-CH3 by incubating the peptides in 4 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. The complete derivatization was confirmed by reversed phase HPLC. Tri-O-acetyl-GalNAc was deacetylated using 18 mm sodium methylate as described (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J.

The deacetylated peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (see Table I).Figure 5Equilibrium binding affinities of glycosulfopeptides for sPS at physiological salt concentration.Equilibrium gel filtration experiments were carried out by loading 50 pmol–3.2 nmol of sPS into gel filtration columns equilibrated with the indicated [3H]glycosulfopeptides in buffer (specific activity, 1000 cpm/pmol and 8000 cpm/ml in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3).

The reactions were accomplished by adding one glycosyltransferase and one donor at a time; after the reaction was >95% complete a new glycosyltransferase and a donor were added. At each step of the synthesis, a small aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. The completeness of each reaction was easily monitored by HPLC, because the addition of each monosaccharide reduced the retention time for the peptides (data not shown). At the end of the reaction sequence the reaction mixtures were deproteinated by chloroform-methanol (2:1) extraction, and samples were further purified by HPLC. The masses of the final products (2-GSP-6 series) and of peptide products after sialyltransferase reaction (2-GSP-5 series) were verified by electrospray mass spectrometry (see Table I). The sialyltransferase products served as acceptors for the synthesis of radiolabeled peptides. Radiolabeled glycosulfopeptides (2-GP-6, 2-GSP(46)-6, 2-GSP(48)-6, 2-GSP(51)-6, 2-GSP(46,48)-6, 2-GSP(46,51)-6, 2-GSP(48,51)-6, and 2-GSP-6) were synthesized using sialyltransferase products (2-GSP-5 series) as acceptors and either GDP-[3H]Fuc (1000 cpm/pmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) or GDP-[14C]Fuc (96,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a donor in the α1,3-fucosyltransferase VI (Calbiochem) reaction.

[3H]2-GSP-5 was synthesized using 2-GSP-4 as an acceptor and CMP-[3H]NeuAc (1000 cpm/pmol) (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) as a donor in the α2,3-(N)-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem) reaction. Radiolabeled products were purified by HPLC. Isomeric glycopeptides 3-GP-6 and 3-GP-6′ were synthesized as described (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I.

The fully sulfated products 3-GSP-6 and 3-GSP-6′ were purified using HPLC, and the masses of the final products were verified using electrospray mass spectrometry (Table I). Glyco(sulfo)peptide samples were filtered on a Spin-X membrane (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and analyzed in a reversed phase C-18 HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on a Beckman System Gold HPLC. The following solvent systems were used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 1–10 min, isocratic 20% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 10–70 min, linear gradient 20–45% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (non-, mono-, and disulfated peptides); 1–10 min, isocratic 15% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 10–70 min, linear gradient 15–40% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (trisulfated peptides). The UV absorbance at 215 nm was followed, and/or the radioactivity of the collected fractions was measured. To prevent desulfation, the glycosulfopeptide products eluted from HPLC were rapidly cooled on ice and dried under vacuum. Hummel-Dreyer equilibrium gel filtration experiments were conducted in 2 ml of Sephadex G-100 columns (0.5 × 10 cm) as described (16Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J.

An sPS column (0.9 ml, 0.5 × 4.5 cm) was equilibrated with 20 ml of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3. Radiolabeled peptides dissolved in 200 μl of equilibration buffer (1000–2000 cpm, 1–10 pmol) were chromatographed in the P-selectin column by collecting 0.5-ml fractions at a flow rate of 250 μl/min. Bound peptides were eluted using 10 mmEDTA instead of divalent cations in buffer. In some experiments, 50 mm NaCl was used instead of 150 mm NaCl in buffers containing Ca2+ or EDTA (1 mm). To derive the Δ value for each bound peptide, the elution volume of unbound peptide (2 ml) was subtracted from the elution volume of bound peptide. [3H]2-GSP-6 (506,000 cpm, 0.5 nmol) was desialylated by adding 13 milliunits ofArthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (Sigma) in 400 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, for 14 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was deproteinated by chloroform-methanol (2:1) extraction and purified by HPLC. [3H]2-GP-6 (10,000 cpm, 10 pmol) was digested with Streptomyces griseusPronase E (2 mg/ml) (Sigma) in 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 for 19 h at 60 °C. Pronase was inactivated by boiling for 30 min and was removed by chloroform-methanol (2:1) extraction. The aqueous phase was dried under vacuum and dissolved by 100 μl of 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. An aliquot of Pronase-digested [3H]2-GP-6 (1, 300 cpm) was chromatographed on a P-selectin column using 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3. Electrospray mass spectra were collected in the negative ion mode using an API365 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Sciex Instruments, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Samples were dissolved in 1% triethylamine in 50% aqueous methanol to a concentration of 5 pmol/μl and injected into the mass spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Protana A/S, Odense M, Denmark). We explored the possibility that only one or two TyrSO3 residues together with a nearbyO-glycan can support high affinity binding to P-selectin. To this end we synthesized a series of glyco(sulfo)peptides corresponding to the extreme N terminus of human PSGL-1 (residues 45–61) with one, two, or three TyrSO3 residues at defined positions or without TyrSO3 residues (Fig. 1). Each glyco(sulfo)peptide contained a C-terminal Cys residue for future coupling of the peptide to artificial supports. Each glyco(sulfo)peptide was subsequently modified by purified or recombinant glycosyltransferases to generate a core-2-basedO-glycan expressing the sLex antigen at Thr-57 (Fig. 2). To compare the roles of sialic acid and fucose for binding to P-selectin, peptides with three TyrSO3 residues but having incomplete glycosylation were also synthesized (Fig. 1). Peptides with one, two, or three TyrSO3 residues (Tyr-46, -48, and/or -51) and an α-linked GalNAc residue at Thr-57 were synthesized chemically using Fmoc derivatives of TyrSO3 and tri-O-acetyl-GalNAcα-Thr during the solid phase peptide synthesis. The sulfated peptides were cleaved from the solid support under mild conditions because of the acid lability of TyrSO3 residues (20Kitagawa K. Futaki S. Yagami T. Sumi S. Inoue K. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After peptide cleavage, the C-terminal Cys of each peptide was protected by converting the free sulfhydryl into S-S-CH3 to prevent oxidation and dimerization of the peptide. After deacetylation of tri-O-acetyl-GalNAc, the peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC, characterized by mass spectrometry, and used as acceptors for enzymatic glycosylation. sLex on a core-2-basedO-glycan was synthesized on each peptide at Thr-57 using recombinant or highly purified glycosyltransferases (Fig. 2). The completeness of each glycosyltransferase reaction was easily monitored by HPLC, because the addition of each monosaccharide reduced the retention time for the peptides by ∼0.5–2 min (data not shown). Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to analyze the masses of the final products. The mass of each glyco(sulfo)peptide matched the calculated mass (Table I). Radiolabeled peptides were synthesized using either GDP-[3H]Fuc or GDP-[14C]Fuc in the reactions with α1,3-fucosyltransferase, which is the final step in the synthesis. In addition, radiolabeled glycosulfopeptides with three TyrSO3 residues but with incomplete O-glycan structure were synthesized. These glycosulfopeptides are 2-GSP-2 (core-1 O-glycan), desialylated 2-GSP-6, and 2-GSP-5, which lacks a fucose residue (Fig. 1). We previously showed that a core-2-based O-glycan containing sLex at Thr-57 together with three TyrSO3residues supported high affinity binding of a glycosulfopeptide (GSP-6) to P-selectin (16Leppänen A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) plays a central role in mRNA synthesis. The CTD is composed of 26–52 heptad repeats with the consensus sequence, YSPTSPS. These repeats are extensively phosphorylated in RNA polymerase II actively engaged in transcript elongation (2Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

In the past several years evidence has accumulated indicating that the phosphorylated form of the CTD acts to coordinate pre-mRNA processing events (for review see Refs. 6Greenleaf A.L.

Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A variety of evidence strongly suggests that the phospho-CTD is involved in splicing. The hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II colocalizes with splicing factors when transcriptionally active (15Snaar S.P. Vincent M. Dirks R.W. J. Histochem.

Several phospho-CTD binding proteins have been identified that contain SR and RRM domains as found in many splicing factors (20Yuryev A. Patturajan M. Litingtung Y. Joshi R.V. Gentile C. Gebara M.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 565-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins with a hyperphosphorylated CTD can inhibit splicing in vivo (22Du L. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, transcriptionally unengaged but phosphorylated RNA polymerase II is able to stimulate splicingin vitro (23Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the prolyl isomerase, Ess1, can bind the phosphorylated form of the CTD and that this binding is mediated by its WW domain (24Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because the prolyl isomerase activity of Ess1 preferentially acts on phospho-Ser-Pro peptide bonds, as are found in abundance in the phospho-CTD, our findings provided a plausible explanation for earlier results implicating Ess1 in pre-mRNA 3′ end formation (25Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). WW domains, named for two highly conserved tryptophan residues, are small independently folding protein domains consisting of slightly more than 30 amino acids arranged in three anti-parallel β sheets (27Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 28Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). These domains have been shown to bind proline-rich sequences containing several different motifs (29Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Of five proteins in yeast carrying the most characteristic WW domain sequences (Ess1, Rsp5, Prp40, YFL010p, and YPR152p), two are already known to bind the proline-rich CTD. As mentioned, Ess1 binds the phospho-CTD (24Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas Rsp5, a ubiquitin ligase with specificity to RNA Pol II (30Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 31Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), binds the unphosphorylated CTD via one or two of its WW domains (32Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because many WW domain-containing proteins are involved in RNA transcription or processing, it seemed likely that other WW domain proteins might have CTD or phospho-CTD binding capacity. To test this likelihood, we evaluated the CTD and phospho-CTD binding capabilities of the five yeast proteins mentioned above. In addition to Ess1, we found that Rsp5 and Prp40 can associate with the phospho-CTD. The identification of Prp40 as a phospho-CTD binding protein represents the first example of direct interaction between a documented splicing factor and the phospho-CTD. The ability of Prp40 to associate with the U1 snRNP (33Kao H.Y. Siliciano P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Neubauer G. Gottschalk A. Fabrizio P. Seraphin B. Luhrmann R. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and to bind the branch point binding protein, Msl5, is the basis for a proposed bridging between the U1 snRNP-associated 5′ splice site and the Msl5-associated branch point and 3′ splice site (35Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus the phospho-CTD binding ability of Prp40 suggests a role for the phospho-CTD in commitment complex formation. Interestingly, Prp40 appears to be part of an orthologous group which includes a single protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster and two proteins from mammals (FBP11 and HYPC). Each of these proteins has a pair of WW domains amino-terminal to a series of six FF repeats, a recently identified motif often associated with WW domains (36Bedford M.T. Leder P. Trends Biochem Sci. 1999; 24: 264-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of these apparent Prp40 orthologs, FBP11, has been experimentally implicated in splicing: paralleling the Prp40 interaction with the yeast branch point binding protein, Msl5, FBP11 has been shown to bind a mammalian branch point binding protein, SF1 (37Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Concurrent with the present work, a human protein with both WW and FF domains, CA150, was independently identified as a phospho-CTD binding protein (38Carty S.M. Goldstrohm A. Suñe C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that sites in the FF region of CA150 bind the phospho-CTD. In parallel with those results, we show here that although the Prp40 WW domains can bind the phospho-CTD, at least two other phospho-CTD binding sites are present in the FF region of Prp40. Three of the five yeast proteins with characteristic WW domains have now been shown to bind the CTD or phospho-CTD, at least in part through interactions mediated by WW domains. Because similar WW domains are found in dozens of homologs in higher eukaryotes, it seems very likely that many of these proteins will also interact directly with the CTD. GST-Ess1 was constructed and expressed as previously reported (24Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly, other GST fusion proteins were expressed using plasmids created by ligating appropriately digested polymerase chain reaction products into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the polylinker of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification were as described previously using modified elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mm NaCl brought to pH 8.5–9 with NaOH) for all proteins (24Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amount of full size fusion protein present was crudely estimated by Coomassie staining of gels and comparison with broad range molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad). Yeast CTD kinase I was used as described previously to exhaustively phosphorylate β-Gal-yCTD or GST-yCTD fusion proteins (39Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each reaction was monitored to ensure quantitative shift of the fusion protein to slower mobility characteristic of hyperphosphorylated CTD. Proteins were run on 4–15% precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) until the dye front was 5 mm from the gel bottom. Gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer (Tris/Glycine, 20% Methanol) for 15 min at room temperature prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 0.5 A (5 °C in a 6 liter tank). Blots were incubated overnight in clarified blocking/renaturation buffer (cBRB) with rocking (this and subsequent steps at 5 °C). cBRB was prepared by dissolving 3% nonfat dry milk in 1× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material. Blots were probed with β-Gal-yCTD or with fully shifted phospho-β-Gal-yCTD or phospho-GST-yCTD in 10 ml of cBRB with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h. For direct probing blots were reacted with 32P-labeled phospho-CTD. These blots were then washed for 8 min with 100 ml of PBS-Tw (1× PBS, 0.2% Tween-20, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmPMSF) and three times for 8 min with 50 ml of PBS-Tw. The blots were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For linked Far Western assays using either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated β-Gal-yCTD as probe, mouse anti-β-galactosidase (Sigma G 4644) was used as a 1° antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma A9917) was used as 2° antibody. Blots were incubated 15 min with 1° and 2° antibodies, whereas washes were 4 × 50 ml for 3 min. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemilumnescent Substrate (Pierce 34080) and Biomax film (Kodak 870 1302). GST fusion proteins were exchanged into 1× PBS with 1 mm PMSF by repeated concentration and dilution in a microcon 10 unit (Amicon). Proteins were adsorbed to glutathione beads to a concentration of about 1 mg of full sized fusion protein per ml of beads. Beads were equilibrated with prebead buffer (1× PBS, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2% Tween-20, and 5 mm NaF) and resuspended to a 50% slurry. Prebead solution (80 μl) containing both β-Gal-yCTD and32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD in prebead buffer was combined with 20 μl of 50% slurry of beads in 250-μl tubes. Sample tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with mixing by inversion then spun at 500 × g for 30 s to pellet the matrix. Supernatant was removed from each tube (80 μl), mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol (2× SB) and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. The beads and solution remaining (20 μl) were combined with 2× SB and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. All sample were vortexed and spun at 500 × g prior to loading on 4–15% precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of supernatant and bead solutions (15 μl) were loaded; however, to account for protein dilution of these samples by the beads only 12 μl of the more concentrated prebead solution was used. Gels were stained with Coomassie, dried on filter paper, and analyzed by PhosphorImager. As part of ongoing efforts to elucidate the role of CTD kinases and CTD phosphorylation in transcription-coupled events, we are identifying proteins capable of binding the CTD and phospho-CTD. In part because two of the five yeast proteins containing characteristic WW domains were CTD or phospho-CTD binding proteins (Ess1 and Rsp5), and a third (Prp40) was involved in pre-mRNA processing, we decided to test the CTD and phospho-CTD binding capability of all five of these proteins (Ess1, Rsp5, Prp40, YFL010p, and YPR152p). The WW domains of these proteins (Fig. 1) contain conserved residues found in many mammalian WW proteins. Other WW proteins are almost certainly present in yeast (e.g. Nop8), but none of these WW domains has all of the characteristic conserved residues. To investigate CTD and phospho-CTD binding by the yeast WW proteins, we used β-Gal and GST fusion proteins containing the yCTD. These yCTD-containing fusion proteins can be quantitatively hyperphosphorylated by yeast CTD kinase I, generating a product displaying the gel mobility shift characteristic of the phospho-CTD (39Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous quantitations lead to estimates of the number of phosphates per CTD at from 20 to 45 (40). 2D. Morris, unpublished results. Thus, although most repeats contain one or more phosphates, it is possible that a small number of repeats lack a phosphate. When equal amounts of full sized GST fusion proteins for all five WW proteins were loaded on a gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Far Western using 32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD (Fig. 2) or 32P-labeled GST-yCTD (data not shown), both Rsp5 and Prp40 clearly bound the phospho-CTD, although the signal was somewhat weaker than for Ess1 (Fig. 2). This result was replicated with a linked Far Western assay (data not shown) using hyperphosphorylated β-Gal-yCTD as probe (see “Materials and Methods”). Controls documenting the rarity of nonspecific interactions include the unstained molecular mass markers (Fig. 2, lane 1) and total Escherichia coliproteins (Fig. 2, lane 12). The bacterial extract was used because E. coli RNA polymerase lacks a CTD, and thusE. coli should have no natural CTD or phospho-CTD binding proteins. In lanes overloaded with E. coli proteins two light nonspecific bands were sometimes observed (Fig. 2, lane 12).Figure 1Five yeast proteins contain characteristic WW domains. The WW domains of Ess1, Rsp5, Prp40, YFL010p, and YPR152p contain both conserved Trp residues that give the domain its name, a Pro residue three amino acids after the carboxyl-most Trp, and a central set of three hydrophobic residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Analysis of phospho-CTD binding by five WW domain-containing yeast proteins.

The expected masses of GST-Ess1 (45 kDa), GST-YFL010p (49 kDa), GST-Prp40 (95 kDa), and GST-Rsp5 (118 kDa) are consistent with the apparent masses observed by SDS-PAGE; however, the expected mass of GST-YPR152 (80 kDa) is slightly below its apparent mass of 95 kDa. Proteins of one gel were electroblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with hyperphosphorylated32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD, after which the bound label was detected by PhosphorImager. In addition to Ess1, both Prp40 and Rsp5 bound the phospho-CTD. Lane 1 contains Bio-Rad broad range markers of the masses indicated (∼1 μg/band).

Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the RNA Pol II-directed ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, bound strongly to the unphosphorylated CTD (Fig. 3,lanes 11 and 12). We note that some of the fragments of GST-Rsp5 bound by the phospho-CTD (Fig. 2, lanes 10 and 11) and the CTD (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and12) are different. This observation argues that association with the phospho-CTD probe is not simply a consequence of binding rare unphosphorylated repeats. Perhaps significantly, full-length GST-YFL010p did not react with the CTD, whereas a proteolytic fragment bound the unphosphorylated CTD with sufficient affinity to give a clear signal (Fig. 3, lane 5). This signal occurs under exposure conditions in which all of the E. coli proteins gave no signal (Fig. 3, lane 13). The strong signal in the unstained markers (Fig. 3, lane 1) is a useful positive control that results from the anti-β-Gal antibodies reacting with β-Gal and fragments thereof present in the markers. Under the same conditions used for Fig. 3, a control blot probed using β-Gal showed no binding to any WW domain protein (data not shown). A recognized problem with Far Western analysis is that many protein domains will not renature after SDS denaturation while plastered to nitrocellulose. Because this appears to be the case for some domains of Prp40 (see below), we determined the ability of the CTD and phospho-CTD to bind in solution to bead-bound GST-Ess1, GST-YFL010p, GST-YPR152p, or GST-Rsp5 (Fig. 4). The experiment simultaneously partitioned the CTD (β-Gal-yCTD) and phospho-CTD (32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD) between the solution and beads. In general agreement with the Far Western analysis, GST-YFL010p and GST-YPR152p bound neither form of the CTD, whereas GST-Ess1 bound only the phospho-CTD and GST-Rsp5 bound the CTD and phospho-CTD. To further characterize the phospho-CTD binding properties of Prp40, we expressed segments of Prp40 as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 5 A). In addition to two amino-terminal WW domains, Prp40 contains a series of six FF motifs. These motifs were identified by sequence homology and named for two conserved phenylanlanine residues present in most of the founding members (36Bedford M.T. Leder P. Trends Biochem Sci. 1999; 24: 264-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each of the fusion proteins and full-length GST-Prp40 were analyzed by Far Western using the direct assay with32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD (Fig. 5 B). Of the Prp40 segments, GST-WW and GST-WW/FF2 clearly bound the phospho-CTD, whereas GST-FF1/FF2 and GST-cFF apparently did not. Note that combining the WW and FF1/FF2 regions (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and5) significantly increased binding relative to the WW domains alone (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and3). Further, addition of the cFF region in the full sized Prp40 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10 and 11) resulted in another increase in signal intensity. One of the many potential explanations for this behavior is that the FF regions provide some increase in overall binding affinity even though the individual FF regions bound with insufficient affinity to generate a signal under far Western conditions. This hypothesis was made more attractive by the multiple phospho-CTD binding sites present in CA150 (38Carty S.M. Goldstrohm A. Suñe C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a human homolog of Prp40. Like Prp40, CA150 contains WW domains amino-terminal to a series of FF motifs. Unlike Prp40, far Western analysis of the domains of CA150 suggested that the major phospho-CTD binding site resided in the FF region. To test the hypothesis that the FF motifs of Prp40 were phospho-CTD binding sites by an independent method, each of the segments of Prp40 was bound to beads and in-solution binding to 32P-labeled β-Gal-yCTD measured (Fig. 6). In contrast to results from the Far Western, each of the individual segments of Prp40 bound the phospho-CTD. Most dramatically, beads with GST-cFF (Fig. 6, lane 14) were at least as effective at binding the phospho-CTD as were beads with GST-WW (Fig. 6, lane 5). Binding was specific to the phosphorylated CTD because none of the Prp40 segments bound the unphosphorylated CTD significantly. That each of these fragments has some ability to bind to the phospho-CTD demonstrates Prp40 contains at least three independent phospho-CTD binding sites. As will be discussed below, the repetitive nature of the CTD makes it ideal for multi-site binding. The failure of the FF segments to individually bind the phospho-CTD during Far Western analysis probably resulted from the failure of these motifs to renature sufficiently to generate a signal. The finding that CA150, a mammalian protein with WW and FF domains similar to those in Prp40, also possesses multi-site phospho-CTD binding capability (38Carty S.M. Goldstrohm A. Suñe C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) supports the conclusion that this property is functionally significant, and it argues for some degree of mechanistic similarity between Prp40 and CA150. However, two other mammalian proteins, FBP11 and HYPC, are more closely related to Prp40 than is CA150. Indeed, it is quite likely that these two mammalian proteins and Prp40 are part of an orthologous group, which also includes a single protein from S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster (Fig. 7). All six orthologs have a distinctive and highly conserved pair of WW domains (Fig. 7 B). Alignment within the FF region (Fig. 7 C) suggests that all six orthologs contain six FF motifs, and each motif is part of a repeating unit about 70 amino acids in length. Some of the FF motifs are not readily apparent in Prp40; however, comparison with the more conserved proteins of the multicellular organisms strongly suggests their presence. In addition, all of the orthologs have complete conservation of spacing between the FF motifs. Aside from the members of this group, the next closest homolog to Prp40 is CA150 and its probable orthologs in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, zebrafish, and mouse.2 Yeast offers a relatively simple system in which to examine the behavior of a family of domains and the proteins that contain them. Previously, two of five yeast proteins containing a WW domain similar to those found in many mammalian proteins had been identified as CTD or phospho-CTD binding proteins (32Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The present study documents phospho-CTD binding by Prp40 and Rsp5 as well as potential CTD binding by YFL010p. The demonstration that the WW domains of Prp40 can associate with the phospho-CTD reinforces the idea that WW domains are suited to be CTD interacting domains. However, CTD or phospho-CTD binding by a WW domain does not exclude the possibility that the domain also binds other proline-rich targets. Furthermore, in vitroCTD or phospho-CTD binding may not always be functionally significant. The ability of a particular WW domain to bind to any protein has to be evaluated in the context of the functional behavior of each protein. In the present context, Ess1 (25Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) have all been linked to processes associated with transcription, where contact with a the CTD or phospho-CTD is likely. The ability of Rsp5 to bind both the CTD and the phospho-CTD may have important implications for its role in degradation of RNA polymerase II. Although the observed phospho-CTD binding could conceivably be a consequence of the association of Rsp5 with rare unphosphorylated repeats in the phospho-CTD, the ability of some proteolytic fragments to bind only the phospho-CTD argues for a distinct phospho-CTD binding site. The presence of sites for binding both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CTD repeats suggests that RNA Pol II with a partially dephosphorylated CTD may be the in vivo target of Rsp5. Given the multi-site phospho-CTD binding properties of Prp40, the absence of binding by YPR152p was somewhat unexpected. YPR152p not only has a Prp40-like WW domain but also has at least one FF domain (36Bedford M.T. Leder P. Trends Biochem Sci. 1999; 24: 264-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the presence of both a Prp40-like WW domain and an FF motif suggests this protein may have a role in splicing. The inability of full-length YFL010p to interact with either form of the CTD is intriguing, because a less abundant fragment clearly bound the unphosphorylated CTD. The possibility that the amino acids missing from the fragment act as a negative regulatory domain is under further study. The identification of Prp40 as a phospho-CTD binding protein could connect the phosphorylated CTD to the earliest stages of commitment complex formation and may provide a molecular basis for the increasing number of reports linking the phosphorylated CTD and splicing (15Snaar S.P.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Further, the multi-site binding observed for association of Prp40 with the phospho-CTD has far reaching implications not only for splicing but probably for the behavior of many phospho-CTD binding proteins. The repeated nature of the CTD makes this domain an ideal target for multi-site binding events. A formal treatment of the consequences of two proteins interacting at two sites was first done by Jencks (41Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4050-4056Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar) in the early 1980s and has been termed the A-B site problem. The essence of the analysis is that the first binding event localizes the second set of binding sites in each others presence. Stated alternatively, much of the entropy lost upon binding of protein A and B occurs with the first binding event resulting in less entropy loss upon the second binding event. As a consequence of the decrease in this entropic factor, the observed binding constants for multi-site interactions can be dramatically lower than would be expected from addition of the binding energies of the individual sites. To examine the consequence of multiple repeats on the potential of the CTD for multi-site binding, it is instructive to use some illustrative calculations. Given the 26 repeats in the yeast CTD, the repeat motif in the CTD will achieve very high concentrations in some local environment near RNA Pol II. For instance, the diameter of a sphere containing a yeast CTD in which the seven amino acid repeats are 10 mm is 202 angstroms. Given the relatively unstructured nature of the CTD (42Cagas P.M. Corden J.L. Proteins. 1995; 21: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is quite possible the yeast CTD can extend to the edge of a 202-angstrom sphere because the radius of this sphere (101 angstroms) is much shorter than the fully extended length of the CTD (about 655 (182 × 3.6) angstroms). Thus in the environment around RNA Pol II even relatively weak binding sites (mm Kd s) may bind the CTD. Although the present data for Prp40 do not document an entropic contribution from multi-site binding, it seems very likely that constraining several binding sites in an environment with a high concentration of phosphorylated repeats will significantly contribute to phospho-CTD binding behavior of Prp40. The presence of Prp40 in the U1 snRNP (33Kao H.Y. Siliciano P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Neubauer G. Gottschalk A. Fabrizio P. Seraphin B. Luhrmann R. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and its ability to interact with the branchpoint binding protein, Msl5, are the basis for the proposal that Prp40 functions as a connector linking the U1 snRNP at the 5′ site with the Msl5/Mud2 complex at the branch point/3′ splice site (35Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The ability of Prp40 to bind the phosphorylated CTD consequently suggests the phospho-CTD may play a role in the initial steps of spliceosome assembly, perhaps by speeding association of Prp40 with the U1 snRNP or by facilitating formation of a bridging complex. The fact that the WW domains of Prp40 can bind both the phospho-CTD and Msl5 may have important functional significance. This feature of Prp40 raises issues of interdomain binding order and specificity. For example, binding of the phospho-CTD to the WW domains might prevent premature association of Prp40 with free Msl5 prior to Msl5 binding to the 3′ splice site. At this point the colocalized Msl5 may achieve a high enough local concentration to displace the phospho-CTD. It should be noted that a detailed examination of WW domain binding specificity revealed considerable promiscuity in the target sequence (43Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that a single WW domain could be capable of binding the phospho-CTD and the proline-rich region of Msl5. On the other hand, it may be that the two WW domains of Prp40 have different specificity, one binding the phospho-CTD and one binding Msl5. Considerably more work will be required to elucidate the details of these interactions. The existence of a family of proteins orthologous to Prp40 by sequence suggests these proteins and their individual domains may have conserved functions. The fact that the WW domain region of Prp40 can bind the phospho-CTD and is highly conserved in the orthologs suggests the phospho-CTD binding ability will also be conserved. Similarly, conservation of the FF region argues for conservation of multi-site phospho-CTD binding. In addition, the conservation of multi-site phospho-CTD binding in CA150 (38Carty S.M. Goldstrohm A. Suñe C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which contains related WW domains and a six-repeat FF motif region, strongly suggests the Prp40 orthologs will retain phospho-CTD binding ability. Evidence that the Prp40 orthologs play a conserved role in splicing is also available. The WW domains of Prp40 have been shown to bind directly to the branch point binding protein, Msl5 (35Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Similarly the WW domains of FBP11 have been shown to bind directly to a mammalian branch point binding protein, SF1, through a PPLP motif in SF1 (37Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although this exact motif is not present in Msl5, there is a proline-rich amino-terminal region containing two PPL sequences. The present study combined with previously published data suggests a model for phospho-CTD enhancement of splicing. The association of Prp40 with the phospho-CTD suggests that the U1 snRNP will remain associated with transcribing RNA Pol II. As a consequence, the U1 snRNP and Prp40 may be positioned to efficiently interact with Msl5 after this protein binds the branch point near the 3′ splice site. In this manner, the phospho-CTD could facilitate the association of the 3′ and 5′ splice sites, an obvious benefit, particularly in mammalian systems where these sites can be separated by many kilobases. A similar model has been suggested based on the ability of RNA polymerase II to enhance commitment complex formation in mammalian cell extracts (23Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Clearly the mammalian homologs of Prp40 could play a central role in this process. Because commitment complex formation and splicing can be reconstituted in vitro in the absence RNA Pol II (44Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 45Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P. Gesteland R.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar), it seems plausible that a principal function of the phospho-CTDvis á vis splicing may be to increase the efficiency of the process rather than to perform a discrete obligatory step in the pathway. Such a facilitating role, consisting mainly of recruiting critical components to the RNA Pol II neighborhood, could certainly contribute to the speed of the overall process; it could also modulate specificity of the process, such as splice site choice. The potential that the phospho-CTD may be the landing platform for regulatory factors controlling commitment complex formation has far reaching implications. We thank Dr. Mariano Garcia-Blanco for excellent scientific advice."

Previous studies on recombinant receptors have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) and PKA directly phosphorylate intracellular serine residues within the receptor β subunit and modulate receptor function. However, the relevance of this regulation for neuronal receptors remains poorly characterized. To address this critical issue, we have studied phosphorylation and functional modulation of GABAAreceptors in cultured cortical neurons. Here we show that the neuronal β3 subunit is basally phosphorylated on serine residues by a PKC-dependent pathway. PKC inhibitors abolish basal phosphorylation, increasing receptor activity, whereas activators of PKC enhance β3 phosphorylation with a concomitant decrease in receptor activity. PKA activators were shown to increase the phosphorylation of the β3 subunit only in the presence of PKC inhibitors. We also show that the main sites of phosphorylation within the neuronal β3 subunit are likely to include Ser-408 and Ser-409, residues that are important for the functional modulation of β3-containing recombinant receptors. Furthermore, PKC activation did not change the total number of GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane, suggesting that the effects of PKC activation are on the gating or conductance of the channel. Together, these results illustrate that cell-signaling pathways that activate PKC may have profound effects on the efficacy of synaptic inhibition by directly modulating GABAA receptor function.

Much emphasis has focused on the role of receptor phosphorylation because the observation that purified receptor preparations are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (5Kirkness E.F.

Specifically, the β subunits are phosphorylated on a conserved serine residue (Ser-409 or Ser-410) by PKC, PKA, Ca2+/Calmodulindependent protein kinase (CamKII), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (8Moss S.J.

GABAA receptors are also substrates of the prototypic tyrosine kinase SRC which predominately phosphorylates Tyr-365 and Tyr-367 within the γ2 subunit (13Moss S.J. Gorrie G. Amato A. Smart T.G.

Neurosci. 1996; 39: 1-52Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 17Smart T.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies have revealed that receptor function can be modulated by agents that modify the activity of PKC or PKA. However, whether changes in the levels of the phosphorylation of GABAA receptor subunits underpin these changes in receptor function remains unknown.To address this issue we have used both biochemical and electrophysiological methodologies to examine the regulation of GABAA receptor function by protein kinase activity in cultured cortical neurons. Our results reveal that the β3 subunit is basally phosphorylated by a PKC-dependent pathway. PKC inhibitors abolish this basal phosphorylation with an increase in channel activity. Whereas activators of PKC enhance the level of β3 phosphorylation leading to a decrease in channel activity. We show that this differential modulation of channel function is underpinned by changes in stoichiometry of receptor phosphorylation. Activators of PKA only increase the level of β3 phosphorylation in the presence of PKC inhibitors, suggestive of a complex interplay between different protein kinases and the receptor. Our results suggest that cell signaling pathways that control the activity of PKC may have profound effects on GABAA-mediated synaptic inhibition by directly modulating the level of receptor phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONGABAA receptors are major mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain, as well as important drug targets (1Macdonald R.L.

Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus it is of central importance to understand the regulation of the functional properties of these receptors in their native environment. Studies on recombinant receptors have suggested that direct receptor phosphorylation of key conserved serine residues within the β and γ2 subunits is a means of regulating GABAA receptor function via PKA and PKC activation (12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Moss S.J. Gorrie G. Amato A. Smart T.G.

Kinase activation or inhibition can have significant effects on GABAA receptor function in neurons (15Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Int. Rev.

Physiol. 1999; 521: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but the identity of the cell signaling pathways that control receptor phosphorylation in the brain remain completely unknown.To examine this issue we have studied the regulation of GABAA receptors by protein kinases in cortical neurons, using electrophysiological, biochemical, and cell biological methodologies. Receptor phosphorylation was analyzed via immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for the β1/3 subunits from32P-prelabeled cortical neurons. This antisera immunoprecipitated a phosphoprotein of 57 kDa, which we confirmed as the β3 subunit. The basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit was found to be dependent on a PKC-dependent pathway in these neurons. These findings correlate well with the study of recombinant receptors, which have revealed that the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit is phosphorylated on Ser-408/409 by PKC (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit by PKC activity is also in keeping with the association of GABAA receptors with the βII isoform of PKC and RACK-1 in cortical neurons (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intimate association of these signaling molecules with GABAAreceptors is presumably responsible for the high basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit seen in this study. Furthermore, activation of PKC in cortical neurons by PDBu increases the level of PKC-βII bound to the β3 subunit (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a resulting increase in the stoichiometry of GABAA receptor phosphorylation shown here (Fig. 5). The β3 subunit is also a PKA substrate, and the major sites of phosphorylation in A293 cells have been identified as Ser-408 and Ser-409 (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the β3 subunit in cortical neurons by a PKA-dependent mechanism was also evident but only in the presence of PKC inhibitors. This observation suggests a complex interplay between GABAA receptors and different signaling pathways in neurons. One intriguing mechanism to explain our observations is that PKC-mediated phosphorylation occludes PKA-mediated phosphorylation, via the direct binding of PKC or RACK-1 to the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To directly compare the sites of phosphorylation within the β3 subunit to those identified in recombinant receptors, we utilized peptide mapping. Both PKA and PKC phosphorylate Ser-408 and Ser-409 within the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit expressed either as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein or in A293 cells (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The peptide maps of the β3 subunit phosphorylated by PKC or PKA in neurons were very similar to the peptide map of the β3 subunit expressed in A293 cells. These results suggest that in neurons, the major phosphorylation sites within the β3 subunit are likely to include Ser-408 and Ser-409. These residues have been previously identified in recombinant receptors and play a critical role in mediating functional modulation of GABAA receptors by kinase activity (9Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).To identify the functional consequences of modulating the level of β3 subunit phosphorylation in neurons, electrophysiological recordings were utilized. Inhibition of PKC with calphostin C produced a time dependent increase in whole cell currents. In contrast, PDBu produced a time-dependent decrease in whole cell currents. Together these results show that changes in receptor function correlate precisely with changes in β3 subunit phosphorylation. However, to definitively prove that these functional effects are mediated by direct phosphorylation of the β3 subunit awaits the production of mice in which selective GABAA receptor phosphorylation sites have been ablated by homologous recombination. Interestingly, there did not appear to be any obvious relationship between the magnitude in the changes of β3 subunit phosphorylation seen on PDBu treatment (2.4-fold increase in 32P incorporation) and the modest reduction in whole cell currents (25% decrease in 61% of neurons). However, given that cortical neurons express a large multiplicity of GABAA receptor subunits, this discrepancy may result from receptor heterogeneity, with distinct receptor populations that are differentially regulated by PKC activity (29Brünig I. Sommer M. Hatt H. Bormann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.(U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Poisbeau P. Cheney M. Browning M. Mody I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Dose-response analysis revealed that PKC activity affected the maximal GABA evoked response with no effects on agonist potency in cortical neurons. This is consistent with previous studies on recombinant receptors composed of α1β1, α1β1γ2S, and α1β1γ2L where PKC phosphorylates sites within the β1, γ2S, and γ2L subunits (10Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the case of β3 subunit-containing receptors, PKC activation inhibits α1β3γ2L containing receptors via phosphorylation of Ser-408/409 in β3 and Ser-327/343 in γ2L. 2S. J. Moss and T. G. Smart, manuscript in preparation. PKC activity can also produce large reductions (80%) in cell surface levels of α1β1-3γ2S-containing receptors expressed in A293 cells andXenopus oocytes, independent of direct receptor phosphorylation (19Connolly C.N.

To determine whether PKC activity in cortical neurons had any effect on cell surface expression, cell surface receptor levels were evaluated by whole cell ELISA. No significant difference between control cultures and those exposed to PKC activators could be seen. If receptor internalization was of major significance in our experiments a decrease of 15.5% in cell surface expression would be expected. This figure is based upon 61% of neurons being responsive to PDBu in the electrophysiological experiments and showing on average a 25% decrease in GABA-mediated response. It is possible that this figure underestimates the true level of internalization because of a masking effect of PDBu insensitive neurons. This difference in the effects of PKC activity on the cell surface expression of recombinant and neuronal receptors may reflect the specific anchoring of GABAA receptors to the cytoskeleton by molecules such as gephyrin and/or GABARAP in neurons, as compared with heterologous expression systems (32Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Luscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 33Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester treatment has also been reported to inhibit GABAA receptor function in a number of neuronal preparations including synaptosomes and ganglionic neurons (10Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 34Leidenheimer N.J. McQuilkin S.J. Hahner L.D. Whiting P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar). However PKC activity can enhance GABAA receptor function in olfactory and hippocampal neurons (29Brünig I. Sommer M. Hatt H. Bormann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.(U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Poisbeau P. Cheney M. Browning M. Mody I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these differential effects of PKC activation result from heterogeneity of GABAA receptor structure or the activation of differing cell signaling pathways by PKC activity remains to be established. The importance of PKC activity in modulating GABAA receptor function has recently been suggested by deletion of either the γ or ε PKC isoforms in mice resulting in altered GABAAreceptor pharmacology (35Harris R.A.

Therefore, neurotransmitters and other cell signaling molecules that activate PKC signaling pathways may have profound effects on synaptic inhibition via direct modulation of GABAA receptor subunit phosphorylation. GABAA1receptors are key mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. These receptors are pentameric hetero-oligomers that can be assembled from 6 subunit classes with multiple members: α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ε, and θ subunits (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

Heterologous co-expression of receptor α, β, and γ subunits has been shown to reproduce many of the physiological and pharmacological properties of neuronal GABAA receptors (1Macdonald R.L.

There is considerable interest in understanding the endogenous mechanisms used by neurons to regulate GABAA receptor function. Much emphasis has focused on the role of receptor phosphorylation because the observation that purified receptor preparations are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (5Kirkness E.F. Bovenkerk C.F. Ueda T. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Browning M.D. Bureau M. Dudek E.M. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.(U. S.

Res. 1993; 18: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies on recombinant receptors have revealed that receptor β and γ subunits are substrates for a number of protein kinases. Specifically, the β subunits are phosphorylated on a conserved serine residue (Ser-409 or Ser-410) by PKC, PKA, Ca2+/Calmodulindependent protein kinase (CamKII), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (8Moss S.J.

Ser-408 is also a PKA substrate in the β3 subunit (12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are also substrates of the prototypic tyrosine kinase SRC which predominately phosphorylates Tyr-365 and Tyr-367 within the γ2 subunit (13Moss S.J. Gorrie G. Amato A. Smart T.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Valenzuela C.F. Machu T.K. McKernan R.M. Whiting P. VanRenterghem B.B. McManaman J.L. Brozowski S.J. Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Harris R.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 31: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of recombinant receptors by either PKA or PKC causes diverse functional effects ranging from enhancements to inhibitions depending on the identity of the expressed subunits, the identity of the sites phosphorylated and the mode of kinase activation (12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Int. Rev.

Sommer M. Hatt H. Bormann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.(U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Poisbeau P. Cheney M. Browning M. Mody I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Dose-response analysis revealed that PKC activity affected the maximal GABA evoked response with no effects on agonist potency in cortical neurons. This is consistent with previous studies on recombinant receptors composed of α1β1, α1β1γ2S, and α1β1γ2L where PKC phosphorylates sites within the β1, γ2S, and γ2L subunits (10Krishek B.J. Xie X.

In the case of β3 subunit-containing receptors, PKC activation inhibits α1β3γ2L containing receptors via phosphorylation of Ser-408/409 in β3 and Ser-327/343 in γ2L. 2S. J. Moss and T. G. Smart, manuscript in preparation. PKC activity can also produce large reductions (80%) in cell surface levels of α1β1-3γ2S-containing receptors expressed in A293 cells andXenopus oocytes, independent of direct receptor phosphorylation (19Connolly C.N.

To determine whether PKC activity in cortical neurons had any effect on cell surface expression, cell surface receptor levels were evaluated by whole cell ELISA. No significant difference between control cultures and those exposed to PKC activators could be seen. If receptor internalization was of major significance in our experiments a decrease of 15.5% in cell surface expression would be expected. This figure is based upon 61% of neurons being responsive to PDBu in the electrophysiological experiments and showing on average a 25% decrease in GABA-mediated response. It is possible that this figure underestimates the true level of internalization because of a masking effect of PDBu insensitive neurons. This difference in the effects of PKC activity on the cell surface expression of recombinant and neuronal receptors may reflect the specific anchoring of GABAA receptors to the cytoskeleton by molecules such as gephyrin and/or GABARAP in neurons, as compared with heterologous expression systems (32Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Luscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 33Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester treatment has also been reported to inhibit GABAA receptor function in a number of neuronal preparations including synaptosomes and ganglionic neurons (10Krishek B.J. Xie X.

Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar). However PKC activity can enhance GABAA receptor function in olfactory and hippocampal neurons (29Brünig I. Sommer M. Hatt H. Bormann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.(U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Poisbeau P. Cheney M. Browning M. Mody I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these differential effects of PKC activation result from heterogeneity of GABAA receptor structure or the activation of differing cell signaling pathways by PKC activity remains to be established. The importance of PKC activity in modulating GABAA receptor function has recently been suggested by deletion of either the γ or ε PKC isoforms in mice resulting in altered GABAAreceptor pharmacology (35Harris R.A. McQuilkin S.J. Paylor R. Abeliovich A. Tonegawa S. Wehner J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc.i (U. S. A.). 1995; 92: 3658-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36Hodge C.W. Mehmert K.K. Kelley S.P. McMahon T. Haywood A. Olive M.F. Wang D. Sanchez-Perez A.M. Messing R.O. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GABAA receptor function and phosphorylation can be dynamically regulated by PKC activity in intact neurons. Therefore, neurotransmitters and other cell signaling molecules that activate PKC signaling pathways may have profound effects on synaptic inhibition via direct modulation of GABAA receptor subunit phosphorylation. GABAA receptors are major mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain, as well as important drug targets (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 2Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus it is of central importance to understand the regulation of the functional properties of these receptors in their native environment. Studies on recombinant receptors have suggested that direct receptor phosphorylation of key conserved serine residues within the β and γ2 subunits is a means of regulating GABAA receptor function via PKA and PKC activation (12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Moss S.J. Gorrie G. Amato A. Smart T.G.

Kinase activation or inhibition can have significant effects on GABAA receptor function in neurons (15Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Int. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 39: 1-52Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7626-7633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brünig I. Sommer M. Hatt H. Bormann J. Proc.

Physiol. 1999; 521: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but the identity of the cell signaling pathways that control receptor phosphorylation in the brain remain completely unknown. To examine this issue we have studied the regulation of GABAA receptors by protein kinases in cortical neurons, using electrophysiological, biochemical, and cell biological methodologies. Receptor phosphorylation was analyzed via immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for the β1/3 subunits from32P-prelabeled cortical neurons. This antisera immunoprecipitated a phosphoprotein of 57 kDa, which we confirmed as the β3 subunit. The basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit was found to be dependent on a PKC-dependent pathway in these neurons. These findings correlate well with the study of recombinant receptors, which have revealed that the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit is phosphorylated on Ser-408/409 by PKC (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit by PKC activity is also in keeping with the association of GABAA receptors with the βII isoform of PKC and RACK-1 in cortical neurons (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intimate association of these signaling molecules with GABAAreceptors is presumably responsible for the high basal phosphorylation of the β3 subunit seen in this study. Furthermore, activation of PKC in cortical neurons by PDBu increases the level of PKC-βII bound to the β3 subunit (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a resulting increase in the stoichiometry of GABAA receptor phosphorylation shown here (Fig. 5). The β3 subunit is also a PKA substrate, and the major sites of phosphorylation in A293 cells have been identified as Ser-408 and Ser-409 (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the β3 subunit in cortical neurons by a PKA-dependent mechanism was also evident but only in the presence of PKC inhibitors. This observation suggests a complex interplay between GABAA receptors and different signaling pathways in neurons. One intriguing mechanism to explain our observations is that PKC-mediated phosphorylation occludes PKA-mediated phosphorylation, via the direct binding of PKC or RACK-1 to the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit (18Brandon N. Uren J. Kittler J.T. Wang H. Olsen R.W. Parker P.J. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9228-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly compare the sites of phosphorylation within the β3 subunit to those identified in recombinant receptors, we utilized peptide mapping. Both PKA and PKC phosphorylate Ser-408 and Ser-409 within the intracellular domain of the β3 subunit expressed either as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein or in A293 cells (11McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The peptide maps of the β3 subunit phosphorylated by PKC or PKA in neurons were very similar to the peptide map of the β3 subunit expressed in A293 cells. These results suggest that in neurons, the major phosphorylation sites within the β3 subunit are likely to include Ser-408 and Ser-409. These residues have been previously identified in recombinant receptors and play a critical role in mediating functional modulation of GABAA receptors by kinase activity (9Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To identify the functional consequences of modulating the level of β3 subunit phosphorylation in neurons, electrophysiological recordings were utilized. Inhibition of PKC with calphostin C produced a time dependent increase in whole cell currents. In contrast, PDBu produced a time-dependent decrease in whole cell currents. Together these results show that changes in receptor function correlate precisely with changes in β3 subunit phosphorylation. However, to definitively prove that these functional effects are mediated by direct phosphorylation of the β3 subunit awaits the production of mice in which selective GABAA receptor phosphorylation sites have been ablated by homologous recombination. Interestingly, there did not appear to be any obvious relationship between the magnitude in the changes of β3 subunit phosphorylation seen on PDBu treatment (2.4-fold increase in 32P incorporation) and the modest reduction in whole cell currents (25% decrease in 61% of neurons).

We show that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D causes a complete inhibition of FAK but does not inhibit Shc signaling and activation of ERK. We have then generated primary fibroblasts carrying a targeted deletion of the segment of β1 subunit cytoplasmic domain required for activation of FAK. Analysis of these cells indicates that FAK is not necessary for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, association of Shc with Grb2, and activation of ERK in response to matrix adhesion. In addition, integrin-mediated activation of FAK does not appear to be required for signaling to ERK following growth factor stimulation. To examine if FAK could contribute to the activation of ERK in a cell type-specific manner through the Rap1/B-Raf pathway, we have used Swiss-3T3 cells, which in contrast to primary fibroblasts express B-Raf. Dominant negative studies indicate that Shc mediates the early phase and peak, whereas FAK, p130CAS, Crk, and Rap1 contribute to the late phase of integrin-dependent activation of ERK in these cells. In addition, introduction of B-Raf enhances and sustains integrin-mediated activation of ERK in wild-type primary fibroblasts but not in those carrying the targeted deletion of the β1 cytoplasmic domain. Thus, the Shc and FAK pathways are activated independently and function in a parallel fashion.

The divergent effects of the ECM on the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells imply that subsets of integrins, and possibly individual integrins, activate specific signaling pathways. There is now considerable evidence in support of this model (4Giancotti F.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E13-E14Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Integrins activate two major tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways, the FAK pathway and the Shc pathway. Whereas most integrins activate FAK (5Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), a subset, which includes α1β1, α5β1, and αvβ3, also activates the Shc pathway (7Wary K.K.

Accordingly, fibroblasts lacking the three Src family kinases Src, Fyn, and Yes display a profound and specific defect in integrin signaling (9Klinghofer R. Sachsenmeier C. Cooper J. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which FAK is activated is poorly understood, but there is evidence indicating that Rho-mediated contractility of the actin cytoskeleton plays a part (10Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Upon activation, FAK undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 and associates with the SH2 domain of Src. The Src kinase then phosphorylates paxillin and p130CAS, which serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of various adaptors and signaling intermediates (5Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Shc by integrins requires a series of sequential interactions. At least in primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the oligomeric protein caveolin-1 appears to function as a membrane adaptor, which couples the integrin α subunit to the Src family kinase Fyn (8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Upon integrin-mediated activation Fyn undergoes a conformational change and interacts, through its SH3 domain, with Shc. Shc is then phosphorylated predominantly at Tyr-317 and combines with the Grb2-mSOS complex (8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Yes, and possibly other palmitoylated Src family kinases (Lck and Lyn but not Src) able to interact with caveolin-1 may functionally replace Fyn in cells that do not express this kinase. 2K. K.

Although both FAK and Shc can promote the recruitment of mSOS to the plasma membrane and thereby possibly activate Ras, the extent to which each one of the two pathways promotes the activation of ERK is unclear. Initial studies indicated that Src phosphorylates FAK at Tyr-925 and promotes the recruitment of the Grb2-mSOS complex (23Schlaepfer D. Hanks S. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 24Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 5623-5633Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FAK in 293 HEK cells or Src in immortalized Src−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) enhances integrin-mediated activation of ERK. This effect, however, requires autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 and association of FAK with Src but not phosphorylation of Tyr-925 by Src and consequent recruitment of Grb2-mSOS (25Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 26Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, a fragment of Src comprising only the SH2 and the SH3 domain augments signaling to ERK and at the same time causes increased phosphorylation of p130CAS. Thus, FAK can signal to ERK through phosphorylation of p130CAS and, possibly, recruitment of Nck and thereby mSOS but probably not through phosphorylation of Tyr-925 (25Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Whether specific inhibition of FAK or Src suppresses integrin-mediated activation of ERK in cells expressing physiological levels of the two kinases has not been addressed. Biochemical and genetic evidence supports the role of Shc in integrin-mediated activation of ERK. First, the integrins that do not activate Shc are weak activators of ERK in primary fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E.

Second, a dominant negative version of Shc effectively suppresses signaling to ERK, but three different dominant negative forms of FAK do not (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Third, deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β1 subunit prevents activation of FAK without impairing signaling to ERK (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 27Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Finally, a chimera containing the transmembrane domain of the integrin α1 subunit associates with caveolin-1 and causes recruitment of Shc and activation of ERK without inducing activation of FAK (8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Shc pathway is necessary and sufficient for integrin-mediated activation of ERK. However, the evidence that FAK is dispensable for integrin-dependent activation of ERK comes from studies employing expression of dominant negative mutants or cross-linking of mutant integrins with antibodies (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G.

Does FAK contribute to integrin-mediated activation of ERK and, if so, to what extent and by what mechanism? The role of Shc in signaling to ERK is now recognized (22Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 28Schlaepfer D. Jones K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10571-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In particular, a recent study has shown that integrin-mediated activation of ERK is defective in Shc−/− fibroblasts (31Lai K.-M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145PubMed Google Scholar). However, three papers (28Schlaepfer D. Jones K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Sieg D. Ilic D. Jones K. Damsky C. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30738-30746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have placed Shc downstream of FAK. In addition, it has been reported that dominant negative forms of FAK can inhibit integrin-mediated activation of ERK in NIH-3T3 cells (28Schlaepfer D. Jones K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 33Zhao J.-H. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been proposed that FAK is necessary for activation of ERK in response to growth factor stimulation (34Renshaw M. Price L. Schwartz M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Further studies are thus needed in order to determine the relative roles of Shc and FAK in integrin signaling to ERK. To examine if FAK contributes to the activation of ERK, and to what extent, it would be desirable to suppress FAK signaling in primary cells, possibly by using a gene targeting approach. The FAK−/− fibroblasts, which have been analyzed, do not display a defect in integrin-mediated activation of ERK. However, these cells display elevated levels of the FAK family kinase Pyk-2, which could compensate for the absence of FAK (29Sieg D. Ilic D. Jones K. Damsky C. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The Src−/−fibroblasts also show normal activation of ERK in response to integrin ligation, but other Src family kinases may replace Src and associate with FAK in these cells (8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To examine whether Shc signaling to ERK can proceed in the absence of activation of FAK or Pyk-2, we have used primary MEFs carrying a targeted deletion of the C-terminal segment of the β1cytoplasmic domain. Our results indicate that Shc is activated independently of FAK or Pyk-2 and plays a predominant role in integrin-mediated activation of ERK in primary fibroblasts. Although FAK is not required for activation of ERK in primary fibroblasts, it increases and prolongs integrin-mediated activation of ERK through p130CAS, Crk, and the small G protein Rap1 in cells that express B-Raf. A targeted deletion of the C-terminal segment of the β1 cytoplasmic domain was generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and introduced in mice. As expected, the targeting vector integrated only at the endogenous β1 locus. However, whereas the 3′ end of the construct correctly replaced the homologous wild-type β1 sequences, the 5′ end integrated downstream of the expected site, leading to a duplication of exon 6. The resulting β1 allele, defined as β1de6, encodes a β1 subunit that is truncated after the membrane-proximal segment common to all β1 splice variants, as intended, but it contains 11 additional unrelated amino acids at the C terminus (TVLLVPTSSQL). Whereas embryos lacking fibronectin or FAK display profound mesodermal defects at embryonic day 8.5 and deteriorate rapidly thereafter (13Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N.

Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), β1de6 homozygous embryos do not display such defects and die from vascular abnormalities at embryonic days 10.5–11.5. The molecular characterization of the homozygous β1de6 mutation and its phenotypic consequences on mouse development will be reported elsewhere. Primary MEFs were derived from wild-type and β1de6/β1de6E10.5 embryos. Yolk sacs were used for genotyping by polymerase chain reaction. Upon dissociation in trypsin, cells from individual embryos were plated onto 6-cm diameter dishes and cultured in DMEM, 20% fetal calf serum. These cells were used between passages 3 and 7. Unless stated otherwise, the experiments were performed with primary MEFs or with both primary and spontaneously immortalized MEFs with similar results. NIH-3T3, Swiss-3T3, and WI-38 fibroblasts, 293 human embryonic kidney cells, Jurkat T lymphoma cells, and A431 squamous carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM, 10% calf serum or fetal calf serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in Human Endothelial-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml bFGF, and 1 μg/ml heparin (all from Intergen, Purchase, NY). FAK−/−, p53−/−, and FAK+/+, p53−/− immortalized mouse fibroblasts were previously described (34Renshaw M. Price L. Schwartz M. J.

The mAb to p130CAS (clone 21) was from Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The anti-Tyr(P) mAb RC20-H (peroxidase-conjugated recombinant PY20) and rabbit IgGs to a GST fusion protein comprising Shc amino acid residues 366–473 were both from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The mAb M2 to FLAG-tag was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The mAb 3C2 reacting with the Gag portion of v-Crk was as described previously (12Oktay M. Liu F. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R. Giancotti F.G.

The human B-Raf cDNA was obtained from Andrew Chan (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) and subcloned in pRK5. Fibronectin was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose, as described previously (39Retta S. Ferraris P. Tarone G. Dejana E. Corada M. Adhesion Proteins Protocols. 96. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 119-123Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (>4, 500 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). To examine the integrin repertoire of wild-type and mutant MEFs, the cells were detached by incubation with 5 mm EDTA and subjected to cell surface biotinylation, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting, as described previously (40Tomatis D. Echtermayer F. Schober S. Balzac F. Retta S.F. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 412-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To monitor integrin signaling, cells were deprived of growth factors for 24 h, detached, washed with DMEM three times, and kept in suspension for 45 min. When indicated, 1 μm cytochalasin D was added to the cells during the last 15 min of incubation in suspension. The cells were then either lysed immediately, or they were plated on dishes coated with 15 μg/ml fibronectin for the indicated times and then lysed. Extraction buffer consisted of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, and 1 mm EDTA. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

To co-immunoprecipitate FAK and Src, the anti-FAK antibody was covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose. After immunoprecipitation, the beads carrying the immune complexes were washed and boiled in non-reducing sample buffer. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the sample buffer only after the beads were removed by centrifugation. ERK immune complex kinase assays were performed as described previously (7Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). For Fyn immune complex kinase assays, cells were extracted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Immune complexes were washed and incubated in 30 μl of 20 μm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Microtiter plates were coated with fibronectin at the indicated concentrations and saturated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were detached with 0.02% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in DMEM, 10% calf serum, washed three times with DMEM, and plated at 5 × 104/100 μl in DMEM. After 1 h at 37 °C adherent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, stained with Coomassie Blue, and counted under the microscope. The observation that cytochalasin D both inhibits FAK and prevents signaling to ERK in cells adhering to ECM (41Chen Q. Kinch M. Lin T. Burridge K. Juliano R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D caps actin filaments and stimulates ATP hydrolysis on G actin leading to a very rapid dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton (44Sampath P. Pollard T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As the actin filament system supports a variety of distinct cellular functions, the effect of cytochalasin D on any two such functions cannot be interpreted as a proof of their epistatic relationship. We wanted to examine if integrin-dependent Shc signaling and activation of ERK required an intact actin cytoskeleton. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments to identify the lower dose of cytochalasin D which could totally disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and prevent FAK activation in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, which binds only to F-actin, revealed that 1 μm cytochalasin D was the lower dose capable of disrupting the actin cytoskeleton in NIH-3T3 cells adhering to fibronectin (not shown). Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that the same dose of cytochalasin D was able to suppress the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by adhesion to fibronectin completely (Fig.1 A). Notably, cytochalasin D did not inhibit but rather amplified the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the association of Shc with Grb2, and the activation of ERK caused by adhesion to fibronectin (Fig.1 A). A previous study has shown that cytochalasin D can activate Src in NIH-3T3 cells (45Lock P. Abram C. Gibson T. Courtneidge S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have observed that, at the dose used in this study, cytochalasin D activates also Fyn in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B). It is thus possible that cytochalasin D enhances Shc signaling to ERK at least in part by enhancing the activation of Src family kinases. These results indicate that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits FAK without suppressing Shc signaling to ERK. Because cytochalasin D enhances the activation of Src kinases, it cannot be used to determi"

Whereas the essential roles of ERK and JNK in Ras signaling has been established, the contribution of p38 remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the p38 pathway functions as a negative regulator of Ras proliferative signaling via a feedback mechanism. Oncogenic Ras activated p38 and two p38-activated protein kinases, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) and p38-related/activated protein kinase (PRAK). MK2 and PRAK in turn suppressed Ras-induced gene expression and cell proliferation, whereas two mutant PRAKs, unresponsive to Ras, had little effect. Moreover, the constitutive p38 activator MKK6 also suppressed Ras activity in a p38-dependent manner whereas arsenite, a potent chemical inducer of p38, inhibited proliferation only in a tumor cell line that required Ras activity. MEK was required for Ras stimulation of the p38 pathway. The p38 pathway inhibited Ras activity by blocking activation of JNK, without effect upon ERK, as evidenced by the fact that PRAK-mediated suppression of Ras-induced cell proliferation was reversed by coexpression of JNKK2 or JNK1.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10585-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and its upstream activating kinase (MEKK1) (12Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Most Ras signaling is believed to be transmitted via these two pathways (8Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Ras can also stimulate p38, albeit less efficiently (13Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 14Lin A. Minden A. Martineto H. Claret F. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin K. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The biological consequence of p38 activation in Ras signaling transduction, however, remains unclear. It is likely that even this moderate activation could have an important impact on Ras signaling. p38 is most strongly activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses (15Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 16Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnel P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3113) Google Scholar). It is activated by the upstream kinases MKK3, MKK6 (14Lin A. Minden A. Martineto H. Claret F. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin K. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Lee J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), and MKK4 (also called SEK1 and JNKK1). Several protein kinases have been identified as p38 physiological substrates, including MAPKAP-K2 (MK2) (19Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), MAPKAP-K3 (20McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. McDonnel P.C. Van Horn S. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8488-8492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the recently cloned PRAK (p38-related/activated protein kinase) (21New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C.N. Han J.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). PRAK is a 471 amino acid protein with 20–30% sequence identity to other MAPK-regulated protein kinases (21New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C.N. Han J.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation and activation of transcriptional factors, some of the p38 pathway-mediated effects may be mediated via these downstream molecules. Whereas the biological consequence of p38 activation may vary under different situations, the following evidence suggests that it may possess anti-mitogenic activity. 1) Although p38 responds to a variety of extracellular stimuli, it is activated most strongly by proinflammatory cytokines (22Miyazawa K. Mori A. Miyata H. Akahane M. Ajisawa Y. Okudaira H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24832-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.

Zapton T. Su M.S. Penix L.A. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Consequently, the p38 activation may play a role in controlling proliferation within the immune system. 2) Activation of the p38 pathway was shown to inhibit cyclin D1 expression (25Lavoie J. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), which functions downstream of Ras in the direct control of cell proliferation (26Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). 3) The activated p38 pathway is known to phosphorylate and activate Hsp27 (heat shock protein) via MK2in vivo (27Schafer C. Ross S. Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24173-24180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar), which by itself can inhibit cell proliferation (29Blackburn R.V. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Armour E.P. McEachern D. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Arata S. Hamaguchi S. Nose K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanisms for this anti-mitogenic effect of p38, however, remain unknown. It is believed that MAPKs regulate target genes by phosphorylation and activation of a group of transcriptional factors such as AP1 and SRE (8Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 31Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests, however, that signals from three MAPK pathways can be integrated before reaching the transcriptional factors. Activation of the ERK pathway, for example, suppresses p38/JNK-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells (32Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38, on the other hand, enhances interleukin 1β-induced expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor, which is inhibited by the MEK inhibitor 98059 (33Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cross-talk also exists between JNK and p38 pathway. JNK opposes the stimulatory effect of p38 activity on induction of atrial natriuretic factor expression (34Nemoto S. Sheng Z. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Forced expression of constitutively active p38-activating kinase MKK6, however, overcomes apoptosis induced by an active MEKK1, a JNK kinase kinase, in myocardial cells (35Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The possibility thus exists that the activation of p38 by Ras may be able to regulate the output of Ras signaling through interaction with the ERK/JNK pathways. The purpose of this study is to determine how the activation of the p38 pathway may affect Ras proliferative signaling. The HA epitope-tagged wild-type PRAK, the mutant PRAK (PRAK(182D)), and the dominant-negative form of PRAK (PRAK/KM) in pcDNA3 have been previously described (21New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W.

NIH 3T3 line stably transformed by v-ras was provided by Dr. Lowy and has been described previously (47Chen G. Shu J. Stacey D.W.

J82 and T24 human bladder carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and have been previously characterized in this laboratory for the dependence (T24) and independence (J82) of Ras activity for their proliferation (48Stacey D.W. Degudicibus S.R. Smith M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Chen G. Oh S. Monia B.P. Stacey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1 × 105/ml in 10% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1 day before in 6-well plates for the proliferation assay and in 100-mm dishes for the kinase assay. For microinjection, cells were switched to serum-starved medium (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 48 h before the injection. For transfection, the manufacturer's protocol for calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (Promega) was followed. Total DNA content of 7 μg was used for a 2-ml 6-well plate for the proliferation assay and of 20 μg for a 100-mm dish for the kinase assay and flow cytometry analysis. The next day, DNA-containing medium was removed, and cells were allowed to grow in 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h before cells were processed for the different assays. Microinjections were performed into cells within a circular area marked on the back of the coverslip as described previously (50Stacey D.W. Kung H.F. Nature. 1984; 310: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using endofree kit from QIAGEN and mixed at 1:1:1 ratio (pCMV-β-gal: pAC-Ha·Ras (Leu-61): pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-PRAK or pcDNA3-PRAK/182D or pcDNA3-PRAK/KM. Two DNA concentrations were used, one at 150 μg/ml, another at 450 μg/ml of total DNA (with each at 50 and 150 μg/ml, respectively). Following injection, 5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added to each 2-ml plate, and cells were grown in 0.5% fetal calf serum for another 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 100% methanol at room temperature for 10 min. The rest of the procedures for staining and autoradiography were the same as for the other proliferation assays. For staining and autoradiography, cells were plated on coverslips and transfected or microinjected as above. At the end of the experiments, cells were fixed in methanol and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min. (All of the staining procedures were performed at room temperature.) Cells were first incubated with mouse anti-β-Gal (1:30) for 1 h in a humidified chamber and then with anti-mouse Cy3 (1:1000) for 45 min. The coverslips were mounted with Permount solution, air-dried, and exposed to autoradiography emulsion for at least 24 h. After development and fixation, transfected or microinjected cells were identified under a fluorescence microscope as β-Gal positive, and thymidine-positive cells among the total β-Gal-positive cells were counted. For microinjection, all β-Gal positive cells within the circle were counted, and for transfection, at least 200 β-Gal positive cells were scored for the labeling index. Cells were transfected as above although 1 μg of Topo IIα and 2 μg of AP1 or SRE luciferase constructs instead of the transfection marker were used with different cDNAs of interest or proper vectors. By the end of the experiments (48 h after DNA removal), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with scraper. The same lysates were used for luciferase readings using a Microlite Luminometer (ML 2250, Dynateck Laboratories, Inc.) and determination of protein concentration using a Bio-Rad kit. The protein content was used to normalize luciferase activity, and similar results were also obtained with normalization to cotransfected β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). Cells were transfected and then serum-starved as described above. In some experiments, cells were treated with 50 μm PD98059 for the final 48 h, or with 20 μm SB203580 for the final 24 h. For ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase assay, cells were collected in HEPES lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptomethanol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as previously published (51Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Google Scholar) and used in this laboratory (38Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of nuclei-free lysates were incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for GST-tagged ERK or -JNK, or 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for FLAG-tagged p38 incubated for 4–20 h at 4 °C on a rotating plate. For immunoprecipitation of transfected HA·PRAK or Myc·MK2, cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (21New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C.N. Han J.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The lysates were then incubated with 2 μg of anti-HA or anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody for 3 h and for another hour after adding 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (HA·PRAK) or 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Myc·MK2). The precipitates were then washed two times with respective lysis buffer and two times with kinase binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (38Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of substrate protein were used for each sample. The substrate for the kinase reaction includes MBP for ERK, GST·Jun for JNK, ATF-2 for p38, HSP27 for PRAK and MK2. Following the reaction, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to stop the reaction. The phosphorylated proteins were then separated in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were then dried, scanned, and quantitated in a phosphorimager. For each kinase assay, the transfection and the determination of the protein kinase activity were repeated two to three times with similar results. Expression of the transfected eiptope-tagged plasmids in every case was confirmed by Western blot analysis using corresponding specific antibodies. To study interactions between Ras proliferative signaling and p38, effects of oncogenic Ras on p38 activity were first examined by transient transfection assay. For this purpose, p38 kinase activity was assessed by cotransfection of FLAG-tagged wild-type p38α together with oncogenic Ras (Ha·Ras, Leu-61) or a control vector. The transfected p38 was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, and the in vitro kinase activity was determined using ATF2 as a substrate (18Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The ERK and JNK activities were also assayed under similar experimental conditions in which Ras was cotransfected with GST-tagged p42MAPK(ERK) or GST-tagged p54SAPK(JNK) as described previously (36Yan M.

As shown in Fig. 1, Ras was indeed able to activate all three MAPKs in NIH 3T3 cells, although the effect on p38 is less than with the other two kinases. These results are consistent with those reported from other laboratories (13Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Cells were transfected (A andB) or microinjected (C) (total DNA concentration: 150 μg/ml) with a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase together with the indicated plasmids, and the serum removed for 48 h, the final 24 h of which were in the presence of [3H]thymidine. The transfected cells were identified by immunostaining against cotransfected β-Gal, and the thymidine labeling index from at least 200 β-Gal-positive cells was then determined by autoradiography.

The kinase activity following transfection was determined by an in vitro kinase assay in the GSH bead or anti-FLAG precipitates by using MBP as a substrate for ERK, GST·Jun for JNK, and ATF2 for p38.

LPS has been shown previously to increase membrane expression of flavocytochromeb 558, a component of the NADPH oxidase. This study shows that TNFα also increases membrane expression of flavocytochrome b 558. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules have been implicated in the action of priming agents. Pharmacologic inhibitors of MAPKs, SB203580 and PD098059, revealed that priming of the respiratory burst and up-regulation of flavocytochrome b 558 are dependent on p38 MAPK but not on extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK). TNFα and LPS primed respiratory burst activity and increased membrane expression of CD35 and CD66b, specific markers of secretory vesicles and specific granules that contain flavocytochrome b 558, with similar time courses and concentration dependences. These processes also required p38 MAPK but were independent of ERK. TNFα failed to prime respiratory burst activity or to increase membrane CD35 expression in enucleated neutrophil cytoplasts. These data suggest that one mechanism by which TNFα and LPS prime neutrophil respiratory burst activity is by increasing membrane expression of flavocytochromeb 558 through exocytosis of intracellular granules in a process regulated by p38 MAPK.

A multicomponent enzyme complex, called the NADPH oxidase, produces the respiratory burst of PMNs. In resting PMNs, this enzyme complex consists of unassembled plasma membrane and cytosolic components (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following activation, the cytosolic components p40Phox, p47Phox, p67Phox, and Rac-2 translocate to the membrane where they associate with flavocytochrome b 558, a heterodimer composed of gp22Phox and gp91Phox, and Rap1A to form the active oxidase (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In resting cells 10–25% of flavocytochromeb 558 is located in the plasma membrane, with the remaining 75–90% distributed among secretory vesicles and gelatinase and specific granules (2Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Normally, circulating PMNs possess a limited NADPH oxidase response to phagocytosis and chemoattractant stimulation. Their respiratory burst response is enhanced by a number of pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (4Wewers M.D. Rinehart J.J. She Z.-W. Herzyk D.J. Hummel M.M. Kinney P.A. Davis W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L276-L282PubMed Google Scholar), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (5Weisbart R.H. Kwan L. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 18-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (6Vosbeck K. Tobias P. Mueller H. Allen R.A. Arfors K.-E. Ulevitch R.J. Sklar L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), that generally do not stimulate respiratory burst activity on their own. This enhancement of respiratory burst activity is referred to as priming. Priming occursin vivo during infection (7Bass D.A. Olbrantz P. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar, 8Trinkle L.S. Wellhausen S.R. McLeish K.R. Diag. Clin. Immunol. 1987; 5: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar) or following intravenous infusion of TNFα into human volunteers (4Wewers M.D. Rinehart J.J. She Z.-W. Herzyk D.J. Hummel M.M. Kinney P.A. Davis W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L276-L282PubMed Google Scholar). Priming enhances the capacity of PMNs to kill microorganisms as well as damage normal tissue. For example, intravenous infusion of LPS into rabbits prior to the infusion of fMLP resulted in PMN sequestration in the lungs and lung injury, which was not produced by either agent alone (9Worthen G.S. Haslett C. Rees A.J. Gumbay R.S. Henson J.E. Henson P.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1987; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similarly, priming of PMNs prior to their infusion into the renal artery of isolated rat kidneys enhanced renal injury following an ischemic insult (10Linas S.L. Whittenburg D. Parsons P.E. Repine J.E. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 610-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, priming contributes both to protection against infection and to organ damage during inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The mechanisms by which PMNs are primed are not fully understood. A number of studies suggest that increased plasma membrane expression of key components of PMN responses to external stimuli may play a role. The membrane density of adhesion molecules, chemoattractant receptors, and heterotrimeric G proteins have all been reported to be increased in models of PMN priming (6Vosbeck K. Tobias P. Mueller H.

The increased expression of these components, however, cannot explain the increased respiratory burst response to a variety of stimuli. Recently, DeLeo et al. (3DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) reported that LPS stimulated an increase in plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b 558 in PMNs, and subsequent stimulation of the cells with fMLP resulted in a 3–5-fold increase in translocation of p47Phox, p67Phox, and Rac-2 to the plasma membrane compared with cells not exposed to LPS. They concluded that redistribution of the NADPH oxidase components might be the basis for LPS-induced priming. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules are activated by a variety of PMN stimuli, and they have been reported to participate in a number of PMN functional responses (18Nick J.A. Avdi N.J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MAPK modules are three-member protein kinase cascades that link a variety of extracellular signals to cellular events, such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress and inflammatory responses (27Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). MAPK modules begin with a serine/threonine kinase, known as a MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK). When activated, MKKKs phosphorylate and activate a dual-specificity kinase known as MAPK kinase (MKK). MKKs, in turn, activate the third member of the module, a serine/threonine protein kinase, known as a MAPK, by recognition and phosphorylation of a TXY motif (27Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Three MAPK modules have been identified in PMNs, p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) (25Detmers P.A. Zhou D. Polizzi E. Thieringer R.

Biophys. 1996; 334: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that both ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylated p47Phox. Based on the ability of MAPKs to regulate these PMN functions, we examined previously the participation of p38 MAPK and ERK in TNFα and GM-CSF priming of fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst activity, and we demonstrated that inhibition of ERK or p38 MAPK significantly attenuated priming by either TNFα or GM-CSF (28McLeish K.R. Knall C. Ward R.A. Gerwins P. Coxon P.Y. Klein J.B. Johnson G.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To define further the molecular basis for priming, the present study examined the hypothesis that, similar to LPS, TNFα increases membrane expression of flavocytochrome b 558 and that this increased expression is dependent on ERK and/or p38 MAPK activation. Our results indicate that TNFα and LPS stimulate a significant increase in flavocytochrome b 558 expression in the plasma membrane of human PMNs. TNFα and LPS also stimulate increased plasma membrane expression of CD35 and CD66b, markers of secretory vesicles and specific granules, respectively, suggesting that the increased expression of flavocytochrome b 558is due to exocytosis of these intracellular granules. TNFα- and LPS-stimulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles and specific granules and increased expression of flavocytochrome b 558were dependent on p38 MAPK, but not ERK, activation. These results define a role of p38 MAPK in the regulation of intracellular granule exocytosis in PMNs that is, in part, responsible for priming the respiratory burst response. Endotoxin-free reagents and plastics were used in all experiments. TNFα was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). LPS (Salmonella minnesota Re595) was from Sigma. The MAPK inhibitors, SB203580 and PD098059, were obtained from Calbiochem. FITC-labeled monoclonal anti-CD35, FITC-labeled mouse IgG1, and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). FITC-labeled monoclonal anti-CD66b was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific (Westbury, NY). Monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of flavocytochromeb 558 (7D5) was produced and characterized as described previously (35Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Blood was obtained from healthy donors in accordance with a protocol approved by the University Human Studies Committee at the University of Louisville. PMNs were isolated using plasma-Percoll gradients as described by Haslett et al. (36Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, PMNs were washed in LPS-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRPB) (pH 7.2) containing 0.2% dextrose. Microscopic evaluation of isolated cells indicated that greater than 97% were PMNs and viability was always greater than 95% by trypan blue exclusion. Enucleated PMN cytoplasts were prepared according to the method of Roos et al. (37Roos D. Voetman A.A. Meerhof L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMNs were resuspended in 4.5 ml of 12.5% Ficoll containing 20 μm cytochalasin B and warmed at 37 °C for 5 min before being layered onto a prewarmed step gradient consisting of 4.5 ml of 16% layered on top of 4.5 ml of 25% Ficoll, each containing 20 μm cytochalasin B. The gradient was centrifuged at 81,000 × g for 30 min at 34 °C using a SW28 rotor in a Beckman model L-70K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Cytoplasts were recovered from the 12.5/16% interface and washed three times in KRPB at room temperature. Respiratory burst activity was determined as H2O2 production stimulated by the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus using a previously described flow cytometric assay (8Trinkle L.S. Wellhausen S.R. McLeish K.R. Diag. Clin. Immunol. 1987; 5: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ward R.A. McLeish K.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1697-1702PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PMNs were resuspended in KRPB containing calcium and magnesium to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (final concentration 0.5 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of cell suspension was then sampled before, and 10 min after, the addition of 50 μl of opsonized, propidium iodide-labeled S. aureus(final concentration approximately 108 bacteria/ml). The sampled cells were washed in KRPB and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed for phagocytosis and H2O2production by flow cytometry (Epics Profile II, Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The mean channel number of fluorescence intensity (mcf) was used as a quantitative index of phagocytosis and H2O2 production. The flow cytometer was calibrated before the analysis of each set of samples using Standard-Brite beads (Coulter). Alternatively, respiratory burst activity was determined as superoxide release in the presence or absence of 10−7m fMLP. Superoxide release was measured spectrophotometrically by ferricytochrome c reduction as described previously (39Johnston R.B. Keele B.B. Misra H.P. Lehmeyer J.E. Webb L.S. Baehner R.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 1357-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Expression of plasma membrane proteins was determined by flow cytometry. For determination of CD35 and CD66b, PMNs were suspended in ice-cold KRPB and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-CD35 or FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-CD66b. FITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 was used as an isotype control. Membrane expression of cytochrome b 558 was determined using a monoclonal antibody (7D5) against its extracellular domain (35Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking by incubation with 2% goat serum for 10 min at 4 °C, PMNs were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 7D5 or mouse serum. The cells were then washed with ice-cold KRPB and incubated for a further 30 min at 4 °C with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Labeled cells were washed in KRPB and analyzed for fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Degranulation was assessed by measuring the release of lysozyme from specific and gelatinase granules. PMNs (108/ml) were incubated with TNFα (200 units/ml), PMA (100 ng/ml), or KRPB (control) for 10 min at 37 °C. The lysozyme content of the supernatant was determined by measuring the rate of lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus using a spectrophotometric assay (40Absolom D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 95-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Release of lysozyme was expressed as a percent of total cell content, determined by lysing cells with 1% Triton X-100. Differences in H2O2 production and plasma membrane protein expression in the presence or absence of TNFα, LPS, and MAPK inhibitors were evaluated by analysis of variance. Where significant differences were detected in the primary analysis, Tukey's test was used to determine differences between the individual priming agents and control and between the individual inhibitors. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 10, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. for nobservations. We have demonstrated previously that preincubation of PMNs for 60 min with 10 μm SB203580 or 50 μm PD098059 significantly inhibits the ability of TNFα and GM-CSF to prime fMLP-stimulated superoxide production in isolated PMNs (28McLeish K.R. Knall C. Ward R.A. Gerwins P. Coxon P.Y. Klein J.B. Johnson G.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is not known if this effect of MAPK inhibition extends to priming of respiratory burst activity stimulated by phagocytosis. Pharmacologic inhibition was used to examine the role of p38 MAPK and ERK cascades on TNFα and LPS priming of respiratory burst activity stimulated by the phagocytosis ofS. aureus. Incubation with either 200 units/ml TNFα for 10 min (Fig. 1 A) or 100 ng/ml LPS for 60 min (Fig. 1 B) significantly increased H2O2 production on subsequent exposure toS. aureus, compared with control. Preincubation with the ERK inhibitor, PD098059, did not alter the priming action of either TNFα or LPS. In contrast, preincubation with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, significantly reduced the ability of TNFα and LPS to enhance H2O2 production stimulated by S. aureus. The inhibition of priming by the combination of SB203580 and PD098059 was numerically greater than that observed with SB203580 alone; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Incubation with SB203580 did not significantly alter H2O2 production in the absence of TNFα or LPS. On the other hand, PD098059 significantly increased phagocytosis-stimulated H2O2 production in experiments examining LPS priming. Phagocytosis was slightly, but significantly, increased by pretreatment with TNFα and decreased by pretreatment with LPS; however, these changes were unaffected by either SB203580 or PD098059 (data not shown). DeLeo and colleagues (3DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) have previously shown that LPS increases plasma membrane expression of the NADPH oxidase component, flavocytochrome b 558. Therefore, we measured membrane flavocytochromeb 558 expression in intact PMNs following incubation in the presence or absence TNFα or LPS using flow cytometry and a monoclonal antibody directed against an extracellular epitope of flavocytochrome b 558 (35Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Table I show that incubation with 200 units/ml TNFα for 10 min or 100 ng/ml LPS for 60 min significantly increased membrane expression of flavocytochromeb 558. Preincubation of PMNs with SB203580 significantly reduced the ability of both TNFα and LPS to increase membrane expression of flavocytochrome b 558, whereas basal expression was not affected.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased flavocytochrome b 558 observed in the plasma membrane following exposure to TNFα is likely to derive from exocytosis of one or more of these granules. CD35 and CD66b are specific membrane markers of secretory vesicles and specific granules, respectively (41Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used flow cytometry and specific antibodies to examine the effect of TNFα and LPS on plasma membrane expression of CD35 and CD66b and to determine the role of MAPK modules on this process. The data in Table I show that 200 units/ml TNFα for 10 min and 100 ng/ml LPS for 60 min significantly increase the expression of both CD35 and CD66b. Thus, both priming agents stimulate exocytosis of secretory vesicles and specific granules. The data in Table I also show the effect of pretreatment with 10 μm SB203580 and 50 μm PD098059 on TNFα- and LPS-stimulated increases in CD35 and CD66b expression. Pretreatment with SB203580 significantly inhibited the increase in CD35 and CD66b expression stimulated by TNFα and LPS; although pretreatment with PD098059 had no effect. These data indicate that priming by LPS and TNFα is associated with p38 MAPK-dependent exocytosis of granules containing flavocytochrome b 558. SB203580 has been reported to have effects on kinases other than p38 MAPK at concentrations above 3 μm (42Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H. Su M.S.-S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

TPA is a tumor promoter that binds and activates members of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases termed protein kinase C (PKC). PKC comprised at least 12 isotypes that have been classified into three groups according to their structure and cofactor requirement: (a) conventional PKCs (PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ) are diacylglycerol- and calcium-dependent, (b) novel PKCs (PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, PKCθ, and PKCμ) are diacylglycerol-dependent but calcium-independent, and (c) atypical PKCs (PKCζ, PKCι, and PKCλ) are not activated by phorbol esters but can bind diacylglycerol (14Baier-Bitterlich G.

Additionally, Fas ligation-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells resulted in a blockade of cellular PKC activity, suggesting a link between the two events (21Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15320-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although involvement of PKC in the suppression of apoptosis has been demonstrated recently, the mechanisms by which PKC promotes cell survival remain to be elucidated. Transfections of Jurkat T cells were done by electroporation with simple electric shock (320 V, 960 microfarads) using the gene pulser system (Bio-Rad). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of the c-fos SRE luciferase vector with or without 14 μg of the different PKC mutants or transfected with 5 μg of a SRE luciferase reporter plasmid with 14 μg of the constitutively active PKC isoforms (14Baier-Bitterlich G.

Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to the different effectors as indicated in the figure legends. Two days after transfection, soluble extracts were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized by protein amount. Transfections of HEK 293 cells were performed with a calcium phosphate transfection method (Stratagene). HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-BAD (New England Biolabs) with or without 2.5 μg of empty vector or vector encoding the PKC mutant constructs in presence or absence of Rsk2-KN. Two days after transfection, cells were exposed to different effectors for the indicated time as described in figure legends and then lysed to perform Western blotting experiments. Jurkat T cells or HEK 293 cells were incubated with different effectors for the times indicated in the figure legends, and then the cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 100 μm NaF, 10 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore), and then exposed to the appropriate antibodies. BAD was detected with polyclonal phospho-specific BAD Ser112 or Ser136antibodies (New England Biolabs; dilution, 1:1000) or with an antibody that recognizes BAD regardless of its phosphorylation state (New England Biolabs; dilution, 1:1000) and with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:10000 dilution. Caspase 3, PKCε, PKCθ, and PKCα were detected with monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratory) at 1:4000 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively, for PKC in saturation buffer and with a secondary anti-mouse antibody at a 1:5000 dilution. Proteins were visualized with the Amersham ECL system. Jurkat T cells exposed to the different effectors were collected and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were treated with 100 μg/ml RNase for 30 min and then treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Cellular DNA was isopropanol-precipitated, dried, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 55 °C. DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Apoptosis is characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nuclear DNA fragmentation and culminates in cellular death (22Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, induction of apoptosis by CH11, an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody that mimics the proapoptotic effect of Fas ligand, results in the disappearance of intact DNA and in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 A). In the presence of TPA no DNA ladder, indicative of fragmentation, was observed, demonstrating that this phorbol ester protects cell from apoptosis and may promote cell survival (Fig. 1 A) (12Holmström T.H. Chow S.C. Elo I. Coffey E.T. Orrenius S. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2626-2636PubMed Google Scholar). The caspase family of proteins consists of more than a dozen proteins, among which caspase 3 is crucial for the final step of the apoptotic program. CH11-induced activation of caspase 3, as followed by the disappearance of its 32-kDa zymogen form in Western blotting, was also blocked by treatment with TPA (Fig. 1 B). The effect of TPA on both DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation was completely abrogated by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (GFX) but was weakly sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (PD, Fig. 1, A andB). These results indicate that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway plays only a minor role in the protective effect of TPA. Execution of the apoptotic program is achieved through cleavage by caspases of numerous cellular proteins that are essential for cell proliferation and survival (23Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Among these substrates, we previously identified the serum response factor as a target for caspase 3 during CH11-mediated apoptosis (24Bertolotto C. Ricci J.E. Luciano F. Mari B. Chambard J.C. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12941-12947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, cleavage of serum response factor results in a drastic inhibition of the activity of a c-fos SRE luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 1 C) (24Bertolotto C. Ricci J.E. Luciano F. Mari B. Chambard J.C. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12941-12947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TPA was found to counteract the inhibitory effect of CH11 on SRE activity and to concomitantly abrogate serum response factor cleavage (Fig. 1 C) (24Bertolotto C. Ricci J.E. Luciano F. Mari B. Chambard J.C. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12941-12947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 immunoblotting analysis, the protective effect of TPA on SRE activity was completely abolished by GF109203X but only weakly affected by PD98059. These results indicate that SRE luciferase activity can be used as a reporter to monitor the apoptotic process. To define which PKC isoforms were involved in the protective effect of TPA on cell death, we verified the activity of several PKC mutant constructs on CH11-mediated apoptosis. We first assessed the ability of PKC mutant constructs to mediate SRE activation. Jurkat cells were transiently cotransfected with the SRE luciferase vector and different PKC mutant constructs. As observed in HEK 293 cells, constitutively active mutants of PKCε, PKCθ, and PKCα stimulated SRE activity (with PKCθ ≫ PKCε > PKCα), whereas dominant negative mutants of these PKCs were found to weakly inhibit the basal promoter activity (Fig.2 A) (25Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of lysates from mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with either PKCε, PKCθ, or PKCα revealed that the level of expression of the corresponding proteins was comparable (Fig. 2 A). We then studied the effect of PKC constructs on CH11-induced apoptosis. Introduction of the constitutively active form of PKCε and PKCθ totally prevented the CH11-induced inhibition of SRE activity, whereas the effect of PKCα was less pronounced (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, constitutively active PKCζ failed to affect the induction of apoptosis by CH11 (data not shown). The protective effect evoked by constitutively active PKCε, PKCθ, and, to a lesser extent, PKCα was abolished by GF109203X (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, dominant negative mutants of PKC had no protective effect but rather increased the inhibitory effect of CH11 on SRE activity, suggesting that they behave as proapoptotic stimuli (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, dominant negative PKCε, PKCθ, and PKCα impaired the stimulatory effect of TPA on SRE activity, indicating that each of these PKC isoforms may mediate the effect of TPA, although PKCθ again appears to be the most potent (Fig. 2 C). These results strongly suggest that TPA, through the activation of novel and probably conventional PKC isoforms, protects cells from apoptosis. To better understand how these PKC isoforms exert their antiapoptotic function, we investigated the possible participation of an important regulator of the cell death machinery, BAD. First, immunoblotting of protein lysates prepared from untreated, TPA-treated, or CH11-treated Jurkat T cells with phospho-specific BAD antibodies revealed that TPA increased BAD phosphorylation at Ser112, whereas CH11 dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of BAD at the same site (Fig.3, A and B). This result indicates that CH11, which stimulates apoptosis through the activation of death receptors, not only leads to caspase activation but also plays a role in the regulation of the phosphorylation state of BAD. Additionally, TPA promotes cell survival and BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 in Jurkat T cells. In HEK 293 cells, TPA also stimulated phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 but not at Ser136, in agreement with the results of Tanet al. (9Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). In Jurkat T cells and in HEK 293 cells, phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 was drastically inhibited by GF109203X, whereas PD98059 had no significant ability to inhibit Ser112 phosphorylation (Fig. 3,B and C). Thus, although PKC has been previously shown to activate the MAPK pathway, MAPK activation is unlikely to be the major signaling pathway by which TPA abrogates apoptosis (26Marquardt B. Frith D.

Furthermore, we observed that Ly294002 had no effect on the TPA-induced rise in BAD Ser112 phosphorylation, ruling out the involvement of Akt in the protective effect of TPA (data not shown). Interestingly, introduction of constitutively active PKCε, PKCθ, and PKCα in HEK 293 cells also led to phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 (Fig. 4 A) but not at Ser136 (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, in cells overexpressing dominant negative PKC, phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 was significantly reduced (Fig. 4 A), indicating that under basal conditions, BAD is already phosphorylated in a PKC-dependent fashion at Ser112. Finally, dominant negative PKC and, more particularly, PKCθ blocked TPA-induced stimulation of BAD at Ser112, demonstrating that TPA-induced cell survival is mediated by these PKC isoforms (Fig.4 C). Until now, it has not been possible to show a direct phosphorylation of BAD by PKC (9Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has recently been demonstrated that the MAPK-activated p90 ribosomal S6 kinase family (Rsk), a downstream target of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylates BAD at Ser112 both in vitro and in vivo, and Rsk has been reported to protect cells from BAD-induced apoptosis (8Bonni A.

Immunoblotting of HEK 293 cell lysates with the phospho-specific BAD Ser112 antibody revealed that expression of Rsk2-KN abrogated constitutively active PKC-induced phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rsk is involved in the protective effect of PKC.Figure 1TPA promotes cell survival in a PKC-dependent pathway.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that phorbol esters promote cell survival essentially through a PKC-Rsk-dependent, MAPK-independent pathway that leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD.

We have observed that over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS) D and CS-E show neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in embryonic day (E) 18 rat hippocampal neurons (Nadanaka, S., Clement, A., Masayama, K., Faissner, A., and Sugahara, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3296–3307). In the present study, various CS isoforms were examined for their ability to inhibit the MK-mediated cell adhesion of cortical neuronal cells in comparison with heparin from porcine intestine and heparan sulfate from bovine kidney. E17–18 rat cortical neuronal cells were cultured on plates coated with recombinant MK in a grid pattern. The cells attached to and extended their neurites along the MK substratum. Cell adhesion was inhibited by squid cartilage over-sulfated CS-E as well as by heparin, but not by heparan sulfate or other CS isoforms. Direct interactions of MK with various glycosaminoglycans were then evaluated using surface plasmon resonance, showing that CS-E bound MK as strongly as heparin, followed by other over-sulfated CS isoforms, CS-H and CS-K. Furthermore, E18 rat brain extracts showed an E disaccharide unit, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate). These findings indicate that CS chains containing the E unit as well as heparin-like glycosaminoglycans may be involved in the expression and/or modulation of the multiple neuroregulatory functions of MK such as neuronal adhesion and migration and promotion of neurite outgrowth.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 177: 652-658Google Scholar). Their Hep-binding properties possibly indicate that cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) mediates biological functions of both PTN and MK. Syndecan-3 and syndecan-4, on the cell surface, appear to be high affinity receptors in the PTN-dependent neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons (K d = 0.6 nm) (8Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J.

The cortactin/Src kinase pathway has been implicated in syndecan-3-dependent neurite outgrowth (11Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A highly sulfated region of cell-surface HS chains has been suggested to be involved in the MK-mediated adhesion of embryonic rat cortical neurons (12Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Ishihara M. Hara S. Yoshida K. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 220: 108-112Google Scholar), and the two Hep-binding sites have been localized to the C-terminal half of the molecule (13Muramatsu H. Inui T.

Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, PTN binds 6B4-PG/phosphacan (15Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which is abundantly expressed in the brain as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PG) and is the alternatively spliced extracellular domain of the signal-transducing receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPζ/RPTPβ (16Krueger N.X.

Binding to phosphacan is inhibited not only by Hep/HS, but also by shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate (CS) C (15Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The PTN-stimulated migration of embryonic rat cortical neurons is also inhibited by CS-C (19Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that PTN exhibits its functions through interactions with the CS moiety of PTPζ as well as the HS proteoglycan in the brain. CS-PGs may play important roles in the regulation of brain development (20Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Lander A.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Numerous studies indicate that CS-PGs inhibit neurite outgrowth and serve as inhibitory barriers to migrating neurons or extending axons during brain development (22Snow D.M. Lemmon V. Carrino D.A.

However, tissues that express CS do not always exclude the axon entry, and CS staining coincides with developing axon pathways (reviewed in Ref. 28Garwood J. Schnädelbach O. Clement A. Schütte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies have suggested that CS-PGs and CS glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) can promote neurite outgrowth in vitro (29Streit A. Nolte C. Rasony T. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A.

Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In particular, the CS-PG designated DSD-1-PG from developing mouse brains promotes neurite outgrowth of embryonic rat mesencephalic (E14) and hippocampal (E18) neurons (32Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This PG has recently been identified as the mouse homologue of rat phosphacan (28Garwood J. Schnädelbach O. Clement A. Schütte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is secreted primarily by immature glial cells and is immunologically detected on the glial cell surface (32Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), but also on the migrating neuronal surface (15Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 33Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). There are subsets of neurons that express phosphacan as well as PTPζ (34Snyder S.E. Li J. Schauwecker P.E. McNeill T.H. Salton S.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The neurite outgrowth-stimulating capacity of DSD-1-PG is strongly reduced by monoclonal antibody 473HD, which recognizes a CS epitope. Surprisingly, shark cartilage CS-C inhibits the interactions between the monoclonal antibody and the DSD-1 epitope (32Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We have shown that shark cartilage CS-D also exhibits the inhibitory activity and neurite outgrowth-promoting activity for embryonic rat hippocampal neurons as does DSD-1-PG/phosphacan (35Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Notably, DSD-1-PG/phosphacan contains the D disaccharide unit characteristic of CS-D (36Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, we observed that squid cartilage CS-E also exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity, which, however, is not inhibited by monoclonal antibody 473HD (35Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37Clement A.M. Sugahara K. Faissner A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), indicating that the mechanism of the neurite-promoting action of CS-E is different from that of CS-D. Thus, rat brain neuronal cells specifically responded to stimulation by cartilage CS chains derived from remote animal species such as shark and squid. Structurally, both shark cartilage CS-D and squid cartilage CS-E are over-sulfated, containing more than one sulfate group/disaccharide unit, whose characteristic positions on each saccharide constituent are different from each other. The D and E units are GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S) and GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), respectively. Note that the A, B, and C units characteristic of CS-A, CS-B, and CS-C are GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S), IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S), and GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6S). In view of the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of CS-D and CS-E and the findings that PTN binds 6B4-PG/phosphacan through interacting with the CS moiety, we explored the possibility that MK, which is highly homologous to PTN, functions in the brain through interacting with over-sulfated CS isoforms. We detected both CS-D and CS-E in E18 rat brains and found that exogenous CS-E, but not CS-D, inhibited MK-mediated adhesion of E18 rat cortical neuronal cells to culture substrates. Preliminary findings have been reported in abstract form (38Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. Abstracts of the Fourth BIAsymposium in Japan, Osaka, Japan, November 6–7, 1997.

N-Ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and the running buffer for the BIAcore system (10 mm HEPES/NaOH containing 0.15m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) were purchased from BIAcore AB (Uppsala). [3H]Acetyl-labeled CS-E (1.875 × 105 cpm/μg) was prepared as described previously (44Yamane Y. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Furuya S. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Sugino H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by N-deacetylation with hydrazine, followed by N-reacetylation with [3H](CH3CO)2O. Inhibition assays of neurite outgrowth by various GAGs were carried out as described previously (7Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Nishiyama H. Koizumi S. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic rat cerebral cortex (E17–18) was isolated and digested with trypsin and DNase I. After the enzyme treatments, single cells were collected by centrifugation and used for the neurite outgrowth inhibition assays. A 24-well plastic culture plate (Falcon 3057, Becton Dickinson) was coated with recombinant mouse MK at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. After washing with H2O, the plate was dried, and metal electron microscopy grids (HDL 200, Veco, Amsterdam) were placed in the wells, followed by irradiation with UV light at 315 nm to produce the grid pattern of the substrate. After removing the grids, the wells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for blocking. After washing with H2O, the rat brain nerve cells in suspension described above were seeded (0.8 × 106 cells/well) and cultured in medium comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% fetal bovine serum, insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite, and penicillin/streptomycin in the absence or presence of each test GAG preparation for 24–48 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Photographs were taken after 20 h. Filter binding assays of various GAGs with MK were performed as described previously (44Yamane Y. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Furuya S. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Sugino H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Various amounts (∼0.1–0.4 μg) of recombinant human MK were incubated with [3H]CS-E (80 ng, ∼15,000 cpm) in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 3 h. Incubations for inhibition assays were conducted in the presence of 50 ng of various individual exogenously added GAGs. The growth factor, along with any bound [3H]CS-E, was recovered by quick passage of the samples through nitrocellulose filters (0.45-μ pore size, 25-mm diameter; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), which had been placed onto a 12-well vacuum-assisted manifold filtration apparatus. The filters were prewashed with 10 ml of the buffer described above before application of the samples, which was immediately followed by washing five more times with 2 ml of the same buffer. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined after submersion of the filters in 1 ml of 1 m NaCl and 0.05 m diethylamine, pH 11.5, for 30 min; radioactivity in the eluate was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-700, Aloka Co., Tokyo) using scintillation fluid containing 1.2% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 33% (w/v) Triton X-100. The binding of various GAGs to recombinant human MK was evaluated in the BIAcoreTM 2000 system (BIAcore AB), which had been equilibrated with the running buffer (10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB), which is coated with carboxymethyl-dextran, was activated by injecting a solution mixture (1:1, v/v) of 200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A 70-μl aliquot of the recombinant human MK sample (50 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate/NaOH buffer, pH 5.08) was then injected at a flow rate of 10 μg/min for immobilization of MK. The remaining activatedN-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were blocked by injecting 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride/NaOH, pH 8.5, and washed with 10 μl of 1 m NaCl. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min in both association and dissociation phases. GAGs in a series of concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 μg/ml in the running buffer were injected into the flow cell, and the changes in resonance units were recorded. After each run, regeneration of the sensor chip surface was accomplished by an injection of 10 μl of 1 m NaCl. The values for rate constants were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using BIAevaluation 2.1 software as described by Karlsson and Stahlberg (45Karlsson R. Stahlberg R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Association rate constants (k a) were calculated from the linear portion of sensorgrams during the early association phase. Dissociation rate constants (k d) were calculated from the early portion of the dissociation phase after the completion of the sample injection during the washout period. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) was calculated as the ratio k d /k a. The kinetic constants were determined by three independent experiments. A soluble brain CS-PG fraction was prepared according to Oohira et al. (46Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Takida Y. Kuboki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (47Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31377-31381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, E18 rat brains were homogenized in 5 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the pellet was subjected to re-homogenization in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, both supernatant fluids were combined, concentrated, and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm sodium acetate using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The protein concentration of the PG fractions was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. The PG fractions (∼100 μg of protein each corresponding to 39.6 mg of brain, wet weight) were first digested using 25 mIU of chondroitin ABC or AC lyase as described (48Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and evaporated to dryness. The digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide according to the manufacturer's instructions for the SignalTM labeling kit (Oxford Glycosystems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) as described (49Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The labeled disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Kyoto) as described previously (50Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 162: 189-197Google Scholar). HPLC was performed using a linear gradient from 16 to 798 mmNaH2PO4 over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. The identification and quantification of the resulting disaccharide units were accomplished by comparison with the standard CS-derived unsaturated disaccharides labeled with 2-aminobenzamide as described (49Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and by enzymatic digestion using chondro-4-sulfatase and chondro-6-sulfatase as reported (48Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, CS-E derived from squid cartilage was demonstrated to contain novel disulfated and trisulfated disaccharide units, including GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S), GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(6S), and GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S,6S) (51Suzuki S. Saito H. Yamagata T. Anno K. Seno N. Kawai Y. Furuhashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to the conventional disulfated disaccharide unit GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S) (52Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In view of such a heavily sulfated structural feature of CS-E, comparable to that of Hep, we examined, using filter binding assays in the preliminary studies, whether CS-E could interact with several Hep-binding growth factors, including MK, FGF-1 (acidic FGF), FGF-2 (basic FGF), and FGF-10 (data not shown). CS-E showed strong binding with only MK, implying that the binding was specific and was not caused merely by electrostatic interactions. Hence, the binding of MK to CS-E was investigated as described below. The effects of various CS isoforms on the MK-mediated adhesion of neuronal cells prepared from embryonic rat brain (E17–18) were examined. In the absence of exogenous GAGs, the cells specifically bound to the MK-coated substratum, forming a grid pattern along the MK coating (Fig. 1 A), as reported previously (7Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Nishiyama H. Koizumi S. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Most of the tested CS isoforms showed no inhibition even at a high concentration of 50 μg/ml; representative results obtained with CS-A are shown in Fig. 1 B. In strong contrast, squid cartilage CS-E exhibited potent inhibition at a low concentration of 2.5 μg/ml (Fig. 1 C), which was comparable to the inhibitory concentration of Hep (TableI). Although Hep showed moderate inhibition even at a lower concentration (0.64 μg/ml), the average molecular mass of CS-E (70 kDa) was 3-fold that of Hep (19 kDa), as has been estimated by gel filtration chromatography (53Munakata H. Takagaki K. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), 2K. Takagaki, personal communication. suggesting comparable inhibitory activities of CS-E and Hep. It should be emphasized that large cell aggregates were observed even though the cell adhesion was strongly inhibited, supporting the specificity of the inhibition,i.e. CS-E inhibited neuronal cell adhesion to the MK-coated substratum, but not intercellular cell adhesion between the neuronal cells. The inhibition observed with CS-E is not attributable to a possible nonspecific binding of CS-E to BSA used for masking the MK-uncoated surface because no binding was observed between CS-E and BSA in the BIAcore system (see below). CS-H, another over-sulfated CS isoform, derived from hagfish notochord, showed appreciable inhibition, although at a high concentration of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1 D). The findings from the inhibition studies are summarized in Table I. The specificity of the inhibition of neuronal cell adhesion by CS-E was reinforced by the findings that other over-sulfated CS isoforms such as CS-D from shark cartilage and CS-K from king crab cartilage showed no inhibition even at 50 μg/ml. Thus, the inhibition was dependent not only on the sulfation degree, but also on the sulfation pattern.Figure 4Analysis of the binding of Hep and over-sulfated CS isoforms to immobilized MK in the BIAcoreTM system. Recombinant human MK (2.3 ng, 0.18 pmol corresponding to 1902 resonance units) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and then aqueous solutions (100 μg/ml) of Hep, HS, and various CS isoforms (CS-A, CS-B, CS-C, CS-D, CS-E, CS-H, and CS-K) were individually injected over the immobilized MK surface as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrow A indicates the beginning of the association phase initiated by the injection of each of the various GAG analytes; arrow B indicates the end of the sample injection or the beginning of the dissociation phase initiated with the running buffer.

N-acetylmuramic acid GlcNAc-β-1,4-(1,6)-anhydro-MurNAc p-nitrophenol reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction Bacteria are enclosed by an exoskeletal structure found in the cell envelope (1Weidel W. Pelzer H. Adv. Enzymol. 1964; 26: 193-232PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases the bag-shaped macromolecule murein (peptidoglycan) stabilizes the cell mechanically and determines the shape of the bacterium (2Park J.T. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 48-57Google Scholar). It is a heteropolymer, made up of glycan strands composed of an alternating sequence of two amino-sugars (N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine) linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds (reviewed by Höltje in Ref. 3Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycans are interlinked by short peptide bridges, and a covalently closed network completely surrounding the cell is formed. To enlarge this structure not only does new material have to be synthesized, it has to be integrated into the existing murein. This is accomplished by the concerted action of murein synthases and murein hydrolases (3Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Höltje J.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the controlled enlargement of the exoskeleton, old material from the sacculus gets released as turnover products while the polymer grows by the insertion of new murein glycan strands (7Goodell E.W. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 391-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goodell E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 305-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kraft A.R. Prabhu J. Ursinus A. Höltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different enzymatic activities have been described to take part in this turning over of the murein sacculus. Lytic transglycosylases are muramidases that are degrading the glycan strands to anhydro-disaccharides (10Höltje J.-V. Mirelman D. Sharon N. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endopeptidases cleave peptide cross-links (11Keck W. van Leeuwen A.M. Huber M. Goodell E.W. Mol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) andN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases release oligopeptides from the murein or from muropeptides (7Goodell E.W. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 391-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of the action of these enzymes, disaccharides (N-acetylglucosamyl-β-1,4-(1,6)-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid) are formed that carry a characteristic 1,6-anhydro ring structure at the muramic acid. For Escherichia coli the turnover process has been well studied, and it could been shown that during one generation up to 50% of the cell wall gets degraded as a result of normal growth processes (9Kraft A.R. Prabhu J. Ursinus A. Höltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These breakdown products are efficiently reutilized byE. coli in a recycling process; it could be shown that this reuse is an important source for the formation of new murein precursors (15Park J.T. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A major metabolic pathway, describing the fate of the peptide moiety originating from the breakdown of the murein could be elucidated. During the early steps of the recycling, the periplasmic degradation products get taken up by membrane transporters. Oligopeptides are internalized by the MppA/Opp system (16Goodell E.W. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3861-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Park J.T. Raychaudhuri D. Li H. Normark S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the membrane permease AmpG transports sugar containing muropeptides (18Jacobs C. Huang L.J. Bartowsky E. Normark S. Park J.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the cytosol the muropeptides get further degraded by the action of an N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase (AmpD; Refs. 19Höltje J.V. Kopp U. Ursinus A. Wiedemann B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 20Jacobs C. Joris B. Jamin M. Klarsov K. Van Beeumen J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Park J.T. Normark S. Frere J.M.

The tripeptide is recognized by the muropeptide ligase Mpl (22Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5347-5352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and added to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc),1 and UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, a precursor for murein synthesis, is formed. The fate of the sugar moiety is not clear despite the fact that the presence of a β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase active on muropeptides had been reported over 20 years ago (23Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 372-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here the identification of the gene encoding NagZ, a cytosolic glucosaminidase involved in muropeptide recycling, is shown. Additionally, its need for the expression control of certain β-lactamases is described. The β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient mutant E593 (24Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 372-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is derived from E. coli K-12 AB1157 (F− Δ(gpt-proA62) argE3 his-4 leu-6 thr-1 ara-14 galK2 lacY1 xyl-5 mtl-1 thi-1 supE44 rpsL31 Str r tsx-33 T6r (λ−)). The general cloning host was XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To examine β-lactamase induction, strains were transformed with pJP1 (9Kraft A.R. Prabhu J. Ursinus A. Höltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid containing the ampR-ampC operon fromEnterobacter cloacae (25Kopp U. Wiedemann B. Lindquist S. Normark S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pBC SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as cloning vector and pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for construction of a His6-tagged NagZ protein. Bacteria were cultivated aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium. Growth was monitored by determination of A578 in an Eppendorf photometer. Transformants were grown in the presence of 40 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 50 μg/ml ampicillin in LB broth or on LB agar plates. LB agar plates (1.5% agar) were overlaid with 3 ml of LB top-agar (0.7% agar) containing 10 μl of a bacterial culture grown overnight at 37 °C. Filter discs (5 mm diameter) were loaded with 10 μl of cefoxitin (20 mg/ml), dried, and placed on the agar plates. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the diameter of the inhibition zone was measured. The MIC was determined by plating several hundred cells on LB agar plates containing a range of concentrations of cefoxitin that varied by a factor of 2. To induce β-lactamase production 20 ml of culture of exponentially growing bacteria (A578 = 0.4) carrying pJP1 were diluted with 20 ml of prewarmed medium containing 5 μg/ml cefoxitin. To measure β-lactamase activity, aliquots of the culture (0.5–4 ml) were removed and cells were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 2 min). After washing with 2 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) cells were centrifuged again and frozen. Standard techniques were used for manipulating the plasmid DNA (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); E. coli was transformed as described by Inoue et al. (27Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; oligonucleotides came from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). PCR (28Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13369) Google Scholar) was performed using PowerScript polymerase (PAN Systems, Nürnberg, Germany) in a volume of 50 μl of the supplied buffer with 0.5 mm of each primer and 0.1 μg of chromosomal DNA as a template. After initial denaturation for 3 min at 92 °C, touchdown PCR (29Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattik J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar) was performed with 0.5 min of annealing, 1 min of extension at 72 °C, and 0.5 min of denaturation at 92 °C. During the PCR, the annealing temperatures were lowered to 61, 59, 57, 55, and 53 °C for three cycles each and finally to 51 °C for another 15 cycles. The coding sequence of ycfO was amplified by using PCR. Both the wt allele (from E. coli AB1157) and the copy from the glucosaminidase deficient mutant strain E593 were amplified (specific primers 5′-AAAGAATTCGTGGGTCCAGTAATGTTG-3′ and 5′-AAAGTCGACCGCTTCCTCACATAAGCC-3′) and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the vector pBC SK+(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The constructs were termed pBC-nagZ and pBC-nagZmut, respectively. The addition of an N-terminal His6 tag to the protein was obtained after cloning of the PCR product (template chromosomal DNA from E. coli AB1157; primers: 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGGTCCAGTAATGTTGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGTCGACCGCTTCCTCACATAAGCC-3′) into pQE30 (Qiagen) cut with BamHI and SalI. The resulting plasmid was named pHN5. All constructs were sequenced; in the case of the mutant allele several independently obtained clones were subject to sequencing. To overproduce the His6-tagged NagZ 800 ml of culture of E. coli XL-1 blue harboring pHN5 were grown in LB medium with moderate shaking at 37 °C. Expression of the protein was induced at an A578 of 0.2 by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 ml ice-cold buffer A (100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), and resuspended in 5 ml buffer A containing 10 mm imidazol (buffer B). After disrupting the cells by three passages through a precooled French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i. and centrifugation (20 min, 90,000 ×g), the supernatant was used for purification of the enzyme by metal chelation chromatography on Superflow nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Qiagen). After loading of the column (bed volume, 3 ml; equilibrated with buffer B), the column was washed with 60 ml of buffer B at a flow-rate of 4 ml/h. The protein was eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazol. Glucosaminidase activity in the eluted fractions was determined by measuring hydrolysis of PNP-β-GlcNAc, and fractions showing high activity were pooled. After extensive dialysis against buffer A, the protein was stored at −20 °C. Murein sacculi were isolated as described before and treated with α-amylase and pronase (30Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Murein from 20 liters of culture was completely digested into noncross-linked disaccharide units by incubation with purified MepA (3 μg) and purified Slt70 (2 μg) in a volume of 4 ml of buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Anhydro-disaccharide-tripeptide and anhydro-disaccharide-tetrapeptide were isolated by rpHPLC (30Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To obtain unsubstituted anhydro-disaccharides isolated sacculi were degraded with purified Slt70 (2 μg) and isolated AmiC (4 μg). The anhydro-disaccharides were isolated by rpHPLC on 5-μm Hypersil-ODS (4.6 mm x 125 mm; Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany). Chromatography was performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After 10 min a gradient (0% to 30% acetonitril) that was built up in 10 min was applied before equilibrating to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min. Fractions containing muropeptides were collected and dried. Cell extracts or protein fractions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a volume of 200 μl containing 0.66 mm PNP-β-GlcNAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, and 500 mm NaCl. The reaction was quenched with 800 μl of 300 mm sodium carbonate, and absorbance measured at 405 nm. β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in whole cells was measured as described before (24Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 372-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the activity on different muropeptides, a HPLC-based detection system was established. Routinely 50 ng of purified enzyme was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 100 μl of buffer (50 mm Hepes, 500 mmNaCl, pH 7.1) with varying amounts of substrate. After addition of 5 μl of 2% phosphoric acid, the mixture was boiled and centrifuged. 90 μl of the reaction were used for separating the amino-sugars by rpHPLC on 5-μm Hypersil-ODS (column size, 4.6 × 125 mm; Bischoff). Chromatography was performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0 using a methanol gradient (4 to 15%) that was built up in 20 min. Alternatively, the chromatography conditions as described for the isolation of muropeptides were employed. Substrate and product peaks were quantified using calibrated standards (kindly provided by Astrid Ursinus). β-Lactamase activity was determined by measuring hydrolysis of nitrocefin, a chromogenic β-lactam (31O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). In contrast to published assay systems, activity was determined in whole cells, which were permeabilized by treatment with SDS and chloroform (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Activity was calculated from ΔA492/min·amount of cells (A578). Briefly, 0.1–8 ml of a bacterial culture (A578 = 0.2–1.2) were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 750 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Cells were permeabilized by the addition of 1 drop of chloroform and one drop of 0.05% SDS solution and vigorous shaking on a vortex mixer for 20 s. 100 μl of different dilutions of permeabilized cells were mixed with an equal volume of a Nitrocefin solution (25 μg/ml nitrocefin in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and hydrolysis was monitored over 20 min in a microtiter plate reader at 492 nm. The rate of hydrolysis was expressed as nm nitrocefin hydrolyzed per 1A578 of cells/min. Mapping data from Hrebenda (33Hrebenda J. Acta Microbiol. Pol. 1979; 28: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar) and Park (15Park J.T. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggest a chromosomal location for the gene of a β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase active on muropeptides at around 26 min of the E. coli genome. To identify this gene, the possible reading frames from this region (25 min to 27 min) were subject to data base comparisons using the BLAST algorithm (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) on the Swiss-Prot data base. One out of the approximately 100 checked reading frames showed a significant similarity to known glycosyl hydrolases. To show that such an enzyme is encoded by ycfO (located at 25.1 min, 1163 kilobase pairs of the physical map of the E. coli genome), the gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the cloning vector pBC SK+. Transformation of E. coli E593, a mutant deficient in β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, with this plasmid restored enzyme activity as detected with a whole cell β-N-acetylglucosaminidase assay. Transformation of the same strain with a plasmid harboring a plasmid with the ycfOallele from E593 showed no measurable increase in glucosaminidase activity (data not shown). Both alleles were sequenced, and it could be shown that the wt copy is identical to the published sequence of ycfO (35Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5935) Google Scholar). For the mutant allele a single base pair change was detected (changing Gly101 to Asp) and therefore is responsible for the total loss of activity. The identified open reading frame was renamed to nagZ as proposed by Park (15Park J.T. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reading frame from the ycfOgene encodes a protein of a predicted size of 37 kDa. Using the TopredII algorithm (36Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar), no leader sequence was detected; therefore, a cytosolic localization is expected. These results are in agreement with data from Yem and Wu (23Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who characterized the cytosolic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from E. coli AB1157 mapping at 25 min. Further similarity searches (using the PSI BLAST algorithm; Ref. 37Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) performed with the coding sequence of NagZ put the protein to family III of glycosyl hydrolases, a group of enzymes mainly containing β-glucosidases. Recently, the active site aspartic acid of ExoII, a highly similar protein from Vibrio furnissi was identified (38Vocadlo D.J. Mayer C. He S. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Chitlaru E. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33433-33439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and, indeed, this amino acid is conserved in all members of the family including the newly characterized enzyme. The mutation found in the nagZ allele from E593 maps close to another conserved region in the protein (data not shown). Highly similar orthologs were found within most Enterobacteriaceae sequenced to date, and searching the unfinished microbial genomes data base (last update, May 16, 2000 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information) revealed the presence of further homologues (in Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Pasteurella multocida, Vibrio cholerae, Hemeophilus influenzae, Hemeophilus ducreyi, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella putrefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enteritidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Bordetella bronchiseptica; e values in a tblastn gapped blast search < e−61). This suggests a conserved function for NagZ. Initially, no obvious phenotype for E593, the mutant isolated by Yem and Wu (23Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 372-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was observed. Neither growth rate or cell shape was changed in LB medium (data not shown). To find out whether NagZ is indeed an enzyme that is involved in muropeptide recycling, an indirect approach was chosen. Muropeptides are known effectors of the transcriptional activator AmpR that controls the expression of AmpC type β-lactamases. This activator promotes β-lactamase transcription and is needed to establish β-lactam resistance. Activation of AmpR only occurs upon binding of certain muropeptides that are formed during the cytosolic degradation steps of turnover material from the cell wall. During normal growth conditions, the intracellular concentration of these murein metabolites stays low because they are efficiently recycled. In bacteria treated with β-lactams (e.g.cefoxitin), a high amount of muropeptides gets released and accumulates in the cytoplasm. Consequently, AmpR activation is found, and AmpC production is induced (18Jacobs C. Huang L.J. Bartowsky E. Normark S. Park J.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The muropeptides activating AmpR are anhydro-monosaccharides (anhydro-N-acetyl-muramoyl-peptides) that are products of an N-acetyl-glucosaminidase acting on the released turnover material. Therefore, a strain carrying anagZ mutation was tested for its capability to induce expression of AmpC type β-lactamases by determination of the sensitivity against β-lactam antibiotics. E. coli E593 was transformed with pJP1 (9Kraft A.R. Prabhu J. Ursinus A. Höltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid that carries theampR-ampC operon from E. cloacae, and the influence of the nagZ mutation on the induction process was examined. In an agar diffusion assay the sensitivity to cefoxitin, a cephalosporin that is a potent inducer of AmpC expression, was determined. In the corresponding control strain (AB1157), the transformation with pJP1 leads to high resistance against β-lactams. In contrast, the mutant E593 harboring the plasmid stayed as sensitive against cefoxitin as a strain not possessing the resistance plasmid (Table I). Introducing a second plasmid containing the cloned wild type allele of nagZ can complement this defect; the control transformation with the mutatednagZ from E593 on a plasmid did not lead to increased resistance to the cephalosporin. Therefore, it is concluded that the identified glucosaminidase is involved in muropeptide recycling and is needed for the establishment of expression of the inducible β-lactamases of the AmpC type.Table ISensitivity of a nagZ mutant against cefoxitinStrain 1-aA nagZ mutant and its corresponding parent were transformed with a plasmid carrying theampR ampC operon from E. cloacae and with different derivatives of the cloning vector pBC SK+ containingwt nagZ or mutated nagZmut.Zone of Inhibition (Diameter) 1-bSensitivity was determined in an agar diffusion assay.

Open table in a new tab To get further insight into the induction process, β-lactamase induction was measured in cultures of AB1157 and E593 carrying pJP1 (ampR ampC) after treatment with 2.5 μg/ml cefoxitin. Activity was determined in culture aliquots (taken every 15 min) in a newly established whole cell assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The hydrolysis of nitrocefin, a chromogenic substrate for β-lactamases was monitored, and induction factors could be calculated for the strains carrying the resistance plasmid (TableII). For the control a 17-fold induction (as compared with the untreated control) was found after 45 min, in the mutant the calculated induction factor was 4.5. Still a substantial amount of β-lactamase (37.2 nano mol/min ×A578) was measured in the inducednagZ mutant. Although this level of β-lactamase production does not lead to any increase in β-lactam resistance, it opens the question how induction can occur in the nagZ mutant. A possible explanation might be the presence of a second enzyme able to hydrolyze anhydro-muropeptides. This enzyme could be identical to BglX, a periplasmic β-d-glucosidase also belonging to the family III of the glycosyl hydrolases (40Yang M. Luoh S.M. Goddard A. Reilly D. Henzel W. Bass S. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This enzyme, together with an transporter specific for the released anhydro-monosaccharides would constitute an unknown way to reutilize turnover material.Table IIβ-Lactamase induction in a nagZ mutant carrying ampC/ampR from E. cloacaeAB1157, pJP1E593, pJP1Not inducedInducedNot inducedInduced0 min4.64.6 (1.0)5.15.2 (1.0)15 min5.49.3 (1.7)5.38.0 (1.5)30 min6.550.6 (7.8)7.723.9 (3.1)45 min6.2106.9 (17.1)8.337.2 (4.5)β-Lactamase production was induced by treating growing cells (A578 = 0.35) with 2.5 μg/ml Cefoxitin. β-Lactamase activity was determined in permeabilized cells by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic β-lactam nitrocefin at 492 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” β-Lactamase activity is expressed as nano mol/min ×A578.

PMN-derived superoxide (O⨪2) can be scavenged by nitric oxide (NO⋅) with the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−); however, questions remain regarding the effects and mechanisms by which NO⋅ and ONOO− modulate the PMN oxidative burst. Therefore, we directly measured the dose-dependent effects of NO⋅and ONOO− on O⨪2 generation from human PMNs stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate using EPR spin trapping. Pretreatment with low physiological (μm) concentrations of NO⋅ from NO⋅ gas had no effect on PMN O⨪2 generation, whereas high levels (≥50 μm) exerted inhibition. With ONOO− pretreatment, however, a biphasic modulation of O⨪2 generation was seen with stimulation by μm levels, but inhibition at higher levels. With the NO⋅ donor NOR-1, which provides more sustained release of NO⋅ persisting at the time of O⨪2 generation, a similar biphasic modulation of O⨪2 generation was seen, and this was inhibited by ONOO− scavengers. The enhancement of O⨪2 generation by low concentrations of ONOO− or NOR-1 was associated with activation of the ERK MAPKs and was blocked by their inhibition. Thus, low physiological levels of NO⋅present following PMN activation are converted to ONOO−, which enhances O⨪2 generation through activation of the ERK MAPK pathway, whereas higher levels of NO⋅ or ONOO−feed back and inhibit O⨪2 generation. This biphasic concentration-dependent regulation of the PMN oxidant burst by NO⋅-derived ONOO− may be of critical importance in regulating the process of inflammation.

Kuppusamy P. Weisfeldt M.L. Zweier J.L. Circulation. 1993; 87: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PMNs are chemotaxed and then activated at sites of tissue injury with the generation of oxygen free radicals and the release of proteolytic enzymes and other toxic products (2Rowe G.T. Eaton L.R. Hess M.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1984; 16: 1075-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activated human PMNs generate superoxide (O⨪2) during their respiratory burst via the NADPH oxidase complex (3Babior B.M. Peters W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2321-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that high levels of nitric oxide (NO⋅) can directly inhibit O⨪2 generation from stimulated PMNs (4Clancy R.M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin.

NO⋅ can also react with O⨪2derived from PMNs or other sources to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−). However, questions remain regarding the effects of low physiological levels of NO⋅ and how these or ONOO− modulate the NADPH oxidase function of and O⨪2 generation from PMNs. NO⋅ can inhibit PMN-endothelial cell adhesion in the microcirculation and thus potentially exert anti-inflammatory effects (6Kubes P. Suzuki M. Granger D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4651-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been observed that increased NO⋅generation leads to cytotoxicity following sepsis, ischemia, and reperfusion (7Schulz R. Wambolt R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 432-439PubMed Google Scholar) or anoxia and reoxygenation (8Matheis G. Sherman M.P. Buckberg G.D. Haybron D.M. Young H.H. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H616-H620PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ONOO− is formed by the reaction of O⨪2 and NO⋅ in post-ischemic tissues and following the process of inflammation (9Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that O⨪2plays a key role in NO⋅-induced toxicity, and previously proposed mechanisms for both O⨪2- and NO⋅-mediated tissue injury now include a role for their combined reaction product, ONOO− (10Tarpey M.M. Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Gore J.Z. Brock T.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reaction between O⨪2 and NO⋅ is extremely fast, almost diffusion-limited in rate (2 × 109m−1s−1) (11Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). ONOO− is a potent oxidant that can attack a wide variety of biological molecules and is produced in diverse inflammatory and pathological processes, including post-ischemic injury (7Schulz R. Wambolt R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 432-439PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). ONOO− can directly oxidize sulfhydryl groups (14Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also reacts by both 1- and 2-electron oxidation reactions with a variety of biological target molecules (15Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Notably, ONOO−-mediated nitration of tyrosine residues on a variety of proteins is associated with loss of enzyme or receptor function (16Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important in the regulation of leukocyte function and the PMN oxidative burst (17Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Downey G.P. Butler J.R. Tapper H. Fialkow L. Saltiel A.R. Rubin B.B. Grinstein S. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These kinases are also modulated by various oxidants; and based on these interactions, it has been suggested that O⨪2 or secondary oxidants are important mediators of cellular signaling. Three groups of MAPK superfamilies have been identified in mammalian cells: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK-1 and ERK-2), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (also termed stress-activated protein kinase), and p38MAPK (20Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of ERK, ERK-1 (p44MAPK) and ERK-2 (p42MAPK), are expressed in PMNs (21Torres M. Hall F.L. O'Neill K. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1563-1577PubMed Google Scholar), and they transduce signals elicited via several receptors that either have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity or are associated with non-receptor tyrosine kinases (22Blenis J.

Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEKs have been detected in PMNs and have been shown to be critical for ERK activation (24Grinstein S.

It has been reported that ERK may participate in activation of the PMN oxidative burst since one of the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase (p47phox ) contains two serine residues within a sequence that is recognized by proline-directed kinases (26El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as ERK and since phosphorylation of p47phox is involved in NADPH oxidase activation (27Inanami O. Johnson J.L.

Furthermore, recent studies have reported that MEK and ERK contribute to activation of the oxidative burst of human PMNs (18Downey G.P. Butler J.R. Tapper H. Fialkow L. Saltiel A.R. Rubin B.B.

Therefore, in this study, we determined the concentration-dependent effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on activation of and O⨪2 generation from PMNs. O⨪2 generation was directly measured via EPR spin trapping with the use of the O⨪2-specific trap DEPMPO, whereas NO⋅ concentrations were monitored by NO⋅ electrode. In addition to characterizing the effects of high pharmacological levels of NO⋅, the effects of low physiological levels were studied. At these low levels, it was observed that ONOO−, formed from the reaction of NO⋅ with PMN-derived O⨪2, triggered MAPK-mediated increases in O⨪2 generation from the NADPH oxidase, whereas with high levels of NO⋅ or ONOO−, inhibition of the oxidase was seen. PIPES, EGTA, EDTA, d-glucose, NaF, Na4P2O7, Na3VO4, 2-mercaptoethanol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), Nonidet P-40, bovine serum albumin, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Tris-HCl, and urate were from Sigma. NOR-1 ((±)-(E)-methyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide) was from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The ONOO− decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,3-disulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron(III) (FeTMPS) was obtained from Monsanto Corp. (St. Louis, MO). The following materials were from the indicated sources: Percoll and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Tris and Tween 20, Bio-Rad; leupeptin, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

(Beverly, MA); and PD98059 and crystallized human serum albumin, Calbiochem. NO⋅ was scrubbed of higher nitrogen oxides by passage through a trap with solid NaOH pellets and a second trap with 1 m de-aerated (bubbled with argon for 30 min) NaOH solution. NO⋅ gas-equilibrated solution was prepared using 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) that was de-aerated by bubbling with argon for 30 min and then bubbled with scrubbed NO⋅ for 30 min (28Liu X.

To further verify the precise NO⋅ concentration derived from NO⋅gas-equilibrated solutions, electrochemical measurement of NO⋅concentrations were carried out at 25 °C using a Model 832 detector with a Faraday cage and NO⋅ electrode (CH Instruments, Inc., Cordova, IN). The ONOO− was synthesized from acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide according to Beckman et al. (15Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Alternatively, similarly prepared ONOO− was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The concentration of ONOO− was checked at the time of synthesis and again just prior to each experiment by absorbance measurements at 302 nm (extinction coefficient of 1670m−1cm−1), and only ONOO− that was >95% of the original concentration was used. To assure that pH did not change significantly upon addition of alkaline ONOO−to the reaction mixture, we also monitored the pH and limited the amount of alkaline ONOO− stock used. Human PMNs were isolated from freshly sampled venous blood of volunteers by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (30Schleimer R.P. Rutledge B.K. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 649-654PubMed Google Scholar), which yielded PMNs with a purity of >95%. Each 10 ml of whole blood was mixed with 0.8 ml of 0.1m EDTA and 25 ml of saline. The diluted blood was layered over 9 ml of Percoll at a specific density of 1.080 g/ml. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 20 min at 20 °C, the plasma, mononuclear cell, and Percoll layers were removed. Erythrocytes were lysed by addition of 18 ml of ice-cold water for 30 s, followed by 2 ml of 10× PIPES buffer (25 mm PIPES, 110 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Cells were pelleted at 4 °C, the supernatant was decanted, and the procedure was repeated. After the second hypotonic lysis, cells were washed twice with PAG buffer (PIPES buffer containing 0.003% human serum albumin and 0.1% glucose). Afterward, PMNs were counted by light microscopy on a hemocytometer. The final pellet was then suspended in PAG-CM buffer (PAG buffer with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). All EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 300 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM110 cavity. The microwave frequency was measured with a Model 575 microwave counter (EIP Microwave, Inc., San Jose, CA). To measure O⨪2 generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs, EPR spin-trapping studies were performed using DEPMPO (Oxis, Portland, OR) at 10 mm (31Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The instrument settings used in the spin-trapping experiments were as follows: modulation amplitude, 0.32 G; time constant, 0.16 s; scan time, 60 s; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; and microwave frequency, 9.76 GHz. The samples were placed in a quartz EPR flat cell, and spectra were recorded. The component signals in the spectra were identified and quantified as reported (31Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The double integrals of DEPMPO-OOH experimental spectra were compared with those of a 1 μm TEMPO standard measured under identical settings to estimate the concentration of the O⨪2 adduct. Dissolved NO⋅ gas solutions were used to determine the effects of NO⋅ pre-exposure on subsequent O⨪2 generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs (4 × 106 cells/ml). Electrode measurements confirmed that after 10 min, no detectable NO⋅ remained, ensuring that NO⋅would not significantly scavenge O⨪2 generated from the stimulated PMNs. Therefore, dissolved NO⋅ gas (0–100 μm) was added to the PMNs in PAG-CM buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C; and after 10 min, PMA (1 ng/ml) was added, and O⨪2generation was measured by EPR. For experiments with ONOO−pre-exposure, ONOO− (0–100 μm) was added with a gas-tight syringe to PMNs in PAG-CM buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C; and after 1 min, the PMNs were stimulated by addition of PMA (1 ng/ml), and O⨪2 generation was measured by EPR spin trapping. As previously reported, ONOO− rapidly decays at pH 7.4 with a half-life of <1 s (15Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar); and after 1 min, no detectable ONOO− remains. To achieve sustained release of NO⋅continuing during the PMN oxidative burst so as to trigger intrinsic ONOO− generation, the NO⋅ donor NOR-1 (0–100 μm) was used, and PMNs were immediately stimulated with PMA after addition of NOR-1. PMNs in PAG-CM buffer were subjected to the same experimental conditions described above; reactions were stopped by addition of ice-cold PAG buffer; and the PMNs were rapidly pelleted. Cell pellets were immediately lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Extracts from an equal number of PMNs (106 cells/lane) were diluted with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to 4–20% Tris/glycine gradient gel electrophoresis (Novex, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, gels were then transferred to pure nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) with TransBlot (Novex). After transfer, membranes were immersed in TBST (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried skim milk overnight to block nonspecific binding. Membranes were then washed three times (5 min each) with TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using anti-phospho-ERK-1 and -ERK-2 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) in TBST containing 1% skim milk. After 4 h of incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody for 1 h. After five 10-min washes, membrane-bound anti-mouse Ig antibody was visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce), and Hyper ECL luminescence detection film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enhanced chemiluminescence film images were converted to digital format with a URL digital camera, and the images were analyzed with National Institutes of Health Image (32Miura K. Schroeder J.T. Hubbard W.C. MacGlashan Jr., D.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4198-4206PubMed Google Scholar). Although the comparisons were made on the basis of equal numbers of cells, the protein contents of these samples were also found to be equal. All the experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. Ap value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The dose-dependent effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− pretreatment on O⨪2generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs were measured by EPR spin trapping with DEPMPO. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the dose-dependent effects of PMA and to identify a concentration that would provide significant but less than half-maximal activation. As reported previously (31Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), after addition of PMA (1–100 ng/ml) to PMNs, we observed primarily a characteristic DEPMPO-OOH adduct spectrum with hyperfine splitting giving rise to 12 resolved peaks (Fig. 1 A, spectra b–d). The O⨪2 adduct DEPMPO-OOH comprised 92% of the total intensity, and the DEPMPO-OH adduct 8%. The DEPMPO-OOH signals increased as a function of the PMA concentration (Fig. 1). PMA is known to be a strong activator of protein kinase C. As shown in Fig. 1 B, at concentrations >10 ng/ml, PMA resulted in near-maximal levels of O⨪2 generation, suggesting full activation of the NADPH oxidase complex. Since maximal PMA activation could mask other stimulatory effects, in experiments evaluating the effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on O⨪2 generation from PMNs, PMA concentrations of 1 ng/ml were used so as to provide about one-third of the maximal activation. We examined the effects of NO⋅ pre-exposure on subsequent PMN function. PMNs were exposed to given initial concentrations of NO⋅ prepared using NO⋅ gas, and the concentration of NO⋅ in solution was monitored by NO⋅ electrode. After 10 min, when the NO⋅ concentration decayed to near zero, PMA was added to trigger O⨪2 generation from the PMNs. After addition of PMA (1 ng/ml), a large signal of DEPMPO-OOH and a small signal of DEPMPO-OH was observed (Fig. 2 A, spectrum a). We observed that low concentrations of NO⋅ (1 μm) had no effects on the magnitude or kinetics of DEPMPO-OOH formation (Fig. 2, A, spectrum b; and B), whereas with high concentrations of NO⋅ (100 μm), the DEPMPO-OOH signal was significantly decreased (Fig. 2 A,spectrum c; and B and C). The effects of pre-exposure of PMNs to ONOO− on subsequent O⨪2generation were also studied. It was observed that low ONOO− concentrations (1 μm) markedly increased O⨪2 generation following PMA stimulation, with higher levels of DEPMPO-OOH spin adduct seen (Fig. 3, A, spectra a and b; and B). In contrast, pretreatment with high levels of ONOO− (100 μm) markedly inhibited subsequent PMA-stimulated O⨪2 generation (Fig. 3, A, spectra b andc; and B). In further experiments, the dose-dependent effects of NO⋅ and ONOO−on subsequent O⨪2 generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs were determined. It was observed that ONOO− concentrations up to 10 μm increased O⨪2 generation, whereas ONOO− concentrations over 50 μm decreased O⨪2 generation (Fig. 3 C). With NO⋅, however, low concentrations did not alter O⨪2 generation, and only inhibition was seen at high levels (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that ONOO− can exert a concentration-dependent biphasic modulation of O⨪2generation from the PMN NADPH oxidase.Figure 3Effect of ONOO − on O⨪2 generation from PMNs. A, EPR spin-trapping measurement of O⨪2generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs in PAG-CM buffer (pH 7.4). ONOO− (1 or 100 μm) was preincubated with PMNs (4 × 106 cells/ml) for 1 min before PMA (1 ng/ml) stimulation in PAG-CM buffer (pH 7.4), and then O⨪2generation was measured by EPR spin trapping with DEPMPO (10 mm). Spectrum a, in the absence of ONOO−, a prominent spectrum of DEPMPO-OOH with only a small signal of DEPMPO-OH was seen with relative intensities of 92 and 8%, respectively. Spectrum b, with addition of ONOO− (1 μm), the DEPMPO-OOH signal was increased >2-fold. Spectrum c, with addition of ONOO− (100 μm), the DEPMPO-OOH signal was decreased ∼3-fold, and the DEPMPO-OH adduct was seen with relative intensities of 47 and 53%, respectively.

Furthermore, since ONOO− is a reactive short-lived species, its intrinsic generation near or within PMNs could be of particular importance. To generate sustained release of NO⋅ continuing during the PMN oxidative burst so as to trigger intrinsic ONOO− generation, the NO⋅ donor NOR-1 (0–100 μm) was used, and PMNs were immediately stimulated with PMA after addition of NOR-1. When NOR-1 (1 μm) was added to PMNs, the DEPMPO-OOH signal was increased by >2-fold from levels in the absence of the NO⋅donor (Fig. 4, A,spectrum b; and B), in a manner similar to that seen with extrinsic ONOO−. With addition of NOR-1 (100 μm), the DEPMPO-OOH signal was decreased by >5-fold (Fig. 4, A, spectrum c; andB). These data indicate that low concentrations of NO⋅ present at the time of O⨪2 generation enhance this latter process, whereas high concentrations of NO⋅ either inhibit or scavenge the O⨪2 generation. The dose-dependent effects of NOR-1 on O⨪2generation from PMA-stimulated PMNs were characterized, and it was observed that NOR-1 concentrations as low as 0.5 μm and as high as 5 μm increased O⨪2 generation 2–3-fold from PMA-stimulated PMNs, whereas NOR-1 concentrations over 10 μm decreased O⨪2 generation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, 100 nm to 1 μm NO⋅ added at the time of PMA stimulation using NO⋅ gas-equilibrated solution increased the subsequent level of O⨪2 generation. To characterize the time course of NO⋅ release from NOR-1 and the concentration of NO⋅ in the presence of non-activated and PMA-activated PMNs, NO⋅ electrode measurements were performed. In non-activated PMNs, NO⋅ solution concentrations initially increased over the first 5 min after NOR-1 addition and then achieved a plateau, which was followed by a gradual decrease over the next 10 min (Fig. 5). A similar time course was seen with 1, 10, or 100 μm NOR-1 (Fig. 5, A–C). In activated PMNs, the observed NO⋅ concentrations were markedly decreased, with complete scavenging seen with 1 μm NOR-1, a prominent decrease with 10 μm NOR-1, and only a partial decrease with 100 μm NOR-1. The total absence of detectable NO⋅ with 1 μm NOR-1 suggests that all of the NO⋅ release was scavenged by PMN-derived O⨪2generation. This was confirmed by experiments with superoxide dismutase, where it was observed that superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml) prevented the decrease in NO⋅ concentrations seen in activated PMNs. With 1 μm NOR-1, peak NO⋅concentrations of ∼30 nm were measured, indicating that these low physiological levels of NO⋅ could be sufficient to trigger the process of ONOO−-mediated stimulation of O⨪2 generation. To confirm that the ONOO− formation was the basis by which low doses of NOR-1 stimulated PMN O⨪2 generation, we investigated the effects of the ONOO− scavenger urate and the ONOO− decomposition catalyst FeTMPS on this process. It was observed that the NOR-1 (1 μm)-mediated O⨪2 enhancement was almost totally blocked by urate (10 μm) and totally blocked by FeTMPS (10 nm) (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the decrease in DEPMPO-OOH adduct formation seen with 100 μmNOR-1 was only slightly altered by urate and FeTMPS. Neither urate nor FeTMPS could prevent inhibition of O⨪2 generation mediated by pretreatment with NO⋅ gas (100 μm) (Fig. 6 B). Recently, it has been shown that MEK and ERK MAPKs can contribute to activation of the oxidative burst in human PMNs stimulated with a variety of activators (18Downey G.P. Butler J.R. Tapper H.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been reported that NO⋅-derived species and ONOO− can activate the phosphorylation of ERKs (33Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol.

To understand the mechanism by which extrinsic or intrinsic PMN-generated ONOO− enhances PMN O⨪2 generation, we examined the relationship between ERK activation and O⨪2generation. In preliminary experiments, we verified that PMA (1–100 ng/ml) induced the phosphorylation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 in a PMA concentration-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 was maximized above 10 ng/ml PMA in a manner similar to that seen for O"

Best known among these are the key enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)1andS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. Increases in ODC are often associated with initiation of normal cell growth and with sustained neoplastic cell growth. Overexpression of ODC activity is a well recognized feature of many cancers, and in at least one tumor type, this increase in activity has been attributed to a point mutation leading to stabilization of the typically labile enzyme protein (1Tamara A. Nishiguchi S. Kuroki T. Koh N. Kobayashi K. Yano Y. Otani S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3500-3503PubMed Google Scholar). Such findings form the rationale for certain cancer therapeutic and prevention strategies targeting polyamine metabolism. These efforts rely on inhibitors to block biosynthetic enzyme activity (2Mamont P.S. Duchesne M-C. Grove J. Bey P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1978; 81: 58-66Google Scholar, 3Kramer D.K. Khomutov R.M.

The enzyme acetylates higher polyamines that are then either excreted out of the cell or acted upon by a flavin-adenine-dependent polyamine oxidase, leading to the back-conversion of spermine (Spm) to spermidine (Spd) and Spd to putrescine (Put) (11Seiler N.

In the absence of specific SSAT inhibitors, the metabolic significance of changes in enzyme activity has not yet been clearly discerned. In fact, the role of this enzyme in modulating intracellular polyamine pools is largely inferred from its enzymatic function. Much of what is known regarding the cellular consequences of SSAT is based on studies with polyamine analogs such asN 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM), which potently induce the enzyme (9Libby P.R.

Cause and effect relationships have been difficult to establish with such analogs since, as noted above, they have other effects on polyamine metabolism and are known to exert a somewhat paradoxical inhibition of the SSAT enzyme (15Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies examined SSAT function in fetal fibroblasts from transgenic animals that overexpress SSAT (16Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

A 10-fold increase in enzyme activity was found to correlate with lowered Spd and Spm pools and increased Put and acetylated polyamine pools. More recently, McCloskey et al. (18McCloskey D.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6175-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) stably overexpressed SSAT in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and observed similar polyamine pool perturbations. Since in both instances cell growth was not affected, we reasoned that metabolic adaptations that took place following transfection may have masked the effects of SSAT overexpression on polyamine pool dynamics and cell growth. In this present study, we investigated the polyamine and cellular consequences of conditional SSAT expression. In particular, we derived cells transfected with either the human SSAT cDNA or the murine SSAT gene under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable (Tet-off) promoter (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate a previously unappreciated ability of SSAT to (a) regulate intracellular polyamine pools against a huge extracellular gradient, (b) diacetylate Spm, (c) negatively affect cell growth, and (d) markedly enhance growth inhibition by polyamine analogs. The Spm analogueN 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM (20Bergeron R.J. McManis J.S. Liu C.Z. Feng Y. Weimar W.R. Luchetta G.R. Wu Q. Ortiz-Ocasio J. Kramer D.L Porter C.W. J. Med.

A MCF-7 cell line stably transfected with a Tet-off transfection system was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 units/ml, and the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies) at 100 μg/ml at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted electronically (Coulter Model ZM, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). 1 mm aminoguanidine was routinely included in the media as an inhibitor copper-dependent bovine serum amino oxidase to prevent oxidation of extracellular polyamines to toxic products.

Latino R. Gasparini P. Zalante L. Focus. 1997; 19: 58-59Google Scholar). To facilitate clone selection, cells were co-transfected with a pTK-Hyg vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Transfected clones resistant to 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) were selected and tested for SSAT enzyme activity and/or mRNA in the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml doxycycline hydrochloride (Dox, Sigma-Aldrich). In the presence of Dox (+Dox), SSAT transcription is not induced; in the absence of Dox (−Dox), SSAT transcription is induced. A Dox concentration of 200 ng/ml was found to be the minimum antibiotic concentration required to fully and consistently suppress SSAT gene expression during cell culture passage. Clones that expressed the lowest basal levels of SSAT activity or mRNA in +Dox and the highest induced level of SSAT activity or mRNA in −Dox were selected for further study. Clones were maintained continuously under +Dox conditions until experiments were initiated. Intracellular polyamines including acetylated polyamines and polyamine analogs were extracted from cell pellets with 0.6 n perchloric acid, dansylated, and measured by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (24Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Dansylated samples (50 μl) were injected onto a 250-mm x 3.2-mm internal diameter Econosil C18 column (5-μm particle size, Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with a column temperature of 50 °C and eluted by a two-solvent gradient using a Waters 616 LC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) and a Waters WISP 710B autosampler. Solvent A contained 55% 10 mm ammonium phosphate, 45% acetonitrile at pH 4.4. Solvent B contained 100% acetonitrile. At 0.9 ml/min, the gradient began at 100% solvent A and progressed linearly to 82% solvent B over 30 min with a 15-min hold. Compounds were detected using a McPherson FL-750 BX fluorescence detector (McPherson, Acton, MA) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission cut-off filter of 500 nm. The data were collected and analyzed using Millennium 32 chromatography software (version 3.05). Total RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Human SSAT cDNA probe (21Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Pegg A.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 179: 407-415Google Scholar) was used in Northern blot analyses. ODC and SSAT enzyme activities were assayed as reported earlier (14Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with either the human SSAT cDNA (MCF-7/hSc) or the murine SSAT gene (MCF-7/mSg) were selected in hygromycin and grown as clones in the presence of Dox. Of 11 MCF-7/hSc clones (Fig. 2), those most sensitive to Dox regulation were selected according to the differential between SSAT mRNA in the presence of Dox (+Dox, SSAT-uninduced)versus mRNA in the absence of Dox (−Dox, SSAT-induced). Clone H-12, which was ideal in this regard, was lost in passaging. Subsequent attention focused on clone H-10, which displayed a 20–30-fold increase in SSAT mRNA (Figs. 2 and3) after Dox removal for 48 h. The SSAT mRNA from the transfected human cDNA (∼1.5 kb) was clearly distinguishable from the smaller (∼1.3 kb) endogenous transcript, presumably because of differences in polyadenylation, which we have previously shown to be affected by enzyme induction (25Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notice that although the exogenous 1.5-kb transcript levels increased with Dox removal, the endogenous 1.3-kb transcript levels remained the same. One unexpected finding was the appearance of two bands in the region of ∼3.5-kb SSAT RNA that previous studies (25Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown to be heteronuclear (hnRNA) in origin. Since these could not have originated from the cDNA, we can only speculate that induced SSAT gene expression may in some way interfere with processing of the endogenous heteronuclear RNA, but this remains to be investigated. The same selection strategy, applied to MCF-7 cells transfected with the murine SSAT gene (MCF-7/mSg cells), led to the identification of the M-3 clone (shown in Fig. 8). The M-3 clone showed a ∼3-fold increase in SSAT mRNA after Dox removal for 48 h. As expected for transfected genomic sequences, this SSAT mRNA was apparent as a mature ∼1.3-kb species comparable in size with the endogenous message and as a less abundant preprocessed ∼3.5-kb RNA. The time dependence of Dox-regulated expression of SSAT mRNA and activity was characterized in the newly selected H-10 clone (Fig. 3). After Dox removal, SSAT mRNA increased most rapidly during the first 6 h, after which it reached a plateau that typically ranged between 19- and 34-fold. This induction of mRNA was accompanied by a more modest rise in SSAT activity, which reached a maximum of ∼10-fold range (see Fig. 3 and TableI). In the case of M-3 cells, a more modest 3-fold increase in mRNA led to an increase in SSAT activity similar to that seen in H-10 cells (Table I).Table IThe effects of conditional SSAT overexpression on growth and polyamine metabolism in H-10 cells transfected with human SSAT cDNA (MCF-7hSc) and M-3 cells transfected with the mouse gene (MCF-7mSg)MCF-7 cellsTime − DoxCell growthODC activitySSAT activityPolyamine poolsPutN 1-AcSpdSpdN 1-AcSpmN 1,N 12-DiAcSpmSpmh% controlnmol/h/mgpmol/min/mgpmol/106 cellsParental cells2.2 ± .220 ± 5840 ± 80<54,100 ± 240<5<52,750 ± 155H-10 clone01002.2 ± .223 ± 4795 ± 60<54,035 ± 215<5<52,845 ± 185H-10 clone48883.1 ± .3271 ± 46445 ± 451,750 ± 1451,855 ± 125135 ± 10110 ± 102,600 ± 115H-10 clone96842.5 ± .3199 ± 22360 ± 352,285 ± 1701,150 ± 85165 ± 15190 ± 202,775 ± 110M-3 clone01001.522 ± 5880 ± 85145 ± 254,115 ± 225<5<52,695 ± 170M-3 clone48881.7248 ± 48505 ± 551,835 ± 1801,885 ± 75120 ± 5195 ± 252,580 ± 155M-3 clone9660NA 1-aNA, data not available.181 ± 24315 ± 302,355 ± 1851,075 ± 60175 ± 20255 ± 302,475 ± 115Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., where n is at least 3.1-a NA, data not available.

The time-dependent metabolic consequences of SSAT overexpression on polyamine metabolism were evaluated in the H-10 clone (Table I). Interestingly, there did not appear to be a compensatory rise in ODC activity as has been seen in systems bearing stably transfected SSAT (16Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6175-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The typical ∼10-fold increase in SSAT activity was seen to have an obvious effect on polyamine pools. After 48-h of Dox, Put pools were lowered by ∼45% relative to zero time, Spd pools were lowered by ∼54%, and Spm was not significantly affected. At 96 h, Spd pools were further decreased to <30% zero control, indicating the progressive effect of SSAT overexpression. Consistent with SSAT enzymatic function, acetylated polyamine pools were profoundly increased. N 1-Acetyl-Spd increased from <5 to 1750 and 2285 pmol/106 cells by 48 and 96 h, respectively. The other enzyme productN 1 -acetyl-Spm, which is rarely seen in cells, increased from <5 pmol/106 cells in +Dox cells to 165 pmol/106 cells in −Dox cells at 96 h. We also noted significant amounts of a novel polyamine peak that was subsequently identified asN 1,N 12 -diacetyl-Spm (see below), which accumulated to 190 pmol/106 cells by 96 h. In contrast to a previous report (18McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6175-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) studying CHO cells stably transfected with SSAT, N 8-acetyl-Spd was not detected in these cells. Very similar trends were observed in M-3 cells transfected with murine SSAT genomic sequences (MCF-7/mSg cells, Table I). As with the H-10 cells, Put and Spd pools decreased with the former, falling to 36% of the zero control, and the latter, to 25% of control by 96 h. In previous studies with SSAT transgenic mice (16Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in the embryo fibroblasts derived from them (17Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Put pools increased rather than decreased. This may be because ODC activity increased in the stably transfected systems but remained relatively constant during conditional overexpression of SSAT (Table I). Fig. 4 shows that conditional overexpression of SSAT causes a sustained reduction in growth in both H-10 or M-3 cells after Dox removal. M-3 cells were more sensitive than H-10 cells even though Spd pools were similarly depleted in both clones (Table I). In both cases, the growth response appeared to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic in nature, since cell proliferation continued albeit at a reduced rate. The data in Table I and Fig. 4 indicate that SSAT overexpression and the attendant inhibition of cell growth may be directly related to a reduction in intracellular Spd pools. Because Spd is generally regarded as the polyamine most critically required for cell growth (3Kramer D.K. Khomutov R.M. Bukin Y.V. Khomutov A.R. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we investigated whether it could prevent growth inhibition. This strategy is typically employed to validate the specificity of polyamine enzyme inhibitors (2Mamont P.S. Duchesne M-C. Grove J. Bey P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1978; 81: 58-66Google Scholar, 3Kramer D.K. Khomutov R.M. Bukin Y.V. Khomutov A.R. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For these studies, H-10 cells were continuously exposed (or not exposed) to 10 μm Spd after Dox removal. As shown in Fig. 5, 10 μm Spd failed to prevent growth inhibition associated with SSAT induction. Although this would suggest that Spd depletion is not responsible for growth inhibition, polyamine pool analysis (TableII) revealed that intracellular Spd pools in −Dox cells were not restored by this treatment. Rather,N 1-acetyl-Spd accumulated to enormous levels (5660 pmol/106 cells), whereas Spd pools remained at <50% that seen in +Dox cell levels, apparently because overexpressed SSAT rapidly converts influxing Spd to the acetylated derivative. Thus, the data do not exclude the possibility that growth inhibition is due to Spd depletion.Table IISpermidine effects on Dox-induced growth inhibition and polyamine pool perturbations in clone H-10 cellsTreatment (48 h) 2-aSpd was added at time of Dox removal.Cell growthPolyamine poolsPutN 1-AcSpdSpdN 1-AcSpmN 1,N 12-DiAcSpmSpm% controlpmol/106 cellsUninduced H-10 + Dox100758 ± 45<54,040 ± 120<5<52,775 ± 60 H-10 + Dox + 10 μm Spd9975 ± 570 ± 104,840 ± 140<5<52,525 ± 85Induced H-10 − Dox84340 ± 601,565 ± 1451,115 ± 20110 ± 10105 ± 52,570 ± 40 H-10 − Dox + 10 μmSpd88232 ± 305,660 ± 3251,850 ± 40205 ± 12845 ± 402,155 ± 90Data are experimentally matched to that presented in Fig. 5 and are expressed as mean ± S.E., where n is at least 3.2-a Spd was added at time of Dox removal.

These findings prompted us to examine whether higher concentrations of Spd might be able to saturate SSAT and allow for restoration of Spd pools and prevention of growth inhibition. Here, we encountered the unexpected finding that external Spd concentrations as high as 500 μm were still unable to restore intracellular Spd pools (Fig. 6) or to prevent growth inhibition (Table III and Fig. 6 legend). Although cells grown +Dox and treated with increasing levels of exogenous Spd clearly accumulated higher than normal Spd levels (up to 150%), cells grown −Dox did not. Intracellular Spd pools remained at subnormal levels, whereas N 1-acetyl-Spd rose to extremely high levels, increasing from <5 to >14,000 pmol/106 cells during treatment with 500 μm Spd. Thus, even unusually high levels of exogenous Spd were unable to restore intracellular Spd pools and prevent growth inhibition in SSAT-induced cells.Table IIIEffects of exogenous polyamines and polyamine inhibitors on Dox-induced growth inhibition and polyamine pool perturbations in clone H-10 cellsTreatment (48 h) 3-aTreatment began at the time of Dox removal.Cell growthPolyamine poolsPutN 1-AcSpdSpdN 1-AcSpmN 1,N 12-DiAcSpmSpm% controlpmol/106 cellsH-10 + Dox100795 ± 60<54,035 ± 215<5<52,845 ± 185H-10 − Dox73360 ± 352,285 ± 1701,150 ± 85165 ± 15190 ± 202,775 ± 110H-10 + Dox + 100 μmSpd10070 ± 10<56,220 ± 215<5<51,800 ± 185H-10 − Dox + 100 μm Spd68385 ± 3511,720 ± 3152,130 ± 25345 ± 151,655 ± 2151,640 ± 90H-10 + Dox + 100 μmPut1003,145 ± 15060 ± 105,200 ± 60<5<52,355 ± 120H-10 − Dox + 100 μm Put799,960 ± 6902,455 ± 2002,210 ± 85125 ± 10170 ± 301,490 ± 145H-10 + Dox + 100 μmSpm100<5<5225 ± 15<5<55,285 ± 185H-10 − Dox − 100 μm Spm76265 ± 201,765 ± 35205 ± 50895 ± 854,830 ± 3753,935 ± 95H-10 + Dox + 1 mmDFMO100<5<5150 ± 35<5<52,355 ± 60H-10 − Dox + 1 mmDFMO57<5<555 ± 10<5<52,155 ± 75H-10 + Dox + DFMO + 20 μmSpd100<5<56,110 ± 340<5<51,415 ± 180H-10 − Dox + DFMO + 20 μm Spd70195 ± 256,335 ± 140780 ± 115250 ± 451,110 ± 451,955 ± 165Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., where n is 3.3-a Treatment began at the time of Dox removal.

A detailed analysis of HPLC chromatograms (Fig. 7) from−Dox cells treated with Spd revealed an additional peak that eluted beforeN 1-acetyl-Spd and rose significantly with exposure to increasing concentrations of Spd (Fig. 6). Spiking cellular extracts with authenticN 1,N 12-diacetyl-Spm confirmed a retention time coincident with the unknown peak (Fig. 7). The identity of the peak was further indicated by the finding (data not shown) that it increased remarkably in cells treated with 10 μm N 1 -acetyl-Spm, presumably because the latter was rapidly converted toN 1,N 12-diacetyl-Spm. Analysis of metabolite profiles in Spd-treated cells indicates that modest amounts of Spd are converted toN 1-acetyl-Spd in +Dox cells, whereas large amounts are converted to N 1-acetyl-Spd andN 1 -"
https://openalex.org/W2017783236,"In many epithelial tissues in the body (e.g. kidney distal nephron, colon, airways) the rate of Na+ reabsorption is governed by the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). ENaC activity in turn is regulated by a number of factors including hormones, physiological conditions, and other ion channels. To begin to understand the mechanisms by which ENaC is regulated, we have examined the trafficking and turnover of ENaC subunits in A6 cells, a polarized, hormonally responsive Xenopus kidney cell line. As previously observed by others, the half-life of newly synthesized ENaC subunits was universally short (∼2 h). However, the half-lives of α- and γ-ENaC subunits that reached the apical cell surface were considerably longer (t12 > 24 h), whereas intriguingly, the half-life of cell surface β-ENaC was only approximately 6 h. We then examined the effects of various modulators of sodium transport on cell surface levels of individual ENaC subunits. Up-regulation of ENaC-mediated sodium conductance by overnight treatment with aldosterone or by short term incubation with vasopressin dramatically increased cell surface levels of β-ENaC without affecting α- or γ-ENaC levels. Conversely, treatment with brefeldin A selectively decreased the amount of β-ENaC at the apical membrane. Short term treatment with aldosterone or insulin had no effect on cell surface amounts of any subunits. Subcellular fractionation revealed a selective loss of β-ENaC from early endosomal pools in response to vasopressin. Our data suggest the possibility that trafficking and turnover of individual ENaC subunits at the apical membrane of A6 cells is non-coordinately regulated. The selective trafficking of β-ENaC may provide a mechanism for regulating sodium conductance in response to physiological stimuli. In many epithelial tissues in the body (e.g. kidney distal nephron, colon, airways) the rate of Na+ reabsorption is governed by the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). ENaC activity in turn is regulated by a number of factors including hormones, physiological conditions, and other ion channels. To begin to understand the mechanisms by which ENaC is regulated, we have examined the trafficking and turnover of ENaC subunits in A6 cells, a polarized, hormonally responsive Xenopus kidney cell line. As previously observed by others, the half-life of newly synthesized ENaC subunits was universally short (∼2 h). However, the half-lives of α- and γ-ENaC subunits that reached the apical cell surface were considerably longer (t12 > 24 h), whereas intriguingly, the half-life of cell surface β-ENaC was only approximately 6 h. We then examined the effects of various modulators of sodium transport on cell surface levels of individual ENaC subunits. Up-regulation of ENaC-mediated sodium conductance by overnight treatment with aldosterone or by short term incubation with vasopressin dramatically increased cell surface levels of β-ENaC without affecting α- or γ-ENaC levels. Conversely, treatment with brefeldin A selectively decreased the amount of β-ENaC at the apical membrane. Short term treatment with aldosterone or insulin had no effect on cell surface amounts of any subunits. Subcellular fractionation revealed a selective loss of β-ENaC from early endosomal pools in response to vasopressin. Our data suggest the possibility that trafficking and turnover of individual ENaC subunits at the apical membrane of A6 cells is non-coordinately regulated. The selective trafficking of β-ENaC may provide a mechanism for regulating sodium conductance in response to physiological stimuli. epithelial sodium channel Xenopus ENaC vasopressin brefeldin A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The kidney regulates extracellular fluid volume in the body through modulation of Na+ reabsorption along the nephron. The ultimate regulation of Na+ reabsorption occurs at the apical surface of collecting ducts and is mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).1 ENaC is also located at the apical membrane of other epithelial tissues throughout the body, including colon, sweat glands, and airway (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Abnormalities of function of this channel, linked to inherited alterations in channel structure, have been shown to be important in several human diseases, including the hypertension seen in patients with Liddle's Syndrome (2Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. et al.Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar) and the salt-wasting seen with some variants of psuedohypoaldosteronism (3Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In addition, apparent overactivity of this channel, seen in the presence of common mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, has been linked to the pathogenesis of airway disease in cystic fibrosis (4Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L.C. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how ENaC activity is regulated under different physiological states. The primary structure of ENaC was elucidated through expression cloning (5Burch L.H. Talbot C.R. Knowles M.R. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C511-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and revealed that the channel is formed by three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ. When these three subunits are expressed together in Xenopus oocytes, they produce a channel with the typical biophysical and pharmacologic properties of the native channel: low conductance, high Na+/K+ selectivity, and sensitivity to amiloride in the submicromolar range (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 5Burch L.H. Talbot C.R. Knowles M.R. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the open probability of this channel in oocytes is much higher than in most tissues, suggesting that this expression system lacks physiologically important regulation machinery for ENaC (7Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37834-37839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression, activity, stoichiometry, and trafficking of ENaC in various tissues appears to be differentially regulated and complex. Thus, a complete understanding of ENaC trafficking and regulation requires examination of these processes in cells from tissues that express the channel endogenously. We have investigated the trafficking and turnover of individual ENaC subunits in the hormonally responsive Xenopus kidney cell line A6. Interestingly, we find that Xenopus ENaC subunits (xENaCs) at the apical cell surface have different half-lives and that xENaC subunits traffic to the cell surface in a non-coordinate fashion in response to a subset of transport-modulating agents. In particular, our data suggest a model in which cell surface xENaC activity can be regulated by the selective insertion or removal of β-xENaC. A6 cells were maintained in amphibian medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 28 °C in 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded at high density on permeable supports (0.4-μm pore, Costar, Cambridge, MA or Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used at least 8 days post-plating. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Generation and affinity purification of anti β- and γ-xENaC antibodies is described in Rokaw et al. (8Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K.

Affinity-purified anti α-xENaC antibody, generated against a peptide encoding residues 107–125 of α-xENaC, was a generous gift of Dr. Thomas Kleyman (University of Pennsylvania and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA) and is described and characterized in Zuckerman et al. (9Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An anti α-xENaC antibody, generated against this region of the protein by our laboratory, that recognizes proteins of the same molecular weights was also used in some experiments. Insulin (humulin R) was purchased from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN), and aldosterone, vasopressin (ADH), brefeldin A (BFA), and amiloride were from Sigma. Expression of xENaC subunits in HeLa cells was performed essentially as described in Weisz et al. (10Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at approximately 40% confluence. The following day, cells were infected at 37 °C with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7.3) at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20. After adsorption for 30 min, the inoculum was replaced with 0.75 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 μg of total DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 3 h post-infection, cells were starved for 15 min in cysteine-free, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, then labeled for 2 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (in vitro labeling mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in detergent solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 62.5 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After brief centrifugation (1 min at maximal speed in a microcentrifuge) to remove nuclei, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate anti-xENaC antibodies, eluted, divided into two aliquots, and mock-treated or treated with N-glycanase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Samples were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate anti-xENaC antibodies and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Radiolabeled bands were visualized using phosphorimaging with Quantity One software (Personal Molecular Imager FX; Bio-Rad). A6 cells were mock-treated or treated with aldosterone (1 μmfor 18 h or 3 h), ADH (100 milliunits/ml for 30 min), insulin (100 milliunits/ml for 30 min), BFA (5 μg/ml for 3 h) or amiloride (100 μm for 18 h). Transepithelial potential difference and short circuit current (Isc) were measured using a sterile in-hood short-circuiting device as described previously (11Steele R.G. Handler J.S. Preston A.S. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C186-C190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A6 cells were starved for 30 min, then radiolabeled for 1 h and chased for 0–4 h. Individual filters were solubilized in detergent solution, and ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels. To determine the half-life of ENaC subunits that had reached the apical membrane, A6 cells grown on 6-well filter inserts were chilled and biotinylated on ice with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). Cells were subsequently returned to 28 °C for various chase periods. At each time point, cells were solubilized, biotinylated subunits were recovered by binding to streptavidin-agarose, and samples were washed and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels. Two filter inserts were combined for each time point. After transfer to nitrocellulose, gels were probed with anti-xENaC antibodies, and the half-life of each subunit tagged at the cell surface was quantitated by measuring the decrease in biotinylated subunit recovered with time. For α-xENaC quantitation, the intensities of the 150- and 180-kDa bands were summed; for β-xENaC quantitation, both the 97-kDa band and the minor higherMr species (when observed) were summed; and for γ-xENaC quantitation, the intensity of the 95-kDa band was measured (see Table I).Table ISpecificity of anti-xENaC antibodiesAntibody raised against:cDNA expressed in HeLa cells (IP of radiolabeled cells)Newly synthesized ENaC in A6 (IP of radiolabeled cells)Steady state population of ENaC in A6 (Western blot of cell lysate)Cell surface ENaC in A6 (Western blot of biotinylated proteins)α-xENaC65 1-aLow molecular mass forms represent nonglycosylated subunits seen only under overexpression conditions., 75 kDa75 kDa150, 180 kDa150, 180 kDa (typically more of the 180-kDa form)β-xENaC70 1-aLow molecular mass forms represent nonglycosylated subunits seen only under overexpression conditions., 97 kDa97 kDa97 kDa, sometimes minor higher molecular mass band as well97 kDa sometimes minor higher molecular mass band as wellγ-xENaC75 1-aLow molecular mass forms represent nonglycosylated subunits seen only under overexpression conditions., 95 kDa95 kDa95 kDa95 kDaIP, immunoprecipitate.1-a Low molecular mass forms represent nonglycosylated subunits seen only under overexpression conditions.

The cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 15,000 × gin a microcentrifuge. Cells were resuspended in 600 μl of HB (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors by passing through a 200–1000-μl pipette tip 10 times, then lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. The nuclei were pelleted at 600 ×g, and the post-nuclear supernatant was diluted 1:1 with 62% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 4.4-ml polyclear centrifuge tube (Seton Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). 1.5 ml of 35% sucrose was layered on top followed by 1.5 ml of 25% sucrose and 0.5 ml of HB. The gradients were centrifuged in a TST 60.1 rotor at 167,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, and the interfaces were collected. Protein-matched samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-xENaC antibodies. Quantitation of internalized horseradish peroxidase in gradient fractions was performed using the assay described in Steinman et al. (12Steinman R.M. Brodie S.E. Cohn Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 665-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We previously generated antibodies against β- and γ-xENaC and confirmed that these antibodies recognize proteins of the appropriate molecular mass in A6 cells by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (8Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently acquired an antibody against α-xENaC from Dr. Thomas Kleyman. By Western blotting, this antibody recognizes bands of 70, 150, and 180 kDa in A6 cells (9Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 180-kDa band likely represents a homodimer of mature α-xENaC and is preferentially recovered from apical membrane preparations of A6 cells (9Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The identity of the 150-kDa band is unknown but appears to represent a form of α-xENaC that is primarily intracellular, as it is frequently in lower abundance when we blot ENaC biotinylated at the apical membrane of A6 cells. All three bands are competed away by preincubating the antibody with immunizing peptide (9Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Another group has also observed migration of α-ENaC at 150 and 180 kDa (13Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S.

Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23286-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To verify that our antibodies react specifically with xENaC subunits, we expressed α-, β-, and γ-xENaC from cDNA in HeLa cells using recombinant vaccinia virus and immunoprecipitated radiolabeled cells using anti α-, β-, or γ-xENaC antibodies (Fig. 1 A). None of the antibodies recognized proteins from mock-infected HeLa cells. Anti-α-xENaC immunoprecipitated a protein of approximately 65 and 75 kDa from HeLa cells transfected with α-xENaC (Table 1). Anti β-xENaC recognized two bands of molecular masses ∼70 and 97 kDa from cells transfected with β-xENaC, and anti γ-xENaC recognized 2 bands of molecular masses 75 and 95 kDa from cells transfected with γ-xENaC. In the case of α- and γ-xENaC, treatment with N-glycanase resulted in collapse of the more slowly migrating band into the band with faster mobility. Treatment of β-xENaC immunoprecipitates withN-glycanase caused a shift in the migration of the higher molecular mass band; however, this band did not migrate with the lower molecular mass band, suggesting a further post-translational modification of this subunit. The nonglycosylated subunits that we observed in this overexpression system have previously been observed in other heterologous expression systems, and are not membrane associated nor do they represent degradation intermediates (14Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30344-30351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is likely that these forms are an aberration induced by overexpression. To confirm that endogenous ENaC expressed in A6 cells was glycosylated, we biotinylated the apical membrane of polarized cells, recovered surface proteins using streptavidin-agarose, and treated the samples withN-glycanase. ENaC subunits were then detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1 b). The mobilities of both β- and γ-xENaC shifted to 70 and 75 kDa as expected. However, neitherN-glycanase nor endoglycosidase H treatment affected the mobility of the α-xENaC bands. We suspect that these high molecular mass forms of α-xENaC may be aggregated or modified in such a way that they are resistant to deglycosylation. However, another group has reported that ENaC subunits at the cell surface of CHO cells appear to be deglycosylated (75Prince L.S. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We used these antibodies to measure the half-life of newly synthesized xENaC subunits as well as xENaC subunits that had reached the apical plasma membrane of polarized A6 cells. Consistent with a previously published study (15May A. Puoti A. Gaeggeler H.-P. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we found that the half-life of newly synthesized ENaC subunits is relatively short in A6 cells, with a half-life of approximately 2 h for each subunit (Fig. 2). In addition, we measured the relative amounts of individual ENaC subunits at the plasma membrane at steady state. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from 200 μg of cell lysate using streptavidin-agarose, electrophoresed, and Western-blotted using antibodies against the individual xENaC subunits (Fig. 3, right lane). The signal was compared with the amount of each ENaC subunit in 40 μg of cell lysate (Fig. 3, left lane). Based on this and other similar experiments, we estimate that that roughly 20% of each subunit is at the cell surface under steady state conditions. Importantly, this steady state distribution of ENaC subunits is considerably higher than that reported in oocytes (14Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30344-30351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), where less than 1% of the total subunits were detected at the plasma membrane. This observation suggests that there could be significant differences in the regulation of ENaC traffic between this overexpression system and cells that endogenously express the channel.Figure 3Steady state distribution of xENaC subunits in A6 cells. Polarized A6 cells were biotinylated using a membrane-impermeant reagent. Cells were solubilized, and 40 μg of the lysate was loaded in the left-hand lanes. 200 μg of protein was incubated with streptavidin-agarose to recover cell surface xENaC subunits (right lanes). After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the samples were blotted to detect α-,β-, or γ-xENaC. Approximately 20% of the total xENaC in the cells could be biotinylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because a large fraction of newly synthesized ENaC is rapidly degraded and does not reach the cell surface, the short half-life we measured for newly synthesized subunits does not accurately reflect the half-life of ENaC that has reached the cell surface. Therefore, we biotinylated the apical membrane of polarized A6 cells and measured the rate of degradation of individual ENaC subunits over time (Fig. 4). Interestingly, all of the ENaC subunits at the plasma membrane had considerably longer half-lives compared with newly synthesized subunits. Surprisingly, however, we consistently observed that the rate of degradation of cell surface β-xENaC was considerably faster (∼6-h half-life) than that of α- or γ-xENaC, which remained relatively stable over the 24-h time course. The long half-life of α-xENaC that has reached the cell surface has also been independently verified in Dr. Thomas Kleyman's laboratory. 2T. Kleyman, personal communication. The surprising observation that ENaC subunits have different rates of degradation upon reaching the cell surface suggests the possibility that individual subunits might traffic to or from the plasma membrane independently (non-coordinately). ENaC activity has been reported to be up-regulated by various hormone treatments including aldosterone, ADH, and insulin. Stimulation of ENaC channel activity by aldosterone occurs in two phases: an initial, acute phase (within 1–3 h of stimulation), thought to involve activation of silent or inactive channels resident in the apical membrane, and a late phase, (upon overnight stimulation) whose mechanism is unknown. The mechanism of action of these agents in kidney remains unclear but does not appear to involve synthesis of new channel subunits. By contrast, hyperpolarization with the sodium channel inhibitor amiloride appears to decrease ENaC activity as an adaptive response (16Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of these treatments on ENaC activity in A6 cells. As expected, treatment with aldosterone (both short (3 h) and long (18 h) term), ADH (30 min), and insulin (30 min) increased short circuit current in A6 cells (Table II). By contrast, treatment for 3 h with the fungal metabolite BFA, which inhibits delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the plasma membrane, decreased amiloride-sensitive current (Table II). Next, we tested whether the same treatments affected the surface density of xENaC subunits in the apical membrane. To do this, we incubated A6 cells with aldosterone (3 or 18 h), ADH (30 min), insulin (30 min), or BFA (3 h), then biotinylated the apical domains of the cells. The cells were then solubilized, and biotinylated proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-xENaC antibodies (Fig. 5). The level of α-xENaC recovered after these treatments was generally unaffected, although a slight (∼10%) but statistically significant decrease in apical α-xENaC was observed upon treatment with ADH. By contrast, the amount of β-xENaC at the apical surface was dramatically elevated in cells treated for 18 h with aldosterone (∼60% increase;p < 0.01) or for 30 min with ADH (∼20% increase;p < 0.01). Treatment with insulin or short term incubation with aldosterone had no effect on the density of β-xENaC at the apical membrane, whereas incubation with BFA reduced apical β-xENaC levels. These striking results were reproducibly observed in multiple experiments, including several experiments in which the same blots were stripped and sequentially probed with individual anti-xENaC antibodies in random order.Table IIChanges in short circuit current in response to various transporting conditionsConditionIse (μA/cm2) mean ± S.D.Control, n = 824.4 ± 1.3Aldosterone 3h, n = 8013.8 ± 3.8Aldosterone 18h, n = 6624.8 ± 10.9ADH 30 min, n= 5910.7 ± 4.5Insulin 30 min, n = 3112.1 ± 2.8BFA 3h, n = 580.8 ± 0.8A6 cells grown on permeable supports were mock-treated with the indicated hormones or drugs and short circuit was measured as described under “Materials and Methods”.

Mean ± S.D. from at least 31 independent determinations is shown. All values were significantly different from control (p < 0.05) by independentt test. The altered cell surface distribution of β-xENaC in response to short term ADH might be due to increased delivery of newly synthesized or recycling proteins, decreased endocytosis or degradation, or to a combination of these effects. Internalization of ENaC expressed inXenopus oocytes (measured as a decrease in current density) has been shown to occur via a dynamin-dependent mechanism, suggesting that ENaC may traffic to endosomes (17Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Changes in ENaC internalization and recycling would be expected to result in reduced levels of β-xENaC in endosomal compartments. To examine this possibility, we isolated endosomal populations from non-stimulated or ADH-stimulated A6 cells and measured the levels of xENaC subunits recovered in these fractions. For this purpose, we used a flotation gradient developed to isolate endosomal fractions from other polarized epithelial cell lines. To test this method, we incubated A6 cells with the fluid phase marker horseradish peroxidase for 10 min, then homogenized the cells and isolated endosomal fractions on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 6 A). Late endosomes are concentrated at the 8.5%, 25% sucrose interface, whereas early endosomes are found at the 25%, 35% sucrose interface, very similar to the pattern observed using mammalian cells (18Leung S.-M. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 6: 2131-2150Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon fractionation of untreated A6 cells, we found ENaC subunits in early endosomes but not at the interface containing late endosomes (not shown), consistent with the presence of a recycling population of channel subunits. In response to ADH, where apical membrane β-xENaC increased, endosomal levels of β-xENaC decreased, suggesting either an increase in exocytosis or a decrease in recycling in response to ADH (Fig. 6, B and C). By contrast, the levels of α- and γ-xENaC typically increased in these endosomal fractions, although the changes were not statistically significant compared with mock-treated cells (Fig. 6, B and C). This difference in the response of β-xENaC to ADH was detected in multiple experiments and was observed when the same blot was sequentially probed with all three anti-xENaC antibodies (Fig. 6 B). Thus, our data suggest that acute stimulation with ADH results in a dramatic redistribution of β-xENaC from an endosomal pool to the apical surface of A6 cells. Altogether, our data suggest that selective delivery and/or retrieval of individual subunits can be regulated in a non-coordinate manner and that a selective increase in the level of cell surface β-xENaC compared with the other ENaC subunits could account for the increased sodium conductance observed in hormonally stimulated cells. We have investigated the trafficking and turnover of endogenous ENaC in the hormonally responsive, well characterized kidney cell line A6. As previously observed in these and other cells (14Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem."
https://openalex.org/W1990104149,"Expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was induced in renal mesangial cells by activation of heptahelical receptors by serotonin (5-HT) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Induction of CTGF mRNA was transient with maximal expression after 1 to 2 h, whereas induction ofCTGF by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) increased over time. In contrast to the induction of other early response genes (Egr-1 and cyclooxygenase-2), LPA-mediated induction of CTGF was pertussis toxin-insensitive and independent of p42/44 MAP kinase activation. 5-HT-mediatedCTGF induction was due to activation of 5-HT2Areceptors and likewise independent of p42/44 MAP kinase activation. Upon stimulation, enhanced levels of CTGF protein were detected in cellular homogenates, whereas no protein was detectable in cell culture supernatants. Inhibition of proteins of the Rho family by toxin B abrogated basal as well as CTGF expression stimulated by LPA, 5-HT, and TGF-β. Inhibition of the downstream mediator of RhoA, the Rho kinase by Y-27632 partially reduced induction ofCTGF by LPA and TGF-β. Toxin B not only affected gene expression, but disrupted the actin cytoskeleton similarly as observed after treatment with cytochalasin D. Disassembly of actin stress fibers by cytochalasin D partially reduced basal and stimulatedCTGF expression. These data indicate that an intact actin cytoskeleton is critical for the expression of CTGF. Elimination of the input of Rho proteins by toxin B, however, was significantly more effective and their effect on CTGFexpression thus goes beyond disruption of the cytoskeleton. These findings thus establish activation of heptahelical receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins as a novel signaling pathway to induce CTGF. Proteins of the Rho family and an intact cytoskeleton were identified as critical determinants ofCTGF expression induced by LPA and 5-HT, and also by TGF-β. Expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was induced in renal mesangial cells by activation of heptahelical receptors by serotonin (5-HT) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Induction of CTGF mRNA was transient with maximal expression after 1 to 2 h, whereas induction ofCTGF by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) increased over time. In contrast to the induction of other early response genes (Egr-1 and cyclooxygenase-2), LPA-mediated induction of CTGF was pertussis toxin-insensitive and independent of p42/44 MAP kinase activation. 5-HT-mediatedCTGF induction was due to activation of 5-HT2Areceptors and likewise independent of p42/44 MAP kinase activation. Upon stimulation, enhanced levels of CTGF protein were detected in cellular homogenates, whereas no protein was detectable in cell culture supernatants. Inhibition of proteins of the Rho family by toxin B abrogated basal as well as CTGF expression stimulated by LPA, 5-HT, and TGF-β. Inhibition of the downstream mediator of RhoA, the Rho kinase by Y-27632 partially reduced induction ofCTGF by LPA and TGF-β.

These proteins share structural homologies and function as growth modulators. CTGF was first purified from conditioned medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and shown to account for much of the bioactivity previously attributed to platelet-derived growth factor (4Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Recent data obtained with aortic smooth muscle cells and breast cancer cells demonstrated that CTGF may act as a mediator of growth arrest and apoptosis (5Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S.

In fibroblasts, it is most potently induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) (8Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). It stimulates fibroblast cell proliferation and mediates TGF-β-induced anchorage-independent growth (9Kothapalli D. Frazier K.S. Welply A. Segarini P.R. Grotendorst G.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTGF is a potent stimulator of extracellular matrix synthesis (10Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and suggested to be functionally involved in the development and progression of fibrotic diseases. In the kidney,CTGF mRNA levels were elevated in the majority of biopsies obtained from patients with various types of renal diseases characterized by glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (15Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In the glomerulus, basal expression of CTGF was detected in epithelial podocytes. In the inflamed glomerulus, CTGF was up-regulated in proliferating epithelial cells and also observed in mesangial cells. Mesangial cells cultured in vitro express basal levels ofCTGF mRNA, which are further increased by TGF-β (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In accordance with elevated CTGF expression in diabetic glomerulosclerosis (15Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J.

Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), elevation of glucose levels enhancedCTGF mRNA levels in cultured mesangial cells (5Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of CTGF by glucose was blocked by anti-TGF-β antibodies, confirming CTGF as a downstream target of TGF-β in mesangial cells (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Besides TGF-β, CTGF itself was able to induce its own mRNA expression (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells are thus target cells of CTGF, as also shown by the induction of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen I and IV) (5Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). CTGF belongs to the group of proteins coded for by immediate early response genes, which in general are induced by a variety of different mediators. As an example, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is induced by growth factors, cytokines, and low molecular mediators acting via serpentine receptors (17Goppelt-Struebe M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This prompted us to further investigate the regulation of CTGFmRNA and protein expression in renal mesangial cells. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is generated by cleavage of glycerophospholipids in membranes of stimulated cells. Increased release of LPA is observed in tissue injury, inflammation, and neoplasia (18Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Activated platelets are an abundant source of LPA, and high levels of the lysophospholipid (2–20 μm) are detectable in serum (19Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Via binding to seven transmembrane receptors (edg receptors), LPA modulates cell proliferation and differentiation and mediates cellular effects such as chemotaxis, adhesion, contraction, or aggregation, which are related to cytoskeletal rearrangements (18Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Treatment of mesangial cells with LPA led to contraction of the cells (20Inoue C.N. Forster H.G. Epstein M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and stimulated proliferation (21Gaits F. Salles J.-P. Chap H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,22Inoue C.N. Ko Y.H. Guggino W.B. Forster H.G. Epstein M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proliferation was shown to be mediated by the induction of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr-1 (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Likewise,Cox-2, another example of an early response gene, was rapidly induced by LPA in mesangial cells (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). LPA-mediated induction of the early response genes was pertussis toxin-sensitive,i.e. mediated by G proteins of the Gi type. Furthermore, activation of heptahelical receptors coupling to pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins also led to the induction of these early response genes as exemplified by serotonin (5-HT) (24Stroebel M. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22952-22957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Goppelt-Struebe M. Stroebel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activation of p42/44 MAP kinase was a common signaling module in both pathways: the kinase was rapidly activated by LPA or 5-HT, and inhibition of p42/44 MAP kinase prevented induction of Cox-2 orEgr-1 (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Goppelt-Struebe M. Hahn A. Stroebel M. Reiser C.O. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was thus tempting to speculate that the early response gene CTGF might be another target of LPA and/or 5-HT in mesangial cells. Based on the previous studies on the induction of Egr-1 and Cox-2, rat mesangial cells were used to investigate the induction of CTGF by activation of heptahelical receptors and to delineate the signaling pathways responsible for CTGF induction, which have not yet been described in detail in any cell type. Recombinant human TGF-β was obtained from TEBU, Frankfurt, Germany. PD-98059 was from Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany. LPA, serotonin (5-HT), and cytochalasin D were from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany. Cell culture reagents were from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany. FCS was from Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany. Toxin B from Clostridium difficile was kindly provided by Drs. F. Hofmann and K. Aktories, Freiburg, Germany. Y-27632 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Osaka, Japan. Rat mesangial cells were isolated as described (27Lovett D.H. Ryan J.L. Sterzel R.B. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2830-2836PubMed Google Scholar) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin containing 10% FCS. Mesangial cells (0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/10 ml) were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes in medium with 10% FCS. At subconfluency (after 3–4 days) cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FCS for 2–3 days. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Stroebel M. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22952-22957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation for the indicated times, total RNA was extracted according to the protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) with minor alterations. Usually, RNA yield was about 30–40 μg/10-cm Petri dish. Separation of total RNA (10 μg/lane) was achieved by use of 1.2% agarose gels containing 1.9% formaldehyde with 1 × MOPS as gel running buffer. Separated RNA was transferred to nylon membranes by capillary blotting and fixed by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. Hybridization was performed with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using the NonaPrimer kit from Appligene, Heidlberg, Germany. The specific Cox-2 probe was a 1.156-kilobase EcoRI fragment from the 5′-end of mouse cDNA (29DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A cDNA specific for CTGF (full-length cDNA of human CTGF) was kindly provided by N. Wahab, London, UK (30Mason R. Li X.J. Wahab N.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 642AGoogle Scholar). The GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) probe was obtained with a 500-base pair reverse-transcribed fragment. DNA/RNA hybrids were detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film. As a control for equal loading of the gels, the housekeeping gene GAPDH or the 18 S rRNA were hybridized or the blotted 18 S rRNA was stained with methylene blue (0.04% in 500 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2) and directly quantitated by densitometry. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiographs was performed by densitometric scanning (Froebel, Wasserburg, Germany). All values were corrected for differences in RNA loading by calculating the ratio of the specific bands toGAPDH or 18 S rRNA expression. The two-sided Student'st test for paired samples was used to calculate significant differences. Cellular proteins were isolated using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 14 μg/ml aprotinin). For Western blot analysis, 75 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Biosupport Division, Dreieich, Germany) and probed with an antibody directed against mouse CTGF. The antibody was kindly provided by S. Werner, Zurich, Switzerland (31Dammeier J. Beer H.D. Brauchle M. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18185-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and growth-arrested on glass 8-well multitest slides (ICN, Cleveland, OH) placed in a Petri dish. After stimulation, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 7 min at room temperature. After washing, the actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin complex (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 20 min. TGF-β has been characterized as a potent inducer of CTGF in different cell types, among them human mesangial cells (5Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This was confirmed when rat mesangial cells were treated with TGF-β with subsequent analysis of CTGFmRNA expression (Fig. 1 A). A 2-fold stimulation was observed after 2 h (1.8 ± 0.4,n = 3, means ± S.D.). CTGF mRNA levels were further increased at later time points (4 h, 3.7 ± 0.8, n = 4, means ± S.D., p < 0.005). Two activators of heptahelical receptors, serotonin (5-HT) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) showed a similar but more transient response. Maximal stimulation of CTGF by LPA was observed after 1 h (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation was 2.0 ± 0.4-fold (means ± S.D., n = 9, p< 0.05) with 10 μm LPA. A similar stimulation was observed with 5-HT (1.9 ± 0.7, n = 7, means ± S.D., p < 0.05, stimulation time 2 h). Induction of CTGF by LPA was concentration-dependent. Micromolar concentrations were necessary and sufficient to induce CTGF mRNA induction (Fig. 1 C). Increased proliferation of mesangial cells and the induction of the early response genes Egr-1 andCox-2 were observed in the same concentration range of LPA (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). LPA concentrations were within the range reported to occur in serum (2–20 μm (19Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar)). Higher concentrations were not used to avoid nonspecific effects of the lysophospholipid. When mesangial cells were incubated with LPA plus TGF-β, the increase inCTGF mRNA expression was additive (Fig. 1 D). Low concentrations of LPA, which by themselves did not induceCTGF expression, did not significantly augment TGF-β-mediated induction of CTGF. Additivity was also observed with TGF-β and 5-HT (data not shown). Treatment of mesangial cells with the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide revealed the dynamics of basal CTGF mRNA expression: mRNA levels were increased with time most likely due to the inhibition of the synthesis of degrading enzymes. In line with the characterization of CTGF as an immediate early response gene (e.g.Ref. 8Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar), LPA-mediated induction of CTGF was not inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide but strongly increased (Fig.1 E). CTGF is a secreted protein, and it was thus attempted to detect CTGF protein in cell culture supernatants. No CTGF protein was detectable even if the cells were stimulated with LPA or TGF-β for up to 20 h and the cell culture supernatants were concentrated more than 30-fold. Analysis of cellular homogenates by Western blot analysis with a specific antibody directed against mouse CTGF (31Dammeier J. Beer H.D. Brauchle M. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18185-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) revealed the time-dependent induction of a protein of about 38 kDa when the cells were treated with LPA or with TGF-β (Fig.2 A). This suggested that CTGF was either retained within the cells, or more likely remained attached to the cells as has been shown for human mesangial cells (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A nonspecific band was detected at about 90 kDa, which was not regulated. This band was used as reference for the densitometric quantification of the Western blots (Fig. 2 B). The time course of protein expression corresponded to the time course of mRNA induction. Co-incubation of mesangial cells with LPA and TGF-β resulted in an increased expression of CTGF protein that was additive rather than synergistic (Fig. 2 C). A second nonspecific band of a protein of about 33 kDa was detected on most blots, but with varying intensity (see also 5D). As described before (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) expression of LPA-mediatedCox-2 mRNA was strongly reduced by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), whereas 5-HT-mediated induction of this early response gene was not affected by PTX, indicating coupling to different types of G proteins (Fig.3 A). Preincubation with PTX for 18 h did not significantly affect CTGF induction by LPA or 5-HT, indicating predominant activation of G proteins of the Gq or G12/13 family in both signaling pathways (Fig. 3, A and B). In line with these results, 5-HT-mediated induction of CTGF was prevented by preincubation with ketanserin, a specific inhibitor of 5-HT2A receptors, which couple to Gq proteins (Fig. 3 C). Co-incubation of mesangial cells with 5-HT and LPA did not further enhance CTGF expression, whereasCox-2 expression was increased (Fig. 3 A and Ref.23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). LPA and 5-HT, both activate p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in mesangial cells (26Goppelt-Struebe M. Hahn A. Stroebel M. Reiser C.O. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Goppelt-Struebe M. Fickel S. Reiser C.O.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349(Prt 1): 217-224Crossref Google Scholar). These kinases were shown to be essential parts of LPA- and 5-HT-mediated induction of the early response genes Egr-1 and Cox-2 in mesangial cells (Fig. 4 A and Refs. 23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 25Goppelt-Struebe M. Stroebel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Treatment of mesangial cells with the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 led to a concentrationdependent inhibition of MAP kinase activity reaching over 90% inhibition at a concentration of 20 μm(32Goppelt-Struebe M. Fickel S. Reiser C.O.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349(Prt 1): 217-224Crossref Google Scholar). The basal expression of CTGF was reduced by about 10% when the cells were incubated with 10 or 20 μm PD-98059 (Fig. 4, A and B). Induction of CTGFby LPA or 5-HT, however, was not impaired by PD-98059 and, thus, was independent of p42/44 MAP kinase activation. Rho proteins have been characterized as downstream mediators of LPA signaling in many cellular systems (e.g. Refs. 33Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 34Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Treatment of mesangial cells for 3 h with various concentrations of toxin B, an inhibitor of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of both basal and LPA-induced CTGF expression (Fig. 5 A). Reduction ofCTGF levels by 10 ng/ml toxin B was complete, and no expression was detectable even at longer exposure times of the blot membranes (not shown). Likewise, 5-HT-mediated induction ofCTGF was sensitive to treatment with toxin B (Fig.5 B). Induction of the early response gene Cox-2was also reduced but to a lesser extent (Fig. 5, A andB). Involvement of RhoA in LPA-mediated signaling was shown by the inhibitor Y-27632, which specifically interferes with Rho kinase, a downstream target of RhoA (35Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Meakawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The inhibitor reduced LPA-mediated induction of CTGF by about 50% (51.8 ± 16.0, means ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.05; Fig. 5 C). It also interfered with TGF-β signaling, as did toxin B (see below). Inhibition of CTGF expression by toxin B was also observed at the protein level (Fig. 5 D). Inhibition of Rho family proteins strongly affected the actin cytoskeleton. Mesangial cells in culture show a high degree of actin filaments organized in stress fibers (Fig. 6). Treatment of mesangial cells with toxin B led to time-dependent changes in morphology due to a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. A more rapid destruction of the stress fibers was observed when the cells were treated with cytochalasin D. Cytoskeletal rearrangement as a possible explanation for the effect of toxin B on CTGF mRNA expression was investigated by comparison of toxin B and cytochalasin D. Pretreatment of mesangial cells for 1 h with toxin B (5 ng/ml) completely inhibited basal and TGF-β- or LPA-mediated induction ofCTGF, whereas treatment with cytochalasin (1 μg/ml) partially reduced basal and stimulated CTGF induction (Fig.7). The effect of cytochalasin D was concentration-dependent, 0.5 μg/ml being less effective than 1 μg/ml, with no further inhibition of CTGFexpression when the concentration of cytochalasin D was increased from 1 to 2 μg/ml (data not shown).Figure 7Interference of cytochalasin D with CTGF mRNA expression. A, mesangial cells were preincubated with toxin B (5 ng/ml, ToxB) or cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml, CytoD) for 1 h and then further incubated with LPA (10 μm) for 1 h or TGF-β for 4 h. B, to compare the CTGFexpression in different experiments, expression of CTGFafter stimulation with LPA after 1 h or TGF-β after 4 h was set to 100%. Data are means ± S.D. of four (LPA) and three (TGF-β) experiments. Inhibition was significant withp < 0.05 (*); Student's t test for paired samples was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The low molecular weight mediators LPA and 5-HT regulate mesangial cell contraction, proliferation, and gene induction and thus play a role in the control of glomerular hemodynamics and the progression of glomerular nephritis (36Verbeke M. Smollich B. VanDeVoorde J. DeRidder L. Lameire N. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar, 37Inoue C.N. Epstein M. Forster H.G. Hotta O. Kondo Y. Iinuma K. Clin. Sci. 1999; 96: 431-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-HT has been related to increased matrix production in mesangial cells by induction of TGF-β and enhanced synthesis of type IV collagen (38Kasho M. Sakai M. Sasahara T. Anami Y. Matsumara T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Kobori S. Shichiri M. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Induction ofCTGF by LPA and 5-HT in mesangial cells further relates these mediators to the development and progression of renal fibrosis. In mesangial cells, CTGF has primarily been characterized as a downstream mediator of TGF-β, but was also induced in an autocrine manner by recombinant CTGF (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data presented characterize activation of pertussis toxin-insensitive heptahelical receptors by LPA and 5-HT as novel signaling pathway to mediate CTGFinduction. Induction was transient with maximal mRNA levels reached after 1 to 2 h. Similar kinetics were observed recently, when fibroblasts were stimulated by factor VIIa and thrombin (39Pendurthi U.R. Allen K.E. Ezban M. Rao V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14632-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas des-Arg10-kallidin augmented CTGF mRNA levels more slowly, due to message stabilization (40Ricupero D.A. Romero J.R. Rishikof D.C. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12475-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Activation of heptahelical receptors may thus differentially affect CTGFexpression, possibly dependent on the cell type or the coupling to different downstream signaling pathways. CTGF induction by LPA or 5-HT was insensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting involvement of G proteins of the Gq/11 or G12/13 family. Regarding pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, LPA receptors seem to couple primarily to G12/13 proteins (e.g. Refs.41Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar or 42Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and citations therein), suggesting that this type of G protein might also be involved in LPA-mediated induction of CTGF. 5-HT2A receptors have been characterized on mesangial cells to mediate the mitogenic effects of 5-HT as well as induction of immediate early response genes (25Goppelt-Struebe M. Stroebel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Nebigil C.G. Garnovskaya M.N. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Am. J.

Consistently, these effects were pertussis toxin-insensitive in line with coupling of 5-HT2A receptors to Gq/11 proteins. In contrast to the induction of CTGF, LPA-mediated induction of the transient expression of early response genes Egr-1 orCox-2 was pertussis toxin-sensitive in mesangial cells (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as was c-fos induction in fibroblasts (45Cook S.J. Aziz N. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), indicating involvement of G proteins of the Gi type. LPA receptors have not yet been characterized in mesangial cells, and it is thus not clear whether pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive effects are mediated by different receptors or by differential coupling of G proteins. Previous studies have shown activation of p42/44 MAP kinases in mesangial cells within 2 min by LPA, which was sensitive to pertussis toxin, whereas activation by 5-HT was pertussis toxin-insensitive (32Goppelt-Struebe M. Fickel S. Reiser C.O.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349(Prt 1): 217-224Crossref Google Scholar). Interference with p42/44 MAP kinase activation led to an almost complete inhibition of Cox-2 and Egr-1 expression (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Goppelt-Struebe M. Stroebel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activation of p42/44 MAP kinases did not contribute significantly to LPA- or 5-HT-mediated CTGF expression, consistent with signaling pathways different from those leading to Cox-2 orEgr-1 expression. Induction of Cyr61, a protein closely related to CTGF, has recently been reported to be differentially sensitive to PD-98059 inhibition depending on the stimulus used (39Pendurthi U.R. Allen K.E. Ezban M. Rao V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14632-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Whether p42/44 MAP kinase may also be involved in CTGFinduction under certain conditions remains to be investigated. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA is a downstream signaling molecule of LPA in many cell types (e.g. Refs. 33Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 34Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rho proteins by toxin B resulted in a concentration-dependent complete suppression ofCTGF mRNA expression. This effect was not restricted to LPA-mediated CTGF expression but was also observed when the cells were stimulated with 5-HT or TGF-β. Compared withCox-2 or Egr-1 mRNA expression, induction of CTGF was particularly sensitive to toxin B treatment, possibly related to the different signaling pathways activated. Basal expression ofCTGF, which was dependent on continuous transcriptional activity, as shown by the inducing effect of cycloheximide, was reduced to a similar extent. Concomitantly with the inhibition of CTGF mRNA expression, toxin B disrupted the actin cytoskeleton. Actin stress fibers, which are strongly expressed in mesangial cells culturedin vitro, were first dissolved and later appeared in a condensed form around the nucleus. Previous studies had shown that treatment with toxin B in the concentrations used did not lead to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (23Reiser C.O.A. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D. Goppelt-Struebe M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rho kinase, a downstream kinase of RhoA, implicated in RhoA-mediated actin polymerization (46Aspenstroem P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), also impaired LPA-mediated CTGFexpression, hinting to a role for RhoA and stress fiber organization inCTGF induction. Direct disruption of the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D also strongly affected the induction of CTGFby LPA and even more profoundly by TGF-β, indicating an important contribution of an intact cytoskeleton to signal transduction from the plasma membrane into the nucleus. Most of TGF-β signaling is mediated by Smad proteins which are activated in the cytosol and then translocate into the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 47Piek E. Heldin C.-H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Whether Smad translocation or activation is impaired by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton has not been reported yet. Furthermore, transcription ofCTGF by TGF-β is dependent on a novel response element interacting with unknown transcription factors (8Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). The steps of the TGF-β signaling cascade, which are dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton, thus remain to be characterized. However, even complete disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, as observed after treatment of the cells with cytochalasin D, did not result in a reduction in CTGF mRNA expression comparable to the one brought about by toxin B, indicating specific effects of interference with Rho protein activation. Multiple target proteins of RhoA and the other members of the family, the involvement of which inCTGF mRNA expression is not excluded, have been described in different cell types, but mediators leading to gene expression have not yet been identified (34Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). CTGF is a secreted protein, but due to its strong binding to heparin and other matrix components, it is detectable in the supernatants or as cell-associated protein depending on the cell type investigated (48Steffen C.L. Ball-Mirth D.K. Harding P.A. Bhattacharyya N. Pillai S. Brigstock D.R. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,49Boes M. Dake B.L. Booth B.A. Erondu N.E. Oh Y. Hwa V. Rosenfeld R. Bar R.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent paper, Riser et al. (16Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) observed increased levels of CTGF protein in mesangial cell supernatants after treatment of the cells with heparin, in accordance with a high portion of cell-associated CTGF. These data are in accordance with our results, where CTGF protein was only detectable in cellular homogenates. In accordance with the increase in steady-state levels of CTGFmRNA, stimulation of mesangial cells with TGF-β or LPA also time-dependently increased CTGF protein. A single regulated band with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa was detected by the antibody used. To fully appreciate the dynamics of CTGF protein synthesis, i.e. secretion and degradation after stimulation with different types of mediators, more detailed studies will be necessary with antibodies, which are more defined with respect to the detection of proteolytic and potentially active CTGF fragments (50Brigstock D.R.

Taken together, induction of CTGF mRNA and protein in mesangial cells is not restricted to TGF-β as a stimulus but is stimulated by activation of heptahelical receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins. In the present study we showed activation by serotonin and LPA, but other activators of heptahelical receptors might also turn out to be regulators of CTGF expression thus extending the biological context of CTGF activation. The strong impact of the cytoskeletal organization on CTGF deserves further attention, because mesangial cells are contractile cells that change their phenotype during glomerular injury. The involvement of RhoA in the regulation of CTGF bears pathophysiologically and pharmacologically relevant implications: RhoA signaling is modulated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent kinases (51Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), thus linking regulation of CTGF expression to activators of these pathways such as nitric oxide or activators of adenylyl cyclase. By interference with isoprenylation, the activity of Rho proteins is inhibited by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) (e.g. Ref. 54Essig M. Nguyen G. Prie D. Escoubet B. Sraer J.D. Friedlander G. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and lovastatin and simvastatin are indeed potent inhibitors of CTGFinduction. 2M. Eberlein, J. Heusinger-Ribeiro, and M. Goppelt-Struebe, unpublished observation. RhoA, together with cytoskeletal alterations, thus seems to be an essential module of intracellular signaling pathways regulating the expression ofCTGF. The technical assistance of M. Rehm is highly acknowledged. The antibody directed against CTGF was kindly provided by S. Werner, Zurich, Switzerland, the cDNA directed againstCTGF by N. Wahab, London, UK, and toxin B by Drs. F. Hofmann and K. Aktories, Freiburg, Germany."

Although RFP is reported to be a nuclear protein that is present in the nuclear matrix, its function is largely unknown. Here we show that RFP interacts with Enhancer of Polycomb (EPC) and strongly represses the gene transcription. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the coiled-coil domain of RFP was associated with the EPcA domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC. In addition, both proteins were co-precipitated from the lysates of human cells and mostly colocalized in the nucleus. Using the luciferase reporter-gene assay, we found that they repress the gene transcription activity independent of the differences of enhancers and promoters used, although the repressive activity of RFP was much stronger than that of EPC. The coiled-coil domain of RFP and the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC were most important for the repressive activity of each protein, whereas the EPcA domain had the transcription activating ability that is unique as the Polycomb group protein function. These results suggested that RFP may be involved in the epigenetic gene silencing mechanism cooperating with Polycomb group proteins and that EPC is a unique molecule with both repressive and transactivating activities.

RING finger proteins are thought to play roles in the formation and architecture of large protein complexes that contribute to diverse cellular processes such as oncogenesis, apoptosis, development, and ubiquitination (11Borden K.L.

BMI1/Mel-18 and RING1 belong to Polycomb group proteins (15Gunster M.J. Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. de Bruijn D. Alkema M.J. van Lohuizen M. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell.

Polycomb group proteins have been initially identified inDrosophila as being involved in the maintenance of the correct expression pattern of homeotic genes. Polycomb group proteins form the chromatin associated-protein complexes that are involved in the epigenetic gene silencing and in the maintenance of cell type specificity (25Gould A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Muller J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Pirrotta V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The homologues of Polycomb group proteins were also found in other vertebrates and invertebrates such as human, mouse, chicken, Xenopus, and Caenorhabditis elegans(28Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, epigenetic gene activation mechanism is known to be mediated by distinct protein complexes consisting of trithorax group proteins. Enhancer of Polycomb (EPC) is a unique member of the Polycomb group proteins (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutations in E(Pc), theDrosophila homologue of EPC, exhibit no homeotic transformations, they enhance homeotic mutations by other Polycomb group genes, such as Pc, Pcl, ph,Sce, Scm, and sxc (30Campbell R.B. Sinclair D.A. Couling M. Brock H.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Cheng N.N. Sinclair D.A. Campbell R.B. Brock H.W. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in E(Pc) also function as the strong suppressors of position-effect variegation (PEV) that is another epigenetic gene silencing mechanism and is associated with the heterochromatin formation (32Laible G. Wolf A. Dorn R. Reuter G. Nislow C. Lebersorger A. Popkin D. Pillus L. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 33Sinclair D.A. Clegg N.J. Antonchuk J. Milne T.A. Stankunas K. Ruse C. Grigliatti T.A. Kassis J.A. Brock H.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 211-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among Polycomb group genes, only E(Pc)and Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) were shown to function asSu(var)s (suppressors of PEV) (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, E(z) was reported to have both transcription activating and repressing functions and can be classified as both Polycomb and trithorax group proteins (34La Jeunesse D. Shearn A. Development. 1996; 122: 2189-2197PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most of other Polycomb group proteins, no interacting proteins of EPC have been found so far (28Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results suggest that EPC may have a unique role in the gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Polycomb group proteins. Here we report that RFP interacts with human EPC and that RFP itself functions as a strong transcriptional repressor when targeted to reporter genes. This interaction is mediated by the binding between the coiled-coil domain of RFP and the conserved EPcA domain or the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC. Immunofluorescence study revealed that RFP mostly colocalizes with EPC in the nuclei of human cells, suggesting cooperative roles of RFP and EPC in gene silencing. The RING finger B box region (amino acids 2 to 135), the coiled-coil domain region (amino acids 132 to 317), and the RFP domain region (amino acids 316 to 514) (Fig. 2 A) were amplified by specific primers with a flankingEcoRI site on the 5′ primer and a BamHI site on the 3′ primer, using the full-length human RFP cDNA as a template. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to ensure that there were no mutations due to PCR errors. Each product was subcloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH). The cDNA fragment obtained by yeast two-hybrid screening encoded amino acids 1 to 252 of human EPC. To obtain the full-lengthEPC cDNA, we performed 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends from human testis cDNA library by the specific nested primers using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Both 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of an additional 249-bp 5′ cDNA fragment and an additional 1887-bp 3′ cDNA fragment that included a termination codon. To generate the full-lengthEPC cDNA, an NcoI/XbaI fragment of pACT2-EPC (amino acids 1–252) vector that was derived from the first yeast two-hybrid screening was ligated into theNcoI/XbaI sites of 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends product cloned into the pGEM-T vector. EPcA domain region (A region, amino acids 2 to 285), EPcB domain region (B region, amino acids 280 to 496), EPcC domain and glutamine-rich region (CQ region, amino acids 493 to 620), and CQ and carboxyl-terminal region (CQCT region, amino acids 493 to 836) (Fig. 2 B) were amplified by the specific primers with a flankingEcoRI site on the 5′ primer and an XhoI site on the 3′ primer, using the full-length EPC cDNA as a template. The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to ensure that there were no mutations. These products were cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). The pV5-HisC-GAL4BD plasmid was generated by two steps. AHindIII-EcoRI fragment of the pAS2-1 vector that contains a GAL4BD site was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-HisC vector (Invitrogen) and then the multicloning site betweenSfiI and EcoRI was replaced by that of the pACT2 vector. The full-length EPC cDNA or its fragments (A region, B region, CQ region, and CQCT region) were cloned in-frame into the pV5-HisC-GAL4BD plasmid. To obtain pV5-HisC-GAL4BD-RFP plasmids, a HindIII-BamHI fragment of pAS2-1 full-length RFP or pAS2-1 RFP domains was cloned into the same site of the pcDNA3.1/V5-HisC vector. The full-length RFP cDNA was cloned into the pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH) and used as bait to screen for its interacting proteins in a two-hybrid screen. The pAS2-1 RFPplasmid was co-transfected with human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) into the Y190 strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. The transformants were plated first on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, and then on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (histidine “jump-start” method). From approximately 5 × 106independent clones, 50 colonies were found to grow on a minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, and positive for β-galactosidase expression. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed by the filter assay method according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). After DNA isolation, these clones were further characterized by sequencing and analyzed for gene homology by the BLAST data base. To characterize the interaction between each RFP and EPC domain in the yeast two-hybrid system, the RFP and EPC domains amplified by PCR were cloned into pAS2-1 and pACT2, respectively, and transformed into Y190. Positive interactions meet the two criteria of growth in the presence of 40 mm 3-AT and the expression of β-galactosidase. Measurements were performed using six independent colonies. The GAL4-binding site was amplified from the pFR-Luc vector (Stratagene) by PCR and cloned into the KpnI/SacI sites of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). Serum response element (SRE), cAMP response element (CRE), and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter were cloned from pSRE-SEAP or pCRE-SEAP vectors (CLONTECH). 293 human embryo kidney cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with 30 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 30 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and 240 ng of pCMV-GAL4 RFP or EPC fusion constructs by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (35Iwata Y. Nakayama A. Murakami H. Iida K. Iwashita T. Asai N. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the pRL-TK plasmid was used to normalize all luciferase values. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of EPC was prepared by a solid phase method and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Rabbits were immunized with 100 μg of the synthetic peptide coupled to 500 μg of thyroglobulin in complete Freund's adjuvants. The anti-RFP polyclonal antibody was described previously (8Tezel G. Nagasaka T. Iwahashi N. Asai N. Iwashita T. Sakata K. Takahashi M. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 293 cells plated in three 60-mm dishes 24 h before transfection were transfected with 2 μg of pFLAG-CMV2 EPC expression vector using the LipofectAMINE method. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. 2 μg of rabbit anti-RFP antibody with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C and then the whole cell lysates were added and incubated for 8 h at 4 °C. After washing four times in lysis buffer and twice in PBS, SDS sample buffer was added and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated on SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, filters were cut into upper and lower strips and incubated with anti-EPC and anti-RFP polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Then peroxiase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were added and developed by the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, incubated twice for 5 min in PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. For indirect immunofluorescences, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 and then with secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC. In order to perform double labeling of RFP and EPC with two rabbit polyclonal antibodies, the anti-RFP antibody was conjugated to Alexa 546 using the Alexa 546 antibody labeling kit (Molecular Probes). For double staining, EPC was stained with the primary polyclonal antibody and the secondary FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, followed by incubation with Alexa 546-labeled anti-RFP antibody. For the double labeling of RFP or EPC with PML, SW480 cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-PML antibody (PG-M3) (Santa Cruz) and secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, followed by incubation with Alexa 546-labeled anti-RFP antibody or anti-EPC polyclonal antibody and secondary rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After immunostaining, slides were mounted in PermaFluor (Shandon) and observed with a confocal microscope (MicroRadiance, Bio-Rad). To identify the interacting proteins with RFP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. The full-length coding region of RFP was cloned into the pAS2-1 vector and co-transformed with a human testis Matchmaker two-hybrid library (CLONTECH) into the yeast Y190 strain. The transformants were plated first on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, and then on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 40 mm 3-AT (histidine jump-start method). Of approximately 5 × 106 independent clones, 50 clones were His+ and β-galactosidase positive. Four isolated clones were identical and their inserts were 777 bp in length. The nucleotide sequence was shown to be highly homologous to the EPcA domain of Drosophila Enhancer of Polycomb (E(Pc)) gene by searching the BLAST data base. E(Pc) was identified in many species and especially the EPcA domain was the longest conserved region (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the full coding sequence of human EPC, we performed the 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. By using the human testis cDNA library as a template, we identified a 249-bp 5′ cDNA. A total 270-bp untranslated sequence includes a stop codon 57-bp upstream of the first ATG codon with rough conformation to a Kozak consensus sequence. A 1887-bp 3′ cDNA product included conserved EPcB and EPcC domains and a glutamine-rich (Qx) region, followed by a termination codon. The predicted amino acid sequence of EPC (836 amino acids) is shown in Fig. 1 A. The calculated molecular mass of EPC was approximately 92 kDa. EPcA, EPcB, and EPcC domains and a Qx region are highly conserved in many species, includingDrosophila, C. elegans, yeast, mouse, and human (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There appear to be two E(Pc) paralogues in mammals, and mouse paralogues are named Epc1 and Epc2 (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mouse Epc1 and Epc2 are about one-third of the length of the Drosophila E(Pc), all three domains are conserved (Fig. 1 B). Mouse Epc1 and Epc2 have longer (Epc1-L and Epc2-L) and shorter variants (Epc1-S and Epc2-S), and the shorter variants contain the EPcA domain only (29Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences from human EPC and mouse Epc1 clearly shows a high degree of conservation (81% amino acid identity) (Fig. 1 B).Figure 1Amino acid sequence of human EPC and comparison of EPC homologues in eukaryotes.

Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development. 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By the radiation hybrid mapping method (Research Genetics, Inc.), the EPC gene that we cloned was mapped on 10p11, corresponding to the location of human EPC1(data not shown). In the original two-hybrid screening, the full-length RFP was shown to interact with the EPcA domain of human EPC. To further clarify their interacting domains, we cloned the different regions of RFPand EPC in-frame into pAS2-1 and pACT2 vectors, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Each vector was transformed into yeast Y190, and interactions were assayed by growth on selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine with 40 mm 3-AT and the β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was done by using six independent colonies and the results are shown in Fig. 2 C. Strong interaction was detected between the RFP coiled-coil domain region (CC region) and the EPcA domain region (A region) or the CQCT region that includes the EPcC domain, glutamine-rich (Qx) region (CC region) and carboxyl-terminal region. Although the CQCT region of EPC interacted with RFP, the CQ region (C domain and Qx region) of EPC had no interacting activity (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC is important for EPC-RFP binding. In contrast, the RING finger B box region (RB region) or the RFP domain (RD region) of RFP showed no or very weak interacting activity in two-hybrid assays. In addition, the EPcB domain region (B region) had very weak interaction with any regions of RFP. These results indicate that the coiled-coil domain of RFP is important for EPC binding, and both the highly conserved EPcA domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of human EPC could associate with RFP. To identify the RFP and EPC proteins, we developed polyclonal antibodies against their carboxyl-terminal regions. RFP and EPC were detected as 58- and 92-kDa proteins, respectively, in the lysates of 293 human embryo kidney cells and SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). In addition, a faint 88-kDa band of EPC was present when a longer exposure was carried out (data not shown). In order to test whether the interaction between RFP and EPC in two-hybrid assays signifies an in vivo interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. However, the detection of RFP with EPC in coprecipitaion was impossible because the band of RFP (58 kDa) that should be recognized by the secondary anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody was superimposed by that of anti-EPC rabbit polyclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Thus, to overcome this problem, we transiently transfected 293 cells with the FLAG-tagged form of EPC expression vector (Fig. 3 A) so that EPC can be immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, we found coprecipitation of RFP with FLAG-EPC by using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Reciprocally, EPC was coimmunoprecipitated with RFP by the anti-RFP polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 C). These interactions were not detected when normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins were used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3, B and C). From these results, we concluded that EPC and RFP can form complexes in mammalian cells. Having confirmed the association of RFP and EPC in vitro and in vivo, we next analyzed the subcellular localization of EPC in relation to that of RFP by immunofluorescence experiments. In order to determine the subcellular localization of endogenous EPC, SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were stained with the anti-EPC polyclonal antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 4, B, E, andH, EPC proteins were found in the nuclei of SW480 cells throughout the nucleoplasm. In addition, the brightly labeled domains and the nuclear membrane distribution were apparent in some nuclei. The size and number of nuclear domains stained with the antibody were different depending on each nuclei and several domains seemed to be attached to the nuclear membrane. Endogenous RFP was also stained by using the anti-RFP polyclonal antibody conjugated with Alexa 546 and showed the similar distribution pattern in the nuclei (Fig. 4,A, D, and G). Superimposition of the two confocal images revealed that EPC and RFP colocalized in brightly labeled nuclear domains and nuclear membrane as visualized by the yellow color (Fig. 4, C, F, and I). Colocalization was also detected in the less-condensed area in the nuclei. The fine granular pattern was too complex to allow analysis of any systematic colocalization (Fig. 4, C, F, andI). Both the homogenous and concentrated distribution patterns in the nuclei were similar to those of other Polycomb group protein complexes (16Satijn D.P. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer K.M. Schul W. Alkema M.J. Saurin A.J. Freemont P.S. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RFP and EPC colocalize in the nuclei and form the nuclear structure as observed for other Polycomb group proteins. It was previously reported that a portion of RFP colocalizes with PML within PML nuclear bodies (9Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the subcellular localization of RFP and EPC and their association with PML nuclear bodies, the double staining of PML and RFP or EPC was carried out. Fig. 5 shows that the distribution pattern of PML detected as multiple concentrated nuclear bodies was distinct from that of RFP or EPC. Superimposition of the confocal images showed that colocalization of PML and RFP or PML and EPC seemed to be limited and most PML bodies did not colocalize with RFP or EPC in the nuclei of SW480 cells. Because of the structural similarity of RFP to RING1 which can act as a transcription repressor (16Satijn D.P. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer K.M. Schul W. Alkema M.J. Saurin A.J. Freemont P."

A precursor (N-propionylmannosamine), when incubated with leukemic cells, RBL-2H3 and RMA, resulted in substitution of theN-acetyl groups of surface α2–8 polysialic acid withN-propionyl groups. Expression of the altered α2–8N-propionylpolysialic acid on the surface of tumor cells induced their susceptibility to cell death mediated by monoclonal antibody 13D9 (mAb 13D9), which specifically recognizes α2–8N-propionylated polysialic acid. The expression of α2–8 N-propionylated polysialic acid and the lysis of tumor cells by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity depended on the time and dose of incorporation of N-propionylated mannosamine. In vivo, mAb 13D9 effectively controlled metastasis of leukemic cells RMA when mice were administered the precursor N-propionylated mannosamine.

N-propionylated polysialic acid 3-(4,5-dimethulthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide N-propionyl-d-mannosamine fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline Sialic acid is ubiquitous on the surface of eukaryotic cells, where as a glycoconjugate substituent, it is involved in a number of crucial biological processes (1). The permissiveness of the enzymes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis and sialoside formation (2Shames S.L. Simon E.S. Christopher C.W. Schmid W. Whitesides G.M. Yang L.L.

This strategy was first reported by Reutter and co-workers (6Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol.

This technique was used by the authors to study the effect of cell surface sialoside structural changes on viral receptors (7Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrman M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W.

Virology. 1997; 71: 5922-5931Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, Bertozzi and co-workers (9Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 216: 1125-1128Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar) have exploited this enzymatic permissiveness further by successfully usingN-levulinoylmannosamine as the precursor to introduceN-levulinoylsialic residues on the surface of a number of human cell lines. This procedure introduces unique active keto groups on the surface of the cells, which via the use of appropriate chemical reagents, can be used for the chemotargeting of drugs. We now report the successful application of the enzymatic permissiveness of sialic acid to the immunotargeting of cancer cells and the potential of our protocol to further the development of efficacious carbohydrate-based vaccines. Although some success has been reported (10Slovan S.F. Scher H.I. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 448-454PubMed Google Scholar) in creating cancer vaccines based on cell surface glycoconjugate antigens, the area remains problematic due to the fact that cancer cells fail to produce markers that distinguish them from normal cells. Population densities of cell surface carbohydrate antigens of cancer cells do differ from those of normal cells, but their individual structures are identical. Thus glycoconjugate vaccines based on these antigens are poorly immunogenic. Therefore we propose to introduce modified carbohydrate antigens on the surface of cancer cells to which a strong immunogenic response can be induced. We chose α2–8 polysialic acid (polysialic acid) as our target antigen, because although not a universal cancer antigen, it is found on a number of important cancers (11Troy F.A.

In addition we have previously demonstrated that in its N-propionylated form (NPr polysialic acid)1 it is an excellent immunogen (15Jennings H.J. Roy R. Gamian A. J.

In fact it is the basis of a potential group B meningococcal vaccine and is able, when conjugated to a protein carrier, to induce in mice high affinity NPr polysialic acid-specific antibodies (15Jennings H.J.

Although NPr polysialic acid protein conjugates do induce some antibodies that cross-react with polysialic acid, the protective antibody is predominantly based on a length-dependent (helical) form of the NPr polysialic acid, which mimics a unique capsular epitope on the surface of group B meningococci (16Pon R.A.

For flow cytometry, cells were incubated with mAbs 13D9 or 735 in 50 μl of RPMI + 1% FBS on ice. After 30 min the cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG2a (obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) in 50 μl of RPMI + 1% FBS on ice. After another 30 min the cells were washed and fixed in 1% formaldehyde and assayed on a flow cytometer (Coulter Incorporation, Miami, FL). Fluorescence intensities are expressed in arbitrary units. For antibody-dependent cytotoxicity measurements, 1 × 106 cells were pretreated with ManNPr in 24-well plates. Tumor cells (1–2 × 104), after treatment with ManNPr, were harvested, washed with PBS, and incubated with antibodies (735 or 13D9, 1 mg/ml) on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed and incubated with 10% rabbit complement (Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) at 37 °C for 2 h. The cytotoxic assay was performed as described previously (18Virag L.

MTT was dissolved at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in PBS, and the solution was sterilized by filtration. After adding 10 μl of MTT solution into each well, cells were incubated for 4 h. 150 μl of 1.5 m HCl and 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol were used to rupture the cells. A standard curve was established by measuring MTT incorporation (A 570 nm) of a known number of tumor cells, and the percent cytotoxicity of the unknown samples was calculated using the formula: % cytotoxicity = (1 − number of live cells/total number of cells) × 100%. For inhibition of antibody-dependent cytoxicity, RMA cells were preincubated with ManNPr (2 mg/ml) for 24 h, and the washed cells (1–2 × 104 in 35μl of PBS) were distributed into wells of a 96-well plate. 25 μl of mAb 13D9 (20 μg/ml) was then added to each well. This was followed by 40 μl of NAc or NPr polysialic acids (1 mg/ml) into the first well with the 2-fold serial dilutions of the inhibitor solution in subsequent wells. The cells were washed and incubated with rabbit complement at 37 oC for 2 h, and the cytotoxic assay was performed as described above. To examine the feasibility of our strategy for targeting cancer cells, we first synthesized the required precursor ManNPr, essentially using a previously described method (7Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrman M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We then performed a series of experiments to demonstrate that both a rat leukemic cell line (RBL-2H3) (13Martersteck C.M. Kedersha N.L. Drapp D.A. Tsui T.G. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and a mouse leukemic cell line (RMA) (19Kärre K. Ljunggren H.G. Piontek G. Kiessling R. Nature. 1986; 319: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar) can incorporate ManNPr into the cell surface polysialic acid (Fig.1). RBL-2H3 cells were treated with ManNPr at the same concentration for different times (Fig.1 A) and for the same time at difference concentrations (Fig.1 B). The pretreated cells were stained with mAb 13D9, specific for NPr polysialic acid (16Pon R.A. Lussier M. Yang Q.-L. Jennings H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the uptake of ManNPr, as determined from the relative surface expression of NPr polysialic acid, was both time- (Fig. 1A) and dose (Fig. 1 B)-dependent. The RBL-2H3 cells above were, in addition to mAb 13D9, also stained with mAb 735, specific for polysialic acid (17Frosch M. Gorgen I. Boulnois G.T. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The predominant specificities of these mAbs allowed for the successful monitoring of the transformation of the cell surface polysialic acid to its N-propionylated analog. Flow cytometric analysis showed that as the expression of polysialic acid on the cell surface declined with exposure of the cells to increasing amounts of ManNPr, the expression of NPr polysialic acid on the cell surface increased (Fig. 1 B). RMA cells gave similar flow cytometric profiles when subjected to the above experiments (data not shown), and from these data curves depicting the time dependence of the transformation of the polysialic acid on the surface this cell line to NPr polysialic acid were constructed. (Fig.1 C). The curves indicate that as the density of NPr polysialic acid on the cell surface increases with time and eventually plateaus, the density of polysialic acid decreases and plateaus concomitantly.Figure 1NPr polysialic acid expression on the surface of tumor cells. A, rat leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) were incubated with 4 mg/ml ManNPr in RPMI medium supplemented with 8% FBS for 3 days. At daily intervals aliquots of the cells were harvested, and the expression of NPr polysialic acid was monitored by flow cytometry using mAb 13D9. B, RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with different concentrations of ManNPr in the same medium described inA. Following harvesting of the cells the expression of polysialic acid and its NPr analog were measured by flow cytometry using mAb 735 and mAb 13D9, respectively. C, mouse leukemic cells (RMA) were incubated with 2 mg/ml ManNPr, and the expression of polysialic and its NPr analog were measured by flow cytometry using mAb 735 and mAb 13D9, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether NPr polysialic acid is a useful marker to target and kill tumor cells, assays of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig.2, A and B. Following preculture with the precursor (ManNPr), RBL-2H3 cells were further treated with mAb 13D9 and incubated with rabbit complement at 37 °C. The resultant cell counts demonstrated that lysis of tumor cells was dependent only on the time and dose of their exposure to ManNPr, because mAb 13D9 alone failed to lyse the cells. Thus, the more NPr polysialic acid was expressed on the cell surface, the more cells were killed (Fig. 2 A). Previous studies (16Pon R.A. Lussier M. Yang Q.-L. Jennings H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although mAb 13D9 did not cross-react with polysialic acid, its antigenic specificity has some similarities, being based on an epitope located on an extended helical segment (n > 10) of NPr polysialic acid (20Baumann H. Brisson J.-R. Michon F. Pon R. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4007-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus our results show that ManNPr can be incorporated into the cells in sufficient quantities to form this complex epitope, which has a requirement for many contiguousN-propionylated sialic acid residues. To confirm this result further, RMA cells were subjected to the same assay except that mAb 735 was used as the antibody. mAb 735 exhibited strong binding to the native cell surface polysialic acid and also mediated strong killing of the RMA cells. However, this killing was reduced in a time-dependent manner as ManNPr was incorporated into the cells (Fig. 2 B). The killing of tumor cells by rabbit complement alone was not significant, thus indicating that the cytoxicity of the above cells is controlled by the specificity of the antibody used. Confirmatory evidence that the cytotoxicity of RMA cells is mediated by surface NPr polysialic acid was obtained by showing that cytotoxicity could be inhibited by NPr polysialic acid (Fig.3). Although we have also demonstrated previously that mAb 13D9 does not bind to short NPr sialooligosaccharides (16Pon R.A. Lussier M. Yang Q.-L. Jennings H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that nonspecific binding to these antigens occurs when they are situated on the surface of RMA cells. If this did occur it could also possibly result in them making a contribution to the total cytotoxic effect. To determine whether the above bioengineering procedure could control tumor growth in vivo, we established a mouse solid tumor model. Mice were inoculated with RMA cells (106cells/mouse), and 5 days after inoculation the mice were treated daily with mAb 13D9 (200 μg/mouse) and precursor ManNPr (5 mg/mouse) for a period of 8 days. Tumor growth was routinely monitored by measurement of tumor size. The data showed that in combination with ManNPr, mAb 13D9 had a greater effect on tumor size than mAb 13D9 alone, although mAb 13D9 alone was also able to reduce tumor size when compared with a control group of mice (Figs. 4,A–C). These results indicate what although this bioengineering procedure is able to curtail tumor growth, it is not able to completely eradicate tumor cells from the mice. This can be explained by the fact that the original inoculum was a mixture of RMA cells, some of which were not polysialylated (Figs. 1,A and B), and were therefore unable to express the helical epitope of NPr polysialic acid on which the cytotoxicity of mAb 13D9, in the presence of ManNPr, depends (16Pon R.A. Lussier M. Yang Q.-L. Jennings H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Failure of the solid tumor cells to express polysialic acid was confirmed when mAb 735 failed to bind to tumor cells extracted from the mice (data not shown). Despite our failure to eradicate solid tumors, we carried out experiments to determine whether our bioengineering strategy could be applied to the elimination of metastatic cancer cells. We have shown that leukemic cells (RMA and RBL-2H3) already express polysialic acid on their surfaces, and it is likely, on the basis of our results (see later), that in their metastatic forms they still express a high density of this surface antigen (12Roth J. Zuber C. Komminoth P. Scheidegger E.P. Warhol M.J. Bitter-Suermann D. Heitz P.U. Roth J. Rutishauser U. Troy F.A. Polysialic Acid. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 335-348Google Scholar). This would be to their advantage, because polysialic acid, in addition to its poor immunogenicity (15Jennings H.J. Roy R. Gamian A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1708-1713PubMed Google Scholar), is also a powerful inhibitor of alternative complement pathway activation (21Jarvis G.A. Vedros N.A. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 174-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This accounts for the fact that polysialic acid is the major virulence factor in both pathogenic group B meningococci andEscherichia coli K1 (22Robbins J.B. MacCracken G.H. Gotschlich E.C. Orskov F. Orskov I. Hanson L.A. N. Eng. J. Med. 1974; 290: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The experiments in mice were carried out as described for the solid tumor using RMA cells, except that in this case the spleens of the mice were analyzed for the presence of metastatic cells. One-fifth of a cell suspension of the whole spleen of the mice was used to initiate the tumor cell limiting dilution experiment. Following cell cultures of the spleen cells the metastasized tumor cells were easily distinguished from the normal spleen cells by microscopic examination. Our data in TablesI and IIshow that there were no tumor cells in the spleen of the mice treated with a combination of mAb 13D9 and ManNPr, indicating that all transported metastasized tumor cells were polysialylated and therefore were completely eliminated from the mice.Table IAntibodies against NPr polysialic acid control tumor metastasis in vivoGroupTumors in spleen 1-aNumber per mouse.Percentage metastasis%13D9 + precursor0 /50.013D92 /633.34 /580.0Injection of tumor cells, mAb 13D9, and ManNPr into mice was carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

One-fifth of total spleen cell suspension was used to initiate a 2-fold serial limiting dilution. The samples that had no tumor cells were scored negative. The samples that had tumor cells were scored positive and were subjected to semiquantification by serial dilution. The data also revealed that mAb 13D9 alone could also partially reduce the metastasis of tumor cells to a certain extent in comparison with a control group of mice (Tables I and II). One plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the cytotoxicity of mAb 13D9 can be attributed to its ability to recognize a unique polysialic acid-associated epitope found only on the surface of in vivo RMA cells. This hypothesis has some credence, because a similar cytotoxic epitope is expressed on group B meningococci and E. coli K1. The epitope is composite in nature and is thought to be formed on the surface of the bacteria by the interaction of extended helical segments of their α2–8 polysialic acid capsules with another, probably lipid, surface component (16Pon R.A. Lussier M. Yang Q.-L. Jennings H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Jennings H.J. Gamian A. Michon F. Ashton F.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3585-3591PubMed Google Scholar). Why the expression of this type of epitope did not result in the complete cytotoxicity of all the metastatic cells is not known. In summation we have demonstrated in mice that the metastasis of tumor cells can be controlled by bioengineering their surface polysialic acid glycoconjugates to their N-propionylated analogs and then by applying immunotherapy based on antibodies specific for the modified antigen. These antibodies could be either passively administered as described herein or induced in situ by direct immunization using an appropriate NPr polysialic acid-protein conjugate vaccine. Although this new immunotherapeutic strategy was only partially able to inhibit the growth of tumor cells, its significance cannot be underestimated because of the importance of being able to successfully control metastasis in the treatment of cancer. A serious problem with the implementation of this strategy for the immunotargeting of cancer cells, which applies equally to their chemotargeting (9Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 216: 1125-1128Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar), is that in all likelihood any precursor, including ManNPr, will be taken up by both normal and cancer cells alike. Therefore, the successful application of both the above protocols will depend on a means of achieving specificity. By using polysialic acid as our target antigen we can achieve specificity mediated by the immune response, because although polysialic acid is ubiquitous on fetal tissue, it is only found in a few discrete adult tissues (12Roth J. Zuber C. Komminoth P. Scheidegger E.P. Warhol M.J. Bitter-Suermann D. Heitz P.U. Roth J. Rutishauser U. Troy F.A. Polysialic Acid.

In addition NPr polysialic acid conjugates have been successfully used as experimental human vaccines against group B meningococcal in a number of animal species without deleterious consequences (15Jennings H.J. Roy R. Gamian A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1708-1713PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tai J.Y. Michon F. Fusco P.C. Blake M.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the application of the above strategy to other sialylated glycoconjugates on cancer cells is also theoretically possible, it will be more difficult, because the former are also found on adult tissues. Therefore, it will require the introduction of different methods of achieving specificity to preferentially target cancer cells. Perhaps specificity could be generated in these cases by exploiting the differing densities of some of these glycoconjugates on normal and cancer of cells or by the introduction of new technologies whereby the precursor can be preferentially delivered to cancer cells. We thank D. Bitter-Suermann for providing mAb 735 and H. G. Ljunggren for providing the mouse leukemic cell line (RMA)."

To investigate the possibility that CD45 might modulate CD40L-induced microglial activation, we treated primary cultured microglial cells with CD40L and anti-CD45 antibody.

Accordingly, primary cultured microglial cells from mice deficient in CD45 demonstrate hyper-responsiveness to ligation of CD40, as evidenced by increased p44/42 MAPK activation and TNF-α production.

Lieb K. Illes P. Berger M. Nervenarzt. 1998; 69: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As central nervous system-resident professional macrophages, activated microglia produce and secrete potentially neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (2McGeer P.L.

Microglial activation is also associated with an increased expression of cell surface molecules, including CD45, major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, protein complement receptors such as CR4 and membrane attack complex 1, and the immunoglobulin receptors FcγRI and FcγRII (2McGeer P.L.

Additionally, we have recently shown that microglial activation resulting from stimulation with Alzheimer's β-amyloid peptides and CD40 ligand (CD40L) results in increased CD40 expression on microglia with resultant TNF-α secretion by these cells (8Tan J.

Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), regulate activation of MAPK in these cells. Similar regulation of MAPK by Src occurs in T cells following mitogenic stimulation with interleukin-18 and anti-CD3 antibody, where the activated Src family member Lck has been shown to associate with and promote activation of MAPK (11Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet, in microglial cells, the role of cell surface receptors in regulation of this intracellular Src/MAPK cascade has been largely unexplored.CD45 is a membrane-bound protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), which is expressed on a variety of immune cells, including T and B lymphocytes, where it has been shown to play a critical role in negative regulation of cellular activation (12Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CD45 is expressed on microglia at low to moderate levels, and is markedly increased following activation of these cells (13Sedgwick J.D. Schwender S. Imrich H. Dorries R.

It is generally thought that CD45 couples to Src family kinases, functioning to maintain Src in a dephosphorylated, and hence inactive, state (12Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by studies in T and B lymphocytes, where CD45-deficient cell lines demonstrate increased Src activity (15Ashwell J.D.

The CD40 pathway was initially shown to play a critical role in the humoral and cellular immune response, as ligation of B cell CD40 induces B cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells (20Foy T.M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that the CD40-CD40L interaction on microglia leads to activation of p44/42 MAPK in these cells (9Tan J. Town T. Saxe M. Paris D. Wu Y. Mullan M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6614-6621PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the idea that stimulation of CD45 might oppose the effects of CD40 ligation (28Loh R.K. Jabara H.H. Ren C.L. Fu S.M. Vercelli D. Geha R.S. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 45: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we wished to evaluate the effects of cross-linking CD45 in the presence of CD40L on microglial activation. Specifically, we wished to determine the possible involvement of the Src/MAPK cascade as an early signaling event in mediating this effect. We were particularly interested in searching for putative negative regulators of CD40-mediated microglial activation, as we have previously shown both in vitro andin vivo in a mouse model of AD that stimulation of this pathway results in exacerbation of microglial-mediated AD-like pathology (8Tan J. Town T. Paris D. Mori T. Suo Z. Crawford F. Mattson M.P. Flavell R.A. Mullan M. Science. 1999; 286: 2352-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of a molecule that could oppose this effect may provide a molecular target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with a reactive microglial component, such as AD.In this study, we show that cross-linking of CD45 markedly inhibits p44/42 MAPK-dependent TNF-α production induced by CD40 ligation in murine primary culture microglia. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that cross-linking of CD45 opposes these effects through inhibiting CD40L-induced activation of Src family kinases, particularly Lck and Lyn. Finally, we demonstrate that primary culture microglia, which are deficient for CD45, are hyperresponsive to CD40 ligation, leading to marked p44/42 MAPK activation and TNF-α secretion. Taken together, our data show that CD45 plays a novel role in mitigating CD40L-induced microglial activation via negatively regulating the Src/p44/42 MAPK cascade, suggesting that CD45 might be a potential therapeutic target for the suppression of microglial activation associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and MS.DISCUSSIONIt has previously been shown that microglia express CD45, and this expression level is markedly enhanced following activation of these cells (13Sedgwick J.D. Schwender S. Imrich H. Dorries R. Butcher G.W. ter Meulen V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 7438-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 14Carson M.J. Reilly C.R. Sutcliffe J.G. Lo D. Glia. 1998; 22: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). CD45 is well known to couple to Src family kinases, including Lyn and Lck, where it modulates Src activity via dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues (15Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Yet, the role of CD45 in microglial activation is currently speculative. We and others have shown that CD40 is also constitutively expressed on microglia at low levels, and markedly increases after activation of these cells (5Tan J. Town T. Paris D. Placzek A. Parker T. Crawford F., Yu, H. Humphrey J. Mullan M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 97: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ligation of microglial CD40 results in p44/42 MAPK-dependent TNF-α production (9Tan J. Town T. Saxe M. Paris D. Wu Y. Mullan M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6614-6621PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that stimulation of Src family kinases results in activation of the MAPK module (11Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to investigate whether CD45 might modulate CD40L-induced microglial activation through regulation of the Src/p44/42 MAPK pathway. Our results show that cross-linking CD45 potently inhibits microglial activation induced by CD40 ligation, as evidenced by TNF-α production. Furthermore, CD40 ligation results in marked activation of the Src family kinase members Lyn and Lck, with consequent downstream p44/42 MAPK activation in activated microglia. Co-treatment of microglia with CD40L and anti-CD45 mAb results in reduced Lck and Lyn kinase as well as p44/42 MAPK activity, showing that CD45 is a negative regulator of CD40L-induced microglial activation and suggesting a mechanism whereby CD45 brings about this effect by inhibiting Src kinase activity, a known function of CD45 (12Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As we had shown that cross-linking CD45 reduces CD40L-induced microglial TNF-α production, the possibility arose that this effect may be due, at least in part, to reduced CD40 receptor expression on the microglial cell surface. This idea was highlighted in a previous report, where it was shown that pharmacological inhibition of CD40-mediated monocyte activation was partially attributable to reduced gene expression of CD40 (33Zhou L. Ismaili J. Stordeur P. Thielemans K. Goldman M. Pradier O. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 93: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To rule out this possibility in our system, we treated microglia with anti-CD45 mAb in the presence or absence of CD40L and measured CD40 expression levels on these cells compared with appropriate controls. We did not observe a significant effect of anti-CD45 mAb on CD40 protein expression alone or in combination with CD40L (Fig. 2). However, treatment of microglia with CD40L does result in increased CD40 receptor expression (Fig. 2), an effect that is most likely mediated by NF-κB activation, as the CD40-CD40L interaction has previously been shown to activate functional NF-κB (39Iciek L.A. Delphin S.A. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4769-4779PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yosjimoto T. Nagase H. Ishida T. Inoue J. Nariuchi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data suggested to us that stimulation of CD45, unlike CD40, does not effect transcription factor-mediated gene expression of CD40, and led us to investigate the initial intracellular mediators of CD45-mediated negative regulation of CD40L-induced microglial activation.CD45 is a membrane-bound PTP that is well known to couple to and directly regulate the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases. However, CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of Src family kinases is a complex and not well understood phenomenon (15Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Arimura Y. Mitomo K. Okdada M. Clark M.R. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar). For example, CD45 can either activate or inactivate Src, depending on whether CD45 dephosphorylates inhibitory or activating sites within the SH1 kinase domain (19Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is thought that the receptor occupation and activation status of the immune cell under consideration (i.e. resting or antigen-associated receptor-ligated) may be a critical determinant of which sites CD45 dephosphorylates on Src (19Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered CD45 modulation of Src activity against a background of ligation of the CD40 receptor, which is well known to participate in both immune cell activation and antigen-receptor signaling. Data show that cross-linking of microglial CD45 in the presence of CD40L results in reduced activity of Lck and Lyn, showing negative regulation of CD40L-induced Src activity by CD45. Interestingly, we find that cross-linking of microglial CD45 alone results in increased Src activity (Fig. 5), supporting the hypothesis that in non-activated, resting microglia, stimulation of CD45 results in dephosphorylation of inhibiting regions of the Src SH1 domain. This idea is in line with the dualistic nature of CD45-mediated Src kinase modulation proposed by Ashwell and D'Oro (15Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), who concluded that CD45 can act not only as a simple “on” switch, but also as an “off” switch depending on the activation status of the immune cell under consideration.CD40L treatment has been shown to result in Src family kinase activation, particularly Lck and Lyn in B and T cells (26Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Lepple-Wienhues A. Grassme H. Muller C. Speer C.P. Lang F. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Brenner B.

Immunol. 1997; 160: 2121-2129Google Scholar, 43Gulbins E. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Kopperhoefer U. Linderkamp O. Coggeshall K.M. Lang F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2450-2844Google Scholar), and it has further been shown that, in B cells deficient for Lyn, ligation of CD40 results in a decreased proliferative response induced by interleukin-4 or B cell receptor stimulation (44Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 45Kato J. Motoyama N. Taniuchi I. Takeshita H. Toyoda M. Masuda K. Watanable T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4788-4795PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that CD40 may be a positive regulator of Src, and we evaluted this possibility in microglia challenged with CD40L. Our data show that ligation of microglial CD40 results in increased activity of the Src family kinases Lck and Lyn (Fig. 5) as well as TNF-α secretion by these cells (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that CD40L-induced microglial TNF-α production is dependent on p44/42 MAPK (9Tan J. Town T. Saxe M. Paris D. Wu Y. Mullan M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6614-6621PubMed Google Scholar), and we wished to evaluate the possibility that Src activation might bridge stimulation of microglial CD40 and consequent p44/42 MAPK activation. Thus, we co-treated microglia with CD40L and the Src family kinase inhibitors PP1 or damnacanthal, and find marked reduction in both p44/42 MAPK activation and TNF-α secretion by these cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that activation of Src is required to transduce p44/42 MAPK-dependent TNF-α production following CD40 ligation. This is particularly interesting when considered together with stimulation of microglial CD45, where co-treatment with CD40L and anti-CD45 mAb results in dramatic reduction of Src kinase and downstream p44/42 MAPK activities as well as TNF-α secretion. This suggests an antagonistic system that regulates microglial activation, whereby CD40 ligation leads to activation of these cells, while co-stimulation with CD40L and CD45 opposes it.Having shown that cross-linking of CD45 opposes CD40L-induced microglial activation, we asked the question whether stimulation of CD45 with anti-CD45 mAb could also mitigate against microglial activation induced by other pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS. To examine this possibility, we stimulated microglia with LPS in the presence of anti-CD45 mAb, and found marked reduction in microglial p44/42 MAPK activation and TNF-α secretion (data not shown). It has previously been reported that LPS transduces microglial activation via activation of the MAPK module (38Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neruosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Pyo H. Jou I. Jung S. Joe E.H. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Additionally, LPS-induced macrophage activation has been shown to involve one or more Src family kinases (25Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 47Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that LPS, like CD40L, stimulates the intracellular Src/MAPK pathway in microglia. It is suggested, then, that stimulation of CD45 is effective at blocking microglial activation induced by a variety of stimuli by virtue of its ability to oppose Src/MAPK pathway activation. Thus, in vivo stimulation of CD45 might be a viable therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases which involve pathological microglial activation, such as AD and MS. Microglial activation, which is characterized by transformation of microglia from a ramified to a reactive phenotype exhibiting neurotoxic properties, has been implicated as pathological in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),1 Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) (1Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Lieb K. Illes P. Berger M. Nervenarzt. 1998; 69: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As central nervous system-resident professional macrophages, activated microglia produce and secrete potentially neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (2McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Brain Res. Brain Res Rev. 1995; 21: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), both of which have been shown to promote neuronal injury (3Downen M. Amaral T.D. Hua L.L. Zhao M.L. Lee S.C. Glia. 1999; 28: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Jeohn G.H. Kong L.Y. Wilson B. Hudson P. Hong J.S. J.

Neuroimmunol. 1999; 97: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Microglial activation is also associated with an increased expression of cell surface molecules, including CD45, major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, protein complement receptors such as CR4 and membrane attack complex 1, and the immunoglobulin receptors FcγRI and FcγRII (2McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Brain Res. Brain Res Rev. 1995; 21: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 6McGeer P.L. Kawamata T. Walker D.G. Akiyama H. Tooyama I. McGeer E.G.

Additionally, we have recently shown that microglial activation resulting from stimulation with Alzheimer's β-amyloid peptides and CD40 ligand (CD40L) results in increased CD40 expression on microglia with resultant TNF-α secretion by these cells (8Tan J. Town T. Paris D. Mori T. Suo Z. Crawford F. Mattson M.P. Flavell R.A. Mullan M. Science. 1999; 286: 2352-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, microglial activation induced by a variety of stimuli including CD40L, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), β-amyloid peptides, and prion, has been shown to involve activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module, ultimately leading to production of neurotoxic products by these cells (9Tan J. Town T. Saxe M. Paris D. Wu Y. Mullan M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6614-6621PubMed Google Scholar, 10Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that members of the Src family, including the tyrosine kinase Lyn (10Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), regulate activation of MAPK in these cells. Similar regulation of MAPK by Src occurs in T cells following mitogenic stimulation with interleukin-18 and anti-CD3 antibody, where the activated Src family member Lck has been shown to associate with and promote activation of MAPK (11Tsuji-Takayama K. Matsumoto S. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikeda M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet, in microglial cells, the role of cell surface receptors in regulation of this intracellular Src/MAPK cascade has been largely unexplored. CD45 is a membrane-bound protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), which is expressed on a variety of immune cells, including T and B lymphocytes, where it has been shown to play a critical role in negative regulation of cellular activation (12Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CD45 is expressed on microglia at low to moderate levels, and is markedly increased following activation of these cells (13Sedgwick J.D. Schwender S. Imrich H. Dorries R. Butcher G.W. ter Meulen V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 7438-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 14Carson M.J. Reilly C.R. Sutcliffe J.G. Lo D. Glia. 1998; 22: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that CD45 couples to Src family kinases, functioning to maintain Src in a dephosphorylated, and hence inactive, state (12Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by studies in T and B lymphocytes, where CD45-deficient cell lines demonstrate increased Src activity (15Ashwell J.D.

Yet, the mechanism of CD45 modulation of Src activity is complex, and it is thought that CD45 might function as both a positive and negative regulator of Src in a site-specific manner (19Thomas M.L.

Many of these heat shock proteins function as molecular chaperones, suppressing the aggregation or assisting in the refolding of partially denatured proteins. The small heat shock proteins (sHsps)1 are one of the five major families of molecular chaperones. sHsps are widely distributed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Members of this diverse protein family are characterized by a conserved stretch of approximately 100 amino acids (1de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 79: 2360-2364Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This so-called α-crystallin domain displays sequence similarity to the vertebrate eye lens protein α-crystallin, which prevents protein precipitation and cataract formation in the eye lens. The function and chaperoning mechanism of sHsps are still poorly understood. Various authors have reported that overproduction of sHsps endows cells with increased thermotolerance (3Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kitagawa M. Matsumura Y. Tsuchido T. FEMS Microbiol.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, many sHsps are dispensable for cell viability and growth under physiological conditions, and several mutants lacking sHsps do not exhibit a severe growth defect (4Kitagawa M. Matsumura Y. Tsuchido T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 165-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5165-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chaperone activity in vitro has been demonstrated for numerous sHsps. They protect various substrate proteins such as citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, α-lactalbumin, or insulin from thermally or chemically induced aggregation (7Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 8Merck K.B. Groenen P.J. Voorter C.E. de Haard Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7218-7223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Upon binding to sHsps, these substrates can subsequently be refolded by other chaperones. Unlike chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp60 families, sHsps are unable to refold their substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. The main function of sHsps is to bind denatured proteins and to maintain them in a folding-competent state (10Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 11Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thereby they minimize the risk of protein aggregation by decreasing the free concentration of partially denatured proteins. As the name indicates, sHsps are characterized by their low molecular weight. The molecular mass of sHsp monomers ranges between 12 and 43 kDa. These monomers assemble into high molecular weight complexesin vivo. Many sHsps are known to form well ordered oligomers with a strictly defined number of subunits. Hsp16.5 fromMethanococcus jannaschii, so far the only sHsp whose crystal structure has been solved (12Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), forms a hollow spherical complex of 24 subunits. Other sHsps reportedly assemble into more ill-defined complexes consisting of a variable number of subunits (13Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol.

Upon heat shock, these oligomeric complexes undergo distinct structural changes. Various sHsps have been reported to form large complexes of over 1000 kDa when incubated with substrate proteins under heat shock conditions (10Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 11Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In addition, in the absence of substrate proteins, alterations of the quaternary structure of sHsps are observed upon heat shock. Hsp26 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which forms a 24-mer chaperone complex of 550 kDa at room temperature, dissociates into species of lower molecular weight when incubated at elevated temperatures (16Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S.X. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This reversible dissociation of the large oligomeric sHsp complexes upon heat shock seems to be essential for chaperone activity. sHsps that are unable to form oligomers generally exhibit weak or no chaperone activity (17van de Klundert F. Smulders R. Gijsen M.L.J. Lindner R.A. Jaenicke R. Carver J.A. De Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the oligomerization principles of selected sHsps are being extensively studied, knowledge on the formation and function of heteromultimers consisting of different members of the sHsp family is restricted. In bacteria, oligomer formation of sHsps has not been investigated so far. This is not surprising considering the fact that most bacteria appear to have a very limited number of sHsps.Escherichia coli, for example, encodes two sHsps (18Allen S.P. Polazzi J.O. Gierse J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F.

Geoghagen N.S.M. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar), and many other bacteria do not possess any gene encoding an sHsp (21Münchbach M. Nocker A. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only bacteria known to encode multiple sHsps so far are the rhizobia. Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiont of soybean, responds to a heat shock with the induction of at least 10 sHsps (21Münchbach M. Nocker A. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the presence of multiple sHsps is rather uncommon in bacteria, it is a well known feature in plants. Depending on the plant species, up to 30 sHsps are induced after a temperature upshift. These proteins can be assigned to six different classes and are localized in different cellular compartments (22Waters E.R. Lee G.J. Vierling E. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 325-338Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Similarly, the B. japonicum sHsps can be assigned to two distinct classes, A and B, based on their primary amino acid sequences. Class A consists exclusively of proteins that are typical for prokaryotes, the most prominent being the E. coli sHsps IbpA and IbpB. Class B proteins are much more divergent in sequence and phylogenetic origin. Apart from some bacterial sHsps sharing little sequence similarity with IbpA and IbpB, this class includes plant sHsps (21Münchbach M. Nocker A. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to their counterparts in plants, the rhizobial proteins all occur in the same compartment, i.e. the cytoplasm, thus principally having a chance to interact. In the present publication, we show that oligomerization between different B. japonicum sHsps is possible but that interaction is restricted to members of the same class. The hspB, hspC,hspF, and hspH genes of B. japonicumwere cloned into the expression vectors pET21b and pET24b (Novagen) after introduction of appropriate restriction sites by polymerase chain reaction. Plasmids for the production of small heat shock proteins carrying a hexahistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus were constructed by cloning the corresponding genes into the NdeI and NotI sites of the pET vectors. pET24b, confering kanamycin resistance, was used for generating plasmids pRJ5304 to pRJ5307. pET21b, which carries an ampicillin resistance marker, provided the basis for plasmids pRJ5318 to pRJ5321. A vector-encoded stretch of five amino acids (AAALE) was introduced between the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of each sHsp and the histidine tag. Plasmids pRJ5300 to pRJ5303 (based on pET24b) and pRJ5314 to pRJ5317 (based on pET21b) for producing proteins without hexahistidine tag were obtained by cloning the hspB, hspC, hspF, andhspH genes into the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pET vectors. Thereby, a stretch of three alanines was introduced at the carboxyl-terminal end of the sHsp. The plasmid pBF3-IbpB for the production of the E. coli sHsp IbpB was obtained from Helmut Burtscher (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Small heat shock proteins both with and without hexahistidine tag were overexpressed in the host strains E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and E. coli JGT14. Strain JGT14, a BL21(DE3) derivative carrying a Δibp1::kan null mutation, was obtained from François Baneyx, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington (23Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Overexpression cultures were grown at 30 °C. Once the cultures had reached an A 600 of 0.6, production of the recombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. 2–3 h after induction, bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in binding buffer (500 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.9) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DNaseI. Lysis was performed in a french pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i. Soluble crude extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Purification of hexahistidine-tagged proteins was performed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under native conditions with Ni-NTA resin from Qiagen. The column was pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. After application of the crude extract, the column was washed with washing buffers (500 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9) with increasing imidazole concentrations (5–60 mm). Purified proteins were eluted by raising the imidazole concentration to 250–300 mm. To obtain pure proteins, the eluted fractions were diluted in binding buffer and applied to the Ni-NTA column again. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Protein fractions were dialyzed against storage buffer (400 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) containing 20% glycerol and stored at −20 °C and −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. All protein concentrations reported in this study are expressed in terms of protomers. Gel filtration chromatography was performed both with E. coli crude extracts containing overexpressedB. japonicum sHsps and with purified sHsps. 500 μl of filtered (0.22 μm) crude extract was injected on a Superdex 200 HR 30/10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. Separation was performed on a GradiFrac system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified hexahistidine-tagged sHsps in binding buffer were also applied to the Superdex 200 HR 30/10 column and analyzed on a Biocad perfusion chromatography system at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The following standards were used to calibrate the column: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Citrate synthase (CS, Sigma) was heat-denatured in the presence or absence of various amounts of sHsps. Samples for the aggregation assay were prepared in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. The buffer was pre-incubated at 43 °C for at least 20 min before addition of CS (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 600 nm. Purified small heat shock proteins were added to the solution in varying concentrations. Light scattering at 360 nm was monitored for 30 min at 43 °C in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Control measurements were performed with bovine α-crystallin (StressGen) and BSA as well as with purified sHsps in the absence of CS. Oligomer formation of sHsps was studied by co-purification assays, taking advantage of the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography technique. Two alternative assays were used. In the first assay, crude extracts were denatured by adding urea to a final concentration of 8 m to disrupt pre-existing sHsp oligomers. A crude extract containing an sHsp carrying a hexahistidine tag was mixed with a crude extract containing an untagged protein. After mixing, the denaturing agent was removed by dialysis against binding buffer for 2 h, thus allowing for the formation of oligomers. The resulting protein mixture was applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column under native conditions as described above. The presence of two bands on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels was indicative of mixed oligomers consisting of both tagged and untagged sHsps. This procedure was performed with all possible combinations of histidine-tagged and untagged proteins. In the second assay, oligomer formation was allowed in vivoby co-expressing an sHsp with a hexahistidine tag together with an untagged sHsp in E. coli. Two plasmids carrying different antibiotic markers were co-transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS. Protein expression and purification were then performed as outlined above. Four representativeB. japonicum sHsps belonging to two distinct classes (class A, HspB and HspH; class B, HspC and HspF) were overproduced in E. coli JGT14. This strain, a ΔibpAB mutant of BL21 (6Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5165-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used to eliminate the background of the E. coli sHsps IbpA and IbpB. All four B. japonicum sHsps were produced both with and without a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. Overproduced sHsps represented the major band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with extracts of E. coli JGT14 bearing the pET-derived overexpression plasmids (Fig. 1). More than 50% of the overproduced protein was present in soluble form, as shown by centrifugation of cell lysates at 20,000 × g(data not shown). Protein purification was complicated by the fact that all four sHsps were extremely prone to aggregation at elevated protein concentrations (≥1 mg/ml). In particular the class A proteins HspB and HspH tended to precipitate, leading to a significant loss of protein.Figure 4Formation of sHsp homo-oligomers.

Molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated adjacent to the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hexahistidine-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column. Two purification steps were necessary to obtain proteins of ≥95% purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Purified sHsps migrated as bands with an apparent molecular mass between 18 and 20 kDa, in agreement with the molecular masses calculated from the deduced amino acid sequences of the hexahistidine-tagged proteins. These were 18,449 Da for HspB-His6, 18,377 Da for HspH-His6, 19,881 Da for HspC-His6, and 19,924 Da for HspF-His6. The apparent molecular masses of HspH and HspH-His6 were significantly higher than their calculated molecular masses, as had been observed previously (21Münchbach M. Nocker A. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of purified hexahistidine-tagged HspB, HspH, HspC, and HspF was assessed by determining their ability to prevent the thermally induced aggregation of CS at 43 °C. CS, a dimer of 49-kDa subunits, aggregates spontaneously upon incubation at elevated temperatures. Aggregation of CS can be monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 360 nm. If CS was incubated at 43 °C in the absence of sHsps, it rapidly aggregated within 30 min. In contrast, the solubility of the B. japonicum sHsps was not affected by prolonged incubation at 43 °C (Fig.2). All four B. japonicum sHsps efficiently inhibited the thermally induced aggregation of CS in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A–D). No major differences were observed between the four sHsps regarding their chaperone activity. The addition of sHsps at a molar ratio of CS:sHsp (monomers) of 1:0.5 reduced CS aggregation significantly. At a molar ratio of CS:sHsp (monomers) of 1:2, precipitation of CS was prevented almost completely. In control reactions, CS was incubated with either BSA or α-crystallin. A small concentration-dependent, general protective effect of BSA was observed, which is presumably not due to chaperone activity (Fig. 2 E) and which was much less pronounced than the effect of the sHsps. α-Crystallin, on the other hand, exhibited chaperone activity that was comparable with the B. japonicum sHsps (Fig. 2 F). The oligomeric structure of heterologously expressed sHsps was determined by gel filtration chromatography. Experiments were preferentially performed with E. coli crude extracts containing an overproduced sHsp rather than with purified proteins because a substantial fraction of the purified proteins remained irreversibly bound to the column. Similar difficulties have been described for IbpB (23Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To localize the sHsp peak within the elution profile, elution fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Gel filtration chromatography was performed both with extracts containing hexahistidine-tagged sHsps and with extracts containing untagged sHsps. The elution profiles of hexahistidine-tagged proteins were similar to those of untagged proteins (data not shown). This finding indicates that the hexahistidine tag does not influence oligomerization. All four sHsps led to a similar elution pattern. As a representative example, the elution profile of a crude extract containing HspF-His6 is depicted in Fig. 3. The sHsps eluted predominantly as 400–500-kDa complexes, as estimated by comparison with high molecular mass marker proteins. Deduced from a monomeric mass of 20 kDa, this peak corresponds to an oligomer consisting of 20 to 25 subunits. Detectable amounts of sHsps were not found in the molecular mass range of 20–50 kDa, implying that the major portion of these proteins exists in a high molecular state. Although the majority of each sHsp was present in the 400–500-kDa range, the proteins were distributed over a broad size range, extending from approximately 100 kDa to the void volume of the column. This suggests that sHsps form oligomers of heterogenous size, a finding that is consistent with results obtained by native PAGE. We observed that all examined B. japonicum sHsps migrated as a broad smear rather than as a distinct band in native gels (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that substrate proteins bound to sHsps affected the oligomeric mass of the complexes in the crude extracts, gel filtration chromatography was also performed with purified hexahistidine-tagged sHsps. Although only a small fraction of these purified proteins could be recovered from the column, they clearly displayed a comparable mass distribution as the sHsps present in crude extracts (data not shown). The fact thatB. japonicum is able to induce a surprisingly high number of different sHsps raises the question of whether these proteins assemble into homo- or hetero-oligomers. We investigated the interaction between sHsps using a co-affinity purification approach. Mixtures of crude extracts containing sHsps both with and without carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tag were applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Co-purification of the untagged sHsp was observed as an additional band on SDS gels and indicated the formation of mixed oligomers containing sHsps with and without hexahistidine tag. To provide optimal conditions for the de novo formation of oligomers, pre-existing sHsp homo-oligomers present in the crude extracts were disrupted by the addition of 8 m urea. Denaturation, renaturation, and co-purification were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and as outlined in Fig.4 A. We performed purifications with untreated extracts containing the individual proteins, as a control. In each case, the tagged protein was retained by the Ni-NTA column, whereas the untagged protein alone was unable to bind (Fig. 4,B and C, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Following the denaturation-renaturation protocol with two extracts providing a hexahistidine-tagged sHsp and the same protein without tag (e.g. HspB-His6 and HspB), we observed two bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The upper and lower bands corresponded to the tagged and the untagged proteins, respectively (Fig. 4,B and C, lane 3). As one might have expected, both proteins had interacted to form homo-oligomers. To exclude the risk of observing artificial complex formation due to the denaturing step, all co-purification experiments were repeated in an independent experimental setup. In this alternative approach, a hexahistidine-tagged and an untagged sHsp were co-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The resulting extract was applied to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Again, the appearance of two bands, one corresponding to the hexahistidine-tagged and one to the untagged chaperone, was clearly indicative of homo-oligomer formation (data not shown). Having confirmed the formation of homo-oligomers, possible formation of heteromers was assessed by co-purifying various combinations of two different sHsps. Crude extracts containing two sHsps of the same class were subjected to both the denaturation-renaturation approach (Fig.5) and the co-expression approach (Fig.6). In all cases analyzed, a protein corresponding to the size of the untagged protein was co-purified with the tagged protein (Figs. 5 and 6 B, lane 3). Thus, sHsps of the same class (HspB and HspH, or HspC and HspF) are able to form hetero-oligomers.Figure 6Formation of class A-class A and class B-class B hetero-oligomers demonstrated by a co-expression approach. A, outline of the strategy applied for the detection of oligomer formation without prior denaturation. Two sHsps, one with and one without a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag, were co-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3).

As observed with their homo-oligomeric counterparts, CS aggregation was reduced significantly when CS and sHsp heteromers were incubated at a ratio of CS:sHsp (monomers) of 1:1. The addition of sHsp heteromers in a ratio of CS:sHsp (monomers) of 1:2 led to an almost complete prevention of CS aggregation. Further co-purification experiments were performed with mixtures of two sHsps originating from two different classes,i.e. a hexahistidine-tagged class A protein and an untagged class B protein, or vice versa. Regardless of the assay used, SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins always revealed the presence of only one single protein band, which migrated to a position reflecting the apparent molecular mass of the hexahistidine-tagged protein (Fig.8, A–D, lane 3). Co-purification of the untagged chaperone was never observed. We therefore conclude that hetero-oligomer formation is not possible with members of different sHsp classes. To support our conclusions on hetero-oligomer formation, we analyzed whether E. coli IbpB would interact withB. japonicum sHsps. On the basis of its primary amino acid sequence, IbpB itself can be assigned to class A (21Münchbach M. Noc"

MRP2 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily that includes other drug efflux pumps such as the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR1) and the 190-kDa multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) (8Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J. Bakker C.T. Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). MRP2 is closely related to MRP1 and categorized into CFTR/MRP subfamily, also called ABCC subfamily (13Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). MRP1, exhibiting a multidrug resistance phenotype in tumor cell lines, shares numerous substrates with MRP2, including glutathione conjugates (14Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E.

In contrast to MRP2, MRP1 is expressed in most tissues, but lower in liver, and localized at basolateral site in hepatocyte (6Keppler D. Kartenbeck J. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 55-67PubMed Google Scholar, 8Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J. Bakker C.T. Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P.

The mechanism of how MRP2 transports the substrates is beyond our sights. In the case of P-gp, predicted transmembrane (TM) regions appeared to be particularly important for its function because the sites for interaction with substrates are embedded in lipid bilayer (16Homolya L.

In MRP1-related transporters, the role of the N-terminal transmembrane regions of MRP1 was reported (27Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

In this study, we tested whether the basic residues around TM6–TM17 of MRP2 participate in binding of substrates. We constructed 13 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis, and these mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells to test transport activity. The results suggested that Lys324, Lys483, Arg1210, and Arg1257 are involved in substrate-protein interaction, whereas Lys578 may be involved in stable expression of MRP2. LipofectAMINE and geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. 5-Chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) and monochlorobimane (mBCl) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cyclosporine A (CsA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human MRP2 expression vector, pCI-neo/MRP2, and CHO-K1 cells expressing human MRP2 (29Chen Z.S. Kawabe T. Ono M. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Uchiumi T. Wada M. Kuwano M. Akiyama S.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), CHO/MRP2, were kindly provided by Dr. Kuwano (Kyusyu Universisty, Kyusyu, Japan). In brief, NotI-tagged cDNA fragment encompassing the whole open reading frame of human MRP2 was cloned in theNotI site of mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pCI-neo/MRP2 and the stable clone CHO/MRP2 was selected by 800 μg/ml G418. For mutagenesis, we constructed pCI-neo/MRP2X, which contains a deletion of XhoI site in the multicloning site of pCI-neo, and pCI-neo/MRP2V, which contains I448V and L653V mutations by overlapping polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis method to create Sse8387I andMluI sites, respectively. The seven mutants of MRP2, K316A, K324A, K329A, H439A, K483A, K578A, and R590A, were generated by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction method. The other six mutants, R1023A, H1042A, R1100A, R1210A, R1230A, and R1257A, were generated by the method of Kunkel (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). For this, the 1758-base pairApaI-Eco81I fragment of pCI-neo/MRP2, which encodes the C-terminal half encompassing 2449–4207 amino acids of MRP2, was subcloned into pUC118EA, which has ApaI andEco81I sites in the multicloning site, and mutations were introduced. Then the original ApaI-Eco81I fragment of pCI-neo/MRP2 vector was exchanged with the mutated one. Each mutation was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. CHO-K1 and CHO/MRP2 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate, and 100 U/ml penicillin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To keep MRP2 expression in CHO/MRP2, G418 was added at final concentration of 800 μg/ml in the medium. COS-7 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The expression vectors, pCI-neo, pCI-neo/MRP2, pCI-neo/MRP2V, pCI-neo/MRP2X, and MRP2 mutants were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE. Briefly, 4 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates, and 24 h later, cells were washed and overlaid with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μg of supercoiled DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Excretion measurements were made 50 h after transfection. The excretion assay medium used in the assay was composed of 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 19.7 mmHEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Cells were washed once with ice-cold excretion assay medium and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with ice-cold excretion assay medium containing 5 μmCMFDA or 100 μm mBCl. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold excretion assay medium and incubated at 37 °C for 12 min in excretion assay medium. In CsA-directed inhibition assay, cells were incubated with culture medium containing 10 μmCsA at 37 °C for 30 min before preloading of CMFDA. 10 μm CsA was also included in preloading and excretion period. At designated time, 100-μl aliquots of the medium were collected, and the fluorescence of GS-MF and GS-B was determined by measuring the fluorescence at excitation of 490 nm and emission of 520 nm and at excitation of 380 nm and emission of 461 nm, respectively (SPECTRA MAX GEMINI; Molecular Devices). At the end of the experiment, the cells were solubilized by adding 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the fluorescence of cell lysate was also measured. The total amount of cell proteins was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells seeded on coverslips were washed once with excretion assay medium and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with excretion assay medium containing 2.5 μm CMFDA. Thereafter the cells were washed twice with excretion assay medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To visualize GS-MF accumulation, coverslips were mounted on slide glass and examined with a fluorescence microscope (model IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-MRP2 antiserum was established by the immunization of rabbit (New Zealand White) with FYFMAKEAGIENVNSTKF peptide of MRP2 corresponding to C-terminal amino acids 1528–1545. COS-7 cells transfected with MRP2 expression vector were disrupted in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μm/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was recovered, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein was applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 7.5% gel concentration. After electroblotting to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, the membrane was blocked with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and further probed with 500-dilution of anti-MRP2 antiserum diluted with 3% skim milk in TBST. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at 1,000-dilution was used as a secondary antibody, and the signal was detected with chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and nitroblue tetrazolium. The cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. They were washed with PBS and were permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing, blocking was made with 2% normal goat serum in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of rabbit anti-MRP2 C terminus antiserum diluted 1:100 with PBS and then washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:100 with PBS. Then the cells were mounted on slide glass and examined with a fluorescence microscope (model IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or confocal laser-scanning microscope (model LSM510; Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.) We have examined MRP2-mediated excretion of a fluorescent substrate, GS-MF. GS-MF is produced by sequential modification of CMFDA within the cell cytosol. At first CMFDA, which can pass through the plasma membrane, is hydrolyzed by cytoplasmic esterase, and then the metabolite was conjugated with glutathione by glutathione S-transferase (32Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting GS-MF is now dependent on specific transporter like MRP2 to go across the membrane. This was shown in Fig. 1. COS-7 cells transfected either with pCI-neo/MRP2 or pCI-neo, CHO-K1, and CHO/MRP2 were seeded on coverslips and incubated with 2.5 μmCMFDA. After washing, the cells were further incubated with CMFDA-free medium. In CHO/MRP2 and COS-7 cells transfected with pCI-neo/MRP2, intracellular fluorescence was apparently lower than that of control CHO-K1 and vector-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1). This result reveals that GS-MF is actively excreted by pCI-neo/MRP2 transfection in these cell systems. The excretion of GS-MF and GS-B from intact cells or MRP2-transfected cells was examined by using fluorescent substrate, CMFDA, and mBCl. Like GS-MF, GS-B is also a fluorescent glutathione conjugate synthesized within the cells from mBCl. Cells preloaded with 5 μmCMFDA or 100 μm mBCl were incubated in medium without these fluorescent substrate, and the excreted GS-MF or GS-B in the medium was quantitated every 3 min. In CHO/MRP2 and COS-7 cells transfected with pCI-neo/MRP2, the excretion rate of GS-MF into the medium was 3.7- and 3.2-fold higher than that of the control CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells with vector alone (t = 12 min), respectively (Fig. 2). The excretion of GS-B into the medium from CHO/MRP2 and COS-7 cells transfected with pCI-neo/MRP2 was 3.5- and 2.6-fold higher than that of the control cells (t = 12 min), respectively (Fig. 3). Because of the excretion of GS-MF and GS-B during preloading period with their precursors at 4 °C, the amount of accumulated GS-MF and GS-B in the cells expressing MRP2 was about 30% less than that of control cells at the starting point (t = 0 min) or after incubation period (t = 9 or 12 min) of excretion measurement (data not shown). Therefore, the excreted amount of GS-MF and GS-B was normalized by the amount of GS-MF and GS-B remained in the cells after excretion measurement (t = 9 or 12 min).Figure 3Excretion of GS-B from CHO/MRP2 and COS-7/MRP2 cells. MRP2 expression vector-transfected or empty vector-transfected cells were incubated at 4 °C with 100 μm mBCl for 60 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C with mBCl-free medium for 12 min. The amount of GS-B in the medium at designated time was divided by the amount of intracellular GS-B at 12 min. ○, CHO-K1; ●, CHO/MRP2; ■, COS-7; ▪, COS-7/MRP2. The experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was previously characterized that P-gp transports wide variety of cationic substrates (33Smit J.W. Duin E. Steen H. Oosting R. Roggeveld J. Meijer D.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how those substrates could be recognized by P-gp was speculated to be due to an interaction of negatively charged amino acid residues in transmembrane region of P-gp with cationic substrates (34Zheleznova E.E. Markham P. Edgar R. Bibi E. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Trends Biochem Sci. 2000; 2: 39-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is supposed that positively charged amino acid residues are important in anionic substrate transporting MRP2. To explore this possibility, we constructed MRP2 mutants that are carrying mutations at basic amino acid residues around transmembrane regions by site-directed mutagenesis. We replaced each of 13 basic residues (Lys316, Lys324, Lys329, His439, Lys483, Lys578, Arg590, Arg1023, His1042, Arg1100, Arg1210, Arg1230, and Arg1257) around transmembrane regions from TM6 to TM17 with alanine (Fig. 4). The wild type or mutant MRP2 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the expression amount was compared by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5) and immunocytostaining (Fig. 6) with rabbit anti-MRP2 C terminus antiserum. The expression amount of each mutants was consistent in both immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. Except for K578A, all of the mutants were expressed at nearly the same level when compared with wild type MRP2. Only the expression of K578A was faint in both immunoblot and immunocytochemistry.Figure 5Detection of mutant MRP2 protein expressed in COS-7 cells by immunoblot analysis. COS-7 cells transfected either with wild type or mutant MRP2 expression vector were lyzed in RIPA buffer, and 100 μg of protein of soluble fraction was loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed immunobloting using anti-MRP2 C terminus antiserum. MRP2 was detected in the lanes of wild or mutant MRP2 expression vector-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Fluorescent immunocytostaining of MRP2 and its mutants. COS-7 cells transfected either with wild type or mutant MRP2 expression vector were exposed to the rabbit anti-MRP2 C terminus antiserum after permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and were photographed using a fluorescence microscope. The photograph was taken under the same conditions. Exposure time was 0.13 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First of all, we examined the excretion of GS-MF from COS-7 cells transfected with pCI-neo/MRP2V, which contains conservative amino acid changes as I448V and L653V, or pCI-neo/MRP2X, which contains a small deletion at the multi-cloning site of the vector. MRP2X-transfected cells retained almost the same GS-MF excretion activity with wild type MRP2, and MRP2V-transfected cells also retained the comparable activity (70% of wild type MRP2), indicating that the mutation did not severely affect the MRP2 function (Fig. 7). Next, we studied transport activity of MRP2 mutant proteins. Fig. 8 shows the excretion of GS-MF from COS-7 cells transfected with MRP2 mutants of TM6–TM11. In K324A and K483A mutants, the excretion of GS-MF decreased about 40% compared with MRP2V. As to K578A mutant, GS-MF excretion decreased to the level of control (Fig. 8); however, expression level of this mutant also decreased (Figs. 5 and 6). Fig. 9 also presents the excretion of GS-MF from COS-7 cells transfected with MRP2 mutants of TM12–TM17. In R1210A and R1257A mutants, the excretion of GS-MF decreased approximately to the level of control, but expression level was comparable with MRP2X (Figs. 5 and 6). As shown in Fig. 10, we observed with confocal fluorescence microscopy that these mutant MRP2s including K578A were expressed at the cell surface. Therefore, the defect in the transport function of these mutants was clearly due to the functional defect except for K578A. The decrease in transport activity of K578A was mainly due to the decrease in the expression level.Figure 8Excretion of GS-MF from COS-7/MRP2 and COS-7/MRP2 mutants of TM6-TM11. The empty vector-transfected cells (○) and MRP2V (▵) or MRP2 (▪) mutant-transfected ones were incubated at 4 °C with 5 μm CMFDA for 60 min.

COS-7 cells transfected either with expression vector for wild type MRP2 or K324A, K483A, K578A, R1210A, and R1257A mutants were immunostained using anti-MRP2 C terminus antiserum, and their localization was observed by confocal laser scanning microscope. A 1.2-μm-thick section was observed. The ring-like staining seemed MRP2 expression at plasma membrane and cytoplasmic periphery of the membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined whether basic residues of transmembrane regions are involved in CsA-directed inhibition of the substrate transporting activity of MRP2. Cells expressing active MRP2 mutants were incubated with 10 μm CsA, and extrusion of GS-MF was measured in the existence of 10 μm CsA. In R1230A mutant, the MRP2-mediated transport activity was not inhibited by CsA, whereas the other active mutants were suppressed on their transport activity up to 50% (Fig. 11). According to the fact that MRP2 is involved in excretion of amphiphilic anionic conjugates, it has been predicted that positively charged amino acid residues in transmembrane helices are involved in substrate binding of MRP2. MRP1 and its related transporters have 17 transmembrane helices; however, the N-terminal five helices (TM1–TM5) have been shown to be dispensable for substrate translocating activity on MRP1 (28Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Haas M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In conjunction with other drug-extruding transporters, the core unit essential for transport activity seems limited on the tandem repeated structure of six-transmembrane helices and a nucleotide-binding domain. Hence, we tested whether the basic residues around transmembrane regions of TM6–TM17 of MRP2 participate in binding of substrates by site-directed mutagenesis and transport activity assay. First, we established a method for assaying transport activity of MRP2 by using fluorescent substrates, GS-MF and GS-B, which are glutathione-conjugated metabolites derived from CMFDA and mBCl, respectively. In CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells transfected with a MRP2 expression vector, the excretion of GS-MF and GS-B into the medium was 3–4-fold higher than that of the cells transfected with vector alone (Figs. 2 and 3). Although Evers et al. (35Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in nonpolarized cells exogenous MRP2 was not efficiently expressed at cell surface, there was no difference observed between wild type and the mutant MRP2s in their cell surface expression. The results indicated that the method developed here is useful to measure the transport activity of MRP2 and its mutants in these living cells. For mutagenesis, we constructed human MRP2 expression vectors, pCI-neo/MRP2V and pCI-neo/MRP2X. pCI-neo/MRP2X-transfected COS-7 cells retained almost the same GS-MF excretion activity with the wild type, and pCI-neo/MRP2V-transfected COS-7 cells also retained the comparable activity, 70% of the wild type (Fig. 7). pCI-neo/MRP2V contains mutations of I448V and L653V, which were located in TM8 and NBD1, respectively. In patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, loss of function mutations was occasionally found in NBD1 (12Toh S. Wada M. Uchiumi T. Inokuchi A. Makino Y. Horie Y. Adachi Y. Sakisaka S. Kuwano M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 739-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Likewise, the mutation of NBD1 in pCI-neo/MRP2V might cause slightly decreased activity of MRP2V-mediated transport. To gain insight into the substrate-binding site of MRP2, we constructed 13 mutants, each of which was replacing basic amino acid residue by alanine. Except for a mutant K578A, the protein expression level of these mutants in COS-7 cell was comparable with that of wild type (Figs. 5 and 6). Among these mutants, K578A, R1210A, and R1257A were the most influenced by mutation concerning substrate translocating activity (Figs. 8 and 9). The pattern of cytochemical staining of these mutants was not changed with wild type MRP2 (Fig. 10). These results suggested that Arg1210 and Arg1257 are important residues for substrate transport activity of MRP2. As to K578A, the excretion of GS-MF and protein expression was coincidentally lowered (Figs. 5, 6, and 8). Therefore, it was thought that Lys578 has a role in protein expression rather than substrate translocation. In K324A and K483A mutants, GS-MF excretion also moderately decreased (Fig. 8). Protein expression level (Figs. 5and 6) and membrane localization (Fig. 10) were normal in these mutants, so that it is indicated that Lys324 and Lys483 are also involved in substrate transport function of MRP2. Lys324, Lys483, Arg1210, and Arg1257 are located in TM6, TM9, TM16, and TM17, respectively. In the case of P-gp, TM1, TM6, TM11, and TM12 are important in recognition and binding of substrate (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8883-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TM6, TM16, and TM17 of MRP2 correspond to TM1, TM11, and TM12 of P-gp. Together with these findings, it is suggested that Lys324, Lys483, Arg1210, and Arg1257 of MRP2 are constituent of substrate binding site. Although there is a difference in the chemistry of residues involved in substrate transport, it is intriguing to speculate that the functional transmembrane helices of MRP2 and P-gp for substrate binding are almost common. Next, we examined whether basic residues of TMs are also involved in CsA inhibition. CsA is known to inhibit MRP2 transport activity through binding to but not to be transported by MRP2 (38Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The previous study has shown that 10 μm CsA causes drug accumulation in MRP2 expressing LLC-PK1 cells as much as the level of control LLC-PK1 (29Chen Z.S. Kawabe T. Ono M. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Uchiumi T. Wada M. Kuwano M. Akiyama S.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hence, we tried to see the effect of 10 μm CsA on mutant MRP2 expressors. In most active mutants excretion of GS-MF was inhibited by CsA as well as wild type MRP2, whereas in R1230A mutant excretion of GS-MF was not influenced (Fig. 11). This result clearly indicated that Arg1230 is an essential residue for the inhibition of CsA, either through direct binding of CsA or coordinating to block substrate translocation with CsA bound on another site. Interestingly, in contrast to the fact that both Arg1210and Arg1257 are located at intracellular side of TM16 and TM17, respectively, Arg1230 is located at extracellular side of TM16. So far determined in P-gp, important residues are located at intracellular side (39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The unique location of Arg1230may indicate a novel functional relationship on CsA inhibition site and substrate translocation pathway of MRP2. In summary, the results of this study showed that the basic residues in TM6, TM9, TM16, and TM17 are involved in substrate binding and a residue in TM11 is involved in stable expression of MRP2. This is the first indication that transmembrane basic residues are truly important for substrate translocation on MRP2. Like P-gp, these functional residues of MRP2 are located in intracellular side of the corresponding transmembrane helices. In this study, we used glutathione conjugate as a substrate for MRP2. Further studies are required to determine the role of basic residues by using other substrates, glucronate, and sulfate conjugates. We thank Dr. Michihiko Kuwano, Dr. Morimasa Wada, Dr. Takeshi Uchiumi, and Dr. Mayumi Ono for providing the human MRP2 clone and for help with the cloned cell cultivation."

Seismic records from aftershocks suggest that the damage resulted from the focusing of seismic waves by several underground acoustic lenses at depths of about 3 kilometers, formed by the faults that bound the northwestern edge of the Los Angeles basin. The amplification was greatest for high-frequency waves and was less powerful at lower frequencies, which is consistent with focusing theory and finite-difference simulations."

Because differentiation increases ferritin formation in several cell types, thereby leading to an accumulation of H-rich isoferritins, we investigated whether differentiation affects iron metabolism in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. To this aim, we evaluated the expression of the genes coding for the H and L ferritin subunits and for cytoplasmic iron regulatory protein (IRP) during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in adipocytes induced by the addition of isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone. Differentiation enhanced ferritin formation and caused overexpression of the H subunit, thus altering the H/L subunit ratio. Northern blot analysis showed increased levels of H subunit mRNA. A gel retardation assay of cytoplasmic extract from differentiated cells, using an iron-responsive element as a probe, revealed enhanced an RNA binding capacity of IRP1, which correlated with the increase of IRP1 mRNA. The observed correlation between differentiation and iron metabolism in adipocytes suggests that an accumulation of H-rich isoferritin may limit the toxicity of iron in adipose tissue, thus exerting an antioxidant function.

Ferritin has an approximate mass of 450 kDa and is composed of 24 subunits of two types, namely H and L, in any ratio (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Changes in iron availability regulate ferritin expression primarily at translational level through specifically regulated protein-RNA interactions between iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)1 and iron-responsive elements (IREs) contained within the 5′-untranslated region of the H- and L-ferritin mRNA (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). When intracellular concentrations of iron are low, IRP binding to IRE cis-elements represses ferritin translation; and conversely, when intracellular concentrations of iron are high, IRP is unable to bind IRE, and ferritin mRNA is efficiently translated (3Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Two distinct IRPs have been identified: IRP1 and IRP2 (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Kuhn L.C. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Eisenstein R.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 627-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Theil E.C. Biochem.

IRP1 has been identified as the cytosolic counterpart of aconitase, a key enzyme in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (8Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc.

We have recently shown that its RNA binding activity is inhibited by oxalomalate, a competitive inhibitor of aconitase (10Festa M. Colonna A. Pietropaolo C. Ruffo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 315-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IRP2 has a different pattern of tissue specificity (11Recalcati S. Conte D. Cairo G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and binds IRE-containing mRNA with an affinity similar to that of IRP1 (12Kim H.Y Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4983-4986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ferritin synthesis is stimulated during development, cellular differentiation, and inflammation, as well as by some hormones and cytokines (13Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). With the aim of evaluating the role of iron metabolism on the protection of the highly concentrated oxidable substrates in adipocytes, we investigated the expression of the genes encoding the H- and L-ferritin subunits and IRP1 during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes. We determined the levels of H- and L-subunits of ferritin, the levels of mRNA coding for the H- and L-subunits of ferritin, as well as the level of mRNA coding for IRP1. The RNA binding activity of IRP1 has been also evaluated. Our data show that the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in adipocytes is associated with a consistent increase of ferritin levels and of ferritin mRNA, suggesting a close correlation between iron metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. We treated confluent cultures with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin (all from Sigma) to promote the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After 2 days, the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dexamethasone were removed, and insulin was continued for another 2 days. The medium containing insulin only was replenished at 2-day intervals until adipocyte differentiation. Iron treatment consisted of incubating 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 20 h with 100 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate. Intracellular iron was chelated by treating 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 20 h with 100 μm desferrioxamine (Desferal, Ciba-Geigy). For cytoprotection experiments, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with 5 μm hemin or with 0.3 mg/ml apoferritin for 18 h. 3T3-L1 cells were washed and harvested in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. To obtain cytoplasmic extracts, cells were treated with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the supplier's manual. For Western blot analysis, lysate aliquots containing 50 or 100 μg of proteins were denatured, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad Transblot. Proteins were visualized on the filters by reversible staining with Ponceau-S solution (Sigma) and destained in PBS. Filters were blocked in milk buffer (1× PBS, 10% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 2 h with anti-human ferritin antibodies (Sigma). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting complex was visualized using chemiluminescent Western blotting detection reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform single-step extraction method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.J. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Northern blots, 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on a 1.5% agarose denaturing formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred by blotting in 3 m NaCl, 0.3 msodium acetate to Hybond-N+ filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA was hybridized using 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 7% (w/v) SDS for 16 h at 65 °C. Filters were washed twice at room temperature in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) SDS (15 min each) followed by a wash at 65 °C for 20 min, and the filters were autoradiographed at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. cDNA fragments (H-ferritin 36.8 clone, L-ferritin L-600 clone, adipsin, IRP1, and C/EBP) were radiolabeled using the random priming method. On the basis of the mouse aconitase/IRP1 sequence (16Philpott C.C. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession numberX61147), two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: (a) 5′-CAATGAGGATCCTATCTGCTACTGAATTTAGG-3′ and (b) 5′-CAATGAGCATGCGATGCCTCCATTTGGGAAGTA-3′. These primers were used to amplify a 642-base pair segment of cDNA encoding IRP1 from a cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase, using total RNA from 3T3-L1 cells as a template. The specific IRP sequence primers were flanked by BamHI (underlined in primera) and SphI (underlined in primer b) sites so that the amplified sequence could be cloned in a pGEM-4Z vector. Plasmid pSPT-fer containing the sequence corresponding to the IRE of the H-chain of human ferritin was kindly provided by Prof. G. Cairo (University of Milan). This plasmid was linearized at the BamHI site and transcribedin vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The transcription reaction was performed at 38.5 °C for 1 h with 200 ng of plasmid DNA, 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.5 mmATP, GTP, and UTP (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction volume. The DNA template was digested with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C. Free nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-50 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Band shift analysis was used to measure the interaction between IRPs and IREs using established techniques (17Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of protein extracts were mixed with 0.2 ng of in vitro transcribed32P-labeled IRE RNA with or without unlabeled competitor RNA. The reaction was performed in lysis buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mmKCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.07% Nonidet P-40) in a final volume of 20 μl for 30 min at room temperature. To recover the in vitro total IRP1 activity, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) was added to the binding reaction before the addition of 32P-labeled IRE RNA. To degrade unbound probe, the reaction mixture was incubated with 1 unit of RNase T1(Calbiochem) for 10 min, and the nonspecific RNA-protein interaction was displaced by the addition of 5 mg/ml heparin for 10 min. After the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer containing 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.2% bromphenol blue, the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed for 2 h at 200 V in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, pre-electrophoresed for 20 min at the same voltage. The dried gel was autoradiographed at −80 °C. The IRP·IRE complexes were quantified with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Lipid peroxidation products from mature adipocytes were measured by the thiobarbituric acid colorimetric assay (18Mihara M. Uchiyama M Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar). Briefly, after hemin or apoferritin treatment, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS, incubated with 20 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate for 2 h at room temperature, then washed once more and scraped in 1× PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1.13 mm butylated hydroxytoluene. Cell lysis was performed by means of six cycles of freezing and thawing. To 450 μl of cellular lysate was added 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, 1.3 ml 0.5% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid were added, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 20 min. After cooling, malondialdehyde formation was recorded (A 530 nm and A 550 nm) in a PerkinElmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter. The results are presented as picomoles of malondialdehyde/mg of cell protein, determined by the Lowry method. The ferritin content was determined using a fluorimetric enzyme immunoassay system according to the supplier's manual (Enzymum test, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The results are expressed as ng of ferritin/mg of cell protein. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes are among the most fully characterized models ofin vitro cell differentiation. Exposure to 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone induces 3T3-L1 cells to differentiate into mature adipocytes (14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This process is accompanied by the expression of C/EBP, a family of transacting factors involved in the coordinated expression of adipocyte genes during differentiation (19MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In our study, 3T3-L1 cells, following treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone, acquired the rounded morphology characteristic of adipose cells and accumulated lipids, as observed by phase-contrast microscopy and by lipid staining of cultures (data not shown). We then isolated total RNA from adipocytes and analyzed it by Northern blot using C/EBP and adipsin cDNA probes, the latter protein being an adipocyte differentiation-dependent serine protease (20Min H.Y. Spiegelman B.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8879-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The β-actin probe was used to standardize the amounts of mRNA in each lane. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of C/EBP and adipsin mRNA was clearly enhanced during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 in adipocytes. We analyzed the ferritin content and the ferritin mRNA level in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes induced to differentiate by the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone mixture (14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The levels of ferritin as determined by Western blot analysis of lysates derived from undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells are shown in Fig.2 A. Although the revelation method used (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) is semiquantitative, the results clearly show that the H- and L-chain ferritin levels were higher in mature adipocytes, and the increase of H-chain ferritin was particularly relevant in differentiated cells. Similar results were obtained with 50 or 100 μg of cell lysates. To determine whether the increase in H-chain ferritin synthesis during 3T3-L1 differentiation resulted from transcriptional control, we analyzed the steady-state levels of specific mRNA, and the results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2 B. Total RNA extracted from differentiated and undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells was used for Northern blot analysis using human ferritin H-chain (36.8 clone) and L-chain (L600 clone) cDNA probes. In differentiated cells, an increase in mRNA levels of ferritin H- and L-chain was observed. Interestingly, there was a major increase in the L-chain ferritin transcript (3-fold) over the H-chain transcript (1.7-fold). However, in both cases, the increase of the protein in mature adipocytes was correlated with an increase in the corresponding mRNA. Because IRPs are involved in the translational regulation of ferritin genes in various cell types, we measured IRP1 mRNA levels in mature adipocytes and its binding capacity to the specific mRNA. Fig.3 A shows the results of a Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from adipocyte precursors and differentiated adipocytes using a mouse IRP1 cDNA fragment as a probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). IRP1 mRNA was present in both samples, but its levels were clearly increased in differentiated adipocytes. We also evaluated the IRP·IRE binding activity using an RNA band shift assay. A 32P-labeled ferritin IRE RNA transcript, containing the 5′-untranslated region of the human apoferritin H-chain (bases 31–58), was incubated with cytoplasmic extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated adipocytes; the results are shown in Fig. 3 B. Only an RNA-protein band corresponding to the IRP1·IRE complex was observed. The binding activity of IRP1 was higher in differentiated adipocytes, thus correlating with the increased levels of the mRNA (see Fig. 3 A). Moreover, a longer autoradiographic exposure of a gel (not shown) revealed a faster migrating band, which corresponded to the IRP2·IRE complex. The IRP2·IRE complex was more abundant in differentiated adipocytes, although it was about 10% of the IRP1·IRE in the same lane. To verify that the faster migrating band was indeed IRP2, we treated adipocytes with iron and desferrioxamine, a potent iron chelator. The IRP2·IRE band disappeared in iron-replete cells (Fig.3 C, lane 4) and was present in desferrioxamine-treated cells (lane 3), which is in accordance with iron regulation of IRP2 (21Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. La Vaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To evaluate the correlation between IRP1 mRNA level and IRP1 RNA binding activity, we assayed cytoplasmic extracts in the presence of 2-ME. The addition of high concentrations of this reducing agent to cell extracts converts c-aconitase, when present, into the fully activated IRP1 form, thereby revealing the total amounts of IRP1 (22Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The results of RNA band shift analysis performed with and without 2% 2-ME are shown in Fig. 3 D. The addition of the reducing agent enhanced the RNA binding capacity of either undifferentiated or differentiated 3T3-L1 lysates. Imaging densitometry (Fig. 3 D, lower panel) revealed that the total level of IRP1 in the differentiated adipocytes was also increased, thus correlating with the increased level of its mRNA. To establish whether the increased ferritin expression observed following adipocyte differentiation was related to endogenous iron sequestration, as part of an antioxidant strategy we evaluated lipid peroxidation, assessed by quantification of thiobarbiturate-reactive material in mature adipocytes exposed to iron challenge. Mature adipocytes were pre-incubated with apoferritin (0.3 mg/ml), which is easily pinocytosed by the cell, or with hemin (5 μm), a known inducer of ferritin synthesis (23Eisenstein R.S. Garcia-Mayol D. Pettingell W. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and were then treated with ferric ammonium citrate (20 μg/ml). Treatment with iron for 2 h caused a remarkable degree of lipid peroxidation (Fig.4), whereas preincubation of the cells with exogenous apoferritin and with hemin reduced the iron-induced lipid peroxidation to 15 and 20%, respectively. Consequently, the increased synthesis of the iron-scavenging ferritin in adipocytes is indeed related to antioxidant cellular defense, since ferritin interrupts the reaction sequence leading to lipid peroxidation and cell damage by removing the iron ions from the site of oxygen radical formation. The role of iron metabolism in adipocytes which contain a high concentration of oxidation-sensitive substrates, is obscure. In the present study, we have evaluated the modifications in the expression of the genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of iron metabolism. We demonstrate that differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes increases H- and L-ferritin subunit mRNA levels and the expression of the protein; however, accumulation of the H subunit seems to occur preferentially. These findings are in agreement with reports showing that H-ferritin mRNA is increased in various differentiation processes (24Chou C.C. Gatti R.A. Fuller M.L. Concannon P. Wong A. Chada S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as a consequence of a selective transcriptional regulation of the H subunit gene needed to produce ferritin with a structure appropriate to a differentiated cell type. In fact, it has been proposed that the accumulation of H-rich isoferritin during the maturation of erithropoietic cells affects the intracellular distribution and availability of iron for heme synthesis (25Coccia E.M. Stellacci E. Orsatti R. Testa U. Battistini A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beaumont C. Dugast I. Renaudie F. Souroujon M. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7498-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the differential transcriptional regulation of H-ferritin in absence of a change in L-ferritin, as observed in pre-adipocytes and premyoblasts in response to tumor necrosis factor (27Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), results in a change in the total amount of ferritin, mainly in its subunit composition. Also, differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes leads to an up-regulation of the H-ferritin expression similar to that observed in tumor necrosis factor-stimulated cells. It is possible to predict that in these cells the H-ferritin may contribute to a rapid chelation of iron, thus protecting cells from iron-induced oxidative injury. It has been demonstrated that cultured endothelial cells briefly pulsed with heme became highly resistant to oxidant-mediated injury and to the accumulation of endothelial lipid peroxidation products (28Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our experiments with exogenously added apoferritin or with hemin-induced ferritin (see Fig.4) demonstrate that ferritin remarkably decreased iron-induced lipid peroxidation. It is feasible that the overexpressed ferritin plays a role as an iron cytoprotective agent by limiting the reactivity of intracellular iron on lipids in adipocytes themselves, where lipids are biosynthesised. Thus, H-ferritin overexpression may represent an adaptive adipocyte response to iron-induced oxidative stress. We also observed an increased expression of the IRP1gene in mature adipocytes, which correlates with the increase of the RNA binding activity of IRP1 to IRE in ferritin mRNA. We also show that IRP2 occurs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, albeit at much lower levels than IRP1. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that adipose cells contain IRPs. We found that the IRP2·IRE complex was more relevant in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Because iron enhances IRP2 degradation (21Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. La Vaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the increased expression of IRP2 could be consequent to the intracellular iron sequestration by H-ferritin, as well being overexpressed in differentiated adipocytes. The results obtained in cells treated with dexferrioxamine support this hypothesis (Fig.3 C). The RNA binding activity assays in the presence of 2-ME (see Fig.3 D) confirmed that differentiation results in an increase IRP1 protein expression. In addition, the RNA binding activity in the presence of the reducing agent may include a fraction of IRP1 resulting from the conversion of a pre-existing c-aconitase form in differentiated adipocytes. It is generally agreed that increased IRP1 binding activity prevents ferritin biosynthesis. We have shown that there is a concomitant increase of ferritin and IRP1 RNA binding activity in differentiated adipocytes. These apparently contradictory data can be explained in the light of the following considerations: (i) increased transcription of the IRP1 gene induced by differentiation leads to major expression of the protein; (ii) 3T3-L1 cells, which undergo adipose conversion in vitro, possess an NADPH-dependent H2O2-generating system in their plasma membranes (29Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Activation of IRP1 binding capacity by H2O2 is a well documented phenomenon (30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); (iii) overexpression of H-ferritin subunits leads to rapid chelation of the intracellular iron pool, thereby preventing the formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and thus contributing to the maintenance of IRP1 RNA binding activity.

Previous studies have shown that neuritogenesis and a block at the G1/S checkpoint correlate with the nuclear translocation of and an increase in the p53 tumor suppressor protein. This study was designed to determine if p53 plays a direct role in mediating NGF-driven G1 arrest. A retroviral vector that overexpresses a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant protein (p53ts) was used to extinguish the function of endogenous p53 in PC12 cells in a dominant-negative manner at the nonpermissive temperature. NGF treatment led to transactivation of a p53 response element in a luciferase reporter construct in PC12 cells, whereas this response to NGF was absent in PC12(p53ts) cells at the nonpermissive temperature. With p53 functionally inactivated, NGF failed to activate growth arrest, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and also failed to induce p21/WAF1 expression, as measured by Western blotting. Since neurite outgrowth proceeded unharmed, 50% of the cells simultaneously demonstrated neurite morphology and were in S phase. Both PC12 cells expressing SV40 T antigen and PC12 cells treated with p53 antisense oligonucleotides continued through the cell cycle, confirming the dependence of the NGF growth arrest signal on a p53 pathway. Activation of Ras in a dexamethasone-inducible PC12 cell line (GSRas1) also caused p53 nuclear translocation and growth arrest. Therefore, wild-type p53 is indispensable in mediating the NGF antiproliferative signal through the Ras/MAPK pathway that regulates the cell cycle of PC12 cells.

These paracrine hormones activate the development, maintenance, and regeneration of neurons in the nervous system (1Levi-Montalcini R. Science. 1987; 237: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). NGF signals the development of sympathetic, sensory, and a population of central nervous system neurons through its high affinity receptor, TrkA. The induction of neuronal differentiation invokes two interrelated cellular processes: progression through the stages of neurite outgrowth and cell cycle arrest (2Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, derived from a transplantable chromaffin tumor, provides a model system for the NGF-mediated conversion to a neuronal phenotype (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar). PC12 cells contain both the tyrosine kinase (TrkA) and low affinity (p75NTR) NGF receptors (4Klein R. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 5Hosang M. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Differentiation requires the TrkA receptor and proceeds through the Ras/MAPK pathway (6D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). NGF decreases the growth rate of PC12 cells (8Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and, in the short term, causes synchronized PC12 cells to accumulate in the G1phase of the cell cycle with a decrease in DNA synthesis (9Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Continued exposure to NGF arrests the population in G1 with an increased number in the G2/M phase also (10Ignatius M.J. Chandler C.R. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long-term treatment of PC12 cells with NGF promotes terminal differentiation, in which the PC12 cells resemble sympathetic neurons with a cessation of division, increased substratum adherence, neurite extension, and catecholamine synthesis (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a DNA-binding phosphoprotein that helps regulate the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 11Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type p53 causes either G1 cycle arrest (12Lin D. Shields M.T. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9210-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) or apoptosis (2Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of p53 is a common event in the development of malignancy and occurs in >50% of all human tumors (13Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7400) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that have the p53 gene disrupted develop normally (14Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar), indicating the dispensability of these genes in normal survival and development. Furthermore, sympathetic and sensory neurons from p53 null mice can survive in the presence of neurotrophins (15Davies A.M. Rosenthal A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 182: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More significantly, however, the neuronal precursors in p53 knockout mice show an enhanced proliferative potential (16Tsukada T. Tomooka Y. Takai S. Ueda Y. Nishikawa S. Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Takeda N. Suda Y. Abe S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3313-3322PubMed Google Scholar), supporting a specific role for p53 in mediating an antiproliferative signal to neurons. These experiments implicate the role of p53 and other cell cycle regulators in NGF-mediated growth arrest of neurons and neuronal progenitors. The NGF-mediated cell cycle arrest of PC12 cells is concomitant with the nuclear translocation of p53 in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neuronal cultures (17Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The importance of this subcellular movement of p53 was also shown by the stable expression of a p53 dominant-negative miniprotein, in which the cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53 correlated with an inhibition of both PC12 cell and oligodendrocyte differentiation (17Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Progression through the cell cycle has been shown to be governed by the family of cyclin-dependent kinases, their regulatory subunits (the cyclins), and a family of protein inhibitors (19Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1 (20el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar) is a direct transcriptional target gene of p53 and plays an important role in p53-dependent growth arrest (21Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 22el-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of p53 in mediating the NGF antimitogenic signal that regulates the cell cycle of PC12 cells. Experiments with PC12 cell lines overexpressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant protein (A135V; p53ts) showed that the functional inactivation of p53 undermines NGF-activated cell cycle arrest, whereas neurite outgrowth continues uninhibited. Our results suggest that the closely coupled processes of cell cycle arrest and neuritogenesis share overlapping regulators; however, the wild-type p53 protein is a key coordinator of the NGF-stimulated G1/S phase cell cycle checkpoint in PC12 cells. PC12 cells and the mutant cell line PC12nnr5 (from Dr. Lloyd Greene) were grown and maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar, 23Woodruff N.R. Neet K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing populations of PC12 cells were split and grown on collagen (Vitrogen), poly-l-lysine (Sigma), or poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) plates or coverslips at least 18 h before treatment with NGF (50 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 50 ng/ml), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 50 ng/ml) in complete medium. Mouse NGF (β-subunit) was prepared and purified from mouse submaxillary gland as described previously (24Luo Y. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12275-12283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF and bFGF were purchased from Sigma. In the immunocytochemical studies, PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine or poly-l-ornithine coverslips and treated with NGF for 6 days, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and rapidly fixed in a −20 °C mixture of methanol/acetone or 100% methanol. Naive PC12 cells were analyzed with the agarose overlay method (25Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T.K. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which allows for enhanced visualization of cellular components in round-shaped, blast-like cells. PC12 cells without the agarose overlay produced the same results, but yielded inferior images. For the agarose overlay method, the coverslip with undifferentiated PC12 cells was overlaid with a thin sheet of agarose, fixed in methanol/acetone, permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C. Differentiated PC12 cells were fixed by the same procedure, but without agarose overlay, due to neurite shearing effects. For immunofluorescent visualization, primary antibody staining was followed by staining with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to rhodamine or fluorescein (Chemicon International, Inc.). Colorimetric visualization was performed with a murine avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex kit (Oncogene Science Inc.) and diaminobenzidine (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' specifications. Cells were then studied and photographed with a Nikon camera using a Zeiss microscope or a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope. For all Western blots, cells were harvested, washed, and stored frozen until all time points were collected. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting by homogenizing cells with a Dounce homogenizer or sonicator in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (26Sladek T.L. Cell Proliferation. 1996; 29: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For whole cell lysates, protein concentration was quantitated with the BCA reagent (Pierce) or Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of total protein (60–80 μg) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel lanes. For the nuclear localization studies, lysates were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (27Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8253-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); nuclear pellets were washed at least twice to remove all traces of the cytoplasmic fraction; nuclei were solubilized in sample buffer; and an equal number of nuclei were loaded per lane for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll) or Immobilon (Bio-Rad), and membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h to overnight. Primary antibody incubation was performed in 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS with the mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421 (Oncogene Science Inc. or Dr. Arnold Levine) or the rabbit anti-p21/WAF1 antibody cg-397 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 was performed between all subsequent steps. Primary antibody staining was followed by staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) in PBS. All Western blots were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Fuji XR film. All experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Lanes were scanned in an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech laser densitometer and/or a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 to estimate relative levels (18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dr. Moshe Oren provided a temperature-sensitive murine p53 mutant cDNA encoding a valine at amino acid 135 (p53ts) (28Ginsberg D. Michael-Michalovitz D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A 5′-EcoRI to 3′-SmaI fragment from the plasmid pp53-3-1 was used to replace the Tag gene in the retroviral vector linker cytomegalovirus (CMV) Tag (29Sladek T.L. Jacobberger J.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting virus (linker CMV p53ts) contained a neomycin phosphotransferase gene encoding resistance to the drug G418. Transcription of neomycin phosphotransferase was driven by the 5′-long terminal repeat of the virus. Transcription of the insert was driven by a human CMV immediate-early promoter (30Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Dorsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) internal to the viral long terminal repeats. The empty retroviral vector control (vector) is structurally identical to linker CMV p53ts and linker CMV Tag, except that it lacks the p53 gene insertion downstream of the CMV promoter. Stable PA317 (31Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) virus producer lines were produced as described previously (29Sladek T.L. Jacobberger J.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Budded viral particles from stable viral producer cell lines were harvested from the culture medium and used to infect PC12 cells plated at 60% confluency on collagen-coated plates for 2 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and allowed to recover for 2 days before 10 days of G418 (400 μg/ml; Sigma) selection. A control stable population (PC12(vector)) containing the retroviral vector lacking any insert was created and compared with parental PC12 cells in selected experiments. Infected PC12(p53ts), PC12(Tag), and PC12(vector) cell populations were maintained in regular medium in the absence of selection at the nonpermissive temperature (38.5 °C). Overexpression of p53ts or Tag was confirmed in the PC12(p53ts) and PC12(Tag) cells, respectively, by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation or flow cytometry. PC12(vector) cells expressing the vector control construct were tested for G418 resistance by long-term incubation (4 or more weeks), whereas parallel cultures of uninfected PC12 cells expired completely after 10–14 days. The majority of experiments with the PC12(p53ts) cells were conducted at the nonpermissive temperature (38.5 °C) throughout this study to extinguish endogenous wild-type p53 function. Some control experiments with the PC12(p53ts) cells were performed at the permissive temperature (32.5 °C) to evaluate the properties of the wild-type form of p53ts. XTT is a yellow tetrazolium salt that is cleaved by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in metabolically active (viable) cells to form an orange formazan dye (Roche Molecular Biochemicals cell proliferation kit). The formazan dye was measured at an optimal visible spectrophotometric range of 450–500 nm with an Ortho Diagnostics Systems AutoReader II. All assays were performed in 96-well tissue culture plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-ornithine. Aliquots of 103 to 104 cells were plated, allowed to adhere overnight, and incubated in serum-containing medium with varying concentrations of NGF. PC12 cells were kept at the nonpermissive temperature of 38.5 °C; 50 μl of XTT were added to give a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml; and the absorbance was measured multiple times over a 4–20-h period. All experiments were repeated a minimum of two times, with assays performed in triplicate. The effects on endogenous wild-type p53 activity were monitored with a p53 response element/luciferase reporter construct that was cotransfected with a β-galactosidase reporter for normalization of transfection efficiency (26Sladek T.L. Cell Proliferation. 1996; 29: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The p53 reporter plasmid contained a basal hsp70 promoter element upstream of the luciferase gene. The DNA consensus binding elements for p53 are located upstream of the hsp70 element (32Martinou I. Fernandez P.A. Missotten M. White E. Allet B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One p53 consensus sequence has the sequence 5′-GGA CAT GCC CGG GCA TGT C-3′ and is linked with and oriented 3′ to the optimal p53 transactivation sequence that consists of four consensus half-sites with the sequence 5′-ACG TTTGCCT TG CCT GGA CTTGCCTGG CCT TGC CTT-3′. The half-sites are denoted by alternating underlined and boldface letters. This alignment potentially facilitates binding of tetrameric p53 (32Martinou I. Fernandez P.A. Missotten M. White E. Allet B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which is reportedly the optimal transactivation conformation in vivo (33Wang P. Reed M. Wang Y. Mayr G. Stenger J.E. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5182-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The tandem linkage of these sequences increased the sensitivity of the reporter construct in an additive manner 30-fold relative to the base-line control (32Martinou I. Fernandez P.A. Missotten M. White E. Allet B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This p53 response element configuration resembles the in vivo situation, where p53 functions transcriptionally as a tetramer. PC12 cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated tissue culture plates at 60% confluency the day before transfection. Plasmids were packaged in LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE plus liposome vehicles and transfected according to the protocol of Life Technologies, Inc. for PC12 cells. Cells were then placed in medium containing serum with or without NGF. Cells were harvested 2–3 days later and lysed in RLB buffer (Promega). Total cell lysates were assayed colorimetrically with a β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega) and for luminescence with a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase data were normalized relative to overall transfection efficiency as determined by β-galactosidase expression, and data are presented as normalized luciferase units. All transfection experiments were performed three times, with the assays in duplicate for each experiment. Morphological and cellular changes of PC12, PC12(vector), and PC12(p53ts) cells in response to NGF were examined in conjunction with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation (10 μm, 1–2 h). BrdUrd labeling was analyzed by both immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry to concurrently measure cell cycle phase lengths and distributions. For immunocytochemical studies, cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated coverslips, washed several times with PBS, fixed in a HCl/ethanol mixture, and stained with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Cell immunostaining was visualized colorimetrically with diaminobenzidine following the protocol of the manufacturer, and then the cells were counterstained with 5 mg/ml of eosin Y (Sigma). Cells were observed and photographed using a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope with a Nikon camera. For flow cytometric studies, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol, extracted with 3 n HCl to remove histones, and stained with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton-Dickinson). Counterstaining with propidium iodide (Sigma) and single cell analysis were performed as described (29Sladek T.L. Jacobberger J.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed using a Coulter Epics Elite ESP cytometer. A region was defined by a line drawn around the BrdUrd-positive cells and the percentages of S phase cells were quantitated using Coulter Epics Elite Multigraph software. A 20-base antisense oligonucleotide that corresponds to 10 bases of the 5′-region and 10 bases of the coding region of rat p53 (5′-TGT GAA TCC TCC ATG ACA GT-3′) was made (cf. Ref. 34Tsuji K. Ogawa K. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotide was used as a negative control. The antisense and sense oligonucleotides (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) were synthesized with a thiol group at the 3′-end and with fluorescein conjugated at the 5′-end to enable visualization of the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides by fluorescence microscopy (35Troy C.M. Derossi D. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl groups of both oligonucleotides were coupled to penetratin I (Oncor, Inc.), a 16-residue antennapedia homeodomain peptide, to facilitate uptake and nuclear localization by PC12 cells (35Troy C.M. Derossi D. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Le Roux I. Joliot A.H. Bloch-Gallego E. Prochiantz A. Volovitch M. Proc. Natl.

Antisense oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides with a dithiothreitol-decoupled negative control, or sense oligonucleotides were added at 200 nm to PC12 cells in exponential growth for 2 h. The coupled peptide was translocated across the plasma membrane and localized to the nucleus in this time period, as viewed by fluorescence microscopy. NGF (50 ng/ml) was then added to one plate of each antisense or sense oligonucleotide-containing culture along with other appropriate controls. Since nuclear translocation of p53 has been reported to be an important part of its activation process (17Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we examined this process further. The p53 protein can exist in two different states (mutant/proliferative or wild-type/antiproliferative) that may differ in conformation or degree of phosphorylation (11Levine A.J.

Virol. 1986; 59: 444-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that distinguish between these two conformational states of p53 under nondenaturing conditions were used to monitor subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry. The proliferative p53 form (recognized by PAb240) was localized to the cytoplasm alone (Fig. 1 A), whereas the antiproliferative p53 state (recognized by PAb246) was present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). Thus, we have demonstrated the presence of both conformational forms of p53 in normal PC12 cells with distinct subcellular localizations. Cells stained with the general PAb421 antibody, which binds both wild-type and mutant p53 proteins (42Milne D.M. McKendrick L. Jardine L.J. Deacon E. Lord J.M. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar), showed a more intense immunoreactivity, positive in both compartments (Fig. 1 C), similar to data obtained by others (17Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were treated for 6 days and immunostained for p53 forms. The proliferative anti-p53 antibody (PAb240) stained the cytoplasm only and not the nucleus (Fig. 1 D), as in the naive PC12 cells. Both antiproliferative p53-specific PAb246 (Fig.1 E) and common binding PAb421 (Fig. 1 F) antibodies again stained nuclear and cytoplasmic regions. All three monoclonal antibodies revealed qualitative increases in immunoreactive intensity upon differentiation. Negative immunostaining controls such as an unrelated primary antibody or secondary antibody conjugates in the absence of primary antibody produced no staining (data not shown). Hence, these data suggest that the proliferative mutant conformation of the p53 protein stays sequestered within the cytoplasm upon NGF induction, whereas the wild-type species enters the nucleus and mediates G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with previous Western blotting studies that demonstrated a quantitative increase in total and nuclear p53 proteins in PC12 cells after NGF activation (18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since cytoplasmic p53 levels are 5-fold higher than nuclear levels (18Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the nuclear increase yielded only a small total cytoplasmic decrease that would easily escape detection by immunocytochemical techniques. To test the specificity of NGF signaling through p53, other growth factors were examined for their effects on p53 protein levels. bFGF activates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, similar to NGF (43Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with bFGF for 1, 3, or 6 days caused a growth arrest, as seen with BrdUrd staining (data not shown), and an increase in p53 protein in the nucleus, similar to that caused by NGF (Fig.2 A). EGF affects many of the same signaling pathways in PC12 cells, but stimulates mitogenesis, not neuritogenesis (44Chao M.V.

The active, mature form of HlyA is produced by posttranslational modification of the protoxin that is mediated by acyl carrier protein and an acyltransferase, HlyC. We have now shown using mass spectrometry that these modifications, when observed in protein isolated in vivo, consist of acylation at the ε-amino groups of two internal lysine residues, at positions 564 and 690, with saturated 14- (68%), 15- (26%), and 17- (6%) carbon amide-linked side chains. Thus, HlyA activated in vivo consists of a heterogeneous family of up to nine different covalent structures, and the substrate specificity of the HlyC acyltransferase appears to differ from that of the closely related CyaC acyltransferase expressed by Bordetella pertussis. α-Hemolysin (HlyA) is a secreted protein virulence factor observed in certain uropathogenic strains ofEscherichia coli.

Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other RTX toxins that have been characterized include adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT, the CyaA protein from Bordetella pertussis) and leukotoxin (LktA) from Pasteurella hemolytica. This class of proteins is defined by a common feature, a repeat region rich in aspartic acid and glycine. They are secreted by pathogens during infection and are known to attack host immune system cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes. At high concentrations they are lytic for their respective populations of target cells. At sublytic concentrations HlyA is known to disrupt host cell signal transduction and cytokine production (1Welch R.A. Bauer M.E. Kent A.D. Leeds J.A. Moayeri M. Regassa L.B. Swenson D.L. Infect.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In HlyA, for example, the activation process is dependent on the product of an accessory gene, hlyC, and is accomplished by acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) dependent fatty acylation (4Hardie K.R.

Analysis of the in vivo activated HlyA protein using two-dimensional gels has confirmed the sites of activation (7Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not the chemical structures of the modifications. The structural details of the fatty acylation of CyaA from B. pertussis have been studied. Active CyaA isolated from B. pertussis was observed to be palmitoylated at only one internal lysine residue, Lys-983, which corresponds to Lys-690 of HlyA (8Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) according to RTX toxin sequence alignments. Similarly, Lys-860 of CyaA corresponds to Lys-564 of HlyA. However, recombinant CyaA, isolated from E. coli containing cyaA and cyaCgenes, is acylated at two sites. Lys-983 is about 87% palmitoylated and the remainder myristoylated, and Lys-860 is approximately two-thirds palmitoylated (9Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J.

More recently, it has become clear that acylations observed in CyaA show a high degree of variability, especially at Lys-860. We have now observed Lys-860 acylation, by an as yet uncharacterized side chain, in recent preparations of ACT expressed by B. pertussis(BP338), 3Chen, W., and Hackett, M., manuscript in preparation. 3Chen, W., and Hackett, M., manuscript in preparation. the same strain we first analyzed in 1994 (8Hackett M.

However, CyaA appears to require fatty acylation only at Lys-983 for cell-invasive activity. 5Basar, T., Havlicek, V., Bezouskova, S., Hackett, M., and Sebo, P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press. 5Basar, T., Havlicek, V., Bezouskova, S., Hackett, M., and Sebo, P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press. In contrast to the somewhat more complex set of observations for CyaA, all preparations of native, active HlyA reported to date have probably been fully acylated at both lysines (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in fatty acid composition are believed to result in functional changes, and the non-acylated protoxin is inactive in the case of both CyaA (9Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C.

Interestingly, acylation is not a requirement for secretion of either CyaA or HlyA but is required at both sites in HlyA for full activity as a cytolysin or hemolysin (11Pellett S. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RTX toxin maturation and activation studies up to 1998 (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been reviewed in the context of other types of lipid protein modifications.In order to determine the structural details of fatty acylation present in in vivo activated HlyA, we analyzed the proteolytic fragments of HlyA using the techniques of peptide mapping, off-line HPLC, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry coupled with microcapillary HPLC, capillary gas chromatography coupled with electron impact mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and peptide synthesis. Two different sources of HlyA, one chromosomal (J96) and the other extrachromosomal (pHly152), and several different preparations from one source (J96) were used in order to control for potential variability between laboratories and individual preparations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe had tried unsuccessfully to digest HlyA with trypsin, possibly due to incomplete denaturation of HlyA in 1 m urea. Lys-C, which can tolerate a higher urea concentration (4 m) was a better choice. This was consistent with the difficulties observed by Ludwig et al. (7Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when they attempted to digest their HlyA with trypsin or V8 protease.C14:0 Fatty AcylationHPLC fraction 39 from HlyAJ96 (Fig. 1 A) contained two peptides that can be related to the predicted Lys-C fragments, with C14:0 acylation at Lys-690 (VLQEVVKEQEVSVGKC14:0RTEK and EQEVSVGKC14:0RTEK), based on their molecular weights. Subdigestion of fraction 39 with trypsin and the MALDI-TOF MS results showed a peak at m/z 1243 which corresponded to the product, EQEVSVGKC14:0R. CAD experiments showed a fragmentation spectrum (Fig. 2 A) which yielded the expected y and b series ions. Virtually identical CAD fragmentation patterns were observed when a separate CAD experiment was performed using a C14:0 acylated synthetic peptide, thus confirming the C14:0 acylation at Lys-690 on HlyAJ96. This work was repeated, with the same results, for HlyApHly152. HPLC fraction 44 contained a Lys-C fragment with putative C14:0 acylation at Lys-564, FVTPLLTPGEEIRERRQSGKC14:0YEYITELLVK (m/z 3777). This peptide was subdigested; CAD spectra were acquired, and the C14:0 modification was confirmed by synthesizing the tryptic fragment and analyzing the fatty acyl group itself by GC/MS. Again, the work was repeated for HlyApHly152, with identical results. No modification at Lys-690 or Lys-564 was observed with the biologically inactive ProHlyAJ96 control.Figure 2CAD spectra of the Lys-690 acylated Lys-C fragments (see Fig. 1 A), after tryptic subdigestion. A, the C14:0-containing tryptic peptide from HPLC fraction 39 with a doubly charged parent ion atm/z 621. The spectrum of the synthetic peptide (data not shown) run under identical conditions was the same, within the expected experimental error for ion relative abundances. B, CAD spectrum of the parent ion at m/z 628, showing the C15:0 modification, after subdigestion of HPLC fraction 42 (see Fig.1 B). See text for a brief discussion of the data interpretation and the review by Biemann (23Biemann K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 977-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) for a discussion of the nomenclature of peptide fragmentation mass spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C15:0 and C17:0 Fatty AcylationOur initial goal was to identify the expected C14:0 acylation sites on HlyA, based on our interpretation of work by the Cambridge group (6Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and Ludwig et al. (7Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found Lys-C HlyAJ96 fragments that eluted later than fractions 39 and 44 and that yieldedm/z values not predicted by theoretical peptide maps, allowing for acylation by common fatty acids such as C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 or their unsaturated forms. Examples include peptides atm/z 1615 and 2411 in fraction 42 (Fig. 1 B) andm/z 1643 and 2439 in fraction 41 (Fig. 1 C), which are 14 and 42 mass units larger than the two C14:0-acylated Lys-690 peptides found in fraction 39 (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, in fraction 45, two Lys-C fragments 14 and 42 mass units larger than the C14:0 acylated Lys-564 peptide in fraction 44 were also observed. We observed similar results for HlyApHly152 but not for the inactive ProHlyAJ96 control. A number of potential modifications could give rise to these observations, based on molecular weight information alone, but subsequent analysis of these proteolytic fragments by CAD and electron impact GC/MS of the FAMEs clearly identified the fragments as C15:0 and C17:0 modifications of Lys-690 and Lys-564. Fig. 2 B shows the CAD spectra of the C15:0-modified Lys-690 peptide (HPLC fraction 42) acquired following a tryptic subdigestion. The fragmentation pattern was identical to its C14:0 counterpart (Fig. 1 A), except that starting at the y2 and b8 ions, an increase of 14 mass units was noted. Similar CAD results were observed for the Lys-C fragments of HlyApHly152. We also converted the putative C15:0-acylated peptides in HPLC fraction 42 to methyl esters. Fig.3 shows the expected mass increases from the original peptides (Fig. 1 B) due to the addition of methyl ester groups to the C terminus and the aspartic acid residues. Tryptic subdigestion of these methyl ester derivatives also yielded a peptide with the expected CAD spectrum, suggesting a C15:0 acylation at Lys-690. We repeated these procedures for the remaining HPLC fractions, 41 and 45, which contained the putative C17:0 acylation at Lys-690 and both C15:0 and C17:0 at Lys-564. The MALDI-TOF and electrospray CAD data can successfully pinpoint the locations of these fatty acylations, but studies of the modifying groups themselves were necessary to confirm the conclusions suggested by the peptide CAD data. FAME analysis by capillary GC/MS provided both retention time data and the EI fragmentation patterns that taken together were unequivocal for the assignments of C15:0 (Fig. 4 A) and C17:0 (Fig. 4 B) as modifying groups.Figure 3MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the HPLC fraction containing C15:0-acylated Lys-690, as shown in Fig.1 B, but after chemical conversion to methyl ester (*) derivatives. The conversion took place at the C terminus and the aspartic acid residues. The first peptide increased its mass-to-charge ratio from its original m/z 1615 (see Fig.1 B) to m/z 1671, which corresponded to an addition of four methyl ester units. Similarly, the increase in mass of the second peptide, from m/z 2411 to 2481, corresponded to the addition of five methyl ester groups. Similar results were observed for the C17:0-containing fragments and the acylated peptides at Lys-564 (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4GC/MS EI FAME mass spectra of the odd-carbon fatty acyl groups cleaved from HlyA. The identities of the C15:0 (A) and C17:0 (B) side chains were confirmed by comparing their fragmentation patterns and GC retention times to those of known standards. We were able to rule out methyl-branched or cyclopropane-containing fatty acids due to retention time differences and (or) known mass spectral fragmentation properties.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitative AnalysisBased on the capillary GC retention times for well characterized FAME standards, we identified the peaks corresponding to the C14:0, C15:0, and C17:0 modifications of HlyA. The amounts of each present, as calculated from the peak areas with background corrections, were 68% C14:0, 26% C15:0, and 6% C17:0, with a relative standard deviation of about 8%. This was in good agreement with our expectations based on the peptide electrospray data.Biological SignificanceOur results demonstrate that E. coli α-hemolysin from two sources with different genetic histories consists of a heterogeneous group of acylated proteins, as many as nine (two acylation sites and three possible modifying groups at each site). In contrast to the situation with CyaA described earlier, the data acquired over a 3-year period, involving many preparations of HlyAJ96, were remarkably consistent. The results for a single preparation of HlyApHly152 were identical to those from HlyAJ96, within the expected limits of experimental error. No evidence of palmitoylation was observed in HlyA from either source.Our data support the hypothesis that the substrate specificities of HlyC and CyaC (the acyltransferase from B. pertussis that activates CyaA) or their respective complexes with acyl-ACPs are different. CyaC-mediated acylation of CyaA involves primarily palmitoylation (8Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L.

HlyC-mediated acylation of HlyA in a cell-free system was most efficient when C14:0 acyl-ACP was used as a substrate (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, C14:0-modified HlyA produced in vitro was the most active form in the sheep red blood cell assay for hemolytic activity (5Issartel J.P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Nature. 1991; 351: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Stanley et al. (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and observations from recent biophysical studies with model membranes (27Joseph M. Nagaraj R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16749-16755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have suggested that C14:0 side chains are not hydrophobic enough in themselves to allow HlyA to penetrate target cell membranes in a nonspecific manner, but they are sufficient to promote surface binding to target cell membranes. These observations may shed some light on the functional significance of the approximately 68% C14:0 in vivo acylation that we report here. However, the observations of C15:0 and C17:0 were unexpected and difficult to rationalize because these fatty acids are present in E. coliat concentrations too small to normally be considered significant. However, the cellular machinery responsible for HlyA activation is known to function with very low concentrations of acyl-ACP substrate (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Odd-carbon fatty acids are not mentioned in authoritative reviews of chemical composition (28Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 13-16Google Scholar) and endogenous fatty acid metabolism (29Cronan J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Isopentenoids and Other Natural Products, Evolution and Function. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 163-201Google Scholar) and in other taxonomic groups. However, C17:0 and C15:0 fatty acyl groups have not, to our knowledge, been reported as protein modifications, much less as substrates for the known internal lysine acylations (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the suggestion that their presence is simply a by-product of enzymes and (or) carrier proteins with loose specificity, whose primary end products are C14:0-modified lysine at Lys-564 and Lys-690, is probably not tenable. On the other hand, if HlyA were to achieve a better “fit” with C15:0 or C17:0 during a specific host cell protein interaction, e.g. a receptor, or between monomers in the putative oligomerization step some believe may be involved in pore formation, their presence could be rationalized. It will be interesting to examine the modification status of previously described HlyA mutants and HlyA/LktA hybrid proteins with altered target cell specificities (11Pellett S. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Forestier C. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lally et al. (32Lally E.T. Kieba I.R.

A. Welch, manuscript in preparation. Another possibility is that these side chains may promote interference with host cell signaling pathways by mimicking the action(s) of a lipid-containing host cell messenger. The fact that CyaA is acylated primarily with 16 carbon side chains whereas HlyA is acylated with 14, 15, and 17 carbon groups suggests that the two toxins differ significantly in the physical details of their interactions with target cell membranes. α-Hemolysin (HlyA,1110 kDa) is a widely studied protein toxin secreted by uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. It is the most studied toxin of the RTX (repeat in toxin) class (1Welch R.A. Bauer M.E. Kent A.D. Leeds J.A. Moayeri M. Regassa L.B. Swenson D.L. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 254-272PubMed Google Scholar) and has served as a model protein for the study of fatty acylation of virulence factors important in Gram-negative pathogenesis (2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other RTX toxins that have been characterized include adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT, the CyaA protein from Bordetella pertussis) and leukotoxin (LktA) from Pasteurella hemolytica. This class of proteins is defined by a common feature, a repeat region rich in aspartic acid and glycine. They are secreted by pathogens during infection and are known to attack host immune system cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes. At high concentrations they are lytic for their respective populations of target cells. At sublytic concentrations HlyA is known to disrupt host cell signal transduction and cytokine production (1Welch R.A. Bauer M.E. Kent A.D. Leeds J.A. Moayeri M. Regassa L.B. Swenson D.L. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 254-272PubMed Google Scholar,2Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intracellular activation process is shared by the members of the RTX toxin family (3Welch R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In HlyA, for example, the activation process is dependent on the product of an accessory gene, hlyC, and is accomplished by acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) dependent fatty acylation (4Hardie K.R. Issartel J.P. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Issartel J.P. Koronakis V. Hughes C.

Studies of in vitro activated HlyA protein have revealed that two internal residues, 2For the sake of clarity, we have consistently used the nomenclature of Stanley and coauthors (2Stanley P.

Certain strains of E. coli produce HlyA (e.g. HlyAJ96) that contains 1023 amino acids and thus has modified residues at Lys-689 and Lys-563. The inferred amino acid sequences of J96 (GenBank accession no. P09983, 1023 amino acids) and pHly152 (GenBankTM accession numberP08715, 1024 amino acids) differ at several positions with substitutions and deletions, yielding the net effect of a single amino acid difference in their length. 2For the sake of clarity, we have consistently used the nomenclature of Stanley and coauthors (2Stanley P.

Analysis of the in vivo activated HlyA protein using two-dimensional gels has confirmed the sites of activation (7Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not the chemical structures of the modifications. The structural details of the fatty acylation of CyaA from B. pertussis have been studied. Active CyaA isolated from B. pertussis was observed to be palmitoylated at only one internal lysine residue, Lys-983, which corresponds to Lys-690 of HlyA (8Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) according to RTX toxin sequence alignments. Similarly, Lys-860 of CyaA corresponds to Lys-564 of HlyA. However, recombinant CyaA, isolated from E. coli containing cyaA and cyaCgenes, is acylated at two sites. Lys-983 is about 87% palmitoylated and the remainder myristoylated, and Lys-860 is approximately two-thirds palmitoylated (9Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J.

More recently, it has become clear that acylations observed in CyaA show a high degree of variability, especially at Lys-860. We have now observed Lys-860 acylation, by an as yet uncharacterized side chain, in recent preparations of ACT expressed by B. pe"

In addition, theSRC gene is differentially expressed, developmentally regulated, and frequently overexpressed in human neoplasia.

Since its discovery as the homologue of the v-src transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus, it has long been speculated that c-Src could play an important role in human cancer. Over the years activation of this kinase has been reported in many human neoplasms, especially those of the colon (4Bolen J.B. Veillette A. Schwartz A.M. DeSeau V. Rosen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Most recently, activating mutations in the SRC gene have been identified in a small number of advanced colon cancers (16Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, in many tumors and cell lines, a significant portion of this activation process appears to result from c-Src overexpression (7Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2627-2635PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iravani S. Mao W. Fu L. Karl R. Yeatman T. Jove R. Coppola D. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 365-371PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of normal c-Src is sufficient to transform mouse fibroblasts (17Lin P.-H. Shenoy S. Galitski T. Shalloway D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 401-405PubMed Google Scholar), especially in combination with receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (18Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol.

A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, antisense-mediated down-regulation of c-Src in the human colon cancer cell line (HCCL)1 HT29 and the SKOv-3 ovarian cancer cell line, both of which constitutively overexpress c-Src, results in decreased proliferation and tumor forming ability (20Wiener J.R.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that overexpression of c-Src can contribute to both transformation and tumorigenicity. Our own laboratory has recently shown that this common overexpression results from transcriptional up-regulation of theSRC gene in many HCCLs. 2S. M. Dehm and K. Bonham, unpublished observations. Although theSRC gene product has been the subject of intense scrutiny,SRC transcriptional regulation in both normal and malignant cells has received relatively little attention. Whereas c-Src expression in normal tissues and cells is fairly ubiquitous, expression levels vary tremendously, and the gene is developmentally regulated (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar,2Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SRC is induced at the transcriptional level during differentiation of several cell types (22Higuchi Y. Ito M. Tajima M. Higuchi S. Miyamoto N. Nishio M. Kawano M. Kusagawa S.

Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, 27Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The SRC gene is composed of 14 exons; the first three, designated 1A, 1B, and 1C, encode the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA. Exons 2–12 encode the protein and 3′ noncoding region (28Anderson S.K. Gibbs C.P. Tanaka A. Kung H.-J. Fujita D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,29Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). A promoter, with all the hallmarks of a housekeeping gene (including high GC content and multiple start sites), is associated with exon 1A (29Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this promoter is regulated by members of the Sp1 family as well as a novel factor, SPy, which interacts with several unusual polypurine:polypyrimidine tracts that are essential for full SRC promoter activity (30Ritchie S. Boyd F.M. Wong J. Bonham K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, during the course of our studies with HCCLs, we noted that many c-Src transcripts did not originate from this promoter. We report here the isolation and characterization of an alternative SRCpromoter that is active in a number of tumor cell lines, and we demonstrate that the homeodomain-containing transcription factor HNF-1 is responsible for regulating the expression of c-Src in a tissue-restricted fashion. The HT29, SW480, SW620, COLO201, and COLO205 (all colon cancer), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma), T47D (breast cancer), HTB 10 (neuroblastoma), and HTB 18 (retinoblastoma) human cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HT29, SW480, and SW620 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, COLO201 and 205 in RPMI 1640, HepG2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, T47D in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.2 IU of bovine insulin, HTB 10 in McCoy's medium, and HTB 18 in minimum essential medium and Earle's salts. All cells were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Total cellular RNA was isolated from semi-confluent tissue culture plates as described (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and quantitated by A 260. Concentration and integrity were confirmed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. For 5′ RACE analysis, poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from HT29 cells, using a mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, as described by the manufacturer. A 5′ RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used, essentially as described by the manufacturer, with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was reverse transcribed using aSRC exon 2-specific primer (5′ RACE primer 1; 5′-GGTCTGCGAGGGCGGGGAAAGCG) complementary to sequence located 111 bp downstream of the initiating AUG codon. Following RNase treatment and purification, one-fifth of the single-stranded cDNA was dC tailed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A fifth of the this reaction was then subjected to amplification using a secondSRC exon 2-specific primer (5′ RACE primer 2; 5′-TTGGGCTTGCTCTTGTTGCTAC) complementary to sequence located 26 bp downstream of the AUG codon and the 5′ RACE abridged anchor primer supplied with the kit (35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s). At this point a clear PCR product was observed following agarose gel electrophoresis. This PCR product (one-tenth volume) was then subjected to a second round of amplification using the 5′ RACE primer 2, the abridged universal amplification primer supplied with the kit, and 2.5 units of Pfu (Stratagene) (30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 53 °C for 60 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 90 s). Following phosphorylation with polynucleotide kinase and ATP, the PCR product was gel purified and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene). A number of individual PCR derived inserts were then sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmids, pSRC1A chimera and the genomic subclone pBam 4.8, containing the human SRC promoter region, have been described previously (29Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). The CAT expression vector 0.54SRC1A-CAT3 is similar to that described (29Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar) except that the original GEM2CAT vector was replaced with pCAT3-Basic (Promega). The β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ-gal was a gift from Dr. W. Roesler (University of Saskatchewan). The HNF-1 expression vectors pBJ5-HNF-1α and pBJ5-HNF-1β were a generous gift from Dr. Gerry Crabtree (Stanford University) (32Courtois G. Baumhueter S. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSRC1α chimera was prepared by restricting the longest 5′ RACE product, cloned in pBluescript, with HincII (which cuts within exon 1α) and EcoRV (located in the multiple cloning site), thus removing the first 46 bp of exon 1α sequence. In parallel a EcoRV/HincII fragment encompassing this 46 bp of exon1α and an additional 532 bp of upstream genomic sequence were isolated from pBam 4.8. This fragment was then cloned into the EcoRV/HincII-digested 5′ RACE plasmid. The resulting pSRC1α chimeric construct contained 532 bp of presumptive genomic promoter sequence spliced directly to the three noncoding exons (1α, 1B, and 1C). The −2852, −777, and −145SRC1α-CAT3-Basic clones were derived from the genomic pBam 4.8 clone and contained a common 3′ end defined by anMscI site located in exon 1α at +153. The individual fragments were produced by complete digestion of pBam 4.8 withBamHI followed by a partial digestion with MscI. Fragments of the predicted size (3005, 929, and 297 bp, respectively) were gel purified and blunt end ligated into the SmaI site of pCAT3-Basic. The −y375SRC1α-CAT3-Basic vector was derived from a RsaI/XhoI digest of −777SRC1α, and the resulting 533-bp fragment was cloned into the SmaI/XhoI site of pCAT3-Basic. The +19SRC1α-CAT3-Basic vector was prepared by isolating the 133-bp HincII/XhoI fragment from −145SRC1α-CAT3-Basic followed by cloning into theSmaI/XhoI site of pCAT3-Basic. The vector, −777Δ-136SRC1α-CAT3-Basic was derived from −777SRC1α-CAT3-Basic by digesting with StuI and XhoI. Following an end fill reaction with T4 DNA polymerase, the resulting plasmid fragment was gel purified and religated. In all cases the identity of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. CAT reporter constructs containing a mutated version of the HNF-1 site (−145mutSRC1α and −777mutSRC1α) were generated from the wild type versions of the vectors using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Sense 5′-TGGGAAGCTGCGGTTCCTCTTGGAGCCAGCTTGCAAAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GTTTGCAAGGCTGGCTCCAAGAGGAACCGCAGCTTCCCA-3′ mutagenic oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) spanning the region −62 to −24 were used for this process. Mutated sequences are underlined. Following confirmation of mutation by sequence analysis the promoter fragments were isolated and recloned into pCAT3-Basic. The genomic exon 1α region was mapped to a position approximately 1.0 kilobase upstream of the previously identified exon 1A and associated promoter. This was confirmed by both our own sequencing of the genomic pBam 4.8 clone (29Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar) and the extensive sequence analysis available for this region of Chromosome 20 performed at the Sanger Institute. Mapping of transcription start sites was carried out using an S1 Nuclease Protection Assay Kit (Ambion) essentially as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, a single-stranded 32P-labeled probe was prepared by linearizing pSRC1α chimera with StuI (which cuts 107 bp upstream of the longest 5′ RACE clone analyzed) and carrying out a primer extension reaction in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, unlabeled dNTPs, a primer complementary to sequence in exon 1B (5′-CTGGCTCTGTCTCTCATAGCTGG) and Taqpolymerase. Following isolation of the full-length S1 probe on an acrylamide gel, 50,000 cpm were hybridized to 25 μg of HT29 total RNA at 55 °C overnight. Following S1 digestion, the products were resolved on a standard DNA sequencing gel. Start sites were mapped by a direct comparison with a sequencing ladder generated with pSRC1α chimera and the exon 1B-specific primer. Two S1 probes specific for either 1α or 1A containing c-Src transcripts were generated from the plasmids pSRC1α chimera and pSRC1A chimera linearized with StuI orSacI respectively. Analysis was performed exactly as described for mapping of transcription start sites (see above) except that an exon 1C-specific primer (5′-GAGTCAGGGGTCTCGAAATAGAG) was used to generate probes. Hybridization was carried out at 48 and 60 °C overnight for the 1α and 1A probes, respectively. A multi-tissue RNA blot was purchased from CLONTECH containing standardized levels of poly(A)+ mRNA from various normal human tissues. The blot was first hybridized with a 32P-labeled SRCcDNA fragment (a NcoI/KpnI fragment encompassing the first 875 bp of the SRC coding region) exactly as described by the manufacturer. The blot was then stripped according to manufacturers instructions and reprobed with a32P-labeled 1α-specific probe (a 200-bpStuI/HpaII genomic fragment encompassing −135 to +165 of the promoter region). HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (33Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). A 298-bp MscI fragment covering the −145 to +152 region of the SRC1α promoter was blunt end ligated into the SmaI site of pBluescript. A 32P-labeled probe encompassing the region −145 to +19 was then prepared by digesting this clone with ClaI and HincII followed by an in-fill reaction with Klenow fragment and [32P]dCTP. EMSAs were carried out as described previously (30Ritchie S. Boyd F.M. Wong J. Bonham K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Competitor double-stranded oligonucleotide sequences (Life Technologies, Inc.) used in EMSAs were SrcHNF (−56 to −35, 5′-GCTGCGGTTAATCTTTAAGCA-3′), mHNF (5′-GCTGCGGTTCCTCTTGGAAGCCA-3′) and a consensus HNF-1 sequence (34Tronche F. Yaniv M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), cHNF (5′-GTGGTTAATNATTAAC-3′). For competition experiments, oligonucleotides (25 m excess) were incubated with nuclear extract for 15 min prior to the addition of probe. For antibody experiments 1 or 2 μg of Supershift anti-HNF-1α or HNF-1β (Santa Cruz) were used. Cells from semi-confluent 10-cm plates were lysed directly in a loading buffer containing 65 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% β−mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Following protein concentration determination using a Lowry kit (Sigma), 30 μg of total cellular protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gel transfer to nitrocellulose and membrane blocking were performed using standard procedures (7Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2627-2635PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were first incubated with antibodies specific for HNF-1α, Sp1, or Sp3 (Santa Cruz) at 2 μg/ml, washed, and then subsequently probed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:2000 as described (7Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2627-2635PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT Blue XB-1 film for detection. All plasmids used in transfections were isolated using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). In a typical transfection 0.5 μg of CAT vector and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ-gal were mixed with 6.0 μl of PLUS reagent and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE each in 100 μl of OptiMEM (all reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.). For coexpression studies an extra 0.5 μg of either pBJ5-HNF-1α, pBJ5-HNF-1β, or an empty control vector were included. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the DNA complexes were added directly to cells in serum-free medium (4 × 105 cells/well). After 3 h, serum was added to 10% in a final volume of 2 ml. Cells were harvested 48 h later with provided lysis buffer, and protein levels were determined using Bio-Rad Bradford reagent. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (30Ritchie S. Boyd F.M. Wong J. Bonham K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and CAT levels were quantified using a CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CAT levels were corrected for transfection efficiency and were repeated at least three times in duplicate. As part of our efforts to understand the regulation of SRC in HCCLs, we carried out a series of S1 and RNase protection experiments using single-stranded32P-labeled probes complementary to the 5′ noncoding region of c-Src mRNA (encoded by exons 1A, 1B, and 1C). Surprisingly, the protected fragments observed were frequently much shorter than expected and were consistent with mRNA species, which lacked sequence encoded by exon 1A (results not shown). To test this hypothesis, we carried out 5′ RACE using mRNA isolated from the HCCL, HT29, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A major species of approximately 500 bp was isolated and cloned, and a number of individual constructs were sequenced (Fig.1 A). All of these clones contained sequence encoded by exons 1B, 1C, and 2 (the first coding exon). However, novel sequence data were obtained 5′ of exon 1B, indicating the presence of a new exon. None of the clones analyzed contained sequence encoded by exon 1A. Using traditional mapping methods, as well as the extensive sequence data available for this region of the genome (Chromosome 20 project, Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK), we mapped this new exon to a position approximately 1.0 kilobase upstream of exon 1A and named it exon 1α. (Figs.1 B and 2 A)Figure 2Transcriptional start site mapping of theSRC1α promoter. A, exon 1α sequence (based on the longest 5′ RACE clone) is shown boxedand shaded (−30 to + 175) and is bordered at its 3′ end by a consensus splice site. The major start site is designated as +1 (see below). The HNF-1 consensus sequence (−56 to −35) is boxed.R (G/A) at −13 refers to a single base pair polymorphism identified at this site. B, a S1 probe was synthesized from pSRC1α chimera (C) and used to map transcription start sites as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, yeast RNA (25 μg); lane 2, HT29 total RNA (25 μg). The same primer and plasmid were used to generate a sequencing ladder. Numbering is based on the designation of +1 for the major start site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To map the transcription start site(s) for this new proposedSRC promoter, we constructed a chimeric clone consisting of genomic sequence derived from exon 1α spliced in frame to exons 1B, 1C, and 2 derived from the 5′ RACE product, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Single-stranded 32P-labeled probes were then synthesized from this construct and used in S1 mapping experiments. A single major transcription start site, as well as several minor sites, were identified (Fig. 2 B). The start sites mapped were very similar or identical to those predicted by sequence analysis of the 5′ RACE clones and were also confirmed by RNase protection (results not shown). To examine the relative abundance of transcripts arising from promoters 1α and 1A, S1 probes were used in protection experiments with RNA isolated from various human cell lines (Fig.3). Using similar S1 probes to those described above, we found both full-length protection, demonstratingSRC1α promoter usage, and a shorter protected species consistent with transcripts arising from 1A (Fig. 3 A). These data demonstrate that both promoters are used in HCCLs such as HT29, WiDr, COLO201, COLO205, previously shown to constitutively overexpress c-Src (7Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2627-2635PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2, which also expresses similarly high constitutive levels of c-Src, 3K. Bonham, S. A. Ritchie, S. M. Dehm, K. Snyder, and F. M. Boyd, unpublished data. also utilizes both promoters, although with a strong preference for 1α. HCCLs, which we have previously shown to express low levels of c-Src (SW620 and SW480), reflected this low expression in protection experiments, although species consistent with usage of both promoters were observed with prolonged exposures. In contrast, protection of RNA derived from T47D (breast cancer), HTB 10 (neuroblastoma), and HTB 18 (retinoblastoma) was consistent with predominant utilization of the 1A promoter. This was confirmed by repeating these experiments with S1 probes synthesized from vector pSRC1A chimera, where the 1α portion was replaced with 1A sequence (Fig. 3 B). In this case full-length protection was seen with HTB 18 and HTB 10, confirming that these cell lines preferentially use the 1A promoter. To determine whether transcripts originating from this new promoter were expressed in normal tissues, we first examined the expression pattern of c-Src using a multi-tissue mRNA dot blot (CLONTECH) with a cDNA probe derived from theSRC coding region. As shown in Fig.4 A, c-Src mRNA was ubiquitously expressed, although levels were highly variable. Expression was absent in adult tissues such as skeletal muscle, low in heart, liver, colon, and thymus, and highest in tissues such as testis, stomach, and adrenal gland. In contrast, when a probe specific for transcripts arising from exon 1α was used, a very different pattern was observed (Fig. 4 B). Here expression was highest in pancreas, stomach, kidney, and fetal lung with lower levels detectable in colon, liver, prostate, and some other fetal tissues such as kidney and liver. Expression of SRC1α transcripts was undetectable in most other tissues, including brain, testis, and adrenal gland. These data suggest that although overall c-Src mRNA expression is widespread, transcripts originating from theSRC1α promoter display a much more restricted pattern of expression. Unfortunately, because of an extremely high GC content, we have had difficulty constructing a reliable 1A-specific probe to complement these data. To begin characterization of this new promoter, we constructed a series of 5′ and 3′ SRC1α promoter deletion CAT expression vectors (using pCAT-3basic, Promega). Because theSRC1α promoter appeared to be particularly well utilized in the HepG2 cells, we carried out our initial analysis in this cell line. As shown in Fig. 5, deletion from the 5′ end resulted in a series of stepwise increases in CAT levels, suggesting the presence of several upstream negative regulatory elements. Highest CAT levels were achieved with the −145SRC1α construct, which was approximately four times more active than the −2852SRC1α construct and produced CAT levels similar to that of the SRC1A promoter construct, 0.54SRC1A-CAT3. However, deletion of sequences between −145"

The subcellular localization and function of CLC5 were investigated in the LLC-PK1 porcine proximal tubule cell line. We cloned a cDNA for the porcine CLC5 ortholog (pCLC5) that is predicted to encode an 83-kDa protein with 97% amino acid sequence identity to rat and human CLC5. By immunofluorescence, pCLC5 was localized to early endosomes of the apical membrane fluid-phase endocytotic pathway and to the Golgi complex. Xenopus oocytes injected with pCLC5 cRNA exhibited outwardly rectifying whole cell currents with a relative conductance profile (nitrate ≫ Cl− ≈ Br− > I− > acetate > gluconate) different from that of control oocytes. Acidification of the extracellular medium reversibly inhibited this outward current with a pK a of 6.0 and a Hill coefficient of 1. Overexpression of CLC5 in LLC-PK1 cells resulted in morphological changes, including loss of cell-cell contacts and the appearance of multiple prominent vesicles. These findings are consistent with a potential role for CLC5 in the acidification of membrane compartments of both the endocytic and the exocytic pathway and suggest that its function may be important for normal intercellular adhesion and vesicular trafficking.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F957-F965PubMed Google Scholar), but its physiological role is unknown. It has been postulated that CLC5 may provide an electrical shunt to dissipate the potential gradient across the endosomal membrane generated by electrogenic proton transport into the endosomal lumen. Thus, loss of CLC5 function would be predicted to impair endosomal acidification, which is normally required for endocytosis (14Gekle M. Mildenberger S. Freudinger R. Silbernagl S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F899-F906PubMed Google Scholar), trafficking to lysosomes (15van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13929-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this model, low molecular weight proteinuria in Dent's disease occurs because of failure of endocytosis from the proximal tubule lumen, which is the normal pathway for reabsorption of low molecular weight proteins (17Sumpio B.E. Hayslett J.P. Q. J. Med. 1985; 57: 611-635PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of a Fanconi-like syndrome may be explained by internalization of apical membrane sodium-coupled solute transporters into endosomal vesicles but failure to recycle these transporters back to the surface. The hypercalciuria in this disease appears to be absorptive in origin (18Luyckx V.A. Leclercq B. Dowland L. Yu A.S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12174-12179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and may be due to abnormal regulation of proximal tubule 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-hydroxylase activity. How this might be possible, given that the 1-hydroxylase is located on the inner membrane of mitochondria, remains unknown. To understand the cellular role of CLC5 and test these hypotheses, it will be critical to have a cell culture model that normally expresses CLC5 and physiologically resembles native proximal tubule epithelium. LLC-PK1 is a well characterized cell line that is an excellent model of the proximal tubule epithelium (19Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W.

We report here the cloning of a porcine CLC5 ortholog (pCLC5), its localization to Golgi and endosomal vesicles of LLC-PK1 cells, and its functional characterization by heterologous expression in the Xenopusoocyte system. LLC-PK1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, catalog number CL-101) were cultured to confluence on plastic plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed on 70–80% confluent cells by lipofection using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by cotransfection of pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) was routinely used to assess transfection efficiency (typically 10–20% of cells) and identify positive cells. Northern blots under high stringency conditions (hybridization at 65 °C in the presence of 50% formamide, final washes at 65 °C in 0.1× SSCP) were performed on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from these cells, using digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes of rat CLC5, CLC4, and CLC3 (11Luyckx V.A.

To clone the pCLC5 cDNA, degenerate oligonucleotide primers (sense, ATHTCTGCNCAYTGGATGAC; antisense, TAYTTRTTRAARCARTGRCA) were designed to the conserved amino acid sequences of human (27Fisher S.E. van Bakel I.

Physiol. 1997; 273: C1176-C1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) CLC5. By homology-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 amplification of LLC-PK1 cell mRNA, a 427-base pair cDNA was isolated that was highly homologous to CLC5 in other species. The remainder of the cDNA encompassing the coding sequence was cloned by a combination of primer walking and rapid amplification of cDNA ends and then sequenced in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. To exclude PCR misincorporation errors, each nucleotide sequence within the open reading frame was corroborated at least three times using overlapping clones amplified from independent PCRs. As a positive control, a rat CLC5 cDNA (rCLC5) containing the full coding region, identical to the published sequence (28Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vanderwalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR and cloned in a similar fashion. Constructs encoding the rCLC5 coding region with a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) at either the N or the C terminus and an optimized Kozak translation initiation sequence were generated by PCR-based oligonucleotide mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. To generate mammalian expression constructs for transfection into LLC-PK1 cells, pCLC5 and rCLC5 cDNA were cloned into the plasmid vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. To generate vectors with convenient restriction sites suitable for expression in Xenopusoocytes, we adapted a pTLN II vector (30Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) in which the NcoI site and occult Kozak sequence had previously been deleted by mung bean exonuclease and replaced with an ApaI site (gifts of Dr. Peying Fong and Dr. Joseph Mindell). The polylinker was next removed with ApaI and BstEII, the ends made blunt with Klenow polymerase, and the polylinker of pcDNA3.1-zeo (Invitrogen) excised with PmeI and inserted into this site in both orientations to generate the vectors pOX(+) (oriented so that SP6 transcription proceeds from AflII to ApaI), and pOX(−). These vectors have the advantage that inserts cloned into the polylinker can be easily swapped as a restriction cassette into any of the pcDNA3.1 and pIND series of vectors for mammalian cell expression, which have the same polylinker, without the need to create new restriction sites. The coding sequences of pCLC5 and rCLC5 were cloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pOX(+). In vitro translation of pCLC5 and rCLC5 cDNA was performed in the presence or absence of canine microsomal membranes using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), and the products were electrophoresed on a 7.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Calibration of molecular weights was achieved by electrophoresing in parallel a lane of unstained protein molecular weight standards. In the negative control sample, cDNA was omitted from the reaction. To detect all translated products, biotinylated lysine tRNA (Transcend tRNA, Promega) was included in the translation reaction, and the membrane was blotted with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase followed by a chemiluminescent substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect CLC5 immunoreactivity, Transcend tRNA was omitted, and the membranes were immunoblotted with the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody fractions, C1 and C2, exactly as described previously (11Luyckx V.A.

To detect FLAG epitope-tagged proteins, immunoblots were performed with the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. To detect pCLC5 in LLC-PK1 membranes, confluent cultured cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off the plate, and suspended in sucrose/histidine buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), adjusted to pH 7.4. The cells were homogenized by 6 passes through a 25-gauge needle, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to sediment nuclei, and the post-nuclear supernatant centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to yield a microsomal membrane pellet. This was then resuspended in 2% SDS-containing gel-loading buffer for electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described above. Deglycosylation was performed by boiling the protein samples for 2 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and then adding 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 18 units/mlN-glycosidase F (Sigma) and incubating 12–16 h at 37 °C. Native or transfected LLC-PK1 cells grown on glass coverslips to 85% confluence were washed in PBS and fixed in methanol at −80 °C for 10 min. To entrap fluorescent markers in early endosomes of the apical endocytotic pathway, LLC-PK1 cells were incubated prior to fixation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled conjugates (all from Sigma) of dextran (1 mg/ml, average molecular mass 12 kDa), albumin (1 mg/ml), or Ricinus communis agglutinin (ricin, 0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Immunostaining of endogenous pCLC5 with the C1 antibody, using amplification by the direct tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was performed exactly as described previously (11Luyckx V.A. Goda F.O. Mount D.B. Nishio T. Hall A. Hebert S.C. Hammond T.G. Yu A.S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F761-F769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For double-staining studies with the Na+-K+-ATPase, a monoclonal antibody (gift of Dr. Kevin Bush) was used without dilution. For immunodetection of the FLAG epitope, the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used, diluted 1:100 into PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 0.2% skimmed milk. ARF1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (gift of Dr. Vladimir Marshansky), used as a marker of the Golgi complex (31Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Londono I. Bendayan M. Vinay P. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Londono I. Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. Bendayan M. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was applied at a dilution of 1:250, also in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100. Slides were visualized with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal krypton-argon laser scanning microscope. For double-labeled slides, images were acquired sequentially for each fluorophore in single label mode to minimize “bleed-through” between channels. Each pair of images was then imported into Adobe Photoshop 3.0, false color added, and merged to generate dual-color images. pOX(+) plasmid constructs encoding pCLC5 and rCLC5 cDNA were linearized with MluI, and capped cRNA was transcribed with SP6 polymerase. Stage V/VI Xenopus laevisoocytes were digested with collagenase, defolliculated, and injected with 50 nl of cRNA (1 μg/μl) or sterile water for negative controls and then incubated at 18 °C in ND96 (containing in mm: NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, adjusted to pH 7.4) with 50 μg/ml gentamicin for 4–6 days. To detect CLC5 expression in the oocytes, total microsomal membranes were prepared. Oocytes were suspended in sucrose/histidine buffer, lysed by triturating 30 times through a 200-μl volume pipette tip, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to sediment cellular debris. The floating layer of yellow lipid was removed with a cotton-tipped applicator, and the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to yield a microsomal membrane pellet. To identify the subset of proteins expressed at the cell surface, a modification of a published surface biotinylation method (33Chillaron J. Estevez R. Samarzija I. Waldegger S. Testar X. Lang F. Zorzano A. Busch A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used. Between 40 and 80 oocytes were washed in OR2 (containing in mm: NaCl 82.5, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, Na phosphate 10, adjusted to pH 7.4) and then incubated in OR2 containing 4 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 10 min at room temperature (22 °C). The reaction was then stopped by adding 0.5 mglycine, pH 7.4, and the oocytes were washed twice in glycine and twice in OR2. The oocytes were then suspended in lysis buffer containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2× Complete protease inhibitor, adjusted to pH 7.4. The oocytes were lysed by trituration, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, the lipid layer removed, and the supernatant dialyzed overnight against SAV buffer containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, adjusted to pH 8. The lysate was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the agarose was sedimented by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant, which contains non-biotinylated proteins, was recovered. The pellet was washed 4 times in SAV buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered by solubilization in 1% SDS. The protein recovery of each fraction was determined by a detergent-compatible colorimetric assay (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of each protein sample (25 μg) were loaded in each lane of a denaturing 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and immunoblotted with C1 antiserum. Two-microelectrode voltage clamp studies of Xenopus oocytes were performed at room temperature using a Clampator-1B (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN) controlled by pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had tip resistances of 0.5–2 mΩ. Oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of −50 mV, and voltage steps from −120 to +100 mV in 20 mV increment were applied. Data were acquired at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 2 kHz. For control studies, oocytes were superfused with ND96 modified to contain 98 mm NaCl and 0.3 mm CaCl2so as to minimize activation of the endogenous calcium-activated chloride conductance in oocytes. In anion substitution experiments, 80 mm chloride was substituted with an equimolar concentration of another anion (except where otherwise specified), and the bath Ag/AgCl electrode was protected by a KCl-agar bridge. In studies of the effect of lowering bath pH, MES was substituted for HEPES as the buffer and titrated to the desired pH with NaOH. Each experimental result reported was confirmed in at least 3 distinct batches of oocytes isolated from different frogs on separate days. By high stringency Northern blot analysis with a rat CLC5 probe, LLC-PK1 cells appear to express mRNA encoding a CLC5 homolog. A strong band of 9.5 kb was observed, similar to the size of human and rat CLC5 mRNA (28Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vanderwalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 34Fisher S.E. Black G.C.M. Lloyd S.E. Hatchwell E. Wrong O. Thakker R.V. Craig I.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2053-2059PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a weaker band of approximately 3 kb, similar in size to the X. laevis CLC5 mRNA (29Lindenthal S. Schmieder S. Ehrenfeld J. Wills N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1176-C1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The pCLC5 cDNA was isolated and sequenced from multiple clones by homology-based reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA from LLC-PK1 cells. It contains a long open reading frame of over 2 kb. The first ATG codon after an in-frame upstream stop codon is not in the context of a suitable Kozak consensus sequence (35Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the second ATG is, and the latter has therefore been assigned as the initiator codon (Fig. 2). The resultant open reading frame of 2238 base pairs predicts a protein of 746 amino acids with a molecular mass of 83 kDa (Fig.3 A). The protein sequence of pCLC5 is the same length as and highly homologous with rat CLC5 (rCLC5, 97% amino acid identity (28Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vanderwalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)) and is also very similar to human CLC5 (98% amino acid identity in overlapping region (27Fisher S.E. van Bakel I. Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Thakker R.V. Craig I.W. Genomics. 1995; 29: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) except for the absence of a 20-residue stretch at the N-terminal of human CLC5. We conclude that pCLC5 is the porcine ortholog of CLC5.Figure 2Comparison of the upstream coding sequence and 5′-untranslated region of pCLC5 with that of rat and human CLC5 (27Fisher S.E. van Bakel I.

Based on glycosylation scanning and protease protection studies in CLC1 (36Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), 10 of these domains are believed to span the membrane, with both N and C termini located on the cytosolic side of the membrane. pCLC5 has two potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig.3 A). One at residue 408 is predicted to be in the extracellular loop between the 7th and 8th transmembrane segments, is conserved in all CLC family members, has been shown to be used in vitro in CLC-K1, CLC-K2, and CLC1 (36Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and is likely abona fide glycosylation site. The other site at residue 38 is predicted to be intracellular. There are two overlapping cAMP-dependent phosphorylation consensus sequences in the cytosolic loop between the 6th and 7th transmembrane domain and four potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites that are predicted to be located on the cytosolic side (Fig. 3 A). We previously generated polyclonal antiserum against a fusion protein containing the C terminus of rCLC5 (11Luyckx V.A. Goda F.O. Mount D.B. Nishio T. Hall A. Hebert S.C. Hammond T.G. Yu A.S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F761-F769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we affinity-purified from it two fractions, C1 (which reacts primarily with rCLC5 but also cross-reacts with CLC3 and CLC4), and C2 (which is specific for rCLC5). To determine if these sera could be used for immunodetection of pCLC5, we firstin vitro translated pCLC5. As shown by the streptavidin blot in Fig. 4 A, pCLC5 was successfully translated to yield a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa, identical to the apparent size of in vitrotranslated rCLC5, and absent from the negative control lane. By Western blotting, the C1 antibody reacts strongly with the translated pCLC5 protein (Fig. 4 A), but C2 serum did not recognize pCLC5 at all (data not shown). Furthermore, C1 recognizes a band of the same apparent size in LLC-PK1 100,000 × g membranes (Fig.4 B). Because the apparent molecular mass of pCLC5 (and of rCLC5) on our denaturing gels (65 kDa) is lower than the 83-kDa size predicted from its amino acid sequence, and anomalous migration on protein gels has not been reported for any other CLC protein, the potential contribution of post-translational modification of pCLC5 and rCLC5 proteins by glycosylation and proteolysis was assessed. In vitro translated pCLC5 and rCLC5 polypeptides could both be glycosylated by canine microsomal membranes, yielding broad bands that migrate with an apparent molecular mass of ∼80–85 kDa (Fig.4 B), identical in size to the C1-immunoreactive band in rat kidney cortex (11Luyckx V.A. Goda F.O. Mount D.B. Nishio T. Hall A. Hebert S.C. Hammond T.G. Yu A.S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F761-F769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that mature glycosylated CLC5 protein (as found in rat kidney cortex) migrates at 80–85 kDa, whereas the unglycosylated polypeptide (as found in LLC-PK1 cells) migrates at 65 kDa. Consistent with this, deglycosylation by N-glycosidase F collapsed the C1-immunoreactive band in rat kidney cortex from 80 to 85 kDa down to 65 kDa, but had no effect on the 65-kDa band in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4 B). The finding of bands that migrate with a molecular weight that is consistently lower than predicted could also be explained by initiation of translation from an initiator codon downstream of the predicted start site, giving rise to a protein truncated at the N terminus or by proteolytic degradation. To address these possibilities, we generated epitope-tagged rCLC5 constructs that encode the FLAG octapeptide epitope fused directly to the N or C terminus. Both constructs could be translated in vitro and yielded bands that run only very slightly higher on the gel than those of the untagged proteins (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, both tagged polypeptides were immunoreactive with a monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope, demonstrating that neither the N nor the C terminus had been truncated. We conclude that the position of pCLC5 and rCLC5 bands on denaturing protein gels is the consequence of anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the"

To understand if there is an inter-play between these two neuromodulatory systems, we investigated the effect of AA on extracellular adenosine metabolism in hippocampal nerve terminals. AA (30 μm) facilitated by 67% adenosine evoked release and by 45% ATP evoked release. These effects were not significantly modified upon blockade of lipooxygenase or cyclooxygenase and were attenuated (52–61%) by the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine (6 μm). The ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitor, α,β-methylene ADP (100 μm), caused a larger inhibition (54%) of adenosine release in the presence of AA (30 μm) compared with control (37% inhibition) indicating that the AA-induced extracellular adenosine accumulation is mostly originated from an increased release and extracellular catabolism of ATP. This AA-induced extracellular adenosine accumulation is further potentiated by an AA-induced decrease (48%) of adenosine transporters capacity. AA (30 μm) increased by 36–42% the tonic inhibition by endogenous extracellular adenosine of adenosine A1 receptors in the modulation of acetylcholine release and of CA1 hippocampal synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. These results indicate that AA increases tonic adenosine modulation as a possible feedback loop to limit AA facilitation of neuronal excitability.

Increased neuronal activity also causes an increase in extracellular arachidonic acid (AA)1 (4Lynch M.A. Clements M.P. Voss K.L. Bramham C.R. Bliss T.V.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a free fatty acid that is found sterified in the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids and can potentially be released by a number of phospholipases, in particular by phospholipases A2 (5Dennis E.A. Rhee S.G. Billah M.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Adenosine and AA fulfil opposite roles in regulating cell to cell communication in the nervous system. For instance, in the hippocampus, AA facilitates while adenosine A1 receptor activation inhibits intracellular free calcium accumulation and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (6Damron D.S. Dorman R.V. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Freeman E.J. Terrian D.M. Dorman R.V. Neurochem.

Life Sci. 1997; 60: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); AA has been proposed to be a mediator of epileptogenic phenomena (10Bazan N.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 559: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) whereas adenosine is considered an endogenous anticonvulsant (11Dragunow M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1988; 31: 85-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); AA potentiates hypoxic damage (12Chan P.H. Fishman R.A. Chen S. Chew S. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), while adenosine is an endogenous neuroprotector (13Fredholm B.B. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1997; 40: 259-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite this parallel between the genesis and opposite actions of adenosine and AA, it is not known whether there is an inter-play between these two neuromodulatory systems. We now report that AA causes an increase in the extracellular accumulation of adenosine upon stimulation of nerve terminals from the rat hippocampus. This AA-induced increase of extracellular adenosine seems to be partly protein kinase C-mediated and to be due to a combination of an AA-induced facilitation of ATP release and an increased extracellular formation of adenosine from released ATP together with an AA-induced inhibition of extracellular adenosine removal. This AA-induced increase in endogenous extracellular adenosine is likely to be the basis of the greater tonic facilitatory effects of adenosine A1 receptor antagonists on acetylcholine release and synaptic transmission caused by AA.

All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Free fatty acids were made up into a 30 mm stock solution and AACOCF3was made up into a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol, aliquoted, and stored under nitrogen atmosphere at −20 °C. Indomethacin was made up into a 20 mm stock in methanol and nordihydroguaiaretic acid was made up into a 20 mm stock in ethanol. Dipyridamole, NBTI, chelerythrine, HA1004, and KN-62 were made up into 5 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, DPCPX was made up into a 5 mm stock solution in 99% dimethyl sulfoxide and 1% NaOH (1 m) and veratridine was made up into a 5 mm stock in 2.5 m in maleic acid. Aqueous dilutions of these stock solutions were made daily. The maximal concentrations of ethanol, methanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide used were devoid of effects on [3H]adenosine and [3H]acetylcholine release as well as on synaptic transmission. Hippocampal synaptosomes from 6-week-old male Wistar rats (140 g) were prepared by differential sucrose-Percoll density gradient centrifugations, as described previously (2Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The synaptosomes were resuspended in oxygenated Krebs solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl 124, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgSO4 1, CaCl2 2, NaHCO3 26, glucose 10, pH 7.4, and gassed with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 mixture. This synaptosomal suspension was equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min, loaded with [2,3,8′-3H]adenosine (3 μCi/ml, 0.05 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C and then layered over Whatman GF/C filters into four parallel 90-μl superfusion chambers (adapted from Swinny filter holders, Millipore, Bedford, MA) through the aid of a roller pump (flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, kept constant throughout the experiment). The chamber volume plus dead volume was approximately 0.6 ml. A series of four parallel superfusion chambers was used to enable both control and test conditions to be performed in duplicate from the same batch of synaptosomes. After setting up the synaptosomes, a 40-min washout period was performed before starting sample collection. The effluent was then collected (release period) in 3-min fractions. To quantify tritium release, 500 μl of the each of the effluent samples were analyzed by scintillation counting, after addition of 5 ml of scintillation liquid (Scintran T, Wallac, Turku, Finland). In some experiments, [3H]adenosine in the effluent samples was separated. This procedure consisted in the lyophilization of 1.2 ml of the effluent, resuspension in a 70% (v/v) methanol solution to extract adenosine, HPLC separation of adenosine, and collection of the HPLC eluent corresponding to the adenosine peak that was scintillation counted to determine the amount of [3H]adenosine (see Ref. 1Cunha R.A. Vizi E.S. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2180-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The synaptosomes were stimulated for 2 min with 20 mmK+ (isomolar substitution of Na+ by K+ in the superfusion Krebs solution) at 21 min after starting sample collection. In some experiments, veratridine stimulation (10 μm for 2 min) was used instead of K+ stimulation. Tested drugs, applied through the superfusion Krebs solution, were added 9 min before K+stimulation, and removed 13 min after the offset of stimulation. When testing the modifications of the effect of a drug by a modifier, this modifier was applied 15 min before starting sample collection and was present throughout the experiment. At the end of the experiments, the filters were removed from the superfusion chambers and analyzed by scintillation counting for determination of tritium retained by the synaptosomes. Radioactivity was expressed in terms of disintegrations per second per mg of protein (Bq/mg) in each chamber. The fractional release was expressed in terms of the percentage of total radioactivity present in the preparation at the beginning of the collection of each sample. The amount of radioactivity (expressed as fractional release) released by K+ stimulation was calculated by integration of the area of the peak upon subtraction of the estimated basal tritium release from the total release of tritium obtained upon K+stimulation. The basal release was assumed to decline linearly from 2 min before onset of stimulation to the 8th min after onset of stimulation. Hippocampal synaptosomes were resuspended and equilibrated at 37 °C in 2 ml of Krebs/HEPES solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl 124, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgSO4 1, CaCl2 2, HEPES 26, glucose 10, pH 7.4. Aliquots of 230 μl of synaptosomes (0.52–0.61 mg of protein) were placed in a reaction tube to which 50 μl of luciferin-luciferase solution (FL-AAM from Sigma dissolved in 5 ml of water, kept at 4 °C) and 10 μl of Krebs/HEPES containing the test drug were added. The mixture was placed in a luminometer (Wallac 1250 from LKB Turku, Finland) and the electrical signal generated by the photomultiplier recorded. After obtaining a stable baseline, the photomultiplier entry was closed, 10 μl of a Krebs/HEPES solution with concentrated KCl (to attain a final concentration of 20 mm) were added, the mixture resuspended, the photomultiplier entry was opened again, and the variation in signal recorded between 15 and 30 s was used to estimate the evoked release of ATP. The calibration curve for ATP was linear between 5 and 1000 pm (see Ref. 1Cunha R.A. Vizi E.S. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2180-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Time course kinetic studies of the extracellular catabolism of adenine nucleotides were performed as described previously (2Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampal synaptosomes were resuspended in 1 ml of Krebs/HEPES solution and aliquots of 100 μl were added to incubation vials with 400 μl of Krebs/HEPES solution, to which AA (30 μm) and/or the protein kinase inhibitor chelerythrine (6 μm) were added, and kept at 37 °C. After 10 min incubation, the initial substrate, i.e. ATP (30 μm) or AMP (10 μm), was added. The kinetic protocols consisted of a 5- or 10-min incubation period with sample collection (50 μl) at 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min for AMP and at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 min for ATP. The zero time was defined as the sample collected immediately after (approximately 2–5 s) addition of the initial substrate. Each collected sample was centrifuged (14,000 × g for 10 s) and the supernatant (40 μl) was ice-stored for HPLC analysis (2Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the 5- or 10-min incubation, the synaptosomes were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 s). The pelleted synaptosomes were homogenized in 200 μl of 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 to determine total lactate dehydrogenase activity and protein content (14Spector T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The remaining bathing solution was used to quantify lactate dehydrogenase activity, an index of cellular disruption (2Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which was always lower than 3% of total lactate dehydrogenase activity in the synaptosomes. The synaptosomes were resuspended in 1 ml of Krebs/HEPES solution and equilibrated at 37 °C. All adenosine transport assays were conducted at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl, containing ∼0.15 mg of protein, basically as described by Gu et al. (15Gu J.G. Kala G. Geiger J.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Transport was initiated by addition of 0.25–2 μm [2-3H]adenosine, which was added at least 10 min after exposure of synaptosomes to tested drugs, and incubations were for 15 s. Transport was terminated by addition of 5 ml of ice-cold inhibitor/stop mixture (100 μmdipyridamole and 1 mm adenosine in Krebs/HEPES solution), followed by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and washing of the reaction tube and filter with 5 ml of ice-cold inhibitor/stop mixture. The filters were then analyzed by scintillation counting for determination of tritium retained by the synaptosomes after addition of 5 ml of scintillation mixture. Adenosine transport was calculated as the difference between total adenosine incorporation into synaptosomes and the nonspecific component of adenosine fixation by synaptosomes for each concentration of [2-3H]adenosine, determined in the presence of 100 μm dipyridamole and 1 mmadenosine. To determine the kinetic values for adenosine transport (K m and V max values), [2-3H]adenosine transport was performed in the presence of 6 concentrations of [2-3H]adenosine ranging from 0.25 to 2 μm. The apparent K m andV max values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis with the Raphson-Newton method using the GraphPad Prism software. One 400-μm hippocampal slice, obtained as described previously (3Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transferred to a 1-ml recording chamber for submerged slices and continuously superfused with gassed Krebs solution, kept at 30 °C, at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Drugs were added to this superfusion solution. Electrophysiological recordings of field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP) were obtained as described previously (3Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation (rectangular pulses of 0.1 ms applied once every 15 s) was delivered through a bipolar concentric electrode placed on the Schaffer fibers, in thestratum radiatum near the CA3/CA1 border. Orthodromically evoked fEPSPs were recorded through an extracellular microelectrode (4m NaCl, 2–5 MΩ resistance) placed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 area. The intensity of the stimulus was adjusted to evoke a fEPSP of 0.7–1 mV without appreciable population spike contamination. Recordings were obtained with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier coupled to a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and averages of 8 consecutive responses were continuously monitored on a personal computer with the LTP 1.01 software (16Anderson W.W. Collingridge G.L. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 665Google Scholar). Responses were quantified as the initial slope of the averaged fEPSPs. Superfusion of a slice with drugs was started after responses were stable for at least 20 min. The release of [3H]acetylcholine was performed as described previously (17Cunha R.A. Milusheva E. Vizi E.S. Ribeiro J.A. Sebastião A.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Almeida T. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat hippocampal slices were loaded with [3H]choline (30 μCi/ml, 0.3 μm) for 30 min, washed, placed in 100-μl Perspex chambers, and superfused with oxygenated Krebs solution containing 10 μmhemicholinium-3 at 30 °C with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The preparations were stimulated twice (S1 and S2) at 6 and 36 min with supramaximal monopolar square-wave pulses with a duration of 3 ms and an amplitude of 40 V, delivered with a frequency of 5 Hz for a period of 2 min (600 pulses), through platinum electrodes. Drugs were added to the superfusion medium 15 min before S2 and remained in the bath up to the end of the experiment. When we evaluated the modification of the effect of a drug by a modifier, this modifier was applied 15 min before sample collection was started and hence was present during S1 and S2. At the end of the release experiments, 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Scintran T) was added to a 500-μl aliquot of each eluent fraction and to 100 μl of the homogenized slices (sonicated in 500 μl of 3m perchloric acid and 2% Triton X-100). Radioactivity was expressed in terms of disintegrations per minute per mg of protein in each chamber (dpm/mg). Protein was quantified according to Spector (14Spector T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The fractional release was expressed in terms of the percentage of total radioactivity present in the tissue at the time of sample collection. The release of tritium evoked by each period of electrical stimulation, i.e. the evoked release (expressed as fractional release), was calculated by integration of the area of the peak upon subtraction of the estimated basal tritium outflow from the total outflow due to electrical stimulation. The evoked release of tritium under these conditions is Ca2+- and tetrodotoxin-sensitive and is mostly constituted by [3H]acetylcholine (17Cunha R.A. Milusheva E. Vizi E.S. Ribeiro J.A. Sebastião A.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Almeida T. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The effect of drugs on the release of tritium was expressed by alterations of the ratio between the evoked release due to the second stimulation period and the evoked release due to the first stimulation period (S2/S1 ratio). For the determination of the energy charge, the synaptosomes were incubated without or with AA, PLA2, or melittin for 30 min, homogenized by sonication, and adenine nucleotides were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (17Cunha R.A. Milusheva E. Vizi E.S. Ribeiro J.A. Sebastião A.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Almeida T. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To evaluate cellular integrity, the synaptosomes were placed in the superfusion chambers and superfused for 30 min with gassed Krebs without or with AA, PLA2, or melittin in a close-circuit manner. Cellular disruption was determined by comparing the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the superfusion medium with that found in the synaptosomes upon their solubilization, by sonication, with 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (2Cunha R.A. Sebastião A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To study the metabolism of AA in hippocampal synaptosomes, [3H]AA (5 μm, 21.8 μCi/ml) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with hippocampal synaptosomes (0.36–0.42 mg protein) in a final volume of 200 μl, in the absence or presence of indomethacin (20 μm) and/or NDGA (50 μm). The samples were then diluted to a concentration of 80% (v/v) ethanol, vortexed, and kept on ice for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the precipitated protein material and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 37 °C. Extraction of lipid material was performed by resuspension in 300 μl of 30% (v/v) methanol, a procedure that yields good recoveries (86 ± 3%,n = 4, using synaptosomes previously boiled for 30 min) of [3H]AA, as previously reported (19Henke D.C. Kouzan S. Eling T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Separation of eicosanoids (100 μl injected) in standards and samples was achieved by an adapted reverse-phase HPLC method (see Ref. 19Henke D.C. Kouzan S. Eling T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a Beckman Gold system equipped with a Lichrospher C-18 (5 μm) column, imposing a sequence of isocratic elutions (flow rate:1.25 ml/min) starting with 55% (v/v) methanol in buffered water (prepared by adding 1 ml of glacial acetic acid to 1 liter of water and adjusting the pH to 5.8 with 1 m NH4OH) for 22 min followed by 100% methanol for 14 min. The retention times of the tested eicosanoids, identified by UV detection at 220 nm, were: PGE2 7.77 ± 0.06 min, PGF2α 10.51 ± 0.09 min, 5-HETE and 12-HETE co-eluting at 24.76 ± 0.09 min, and AA 26.08 ± 0.07 min. The HPLC eluent of the chromatographed lipid extracts of synaptosomes incubated with [3H]AA was collected every minute and analyzed by scintillation counting to monitor the disappearance of tritium from [3H]AA and the appearance of tritium in other eicosanoid peaks. The values are presented as mean ± S.E. To test the significance of the effect of an agonist versuscontrol, a paired Student's t test was used. When making comparisons from a different set of experiments with control, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Dunnett's test.p < 0.05 was considered to represent a significant difference. The stimulation of hippocampal synaptosomes with K+ (20 mm for 2 min) resulted in an increase of tritium (Fig. 1 A, open symbols) and of [3H]adenosine (Fig. 1 B, open symbols) in the superfusion effluent, which represents 1.12 ± 0.03% (n = 12) and 0.164 ± 0.007% (n = 12) of total tritium retained by the synaptosomes, respectively. The addition of AA (30 μm) to the superfusate 9 min before K+ stimulation caused a 28 ± 3% (n = 4) decrease in the basal outflow of tritium (Fig. 1 A) and a 16 ± 5% (n = 4) decrease in the basal outflow of [3H]adenosine (Fig.1 B); in contrast, in the presence of AA (30 μm), the evoked tritium outflow and the evoked [3H]adenosine outflow were enhanced by 69 ± 3% (n = 6) and 57 ± 5% (n = 4), respectively (Fig. 1). AA (30 μm) also enhanced the veratridine-evoked tritium outflow by 62 ± 4% (n= 3, data not shown), which excludes direct effects of AA on K+ channels (20Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) as a possible cause for the AA-induced increase in adenosine evoked release. Under control conditions (i.e. in the absence of added AA), omission of Ca2+ in the superfusate and addition of 100 nm EGTA, caused a 81 ± 8% increase of the basal outflow of tritium and a 72 ± 4% decrease of the K+-evoked outflow of tritium. The effect of the absence of Ca2+ and presence of EGTA (100 nm) on [3H]adenosine outflow was similar to that of tritium release, with a 124 ± 9% increase of the basal outflow and a 76 ± 6% decrease of the K+-evoked outflow of [3H]adenosine (n = 4). This Ca2+ dependence of the evoked outflow of tritium and of [3H]adenosine was also observed in the presence of AA (30 μm), when the absence of Ca2+ and presence of EGTA (100 nm) caused a 82 ± 4% decrease of the K+-evoked tritium outflow and a 86 ± 6% decrease of the K+-evoked [3H]adenosine outflow (n = 3). Thus, in the absence of Ca2+ and presence of 100 nm EGTA, AA (30 μm) did not cause a significant (p > 0.05) increase in K+-evoked [3H]adenosine outflow. AA (3–30 μm) caused a concentration-dependent facilitation of the K+-evoked outflow of both tritium and [3H]adenosine (Fig. 1 C). However, a higher concentration of AA (100 μm) caused a lower facilitation mainly of the evoked outflow of [3H]adenosine but also of tritium (Fig. 1 C). To investigate whether the effect of AA on tritium outflow was influenced by detergent-like effects or oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling caused by AA (e.g. Ref.21Breukel A.I.M. Besselsen E. Lopes da Silva F. Ghijsen W.E.J.M. Brain Res. 1997; 773: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of AA on the energy charge and on the release of lactate dehydrogenase, an intracellular marker, from superfused rat hippocampal synaptosomes. As shown in TableI, AA (30 μm) did not significantly change either the energy charge or the release of lactate dehydrogenase. In contrast, AA (100 μm) decreased the energy charge by 8.8 ± 0.1% (n = 4,p < 0.05) and caused the release of 12 ± 2% (n = 4, p < 0.05) of total lactate dehydrogenase during the 30-min superfusion period (Table I). Thus, as was previously proposed to occur (18Almeida T. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Brain Res. 1999; 826: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Breukel A.I.M. Besselsen E. Lopes da Silva F. Ghijsen W.E.J.M. Brain Res. 1997; 773: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the lower effects of AA (100 μm) on the outflow of tritium and [3H]adenosine might probably be due to a modification of the homeostasis and viability of the synaptosomes.Table ILack of effect of AA (30 μm), of phospholipase A2(PLA2, 2 units/ml) and of melittin (1 μm) and modification by AA (100 μm) of the energy charge and release of lactate dehydrogenase, an intracellular marker, from rat superfused hippocampal synaptosomesEnergy charge% total lactate dehydrogenase releasedCONTROL0.784 ± 0.0024 ± 1AA (30 μm)0.786 ± 0.0014 ± 1AA (100 μm)0.715 ± 0.004 1-ap < 0.05 versus control (i.e. absence of any added drug).12 ± 2 1-ap < 0.05 versus control (i.e. absence of any added drug).PLA2 (2 units/ml)0.785 ± 0.0022 ± 1Melittin (1 μm)0.782 ± 0.0035 ± 2The values are mean ± S.E. of four experiments.1-a p < 0.05 versus control (i.e. absence of any added drug).

Since AA caused virtually identical effects on tritium outflow and [3H]adenosine outflow, the tritium outflow was used as a measure of [3H]adenosine outflow in the remaining experiments. It was also observed that the effect of AA on the K+-evoked tritium outflow were consistent from experiment to experiment, whereas there was a large variation in the effects of AA on the basal tritium outflow, which precluded a systematic investigation of the effect of AA on basal tritium"

Here we show that bullfrog retinal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) exhibits anin vivo circadian rhythm in phosphorylation with a peak at night in a light/dark cycle. The phosphorylation rhythm of MAPK persists in constant darkness with a peak at subjective night, and this self-sustained rhythm is also observed in cultured retinas, indicating its close interaction with the retinal oscillator. The rhythmically phosphorylated MAPK is detected only in a discrete subset of amacrine cells despite ubiquitous distribution of MAPK throughout the retinal layers. Treatment of the cultured retinas with MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 suppresses MAPK phosphorylation during the subjective night, and this pulse perturbation of MEK activity induces a significant phase delay (4–8 h) of the retinal circadian rhythm in MAPK and MEK phosphorylation.

These rhythms can be synchronized (entrained) to environmental time cues such as light or temperature but are sustained under constant environmental conditions in the absence of time cues (1Takahashi J.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 531-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A lot of studies on the Drosophila melanogaster clock system have demonstrated that a transcription/translation-based feedback loop is involved in generating the circadian rhythmicity (2Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 3Young M.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a complex of two transcription factors, dCLOCK and CYCLE (dBMAL1), positively regulates both period (per) andtimeless (tim) transcription through CACGTG E-box elements found in their promoters (4Allada R.

PER and TIM proteins form a heterodimer and translocate to the nucleus where PER/TIM negatively regulate dCLOCK/CYCLE-induced transcription of their own promoters (5Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K.

Thus, these positive and negative elements constitute an autoregulatory feedback loop. In vertebrates, autonomous circadian oscillators are located in several neuronal tissues such as the retina, pineal gland, and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)1 (1Takahashi J.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 531-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Kasal C.A. Menaker M. Science. 1979; 203: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Deguchi T.

Homologs of per, clock, and bmal1 have been identified in vertebrates, and they are expressed in SCN of mammals (reviewed in Refs. 2Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar and 18Reppert S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is now postulated that the molecular framework of the circadian oscillator is conserved from flies to mammals, although each clock component appears to function in a slightly different manner (reviewed in Refs. 19Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1998; 392: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 20Hardin P.E. Glossop N.R.J. Science. 1999; 286: 2460-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to the transcriptional and translational regulation, post-translational modifications of clock gene products play important roles in the clock system. Drosophila PER, TIM, and CLOCK proteins are phosphorylated in a daily/circadian manner (21Edery I. Zwiebel L.J. Dembinska M.E. Rosbash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2260-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22Zeng H. Qian Z. Myers M.P. Rosbash M. Nature. 1996; 380: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 23Lee C. Bae K.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and another clock gene product, DOUBLETIME, closely related to human casein kinase Iε, has been shown to reduce the stability of PER by phosphorylation (24Price J.L.

Also, Drosophila TIM is degraded upon receiving light, probably in a tyrosine kinase- and proteasome-dependent manner (10Myers M.P. Wager-Smith K. Rothenfluh-Hilfiker A. Young M.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1736-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 22Zeng H. Qian Z. Myers M.P. Rosbash M. Nature. 1996; 380: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Naidoo N. Song W. Hunter-Ensor M. Sehgal A. Science. 1999; 285: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although these posttranslational events significantly contribute to the circadian timing mechanism in Drosophila, little is known about the molecular nature of protein kinases, phosphatases, and proteases in vertebrate clock systems. Recently, we have demonstrated circadian phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the chick pineal gland (27Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, circadian-phosphorylated MAPK was localized in follicular pinealocytes (27Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the pineal circadian oscillator is located (28Nakahara K. Murakami N. Nasu T. Kuroda H. Murakami T. Brain Res. 1997; 774: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting an intracellular linkage between the circadian activation of MAPK and the oscillator. This is also true of the mouse SCN (29Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), although the phase of the circadian activation of MAPK in the mouse SCN is opposite to that of pineal MAPK (i.e. daytime-versus nighttime-specific activation; Refs. 27Sanada K.

Here we investigated the MAPK activation cycle and its contribution to the oscillator in the retina, which is another well defined clock-containing tissue of vertebrates. It was clearly demonstrated that bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) retinal MAPK exhibitsin vivo and in vitro circadian rhythm in activation peaked at nighttime, and this rhythmicity was found in a discrete subset of amacrine cells, which could be a candidate for clock location in the retina. Noticeably, the retinal circadian rhythms in MAPK and MAPK kinase (MEK) phosphorylation were phase-delayed by a pulse perturbation of MEK activity, suggesting that the MEK-MAPK pathway plays an important role in maintenance of the circadian time-keeping mechanism basically common to vertebrate clock systems. Adult bullfrogs (R. catesbeiana) were entrained to 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) cycles for 7 days before experiments. The bullfrogs were sacrificed by decapitation, and their retinas were immediately homogenized with 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0 at 4 °C). Then the homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant (80 μl) was mixed with 20 μl of 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample solution followed by boiling for 8 min. All of the manipulations during the dark period were performed under infrared light (>800 nm) with the aid of darkroom goggles (NEC, Tokyo, Japan). Adult bullfrogs were entrained to LD cycles for 7 days, and the retinas were isolated 2–4 h before the end of the light period. Each retina was placed on a Millicell CM membrane (Millipore Corp.) with its photoreceptor layer upward and then cultured under 90% O2/5% CO2 at 21 °C in 2 ml of defined culture medium (30Besharse J.C. Dunis D.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 36: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 100 μm hydroxytryptophan, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μml-ascorbic acid, and amino acid mixture (0.61 mm Arg, 0.17 mm Cys, 1.00 mm Glu, 0.27 mm Gly, 0.17 mm His, 0.33 mmIle, 0.33 mm Leu, 0.41 mm Lys, 0.99 mm Met, 0.17 mm Phe, 0.33 mm Thr, 0.04 mm Trp, 0.17 mm Tyr, and 0.33 mm Val, each at a final concentration). At the end of the light period, the tissues were transferred to constant darkness (DD) and kept in culture. The retinal homogenate was prepared from the cultured retinas as described above. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13% acrylamide for Fig. 1 A or 8.5% acrylamide for the others) were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The blots were blocked in 1% (w/v) skim milk in TBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with a primary antibody in the blocking solution. MAPK was detected by anti-MAPK antibody (sc-154, 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the dually phosphorylated form of MAPK was detected by anti-active MAPK antibody (1:1000; Promega) or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (1:1000; New England Biolabs). MEK was detected by anti-MEK1/2 antibody (1:1000; New England Biolabs), and the dually phosphorylated form of MEK was detected by anti-phospho-MEK1/2 antibody (1:1000; New England Biolabs). The primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.), and the positive signals were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When reprobed, the blots were stripped according to the manufacturer's protocol.Figure 1Circadian rhythm in MAPK phosphorylation in the bullfrog retina. A, the bullfrog retinal homogenate (40 μg of proteins) was immunoblotted with anti-MAPK antibody (lane 1), anti-active MAPK antibody (lane 2), or anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (lane 3). B, the bullfrogs were maintained under LD cycles for 7 days and then transferred to the DD condition. The retinas were isolated at the indicated time of day 8 or 9 in the dark, and equal amounts of proteins (40 μg) of the retinal homogenate were immunoblotted with anti-active MAPK antibody (upper panel) or with anti-MAPK antibody (lower panel). The shaded and black areas at the bottom represent the subjective day and subjective night, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cultured retinas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then the tissues were cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in sodium phosphate buffer, embedded in the OCT mounting medium (Sakura, Japan), frozen by using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Finally, 10-μm-thick sections were cut out from the embedded tissues, mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, and air-dried. The sections on glass slides were pretreated with a blocking solution (10% bovine serum albumin, 1% horse or goat normal serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution at 4 °C for 72 h. After rinsing with TBS, the sections were treated with a secondary antibody for 24 h at 4 °C and again washed with TBS. Then the sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (1:50; New England Biolabs), rabbit anti-MAPK antibody (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antiserum (1:1000; Protos Biotech Corp.), and rabbit anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antiserum (1:1000; Chemicon). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Vector Laboratories) and Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was used for staining of cell nuclei. Images of the sections were viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, TCS-NT). MAPKs are highly conserved serine/threonine kinases. When a bullfrog retinal homogenate (a mixture of those prepared in the midday and midnight) was subjected to an immunoblot analysis, a single band of 41-kDa protein was recognized by anti-MAPK antibody (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This protein was assigned as bullfrog MAPK, because (i) the molecular mass was close to the reported value of Xenopus MAPK (42 kDa; Ref. 31Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Matsuda S. Shiina N. Kosako H. Shiokawa K. Akiyama T. Ohta K. Sakai H. Nature. 1991; 349: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and (ii) this protein band was also recognized by two kinds of antibodies, anti-active MAPK antibody (lane 2) and anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (lane 3), which are specific to MAPK phosphorylated on both threonine and tyrosine residues (31Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Matsuda S. Shiina N. Kosako H. Shiokawa K. Akiyama T. Ohta K. Sakai H. Nature. 1991; 349: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 32Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 33Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.-H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Since MAPK is activated by the dual phosphorylation (32Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), these antibodies are capable of detecting MAPK activation in the bullfrog retina. To investigate a possible involvement of MAPK in the bullfrog retinal clock system, the phosphorylation state of retinal MAPK was estimated in the retinal homogenate prepared at various time points from bullfrogs maintained in DD (Fig. 1 B) and LD (Fig.2 B) conditions. Immunoblot analysis of the retinal homogenate revealed that under the DD condition, MAPK phosphorylation peaked in the mid- to late-subjective night (CT18–24; under the DD condition, CT0 and CT12 refer to the time of lights on and off in the previous LD cycle, respectively), and it became dephosphorylated in the late subjective day (Fig. 1 B,upper panel). The MAPK phosphorylation rhythm is also observed under the LD cycle (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) with a phase similar to that in the DD condition. The levels of MAPK protein were nearly constant throughout the period both in DD and LD conditions (Figs. 1 B and 2 B,lower panels). Clearly, the daily change in MAPK phosphorylation is regulated by a self-sustaining mechanism characteristic of a circadian oscillator. Another feature of the circadian rhythm is its adaptive property (entrainment) of the phase to a shifted daily change in environmental conditions such as LD cycle. To investigate the relationship between the retinal MAPK phosphorylation and the oscillator, we examined how the phosphorylation rhythm responds to the shifted LD cycle. The bullfrogs were maintained for 7 days under LD cycles and then transferred to a reversed LD cycle. The retinal homogenates were prepared at various time points in the day (day 0) before the transfer to the new LD cycle and in days 3 and 8 thereafter (Fig. 2 A). In the original LD cycle (in day 0), MAPK phosphorylation peaked in the mid- to late-night (ZT20–24; ZT0 is lights on, and ZT12 is lights off) and declined in the daytime (Fig.2 B, upper panel). At the day 3 in the new LD cycle, the phosphorylation level had a peak at the LD transition (ZT12–18; Fig. 2 C, upper panel), and at day 8, the phosphorylation became evident only in the nighttime (Fig.2 D, upper panel). This fluctuation profile at day 8 is very similar to that observed at day 0, indicating a complete phase shift of phosphorylation rhythm within a week. The gradual entrainment of the phosphorylation rhythm to the shifted LD cycle resembles that of mouse per1 expression rhythm observed in the mouse SCN (34Sun Z.S. Albrecht U. Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and this suggests a close linkage between the circadian oscillator and the phosphorylation rhythm of retinal MAPK. In amphibians, circadian oscillators are located not only in the retina but also in the hypothalamus. For example, the circadian locomotor activity rhythm of Xenopus laevis is lost by lesion of the hypothalamus including the SCN (35Harada Y. Goto M. Ebihara S. Fujisawa H. Kegasawa K. Oishi T. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1998; 29: 30-48Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Also, the neural connections of the hypothalamus to the retina have been reported neuroanatomically inRana esculenta (36Kemali M. De Santis A. Exp. Brain Res. 1983; 53: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the contribution of the retinal circadian system to the phosphorylation rhythm of retinal MAPK, the state of MAPK phosphorylation was characterized in the isolated bullfrog retinas. As shown in Fig.3 A (upper panel), MAPK phosphorylation in the cultured retina showed a daily rhythm even under the DD condition with a peak in the early subjective night (CT12–16), whereas MAPK protein levels were nearly constant throughout the period (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). The rhythmicity of MAPK phosphorylation persisted for at least 2 cycles (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the molecular cycle is linked to the endogenous circadian clock system in the retina. The peak time of the phosphorylation level is advanced by 4–6 h relative to that observed in in vivo experiments under the DD condition (Fig.1 B). Such a difference in phase between in vivoand in vitro experiments has often been observed in studies on various clock systems (12Kasal C.A. Menaker M. Science. 1979; 203: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Deguchi T. Science. 1979; 203: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Strähle U.

J. 1996; 319: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and it has been attributed to the effects of tissue dissection and/or culture. The autonomous rhythm of MAPK phosphorylation in the cultured retina suggests a role of MAPK acting as an output of the clock system or alternatively as a part of the oscillation mechanism itself. To investigate the latter possibility, we examined whether a transient inhibition of retinal MAPK activity affects the circadian clock system. For this purpose, we used PD98059 (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar, 39Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar), a specific and reversible inhibitor of MEK responsible for dual phosphorylation and activation of MAPK (40Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3174) Google Scholar). The bullfrog retinas were treated with 8 or 80 μm PD98059 from ZT12 (on day 1) and transferred to the DD condition, and the level of MAPK phosphorylation was investigated during the drug treatment in the dark (on day 2). The time-of-day-specific phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig.4 A and open circles in Fig. 4 D) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the drug, and 80 μm PD98059 almost completely suppressed the phosphorylation peak (Fig. 4 C and closed squares in Fig. 4 D). During the drug treatment, the levels of MAPK protein showed no significant change (Fig. 4,A–C, lower panels). These results demonstrate that MEK is an upstream kinase responsible for circadian phosphorylation of retinal MAPK and coincide nicely with the observation of the circadian oscillation in the level of MEK phosphorylation (see below and Fig.5 B). We then investigated the temporal change in MAPK phosphorylation under the DD condition after the treatment of the cultured retinas with 80 μm PD98059 for 12 h (at ZT10–22). The activities of MAPK and MEK seemed to be fully recovered after the removal of PD98059, because the maximal phosphorylation levels of MAPK and MEK in the drug-treated experiment were similar to those in a control one (Fig. 5). However, the 12-h treatment with PD98059 in the first day of culture induced a delay (4–8 h) of the peak time in the phosphorylation rhythm in the following days (Fig. 5 A, third panel) as compared with that in a control experiment (Fig. 5 A, first panel). In the parallel experiment, we also examined the MEK phosphorylation level representing the MEK kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 B, we observed a similar phase delay of MEK phosphorylation rhythm by the pretreatment of PD98059. These results indicate that the retinal circadian clock still remains oscillating even after the transient loss of MEK activation, which vice versa gave a strong effect on the phase of the rhythm. The MEK-MAPK pathway seems to play a pivotal role in circadian time keeping mechanism in the retinal clock. To determine the site of circadian-phosphorylated MAPK in the retina, thin sections were prepared from the cultured retinas at various time points under the DD condition, and they were subjected to immunostaining. Immunoreactivity to MAPK was widespread throughout the retinal layers at any time within a day (Fig.6, B and F). On the other hand, no significant immunoreactivity to phosphorylated MAPK was observed in the retinal section prepared at CT24 (Fig. 6 E), while at CT12 a discrete subset of amacrine cells showed strong positive signals at their cell bodies and moderate signals at their processes in the inner plexiform layer (Fig. 6 A). In a more magnified view (Fig. 6, I–K), phosphorylated MAPK is located mainly in the cytosol (green) and diffusely in the nucleus (yellow) at CT 12. The peak time in signal intensity at the cell bodies was consistent with that observed in the immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3), indicating that, despite ubiquitous distribution of MAPK in the retina, the circadian phosphorylation and activation of retinal MAPK occur only in a subset of amacrine cells. Retinal amacrine cells have been classified into a variety of subtypes, which are characterized by diverged neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, dopamine, and acetylcholine (42Kolb H. Eye. 1997; 11: 904-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To investigate the type of amacrine cells showing circadian phosphorylation of MAPK, the retinal sections were immunostained by antibodies to two markers. One is tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an enzyme responsible for dopamine synthesis (43Osborne N.N. Patel S. Vigny A. Histochemistry. 1984; 80: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the other is glutamic acid decarboxylase for synthesis of GABA (44Lam D.M.K. Su Y.Y.T. Swain L. Marc R.E. Brandon C. Wu J.-Y. Nature. 1979; 278: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the double staining analysis, the TH antiserum immunostained some amacrine cells (Fig.6 M), but the phospho-MAPK- and TH-immunoreactive cells were mutually exclusive (Fig. 6 N). Similarly, the glutamic acid decarboxylase antiserum labeled a subset of amacrine cells and horizontal cells (Fig. 6 Q), but they are not identical to the phospho-MAPK-immunoreactive amacrine cells (Fig. 6 R). These results indicate that the phospho-MAPK-immunoreactive amacrine cells represent nondopaminergic and non-GABAergic neurons. We have previously demonstrated circadian activation of MAPK in the chick pineal gland (27Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and others showed an overt rhythm of MAPK phosphorylation in the mouse SCN (29Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrating rhythmic phosphorylation of MAPK in the bullfrog retina, together with those in the two defined pacemaker structures, avian pineal gland and mammalian SCN, strongly suggests that phosphorylation rhythm of MAPK is conserved among various animal species and among clock-containing tissues. The phosphorylation rhythms of MEK and MAPK persisted in vitro under the DD condition (Figs. 3 and 5), and hence they seem to represent outputs of the retinal circadian oscillator. On the other hand, the pulse perturbation of the MEK activity induced the phase shift of the rhythm (Fig. 5), implying that the MEK-MAPK pathway affects the oscillator. Thus, the MEK-MAPK pathway acts as if it were both an input and output of the retinal oscillator. One of the possible models postulates these separate roles of the MEK-MAPK pathway, but this requires careful consideration of the subcellular distribution of circadian-activated MAPK (see below). A more straightforward model is that circadian-activated MAPK feeds back the circadian signal to the oscillator, forming a secondary loop. This would explain why the MEK-MAPK pathway and the circadian oscillator mutually affect each other. We previously demonstrated a marked phase shift of the circadian rhythm induced by a transient suppression of MEK activity in the chick pineal gland (27Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the MEK-MAPK pathway is likely to play an important role in the circadian time-keeping mechanism common to the vertebrate clock systems, although a physiological significance of circadian activation of MAPK in the mammalian SCN remains to be elucidated (29Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation rhythm of MAPK seems to reflect an overall oscillation of the Raf-MEK-MAPK, 2Y. Hayashi, K. Sanada, and Y. Fukada, manuscript in preparation. but we cannot exclude a formal possibility that another MEK target distinct from MAPK is responsible for the phase shift induced by the PD98059 treatment (Fig. 5). An alternative role of MAPK in the vertebrate clock system could be that in synchronization among nearby clock cells via extracellular signals. For instance, melatonin and dopamine are released from retinal cells in a circadian manner (14Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 45Wirz-Justice A. Da Prada M. Reme C.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1984; 45: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 46Adachi A. Nogi T. Ebihara S. Brain Res. 1998; 792: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and these seem to contribute to coupling of individual oscillators distributed among clock cells (46Adachi A. Nogi T. Ebihara S. Brain Res. 1998; 792: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 47Liu C. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Shearman L.P. Pieschl R.L. Gribkoff V.K. Reppert S.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). MAPK might be regulated by these transmitters mediating synchronization of closely located cellular oscillators. In this case, MAPK is expected to respond quickly to the change in environmental conditions. In the present study, we observed a rather slow response of MAPK phosphorylation to the change in LD cycle condition (Fig. 2), suggesting a tighter association of MAPK with the central oscillator in the retina. In the chick pineal gland, MAPK phosphorylation rhythm is observed in follicular pinealocytes (27Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the circadian oscillator is located (28Nakahara K. Murakami N. Nasu T. Kuroda H. Murakami T. Brain Res. 1997; 774: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Given its critical role in the circadian time-keeping mechanism (Fig. 5), circadian-activated MAPK could be a potential marker for detecting clock cells. In the Xenopus and mouse retinas, it has been demonstrated that the photoreceptor cells retain or constitute the circadian clock system regulating the melatonin rhythm in culture (48Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 573-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 49Tosini G. Menaker M. Brain Res. 1998; 789: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse per1, clock, andbmal1 are most strongly expressed in the inner nuclear layer of the mouse retina (50Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar), and newly identified clock genes mousecry1 and cry2 (51van der Horst G.T.J. Muijtjens M. Kobayashi K. Takano R. Kanno S. Takao M. de Wit J. Verkerk A. Eker A.P.M. van Leenen D. Buijs R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Yasui A.

Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) are expressed in the inner nuclear layer but not in the photoreceptor layer (53Miyamoto Y. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6097-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Thus, the identity of clock cells in the vertebrate retina is still controversial. The present study demonstrating the site-specific and time-of-day-specific activation of retinal MAPK (Fig. 6, Aand E) is consistent with the notion that the amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer are the potential clock cells. This does not exclude a possibility that the bullfrog photoreceptor cells also retain the circadian oscillator with a lower amplitude in MAPK phosphorylation cycle or with a slightly different mechanism regarding the contribution of MAPK. In the circadian clock system within the amacrine cells, MAPK may be linked with the endogenous oscillator at the cell bodies in one hand, whereas MAPK at their plexus (see Fig. 6 A) may respond to the extracellular signals possibly for the entrainment of the clock or for synchronization among clock cells. It is possible that rhythmically activated MAPK could constitute a secondary loop that is interconnected with the core feedback loop at intracellular and/or intercellular levels. These loops could regulate and stabilize each other, and they may provide a basis for general properties of the circadian clock system such as period length (54Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Liu Y. Crosthwaite S.K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A subset of amacrine cells synthesize dopamine (55Witkovsky P. Schütte M. Vis. Neurosci. 1991; 7: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 56Djamgoz M.B.A. Wagner H.-J. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 20: 139-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and release it rhythmically (45Wirz-Justice A. Da Prada M. Reme C.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1984; 45: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 46Adachi A. Nogi T. Ebihara S. Brain Res. 1998; 792: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, however, that the circadian activation of MAPK is linked intracellularly to the rhythmic release of dopamine, because phospho-MAPK- and TH-immunoreactive cells are not identical (Fig. 6 N). On the other hand, about half of the amacrine cells in the human retina contain GABA (57Crooks J. Kolb H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 315: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and GABA seems to be involved in the regulation of dopamine synthesis/release, which indirectly affects retinal melatonin synthesis (58Kazula A. Nowak J.Z. Iuvone P.M. Vis. Neurosci. 1993; 10: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 59Boatright J.H. Rubim N.M. Iuvone P.M. Vis.

This led to speculation that circadian-activated MAPK is located at GABAergic amacrine cells, but this was not the case (Fig. 6 R). It is intriguing as well to see a possible colocalization of known clock gene products within the amacrine cells, but our ongoing efforts have been unsuccessful due to no cross-reactivity of commercially available antibodies to clock components of this animal species. The immunoreactivity to circadian-phosphorylated MAPK is localized both in the nucleus and cytosol of the immunopositive amacrine cells (Fig.6 K), suggesting that circadian-activated MAPK phosphorylates nuclear and/or cytosolic proteins as targets. DrosophilaPER, TIM, and CLOCK proteins are phosphorylated in a daily/circadian manner (21Edery I. Zwiebel L.J. Dembinska M.E. Rosbash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2260-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22Zeng H. Qian Z. Myers M.P. Rosbash M. Nature. 1996; 380: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 23Lee C. Bae K.

MAPK might regulate biochemical activities and/or stabilities of these clock proteins, through phosphorylation by itself or via MAPK-activated protein kinases such as p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. Another possible target downstream of MAPK is Ca2+/cAMP-response element-binding protein. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mammalian SCN and Drosophilaexhibit circadian rhythms in Ca2+/cAMP-response element-mediated gene expression (61Belvin M.P. Zhou H. Yin J.C.P.

Through characterizing specifically designed site-specific mutants of GPRTase, we identified essential moieties in the active site for substrate binding. Mutating the unusual Tyr-127 of GPRTase to the highly conserved Ile results in 6-fold lower K mfor guanine. A L186F mutation in GPRTase increased the affinity toward guanine by 3.3-fold, whereas the corresponding human HGPRTase mutant L192F showed a 33-fold increase in K m for guanine. A double mutant (Y127I/K152R) of GPRTase retained the improved binding of guanine and also enabled the enzyme to utilize hypoxanthine as a substrate with a K m of 54 ± 15.5 μm. A triple mutant (Y127I/K152R/L186F) resulted in further increased binding affinity with both guanine and hypoxanthine with the latter showing a lowered K m of 29.8 ± 4.1 μm. Dissociation constants measured by fluorescence quenching showed 6-fold tighter binding of GMP with the triple mutant compared with wild type. Thus, by increasing the binding affinity of 6-oxopurine, we were able to convert the GPRTase to a HGPRTase.

Parasitology. 1997; 114 suppl.: S31-S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in general lack the ability to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo. Purine PRTases catalyze the Mg2+-dependent synthesis of purine nucleotides by conjugating purine bases such as adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine with the phosphoribosyl group of α-d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) by an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism (3Yuan L.

Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate parallel pathways providing the major means of synthesizing AMP and GMP are catalyzed by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (GPRTase), respectively, constituting the primary routes of purine salvage in this organism (15Wang C.C. Aldritt S. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lack of interconversion between AMP and GMP has rendered either of the two purine salvage enzymes potential targets for anti-giardiasis chemotherapy (1Wang C.C. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Wang C.C. Aldritt S. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). G. lamblia GPRTase shows little sequence homology with human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and other known purine PRTases (16Sommer J.M. Ma H. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It converts only guanine to its corresponding nucleotide with an unusually high K mof 16.4 ± 1.8 μm and a very highk cat of 76.7 ± 2.5 s−1 compared with those of other known purine PRTase-catalyzed reactions (5Page J.P. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It exhibits a very low catalytic activity with hypoxanthine as substrate (K m >200 μm) and has no apparent binding with xanthine at all. It is the only specific GPRTase, as far as we are aware, that has been thoroughly identified thus far. The crystal structure of G. lamblia GPRTase has recently been solved at a 1.75-Å resolution (12Shi W. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C.

Although primary interactions between the purine substrate and the amino acid residues at the active site are highly conserved among all the purine PRTases with known crystal structures (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Shi W. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Cahill S.M. Girvin M.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14485-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), minor structural differences in the hood region have been noted between the GPRTase and human HGPRTase (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). InGiardia GPRTase, the backbone carbonyls of Asp-181 and Asp-187 interact with the exocyclic N2 of guanine, with estimated distances of 2.7 and 3.1 Å, respectively (12Shi W. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purine ring is stacked between two aromatic residues, Trp-180 and Tyr-127. Again, the hydrophobic ring stacked on top of the purine ring has been well conserved among all the PRTases. A similar Trp residue is present inToxoplasma gondii HGXPRTase (10Schumacher M.A. Carter D. Ross D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas a Tyr residue is present at the corresponding position in Tritrichomonas foetus HGXPRTase (13Somoza J.R. Chin M.S. Focia P.J. Wang C.C. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7032-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and a Phe residue in human HGPRTase (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The presence of Tyr-127 in the GPRTase is, however, highly unusual, because a well conserved Ile or Leu residue has been identified at the corresponding position among all the other PRTases (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It appears from the three-dimensional structure of GPRTase (see Fig. 1 A) that Tyr-127 could cause extra steric hindrance to purine binding compared with the corresponding Ile-135 in human HGPRTase (Fig.1 B). Another well conserved residue in the purine-binding pocket among type I purine PRTases is the Leu-192 in human HGPRTase showing a close nonpolar association with the C2 end of bound purine (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This particular interaction is apparently so specific that a simple L192I mutation in the human enzyme resulted in a 16-fold higher apparentK m for guanine (23Lee C.C. Craig III, S.P. Eakin A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3491-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is not known if a similarly specific interaction exists between the bound purine and the corresponding residue Leu-186 in Giardia GPRTase, or if the relatively high K m for guanine in the GPRTase-catalyzed reaction could be attributed to a lack of such specific association. The conserved Lys residue, which interacts with the exocyclic O6 of bound purine through hydrogen bonding in all known structures of purine PRTases, is also present in Giardia GPRTase as Lys-152 (Fig.1 A). However, although the ε-NH2 group of Lys residue in human HGPRTase (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), T. foetus HGXPRTase (13Somoza J.R. Chin M.S. Focia P.J. Wang C.C. Fletterick R.J.

We reasoned that this apparently much weaker bonding between the O6 of purine and Lys-152 may have provided the basis why 6-oxopurines other than guanine cannot be substrates for the GPRTase-catalyzed reaction. Guanine binding to GPRTase is apparently dependent primarily on the interactions of backbone carbonyls of Asp-181 and Asp-187 with the exocyclic N2 of guanine (12Shi W. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These intriguing structural features have led us to designing, generating, and characterizing site-specific mutants of GPRTase and comparing them with the corresponding mutants of human HGPRTase for elucidating the roles of individual residues in the purine binding region that determine purine specificity. In a final triple mutant (Y127I/K152R/L186F) of the GPRTase, both guanine and hypoxanthine can be used as substrates, indicating a successful general increase in 6-oxopurine binding affinity in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. All the chemicals used in present studies, including hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine, adenine, IMP, GMP, XMP, AMP, PPi, and the tetrasodium salt of PRPP, were purchased from Sigma and are of the highest purity available. Xanthine oxidase (1 unit/mg of protein) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and guanase (0.1 unit/mg of protein) was from Sigma. Recombinant G. lambliaGPRTase, cloned in a pBAce plasmid and expressed in transfectedEscherichia coli Sφ606 (Δgpt-pro-lac, thi, hpt, Rec A −), was purified to homogeneity as described previously (16Sommer J.M. Ma H. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme samples were stored at −80 °C with no detectable loss of activity after 4 months. The recombinant human HGPRTase was purified from E. coli Sφ606, transformed with pBAcprt expression vector, by a previously described procedure (18Kannaaneh J. Craig III, S.P. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Kinetic data of enzyme-catalyzed reactions were collected using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The formation of IMP and GMP were followed spectrophotometrically at 245 and 257.5 nm, respectively. All measurements were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 12 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C (5Page J.P. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the changes in extinction coefficients for formation of IMP from hypoxanthine and GMP from guanine were 1770 and 6000m−1 cm−1, respectively (19Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final volume of assay mixture, containing various amounts of substrates, was 0.5 ml. All data points were completed in triplicate, and the average values were reported. Initial rate data were fitted into Equation 1for a sequential mechanism described by Cleland (19Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using kinetic software from Bio-Metallics, Inc. (K·CAT) and IntelliKinetics (KinetAssyst II). Kinetic constants were calculated using a weighted linear regression. Nomenclatures are that of Cleland (19Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar):v, initial velocity; V max, maximum velocity; A, concentration of substrate A; B, concentration of substrate B; S, substrate concentration;K m, apparent Michaelis constant; I, inhibitor concentration. v=Vmax(A)(B)/[KiaKb+Ka(B)+Kb(A)+(A)(B)]Equation 1 The dissociation constants of GMP for binding to wild type and mutant GPRTases were determined by following the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-180 in the enzyme protein. Fluorescence was measured using a LS 50B fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation wavelength used was 297 nm, and the emission was monitored from 300 to 400 nm. Fluorescence intensity was measured at different ligand concentrations, and the fractional saturation (F) was calculated at each ligand concentration. The dissociation constant was obtained using Equation 2. F=Fm[L]/Kd+[L]Equation 2 F m is the factor allowing for maximum saturation. Site-directed mutagenesis ofG. lamblia GPRTase and human HGPRTase genes were performed using the Quikchange™ kit from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers were designed and synthesized to generate specific mutants. Following the polymerase chain reaction, mutant plasmid was transformed into E. coli Sφ606. Plasmid DNA isolated from the transformants were sequenced for verification, and the recombinant mutant protein was then purified from the transformed E. coli lysate using the same procedure as for the wild-type enzyme purification (16Sommer J.M. Ma H. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Kannaaneh J. Craig III, S.P. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The stability of each mutant enzyme activity was tested in repeated assays. There was no detectable difference found between the wild type and the mutants. Wild-type and specific site-directed mutant expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain Sφ609 that has the de novo synthesis enzymes and HPRTase and GPRTase-encoding genes mutated or deleted (ara, Δpro-gpt-lac, thi,hpt, pup, purH, J,strA) (20Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cell colonies, grown on LB plates with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, were picked and inoculated into LB medium containing both of the antibiotics. A 1% inoculum of the overnight culture was used for growing various Sφ609 transformants in the synthetic low phosphate induction medium (21Craig III, S.P. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the presence of either 0.2 mm guanine or 0.2 mmhypoxanthine. Growth after 16 h was monitored by light absorbance at 600 nm. The crystal structure of the active site in G. lambliaGPRTase bound to immucillin G phosphate, Mg2+, and PPi (Fig. 1 A) shows several apparent distinctions from, as well as some similarities with, the human HGPRTase active site complexed with GMP and Mg2+(Fig. 1 B). Tyr-127, stacked under guanine in GPRTase, appears to be oriented at a perpendicular angle with respect to the bound purine ring and may not accommodate guanine binding as well as the corresponding Ile-135 in the human enzyme. Leu-186 in GPRTase interacts with the C2 end of the bound guanine moiety similarly to Leu-192 in human HGPRTase. The distance between Lys-152 and the exocyclic O6 of bound guanine in GPRTase is much too far compared with the distance between Lys-165 and guanine O6 in human HGPRTase. These residues in GPRTase and the Leu-192 residue in the human enzyme were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis for structure-function analysis and comparison. Asp-187 in GPRTase and Asp-193 in human HGPRTase are positioned in apparently equal hydrogen bonding interactions with the exocyclic N2 of guanine. They are presumably contributing equally to guanine binding in these two active sites and were thus not included for mutational analysis in the present investigation. Sequence alignments among different purine PRTases show a highly conserved domain, commonly known as the PRTase fingerprint domain (Fig. 2). In this conserved sequence, GPRTase from G. lamblia has a Tyr at position 127, whereas all the other purine PRTases have an Ile at the corresponding position. In the three-dimensional structure of GPRTase, the Tyr-127 residue appears to stack below the guanine ring with its phenolic hydroxyl group placed between the purine exocyclic O6 and Lys-152 (Fig. 1 A). A Y127I mutant was generated, purified and characterized. The K m value for guanine was obtained from the individual K m(app) values obtained at various PRPP concentrations by extrapolating to the infinite concentration of PRPP. The K m for guanine in this mutant enzyme-catalyzed reaction was determined to be 2.8 ± 0.2 μm and the k cat for GMP synthesis was 4.8 ± 0.1 s−1. These values contrast an unusually high K m of 16.4 ± 1.8 μm and k cat of 76.7 ± 2.5 s−1 for the wild-type enzyme. In fact, the kinetic constants of GPRTase Y127I mutant are more in line with those of the other purine PRTases, which universally have Ile at the corresponding position (Table I). The Ile residue allows for improved binding of guanine, probably by replacing the bulky phenyl group of Tyr, which apparently hampers proper positioning of the purine base in the binding pocket. However, the mutation also decreases the k cat value by 16-fold, suggesting a reduced release of GMP from the active site which is most likely the rate-limiting step of the enzyme-catalyzed forward reaction (4Xu Y. Eads J. Sacchettini J.C. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3700-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The net result from this mutation thus demonstrates little change in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m). In T. foetus HGXPRTase, the conserved Ile-104 was also found to be involved in purine binding (22Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16612-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), where it was observed that the I104G mutant has a 6.5-fold decreased binding affinity to guanine.Table IComparison of kinetic constants of the GPRTase reaction of various PRTasesSourceK m for guaninek catReferenceμms −1G. lamblia16.476.7Pageet al.

Binding of GMP to the enzyme induced quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-180 (Fig.3), which is stacked on top of the bound guanine moiety (Fig. 1 A). The dissociation constants, obtained by titration, were determined to be 36.7 ± 2.1 μm for the wild type enzyme, whereas for the Y127I mutant it was 8.0 ± 0.7 μm. This 4–5-fold increased binding affinity of GMP to the mutant enzyme is probably responsible for the lowered k cat of the Y127I mutant catalyzed reaction. In the enzyme-catalyzed forward reaction, the release of GMP as the rate-limiting step has been proposed earlier in the case of human HGPRTase (4Xu Y. Eads J. Sacchettini J.C. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3700-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and T. foetusHGXPRTase-catalyzed reactions (22Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16612-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The significantly higherk cat value of wild type G. lambliaGPRTase-catalyzed forward reaction not only reflects a facilitated release of GMP, but also suggests a primary in vivo function of the enzyme for synthesis of guanine nucleotides inGiardia. Leu-186, as seen in the active site of GPRTase (Fig. 1 A), provides some apparent nonpolar interactions with the C2 end of bound guanine moiety. This particular amino acid residue is well conserved among all the purine PRTases with varied purine base specificity (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7032-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutants of Leu-186 inG. lamblia GPRTase were prepared and purified as described and characterized in terms of the kinetics of catalyzed reactions. TheK m values for guanine and thek cat values for catalysis in the forward reaction were determined. The kinetic constants listed in TableII indicate that theK m values for guanine for the L186I and the L186V-catalyzed reactions were 26- and 35-fold higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, respectively, resulting in significantly reduced catalytic efficiencies. Thus, slight changes in the side chain length and orientation of Leu-186 seem to have an overwhelmingly negative effect on the affinity of binding to guanine. A drastic shortening of the side chain also appears to have a deleterious effect on guanine binding, as observed in the 22-fold increase of K mfor guanine in the L186A mutant-catalyzed reaction. There was, however, relatively little change in the K m for guanine when Leu-186 was replaced with Thr. The L186T mutant has aK m of 18.9 ± 1.9 μm as compared with the K m of 16.4 ± 1.8 μm for the wild-type, whereas there is a mere 5-fold increase in theK m for guanine for the L186S mutant in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. Thus, a side chain with a hydroxyl group seems to offset the significant increase in K m for guanine observed with other minor changes in the hydrophobic side chain of Leu-186. This discrepancy could be explained by a probable hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Thr or Ser and the exocyclic N2 and heterocyclic N3 of guanine, which would be stronger in the case of Thr compared with Ser at that particular position. Another interesting finding was that the k cat of L186T mutant-catalyzed reaction is only slightly lower than that of the wild type enzyme (43.0 ± 3.6 s−1), thus suggesting a similar K m for GMP as that for the wild type enzyme.Table IIKinetics of Leu-186 mutants of GPRTase of G. lambliaEnzymeK mk catk cat/K mμms −1s −1 · μm −1Wild type16.4 ± 1.876.7 ± 2.54.67L186I574.2 ± 74.96.5 ± 1.50.011L186V424.9 ± 127.24.3 ± 1.30.010L186T18.9 ± 1.943.0 ± 3.62.27L186S82.7 ± 13.311.9 ± 0.210.14L186A367.8 ± 95.411.6 ± 2.70.032L186F4.9 ± 0.310.7 ± 0.82.18 Open table in a new tab Another interesting observation was the K m of 4.9 ± 0.3 μm for guanine in the L186F catalyzed reaction. Considering the drastic decreases in the binding affinity observed even with the slightest changes in the side chain length of Leu-186, the 3-fold increase in binding affinity through a bulky phenyl group substitution in the L186F mutant represents a real surprise. It may reflect the ability of the purine-binding site in GPRTase to accommodate a very large hydrophobic group in assisting purine binding through enhanced hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, in the structure of T. foetus HGXPRTase (13Somoza J.R. Chin M.S. Focia P.J. Wang C.C. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7032-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), there is a Phe-162 at the corresponding site in the purine binding pocket. When Phe-162 was mutated to Leu, neither the specificity nor the affinity of purine base binding changed in the mutant enzyme (22Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16612-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as compared with the wild type enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies of these mutants as per theirk cat/K m ratios show significant drops with the L186I, L186V, and L186A mutants in comparison to the wild-type catalyzed reaction, whereas there is negligible change in the L186T and the L186F mutants. With the increased binding affinity to guanine, the relatively unchanged catalytic efficiency of L186F can be attributed to the loweredk cat, which may reflect less efficient release of the reaction product GMP. All the mutants listed in Table II were tested for their ability to accept hypoxanthine and xanthine as substrates, but none of them showed any improvement over the wild-type enzyme in terms of broadened purine substrate specificity (results not shown). Leu-186 is thus apparently not involved in the specificity determination of purine base binding. In human HGPRTase, Leu-192 occupies the corresponding position in the purine binding pocket (7Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as compared with Leu-186 in G. lamblia GPRTase. Lee et al. (23Lee C.C. Craig III, S.P. Eakin A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3491-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) characterized a L192T and a L192I mutant of the human HGPRTase and showed its influence on purine binding in terms of the apparentK m values. There was apparently little change in the L192T mutant from the wild type, whereas the apparentK m for guanine in L192I-catalyzed reaction had an increase of about 16-fold, which is very much in agreement with our results from the L186I mutant of GPRTase. In order to characterize and compare Leu-192 in human enzyme more thoroughly with the Leu-186 in GPRTase, mutants of L192 in human HGPRTase were prepared and purified and their kinetic constants determined. As shown in TableIII, the L192V, L192S, and L192T mutants show negligible changes in the Km values for guanine, whereas their catalytic efficiencies show drastic decreases over the wild-type enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These human enzyme mutants appear to behave similarly to the corresponding GPRTase mutants, except for the GPRTase L186T mutant, which had a wild-typek cat/K m ratio. An even more contrasting observation was made on the K m for guanine between human L192F mutant and GPRTase L186F mutant. TheK m for guanine was determined to be 122.8 ± 25.6 μm for the L192F mutant, compared with 3.6 ± 0.5 μm for the wild type enzyme, representing a 35-fold increase, whereas the catalytic efficiency decreased also by 160-fold. This is the opposite from what we observed in the GPRTase L186F mutant where the K m for guanine is reduced by 3-fold from 16.4 ± 1.8 μm to 4.9 ± 0.3 μm(see Table II), and there is little change in thek cat/K m ratio. Thus, the human enzyme with Phe at position 192 appears to have a negative effect on purine binding, whereas the parasite enzyme can accommodate the large Phe side chain and allow for better hydrophobic interaction with the purine base.Table IIIKinetics of Leu-192 mutants of human HGPRTaseK mk catk cat/K mμms −1s −1 · μm −1Wild type3.6 ± 0.59.3 ± 0.42.58L192V7.1 ± 1.20.3 ± 0.020.042L192S9.5 ± 1.10.02 ± 0.0090.002L192T8.3 ± 3.50.7 ± 0.20.084L192F122.8 ± 25.62.0 ± 0.30.016 Open table in a new tab In the crystal structure of GPRTase, Lys-152 was shown to interact with exocyclic O6 over a long distance of 6.3 Å through two ordered water molecules, which would apparently constitute a rather weak interaction (12Shi W. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When this Lys residue was mutated to Arg in the K152R mutant to shorten this apparent distance (Table IV), there appeared to be no major change in the K m for guanine or thek cat value. Hypoxanthine remained unrecognized as a substrate by the L152R mutant, suggesting that neither the increased side chain length nor the guanidino group of Arg enhanced significantly the binding of 6-oxopurine through interaction with the exocyclic O6.Table IVKinetics of various mutants of GPRTase from G. lambliaK mk catk cat/K mμms −1μm −1 · s −1GPRTase activity Wild type16.4 ± 1.876.7 ± 2.54.7 Y127I2.8 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.11.7 K152R23.3 ± 3.463.5 ± 5.52.7 Y127I/K152R2.7 ± 0.38.8 ± 0.43.3 Y127I/L186F2.8 ± 0.337.2 ± 4.313.3 Y127I/K152R/L186F2.7 ± 0.354.6 ± 4.820.2K mk catk cat/K mμms −1μm −1 · s −1HPRTase activity Wild type>200 Y127I>200 K152R>200 Y127I/K152R54.5 ± 15.54.4 ± 0.70.08 Y127I/L186F>200 Y127I/K152R/L186F29.8 ± 4.18.0 ± 0.60.27 Open table in a new tab In T. foetus HGXPRTase, it was shown that the conserved Lys-134, whose ε-amino group is within 3 Å of the O6 of 6-oxopurine, is the primary determinant in conferring the specificity of the enzyme toward all three 6-oxopurines: guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Mutating this Lys to either Ala or Ser in T. foetusHGXPRTase increased the K m for guanine, while allowing adenine to be accepted as a substrate with an estimatedK m in the range of 34–54 μm (22Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16612-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).G. lamblia GPRTase shows no recognition of adenine, hypoxanthine, or xanthine as substrate (5Page J.P. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With the poor binding to the exocyclic O6 by Lys-152, the primary binding sites in GPRTase active site that interact with the purine moiety appear to be Leu-186 with purine C2 and the main-chain carbonyls of Asp-181 and Asp-187 with the exocyclic N2 in guanine via hydrogen bonding. It explains why only guanine is used as substrate. It also suggests that by increasing binding affinity to purine other than interacting with the exocyclic N2 may broaden the substrate specificity beyond guanine. Furthermore, as can be seen in the crystal structure of GPRTase (Fig.1 A), the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr-127 is placed between the ε-amino group of Lys-152 and the purine O6. It probably forms a deterrent to the interaction between them and thus further weakens the power of Lys-152 in dictating 6-oxopurine as substrate. Although the Y127I mutant showed no improvement over the wild type in its binding with hypoxanthine, it nevertheless increases the affinity of guanine binding by 6-fold (Table IV). To verify whether Arg-152 would further strengthen purine binding by the Y127I mutant through a potentially stronger hydrogen bonding with exocyclic O6, a double mutant Y127I/K152R of GPRTase was prepared, purified, and characterized. TheK m for guanine was not further lowered from that of the Y127I mutant and was determined to be 2.7 ± 0.3 μm (Table IV). The k cat value for the forward reaction remained also relatively unchanged from that by the Y127I mutant and was found to be 8.8 ± 0.4 s−1. The dissociation constant for GMP was determined to be 6.8 ± 0.5 μm, 5-fold lower than that for the wild-type enzyme (Table V). However, the most dramatic change in the double mutant-catalyzed reaction is that hypoxanthine can be now used as a substrate with an estimated K m value of 54.5 ± 15.5 μm and a k cat for the forward reaction of 4.4 ± 0.7 s−1 (Table IV). Thus, by improving nonspecific 6-oxopurine binding to the active site of GPRTase through stronger hydrophobic interactions via a Y127I mutation and a further strengthening of the hydrogen bonding with the exocyclic O6 by the K152R mutation, the primary dependence of purine binding on hydrogen bonding with Asp-181 and Asp-187 becomes de-emphasized. The substrate specificity becomes relaxed somewhat as a result.Table VBinding constants for GMP of the various mutants of GPRTaseEnzymeK dμmWild type36.7 ± 2.1Y127I8.0 ± 0.7Y127I/K152R6.8 ± 0.5Y127I/L186F7.7 ± 0.5Y127I/K152R/L186F6.8 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Another attempt was made to further improve the purine binding affinity through a double mutation Y127/L186F. The mutant was prepared and characterized kinetically. The K m for guanine was determined to be 2.8 ± 0.3 μm, 6-fold lower than that for the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficiency too showed an improvement by 3-fold over the wild-type enzyme catalyzed reaction (Table IV). There was, however, no demonstrable utilization of hypoxanthine as a substrate by this double mutant. A triple mutant Y127I/K152R/L186F was then prepared. It showed a dramatic improvement in both the K m for guanine and in the catalytic efficiency in utilizing guanine. The 6-fold decrease in the K m for guanine and the 4-fold increase in thek cat/K m ratio over the wild-type enzyme clearly indicates the complementarity of the enhanced binding obtained by three major changes in the structure of the active site in GPRTase, First, the replacement of Tyr-127 with the more conserved and less intrusive Leu; second, extending the side chain length by the K152R mutation, thus enabling enhanced interaction with the O6 of the purine moiety; third, the increased hydrophobic interactions by the presence of a Phe-186 at the base of the purine ring. The enhanced guanine binding obtained by these site-specific changes also has a supplementary effect on hypoxanthine utilization as a substrate. The triple mutant catalyzes the formation of IMP from hypoxanthine with a K m of 29.8 ± 4.1 μm and a k cat of 8.0 ± 0.6 s−1 (Table IV and Fig.4) This represents a 2-fold decrease in the K m and a 3.3-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency compared with the Y172I/K152R double mutant (Table IV). The K d values for GMP binding to the Y127I/L186F and the Y127I/K152R/L186F mutant enzymes were 7.7 ± 0.5 and 6.8 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Thus, both the mutants show increased binding to GMP as compared with the wild-type enzyme, representing about 5–6-fold increase in the binding affinity. These results clearly indicate a requirement for enhanced interactions with O6 of the purine moiety combined with strong hydrophobic binding of the purine ring for a 6-oxopurine other than guanine, such as hypoxanthine, to bind effectively to the active site of GPRTase. In order to verify the effectiveness of the triple mutant of GPRTase in converting hypoxanthine to IMP in an in vivoenvironment, functional complementation of the E. colistrain Sφ609 purine auxotroph (ara, Δpro-gpt-lac, thi, hpt,pup, purH, J, strA) with the triple mutant was performed (20Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DNA transformants of E. coli were grown in minimal media supplemented with specific nucleobases. Fig. 5 shows that E. coli Sφ609, transformed with the wild-type GPRTase expression plasmid, could grow in the presence of guanine, but showed very poor growth in the presence of hypoxanthine or without the presence of any purine base. The Y127I plasmid-transformed cells behaved quite similarly to the wild-type GPRTase transfected cells in guanine-supplemented medium. E. coli Sφ609 cells transfected with either the Y127I/K152R or the Y127I/K152R/L186F plasmid grew also to a similar extent as the wild type GPRTase transfected cells on guanine. However, they also grew when supplemented with hypoxanthine and reached about 50% of the final level of growth when compared with that from growing on guanine. Thus, the ability to phosphoribosylate hypoxanthine by the two mutant enzymes could be demonstrated in transfected cells via complementing the auxotrophy of the E. coli strain Sφ609. We believe that what we have accomplished here is a major finding in our efforts to try to understand the molecular mechanism underlining the strict guanine specificity of G. lamblia GPRTase. This newly gained knowledge should also enable us to design new, potent and specific inhibitors of G. lamblia GPRTase. Guanine derivatives with an extended exocyclic O6 substituent up to a length of 6.3 Å could be developed into a potent inhibitor of this parasite enzyme while incapable of binding to the host enzyme at all. The purine-binding site in G. lambliaGPRTase has a unique structural feature, which leads to the unusually restrictive purine substrate specificity of the enzyme. The weak interaction between Lys-152 and the exocyclic O6 of bound 6-oxopurine makes the apparent interaction between Asp-181, Asp-187, and the N2 group of guanine crucial for its binding. Consequently, only guanine can bind to the active site of this enzyme. By strengthening the less specific hydrophobic interactions between the purine ring and residues Leu-186 and Tyr-127, coupled with a stronger hydrogen bonding to the exocyclic O6 of purine by mutating Lys-152 to Arg, hypoxanthine can be used as substrate of the mutant enzyme. The insight gained through our intentional alteration of the purine specificity of this enzyme suggests specific routes for the design of effective anti-parasitic agents targeted to the enzyme."

However, of the proteins involved in this complex regulatory network, only Max and Mnt form homodimers under physiological conditions. The role of the Max-associated bHLH LZ proteins in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis depends upon dimerization with Max (9Bouchard C. Staller P. Eilers M.

The HLH family of proteins is characterized by a domain consisting of two amphipathic α-helices joined by a short, nonconserved loop of random coil. HLH dimers form a globular fold of four interacting α-helices (11Wendt H. Thomas R.M. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5735-5743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K. Handel T.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in which stability and specificity are mediated through highly conserved hydrophobic residues at the core of the HLH domain (13Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper is a dimerization motif characterized by a heptad repeat of leucine residues (14Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 15Alber T. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Folded dimers form a parallel, coiled-coil of α-helices in which, by conventional nomenclature, (abcdefg)n, the heptad repeat Leu residues occupy position d at the dimer interface. Leu is highly conserved at this position throughout the LZ family of proteins, presumably because its side chain size and structure is such that it provides optimal hydrophobic packing. Another heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, typically the β-branched amino acids such as Ile and Val, are found in position a at the dimer interface. There is debate over the role of interhelical salt bridges between charged residues in positions e and g in the coiled-coil. Unfavorable e-g′ electrostatic interactions, where an apostrophe indicates a residue from the apposing chain in the dimer, have been shown to inhibit dimer formation (16O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) and potentially promote strand exchange. However, the presence of attractivee-g′ ion pairs may not contribute significantly to dimer stability; indeed, they may be less stabilizing than an equivalent neutral charge interaction (17Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8642-8648Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The HLH LZ dimer interacts as a parallel, left-handed, four-helix bundle, with each monomer consisting of two right-handed α-helices joined by the loop region of the HLH domain. The LZ extends as a coiled-coil out of the globular fold formed by the HLH domain. Crystal structures of two HLH LZ proteins, USF and Max, show that the dimerization domain is a single, contiguous functional element, with helix-2 of the HLH extending into the LZ such that there is no clear demarcation between the two domains (18Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K.

( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that the Max bHLH-Z domain homodimerizes cooperatively in a manner consistent with a two-state monomer to dimer association. There is also evidence that the Max HLH LZ is able to interact as a tetramer under certain conditions (20Brownlie P. Ceska T. Lamers M. Romier C. Stier G. Teo H. Suck D. Structure. 1997; 5: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The majority of LZ proteins contain an a position Asn residue that confers dimer specificity at the expense of stability and higher order oligomer formation. Mutation of this interfacial polar residue to a Val residue in the GCN4 LZ dramatically stabilizes the coiled-coil and promotes the formation of higher order oligomers (23Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). NMR studies of a recombinant Jun LZ peptide showed that its interfacial Asn residue is hydrogen bonded (H bonded) and adopts two distinct, rapidly exchanging conformations in solution (24Junius F.K. Mackay J.P. Bubb W.A. Jensen S.A. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6164-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutation of this Asn to a Leu residue caused changes in dimer stability and oligomerization status comparable with the behavior of the Asn to Val mutant of GCN4. Max contains two such a position Asn residues, Asn78 and Asn92. These residues may play a destabilizing role akin to that of the interfacial Asn in Jun and GCN4. In addition to the classical hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface, the LZ domain of the Max homodimer exhibits unusual structural features (18Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 20Brownlie P. Ceska T. Lamers M. Romier C. Stier G. Teo H. Suck D. Structure. 1997; 5: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Two regions in particular are unique among the known LZ proteins: an interfacial His-His′ packing at position 81, and a tetrad between Gln-Asn/Gln′-Asn′ at positions 91 and 92 toward the C terminus of the LZ. These residues are likely to be responsible for the propensity of Max to form a variety of heterodimers rather than Max-Max homodimers. Studies using isolated LZ domains (25Muhle-Goll C. Nilges M. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13554-13564Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston M.E.J. Sonnichsen F.D. Lix B. Skyes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have analyzed the role of these two regions in the context of the Myc-Max heterodimer. These indicate that a buried salt bridge between His81 of the Max LZ and two opposing glutamate residues of the Myc LZ resolves the problem of having these destabilizing hydrophilic residues at the dimer interface. The proton NMR structure of the Myc-Max LZ heterodimer (27Lavigne P. Crump M.P. Gagne S.M. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) shows Asn92 of Max forming an H bond with the backbone carbonyl of Leu420 of the Myc LZ, thus allowing the burial of the polar residue within the hydrophobic core of the LZ. Our study sheds light on the function and importance of Asn92 in the context of the Max dimerization domain. The position of this residue at the dimer interface makes it a likely candidate for one of the destabilizing residues important in facilitating peptide exchange between members of the bHLH LZ regulatory network. There is the potential for an array of H bonds to be formed between the Gln-Asn/Gln′-Asn′ tetrad of residues, in contrast to the relatively simple Asn/Asn′ interaction seen previously in the Jun and GCN4 homodimers. This unusual arrangement makes it an attractive target for mutagenesis studies, with the goal of dissecting the role of Asn92 in Max HLH LZ homodimerization. A synthetic gene was designed which encoded the HLH and LZ domains of the human Max protein (amino acids 37–105) 2The amino acid sequence of this protein corresponds to Swiss-Prot number P25912 (1Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). with an additional Gly-Gly-Gly at the N terminus and Gly-Gly-Cys at the C terminus.BamHI sites were incorporated onto the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence to permit insertion into the pGEX-2T expression vector (28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The final DNA sequence was optimized for bacterial expression by replacing rare codons with those frequently used in Escherichia coli (29Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). pGEXMax+G was isolated by expression screening, and its identity was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing in both strands. Mutagenic polymerase chain reaction (30Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. Genome Res. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) was used to introduce changes into pGEXMax+G, yielding the aspartate (pGEXMaxV), glutamate (pGEXMaxE), and valine (pGEXMaxV) mutant clones used in this study. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to remove the Gly-Gly-Gly encoding from the 5′ region of HLH LZ sequences. Polymerase chain reaction was also used to create an additional clone encoding the native Max HLH LZ sequence without the N-terminal Gly-Gly-Gly (pGEXMaxN). The four mutagenic primers were: 1) GGATCCGACCACATCAAAGACTCCTTC, 2) CTGAAACGTCAGGA(C/A)GCTCTGCTGGAA, 3) TTCCAGCAGAGCAACCTGACGTTTCAG, and 4) GGATTCTAATAGTGATCACTATTAGCAAC. Four additional mutagenic primers were used to make the two Q91A mutant forms: 5) CAGAGCGTTAGCACGTTTCAG, 6) CTGAAACGTGCTAACGCTCTG, 7) CAGAGCCACAGCACGTTTCAG, and 8) CTGAAACGTGCTGTGGCTCTG. Expression screening isolated mutant clones and automated DNA sequencing of both strands confirmed their identities. Each GST-Max fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli DH5α that also contained pBS536. pBS536 contains the 2.2-kb GroE+EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pOF39 (MGG 202, 435–445) inserted at the EcoRV site within thetet gene of pACYC184 in an orientation that does not permit its expression from the tetpromoter. 3B. P. Surin and N. E. Dixon, unpublished results. Coexpression of GroEL and GroES from pBS536 increased the amount of soluble GST-Max proteins produced to approximately 50% of total expressed fusion protein (data not shown). Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C for 3 h prior to harvesting. GST-Max fusion proteins were separated from cellular proteins by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, and Max proteins were released from the fusion protein at the engineered thrombin site with bovine thrombin. Max proteins were purified by HPLC on a semi-preparative Vydac C-18 column with a linear gradient from 25 to 45% acetonitrile 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, over 30 min. Following HPLC, the protein preparations used in this study were confirmed to be pure by Tricine gel electrophoresis and of the correct molecular weight by ESMS (Australian Government Analytical Laboratories). Each homodimer was diluted from stock solutions into physiological ionic salt buffer (50 mmTris·HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) to a final peptide concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Stock peptide concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm (A 280) using the extinction coefficient value of 2620 cm−1m−1 for each Max peptide. Far ultraviolet CD spectra from 200 to 260 nm were collected on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter flushed continuously with N2 and routinely calibrated withd-(+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid. For thermal denaturation profiles, ellipticity at 222 nm for each of the disulfide bridged homodimers was measured over a linear temperature gradient from 10 to 95 °C at 1 °C/min. Additional thermal denaturation data were collected for MaxV over a number of peptide concentrations: 1.0, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.005 mg/ml. Base-line spectra of physiological ionic salt buffer were collected and subtracted from all data prior to conversion into mean residue weight ellipticity values using the following formula. [θ]=θ·100·MRWc·dEquation 1 where mean residue weight ellipticity ([θ]) is expressed in deg·cm−2·dmol−1, θ is raw ellipticity values, MRW is the molecular weight divided by the number of residues in the peptide, c is the peptide concentration in mg/ml, and d is the pathlength in centimetres through the optical cell (26Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston M.E.J. Sonnichsen F.D. Lix B. Skyes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Estimates of α-helical content were generated by the K2D program (31Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The thermal denaturation profile was fitted to either sigmoidal function (i) for MaxN and MaxE or (ii) in the case of MaxV. The thermal denaturation profile of MaxD was not subjected to model fitting.[θ] 222=a+bT−{(c+dT)−(a+bT)}exp(m(T−Tm))1+exp(m(T−Tm))Equation 2 [θ] 222=a+bT−{(c+dT)−(a+bT)}exp(m(T−Tm))1+exp(m(T−Tm))+c+dT−{(c+dT)−(c+dT)}exp(m2(T−Tm))1+exp(m2(T−Tm2))Equation 3 Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The self-association of each Max protein was investigated by sedimentation equilibrium methods on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Experiments were carried out at loading concentrations of 150, 125, 41.5, and 13.2 μm, using an An-60ti rotor spinning at 20,000, and 25,000 rpm and at a temperature of 25 °C. Samples were made up as solutions in physiological ionic salt buffer. Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected in double sector cells as absorbance versus radius scans (0.001-cm increments, 10 scans). Scans were collected at 4-h intervals and compared with determine when the samples had reached equilibrium. Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (33Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), and the final parameters were determined by simultaneous nonlinear least squares fits of all data sets to either a single species (disulfide-bonded dimer) or a dimer-tetramer model. The goodness of fit was determined by examination of the residuals from the fits and consideration of the χ2 values. Partial specific volumes were calculated from the amino acid sequence, and the solvent density was calculated to be 1.00482 g ml−1; both calculations were carried out using the program SEDNTERP (34Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. SEDNTERP. University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH1995Google Scholar). Owing to its additional Gly residues, Max+G was used in place of MaxN for redox experiments to facilitate identification of each protein species. Approximately equimolar amounts of each disulfide-linked HLH LZ homodimer were incubated in redox buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 250 μmglutathione (oxidized), 250 μm glutathione (reduced), pH 8.3. Dissolved O2 was removed from the reaction mixture by 10 min of continuous N2 infusion. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C under N2 in an airtight tube. 100-μl samples were taken at 0, 3, and 16 h, and a 300-μl sample was taken after 4 days. Samples were analyzed by HPLC on an analytical Delta Pak C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) with a linear gradient identical to that used for peptide purification. Peaks were collected and lyophilized, and their identities were confirmed by ESMS. The calculated molecular weights for each species are as follows: Max+G homodimer (17,293), Max+G-glutathione conjugate (8,953), MaxD homodimer (16,952), MaxD-glutathione conjugate (8,783), MaxE homodimer (16,980), MaxE-glutathione conjugate (8,797), MaxV homodimer (16,918), and MaxV-glutathione conjugate (8,766). Molecular models were created on a Silicon Graphics workstation using the InsightII suite of programs (version 97.0, Molecular Simulations Inc., 1997). The crystal structure of the HLH LZ domains of the Max homodimer bound to its cognate DNA fragment (18Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) was used as a template. Hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structure at standard chemical positions. Two residues were replaced; these were Ala residues present in the pdb coordinates but not present in the originally published human Max sequence (1Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The two Ala residues in each monomer were replaced by His79 and Gln82. Asn92 was replaced by either Asp, Glu, or Val residues to create the three mutant model homodimers-MaxD, MaxE, and MaxV. The bound DNA fragment was removed from the system prior to energy minimization calculations. Each model was immersed in a 40 × 115 × 40 Å box filled with water molecules. The potential energy of the molecular system was minimized using the consistent valence force field (35Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). Energy minimization of the homodimer models was performed as a stepwise process designed to gradually release the molecule from restraints tethering it to Max crystal structure coordinates (36Biosym Technologies InsightII User Guide , Version 2.3.0. Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were relaxed using Steepest Descents for 20 iterations; all other atoms were tethered to their original positions. Peptide side chain atoms and oxygen atoms of water molecules were then released from tethering restraints and energy minimized for a further 20 iterations using the same algorithm. Restraints were released from the rest of the molecule for the final energy minimization of 300 iterations using conjugate gradients. The stereochemical quality of each model was assessed using the program Procheck (37Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The CD spectra at 10 °C for each of the peptides is shown in Fig. 1 A. α-Helicity estimates were 91% for the native protein (MaxN); and 20, 21, and 76% for the mutant proteins, N92→D (MaxD), N92→E (MaxE), and N92→V (MaxV), respectively. Thermal denaturation of the disulfide bridged homodimers was followed by measurements of [θ]222 from 10 to 95 °C (Fig.1 B). Decreases in absolute [θ]222 correlate with decreasing α-helicity and the formation of monomeric peptides from the initial homodimers. Each protein underwent a decrease in helicity and a shift to an increasingly random structure as it was heated. However, the initial helicities and unfolding pathways differed for each of the peptides studied. MaxN shows a cooperative unfolding event with a melting temperature (T m) of 57 °C. T m is defined as the temperature at which half the peptide population is folded. The thermal denaturation profile exhibited good correlation to the theoretical curve. MaxE also displayed a thermal denaturation profile in keeping with a cooperative mechanism of unfolding. However, the exchange of the polar Asn residue for the more bulky, charged side chain of Glu had a strong destabilizing effect. At 10 °C, MaxE showed less ellipticity than MaxN, indicating that the population of MaxE molecules contained less helical secondary structure. The T m of MaxE was 37 °C, considerably lower than that of MaxN. MaxV exhibited an unfolding pattern similar to that of MaxN up to approximately 85 °C (Fig. 1 B). From 85 to 95 °C, MaxV showed the beginning of a second unfolding transition (Fig.1 C). This second transition was reproducible from peptide concentrations of 0.005–1.0 mg/ml and throughout the series of 22 separate thermal denaturation experiments performed on MaxV. Although the helicity of MaxV at 10 °C was not as marked as that of the native peptide, the Val mutant undergoes its initial denaturation event at approximately the same temperature, 58 °C compared with 57 °C for MaxN. The second transition had an approximateT m of 90 °C, although this is only an estimate because the ellipticity values had not plateaued by 95 °C, which is the upper limit of the CD spectrometer. Additional thermal denaturation experiments performed with MaxV in physiological ionic salt plus 4 m urea failed to clarify the characteristics of this second unfolding event (data not shown). The second transition displayed by MaxV contrasts significantly with the profiles exhibited by the other peptides. For this reason, we wished to exclude the possibility of higher order interactions. TheT m for the first denaturation transition of MaxV was concentration independent across the range of samples studied (Fig.2 A). Data from sedimentation equilibrium measurements carried out on MaxV fitted well to a single species model where the only species present was the disulfide-bonded MaxV dimer with an apparent molecular weight of 18300 ± 1700 Da (Fig. 2 B). Fitting the data to a monomer-dimer equilibrium (disulfide bridged dimer-tetramer) gave a marginally better fit, with a dimerization constant of 420 m−1. However, under these conditions the protein would be >99% dimeric at 0.1 mg/ml. We propose that both models fitted the data similarly because although the propensity of MaxV to form higher order aggregates appears to be real, under our experimental conditions it is small enough that a single species dimeric model describes the interaction adequately. Taken together, these results indicate that MaxV is present predominantly as a disulfide bridged dimer under the conditions of this study. MaxD was predominantly unfolded for the duration of the thermal denaturation experiment (Fig. 1 B). The unfolding pathway suggests multiple points of slight inflection, indicating that the small amount of helical MaxD present melts in a sequential manner consistent with subdomains unfolding within the HLH LZ. The melting temperatures of these inflection points were not determined because it is apparent that MaxD does not display a dimer to monomer unfolding pattern under these conditions. To exclude the possibility that the C-terminal disulfide bond was artificially imparting the correct dimer alignment and thus masking any role of the Asn residue in orientating the molecules, the thermal denaturation profiles of MaxN and MaxV were examined under the reducing conditions imparted by a 5-fold excess of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). Neither denaturation profile varied significantly from those of their respective disulfide bridged homodimers (data not shown). Two additional mutant proteins were made to assess whether Gln91 influenced the stability of the native or Val mutant proteins. These were MaxAN and MaxAV, in which Gln91 was replaced by Ala in MaxN and MaxV, respectively. Thermal denaturation of MaxAN and MaxAV was followed by measurements of [θ]222from 10 to 95 °C (Fig. 3). Both molecules showed unfolding profiles similar to those of MaxN and MaxV. MaxAN had a T m of 57 °C, which compared closely to that of MaxN (58 °C). MaxAV similarly unfolded at a comparable temperature to that of MaxV (57 and 58 °C, respectively). To determine whether there was preferential formation of homodimer or heterodimer species between mutant Max forms and the native Max sequence, dimerization behavior was studied under redox conditions. By virtue of additional Gly residues at the N terminus of the native sequence, Max+G was used in place of MaxN for redox experiments. This facilitated identification of each protein species. In each case, the native peptide showed a weak propensity to form mixed disulfides with glutathione from an initially homodimeric state. After 4 days, 5–14% of Max+G was covalently bound to glutathione. MaxD showed a strong preference to dissociate from an initially homodimeric form into a mixed disulfide with glutathione (MaxD-SG). The MaxD-SG form was evident after only 3 h. After 4 days, 46% of the MaxD peptide was present as a glutathione-bound monomer (Fig.4). Max+G also formed mixed disulfides with glutathione, however, to a lesser degree than MaxD; after 4 days, only 5% of the Max+G peptide was present in this form. Max+G showed no propensity to interact with MaxD. MaxE behaved similarly to MaxD. It showed the presence of a small amount of glutathione adduct after 3 h, and after 4 days this had increased to 68% of the MaxE peptide (Fig.5). Max+G again displayed a weak propensity to dissociate from its homodimeric form and react with glutathione. After 4 days, 14% of the Max+G peptide was covalently bound to glutathione. ESMS analysis of the minor peak 4 identified two contributing species, suggesting a mixture of dimer components. The MaxV mutant displayed a similar monomer-dimer distribution to that of the native Max+G protein. After 4 days, 9% of the Max+G peptide and 5% o"
https://openalex.org/W2075548934,Calmodulin binding to inducible nitric-oxide synthase may play an important role in its Ca(2+)-independent activity. Studies of inducible nitric-oxide synthase chimeras containing the calmodulin binding sequence of neuronal or endothelial nitric-oxide synthases show that the calmodulin binding sequence of inducible nitric-oxide synthase is necessary but not sufficient for the Ca(2+)-independent activity. The mutations at lysine 525 located at the C terminus of the calmodulin binding sequence of inducible nitric-oxide synthase were examined for the effects on the Ca(2+)-independent activity with chimeras containing the oxygenase or reductase domains of inducible or neuronal nitric-oxide synthases. Results show that the Ca(2+)-independent binding of calmodulin is not solely responsible for maximal Ca(2+)-independent activity of inducible nitric-oxide synthase. Lysine 525 of inducible nitric-oxide synthase may also play an important role in coordinating the maximal Ca(2+)-independent activity.
