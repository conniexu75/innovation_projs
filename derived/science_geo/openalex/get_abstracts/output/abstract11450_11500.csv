https://openalex.org/W2025627326,"Nuclei isolated from HeLa cells 15 hr after infection with Ad2 synthesize an RNA transcript ∼25 KB long, beginning between 0.2 and 0.3 on the physical map and extending to (or close to) the right end of the genome. The majority (60–92%) of the RNA transcribed from fragments between 0.2 and 1.0 is synthesized as part of this large molecule which represents the major product of late Ad2 RNA synthesis. Smaller transcripts are also formed mainly from the left end of the Ad2 genome."

https://openalex.org/W2060546338,"Rapidly sedimenting hnRNA complexes contain regions of stable intermolecular duplex. Disruption of such complexes, as judged by a reduction in sedimentation rate, requires conditions sufficient to denature the duplex regions. Rapidly sedimenting molecules reappear only when the complementary sequences reanneal — that is, the formation of such complexes is dependent upon time and the concentration of homologous RNA. These experiments lead us to the conclusion that rapidly sedimenting hnRNA complexes consist of two or more largely single-stranded RNA molecules held together by short duplex regions. Precisely such structures have been visualized in the electron microscope. Rapidly sedimenting fractions of native nuclear RNA from preparative sucrose gradients consist primarily of large, multi-molecular complexes interconnected by duplex regions averaging 300 base pairs in length. Exposure of the RNA to severely denaturing conditions eliminates such complexes. Reannealing of the RNA reconstitutes complexes which are indistinguishable from those observed in preparations before denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1634601902,"The kinetics of labeling of myosin heavy chain, following a single intravenous injection of L-[4,5-3H]leucine, were analyzed with the help of a computer, in conjunction with the labeling kinetics of the specific radioactivities of the precursor amino acid pool. As precursor we used leucyl-tRNA which, as we show here, differs significantly from the intracellular free leucine pool. The half-life of myosin heavy chain was determined from the initial period (0 to 60 min) of incorporation of label into protein after a single injection of tritiated leucine, and also from the period (7 to 14 days) when there is exponential decay of the labeled protein. Myosin heavy chain was separated from other myofibrillar proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before measurement of leucine specific radioactivity. The specific radioactivity was measured in both protein and precursor pools by a sensitive isotope dilution procedure (range, 100 to 1500 pmol). The values for the half-life of myosin heavy chain determined at both intervals were similar (5.4 and 5.9 days). Substitution of the specific radioactivity of the intracellular free leucine pool decreased the half-life to 2.7 dyas. Similar values were obtained when the half-life was calculated by simple graphical integration of the experimental curves."
https://openalex.org/W2018575551,"Six independently isolated adenovirus 2-transformed rat cell lines and one adenovirus 5-transformed human cell line have been examined in vitro for serum growth requirements, saturation density, anchorage-independent growth, proteolytic enzyme activity and the presence of LETS glycoprotein and T antigen. This series of adenovirus-transformed cell lines exhibits an oncogeni spectrum ranging from being tumorigenic in immunocompetent rats through to nontumorigenic in adult nude mice. The relevance of the in vitro findings to growth potential in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575604311,"The effects of hypophysectomy on albumin and total protein synthesis in rat liver were investigated in vivo, in perfused liver, and in isolated hepatocytes. In all systems, hypophysectomy resulted in about a 50% decrease in the rate of total protein synthesis and a 30 to 50% decrease in the relative rate of albumin synthesis. Albumin synthesis accounted for 11 to 13% of total protein synthesis in all normal systems, but represented only 5 to 8% of the total in all systems derived from hypophysectomized rats. Growth hormone, administered subcutaneously to hypophysectomized rats for 5 days, restored the relative rate of albumin synthesis to normal in vivo; however, only partial restoration was demonstrated in the in vitro systems. Perfused livers and isolated hepatocytes exhibited linear rates of total protein and albumin secretion for 3 h. The rate of albumin secretion by normal perfused livers was 3 times that of perfused livers from hypophysectomized animals, being 0.54 and 0.17 mg/g of liver/h, respectively. Isolated hepatocytes synthesized total protein and albumin at nearly the same rate as perfused livers. The amount of albumin secreted by cells derived from normal and hypophysectomized rats was 0.38 and 0.10 mg/ml of packed cells/h, respectively. Ribosome half-transit times for albumin and total liver protein were 1.6 to 1.7 min in isolated liver cells derived from both normal and hypophysectomized rats. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no difference in the qualitative distribution of the proteins secreted by perfused livers and isolated hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2031985588,"The synthesis of Ad2-specific nuclear RNA in HeLa cells 15 hr post-infection has been examined after ultraviolet irradiation. The synthesis of RNA complementary to various segments of Ad2 DNA is decreased differentially, with the most sensitive region at the right end of the physical map and the most resistant in the region from 0 up to 0.2-0.3 (20-30% from the left end of the genome). For a given ultraviolet dose, the amount of labeled RNA homologous to various DNA fragments decreased exponentially from map position 0.2-0.3 to 1.0. These results suggest that a major transcriptional unit late in Ad2 infection is a rightward-transcribing unit between 0.0-0.3 and 1.0."

https://openalex.org/W2068816606,The specific narcotic antagonist naloxone (0.4 milligram) was given intravenously to seven chronic schizophrenics who reported that they had very frequent auditory hallucinations. Saline solution was used as a placebo. The coded study did not reveal any effect of naloxone on hallucinations or on global psychopathology.
https://openalex.org/W1533089121,"Tryptic digests of ovine submaxillary apomucin were fractionated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography to give 14 peptide fractions. Three purified tryptic peptides, representing 106 of the 650 residues in apomucin, were submitted to automated sequence analysis. The NH2-terminal 50 of the 74 residues in one peptide and the entire sequence of the other two hexadecapeptides were established. These studies suggest that purified ovine submaxillary, mucin is chemically homogeneous, containing a unique primary structure without substantial repeating sequences in its polypeptide chain. The sequences adjacent to 28 known O-glycosidically substituted seryl and threonyl residues were compared. No homologies were apparent around the glycosylated seryl and threonyl residues which might define the specificity of the UDP-N-acetylgalactosaminyl:mucin polypeptide transferase that incorporates N-acetylgalactosamine into O-glycosidic linkage in glycoproteins. However, there appears to be a minimum size requirement for glycosylation, because the transferase catalyzes glycosylation of tryptic peptides efficiently, while chymotryptic and thermolytic peptides were much poorer substrates for the transferase."
https://openalex.org/W2278354703,An estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) derived from a pleural effusion was used. This cell line contains a large amount of nuclear receptor not occupied with estrogen. In these experiments it was shown that unoccupied nuclear receptor (Rn) has most of the characteristics attributed to estrogen receptor that it can bind estradiol directly to become estrogen-occupied nuclear receptor and that it is not an artifact of tissue preparation. MCF-7 cells were grown in Falcon plastic flasks or in glass roller bottles in 5% carbon dioxide in air at 37 degrees C. Growth medium was Earles-basal minimal essential medium with supplements. Prior to homogenization cells were 90-95% viable. Cytosol and nuclear extracts were prepared. Details of methods used are described. In the MCF-7 cells a nuclear estrogen receptor with high affinity and limited capacity binding for estradiol was found. Rn comprised about 75% of the cells total population of estrogen-binding sites. Data suggested that (tritiated)-estradiol was bound directly to unoccupied nuclear sites. Studies have shown that MCF-7 cells were not dependent on estrogen for growth but were stimulated in its presence. Rn could be inducing cell growth and division even in the absence of estrogens. The increased stimulation with estradiol would then reflect the increment of additional unoccupied cytoplasmic receptor translocated to the nuclei from the cytoplasm.
https://openalex.org/W1496147883,"The joining of duplex DNA at base-paired ends by bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase was confirmed using either a synthetic duplex decamer or restriction endonuclease fragments of ColE1 DNA as substrates. The reaction was not linearly dependent on enzyme concentration but increased markedly at high enzyme concentrations. Although T4 RNA ligase did not catalyze this blunt end joining, it makedly stimulated the DNA ligase reaction particularly at low DNA ligase concentrations. The apparent Km for the decamer was 50 micronM in the presence or absence of RNA ligase. In the presence of RNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase had about the same turnover number for blunt end and cohesive end joining. The joining of duplex DNA at base-paired ends was proven by several techniques including restriction endonuclease cleavage of the products. The products of the ligation reaction using restriction enzyme fragments were mostly linear oligomers but included some circular duplexes. Escherichia coli DNA ligase in the presence or absence of RNA ligase did not catalyze blunt end joining. RNA ligase only moderately affected the joining of cohesive ends by T4 DNA ligase or E. coli DNA ligase and did not itself catalyze this reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1558917577,"The effects of substituents at position 5 in the pyrimidine ring of a variety of phage DNAs upon EcoRI endonuclease and methylase activities have been examined. The replacement of cytidine in DNA with glucosylated hydroxymethylcytidine confers resistance to cleavage by the EcoRI endonuclease. Substitution of thymidine in DNA by hydroxy-methyluridine(a change in the methyl at position 5 of thymidine for a hydroxymethyl) lowers the maximal velocity of endonucleolytic cleavage 20-fold, but has no detectable effect upon the Km. Substitution of thymidine in DNA by uridine (a change in the methyl at position 5 of thymidine for a hydrogen atom) has no effect upon either the maximal velocity or the Km. The effect of these modifications upon EcoRI methylase activity was markedly different. DNA containing glucosylated hydroxymethylcytidine is methylated as well as normal DNA. DNA containing uridine or hydroxy-methyluridine, in place of thymidine, is much more poorly methylated than normal DNA. These different sensitivities of the EcoRI endonuclease and methylase to modifications in the pyrimidine rings of DNA suggest there are significant differences in the manner by which these enzymes recognize and bind to the canonical EcoRI sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1589161638,"The effect of metal activators on the fidelity of DNA synthesis has been examined. Using the DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus, the accuracy of Co2+-, M2+-, and Ni2+-activated DNA synthesis was determined with different polynucleotide templates. With poly[d(A-T)] as the template, the error frequency for dCMP incorporation was 1:1400, 1:1100, and 1:600 for Mg2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, respectively, at maximally activating concentrations. The error frequency was invariant with respect to [Mg2+] but increased with greater than activating concentrations of Co2+ and Mn2+. This increase resulted from differential rates of complementary and noncomplementary nucleotide incorporation. The enhanced error frequency was nonspecific as it occurred with all polynucleotide templates and with all noncomplementary deoxy- and ribonucleotides which were tested. Nearest neighbor analyses of the reaction products indicated that the noncomplementary deoxynucleotides were incorporated as single base substitutions. The fidelity of Ni2+-activated DNA synthesis was invariant with respect to [Ni2+] and was similar to that obtained using Mg2+. During DNA synthesis with Mg2+, the addition of Co2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+ resulted in a decrease in the fidelity of DNA synthesis. The relationship between decreases in the fidelity of DNA synthesis and metal mutagenesis, or carcinogenesis, or both, is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1501701594,"Purified GTP-dependent Met-tRNAf binding protein (EIF2) prepared from the 0.5 M KCl eluate of reticulocyte polyribosomes was successfully resolved into its three-component subunits by isoelectric focusing in the presence of urea. The 37,000-dalton subunit focused at a pH of 5.8 and was resolved into two spots; the 48,000-dalton subunit focused at a pH of 6.6 and was resolved into three spots; and the 52,000-dalton subunit exhibited an isoelectric point of 8.9 and migrated as a single spot. When isolated 37,000- and 48,000-dalton subunit was found to possess Met-tRNAf and mRNA binding activities while the 37,000-dalton subunit was found to possess GDP binding activity. Phosphorylation of EIF2 by protein kinases present in reticulocyte lysates was demonstrated using [gamma-32P]GTP or [gamma-32P]ATP as the phosphate donor. The 37,000-dalton subunit was preferentially phosphorylated when [gamma-32P]ATP was used as substrate; the 48,000-dalton subunit was preferentially phosphorylated when the [gamma-52P]GTP was used as phosphate donor, although some phosphorylation of the 37,000-dalton subunit was also observed. The 37,000-dalton subunit of ribosome-associated EIF2 was present predominantly in a dephosphorylated form following purification."
https://openalex.org/W1574269421,"This paper reports the evidence for the existence of multiple sites of action of aflatoxin B1 in relation to its inhibition of rat hepatic nuclear RNA synthesis. Two hours after aflatoxin B1 injection (0.3 mg/100 g body weight), rat hepatic nuclear and nucleolar RNA synthesis, in vitro, were inhibited 70 and 90% respectively. When total nuclear free and engaged RNA polymerases were solubilized and assayed in the presence of alpha-amanitin (3.2 micrograms/ml), only alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity was reduced (50 to 70%) by aflatoxin B1. DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography confirmed this finding and further demonstrated that RNA polymerase II was the activity selectively inhibited. Since aflatoxin B1 dramatically inhibited nucleolar RNA synthesis, but had little effect on RNA polymerase I activity per se, it is concluded, therefore, that, in addition to its direct inhibitory effect on the enzymic function of RNA polymerase II, aflatoxin B1 must also cause impairment of the nucleolar DNA template function."
https://openalex.org/W1574998608,"A binding protein for retinal has been found in the soluble protein fraction of bovine retina. It was separable from the intracellular retinol- and retinoic acid-binding proteins by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and appeared to have a molecular weight of about 50,000. The new binding protein did not bind retinol or retinoic acid. The binding protein neither oxidized retinal in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides and is presumed, therefore, not to be a dehydrogenase. Bound retinal was reduced to retinol in the presence of liver alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH, indicating that the functional group remained accessible when in the protein complex. The binding protein bound cis isomers of retinal preferentially. Bound ligand was displaced most effectively by 11-cis-retinal. When individual cis-trans isomers of retinal were presented to the binding protein, binding was maximal with the 11-cis isomer. It is proposed that the protein be referred to as 11-cis-retinal-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1523577123,"An improved procedure is described for the purification of plasminogen activator from pig heart. The initial purification steps were similar to these described previously (Bachmann, F., Fletcher, A. P., Alkjaersig, N., and Sherry, S. (1964) Biochemistry 3, 1578--1585). Use of a novel extraction medium containing EDTA, cysteine, and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol-1 facilitated the removal of large amounts of inert proteins prior to gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-150. The final product had a specific activity of 120,000 to 160,000 CTA units/mg of protein (CTA, Committee on Thrombolytic Agents of the National Heart Institute). Total purification over pig heart was 25,000 to 30,000-fold, average recovery compared to the initial extract was 6 to 8%. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a major and two minor components. The molecular weight of the activator determined by gel filtration was 51,500 +/- 3,400 for the major activity component and 48,000 for a minor component which was partially separated from the major peak in eight of nine chromatography runs. A gamma-globulin fraction of antiserum against purified activator neutralized the biological activity of the activator on fibrin plates. Immunoelectrophoresis of gel-filtered activator revealed only one anodic component."
https://openalex.org/W1527075170,"The proteins of the large subunit of rat liver ribosomes were separated into seven groups by stepwise elution from carboxymethylcellulose with LiCl at pH 6.5. Twenty-one proteins (L3, L6, L7', L8, L10, L15, L17, L18, L19, L23', L25, L27', L28, L29, L31, L32, L34, L35, L36, L36', and L37') were isolated from three groups (C60, E60, and F60) by ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethycellulose and by filtration through Sephadex. The amount of protein obtained varied from 0.3 to 25 mg. Nine of the proteins (L6, L8, L18, L27', L28, L29, L34, L36, and L36') had no detectable contamination: the impurities in the others were no greater than 9%. The molecular weight of the proteins was estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; the amino acid composition was determined."

https://openalex.org/W1546781414,"The in vitro biosynthesis of teichuronic acid, the cell wall polysaccharide of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, occurs in two stages. In the initial stage, the particulate enzyme fraction utilizes uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and uridine diphosphate N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid (UDP-ManNAcUA) to form three intermediates. N-Acetylglucosamine is transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to a carrier lipid present in the particulate enzyme fraction to form the first intermediate, GlcNAc carrier lipid. N-Acetylmannosaminuronic acid is then transferred from UDP-ManNAcUA to the GlcNAc carrier lipid to form ManNAcUA-GlcNAc carrier lipid, the second intermediate. Finally, the transfer of an additional N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid residue from UDP-ManNAcUA yields the third intermediate, (ManNAcUA)2-GlcNAc carrier lipid. Reactions involving UDP-ManNAcUA release uridine diphosphate. Concomitant synthesis of peptidoglycan or membrane mannan inhibits the synthesis of the teichuronic acid intermediates, thereby providing indirect evidence that the carrier lipid is undecaprenol monophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1940914177,"Purified D-amino acid transaminase from Bacillus sphaericus catalyzes an alpha,beta elimination from the D isomer of beta-chloroalanine to yield equivalent amounts of pyruvate, chloride, and ammonia; the L isomer of chloroalanine is not a substrate for this transaminase. During the beta elimination there is a synchronous loss in enzyme activity; the Kinact for beta-chloroalanine was estimated to be about 10 micrometers. The alpha-aminoacrylate-Schiff base intermediate formed after beta elimination of chloride ion is probably the key intermediate that partitions between one inactivation event for every 1500 turnovers. In the presence of D-alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate, which are good substrates for the transaminase activity of this enzyme, beta-chloroalanine is a potent, competitive inhibitor (K1 = 10 micrometers) with D-alanine and a weak, uncompetitive inhibitor with alpha-ketoglutarate."
https://openalex.org/W1587503237,"Isolated sarcotubular membranes (SR) from skeletal muscle bound 3.7 nmol of beta, gamma-methylene [8-3H]ATP (AMP-PCP) per mg of membrane protein. Only one class of binding site was identified and the dissociation constant (K) for this site was 1.5 X 10(-5) M. Addition of 0.05% Triton X-100 increased the number of binding sites to 5.7 nmol/mg. ATP and ADP competitively inhibited AMP-PCP binding. The dissociation constants for ATP and ADP were 3.5 X 10(-5) M and 3.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively. Since this data was obtained in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, it was established that the sarcoplasmic reticulum has a high affinity for the metal free forms of ATP, ADP, and AMP-PCP. Magnesium concentrations in excess of 1 X 10(-4) M inhibited AMP-PCP binding. Lower concentrations of magnesium had little effect on AMP-PCP binding. The effect of calcium on AMP-PCP binding was biphasic. Calcium concentration between 1 X 10(-6) and 1 X 10(-4) M inhibited AMP-PCP binding. Inhibition was maximal at 1 X 10(-5) M. Calcium concentration above 1 X 10(-4) M facilitated analogue binding. Possible sites of magnesium and calcium actions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1600349586,"Abstract We compared the synthesis of mannosyl oligosaccharide-lipid by membranes of wild type and concanavalin A-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells during incubations with GDP-[14C]mannose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The membranes prepared from exponentially growing mutant cells incorporated 10- to 70-fold less [14C]mannose into oligosaccharide-lipid than did membranes of wild type cells. The lectin-resistant cells are temperature-sensitive for growth. Using temperature-resistant revertants, we showed that the reduction in labeled oligosaccharide-lipid correlated with resistance to concanavalin A rather than with the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis, reduced the synthesis of the oligosaccharide-lipid by membranes of wild type cells but did not affect the residual synthesis measured in membranes of the mutant cells. As the mutant cells were grown to high density, there was a marked increase in the synthesis of oligosaccharide-lipid by the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1521784247,"Human serum albumin (HSA) has been chemically modified with 1,2-cyclohexanedione and N-acetylimidazole under nondenaturing conditions. Derivatives, in which 10 arginine residues (1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene (DHCH)-HSA), 56 to 57 lysine and 5 tyrosine residues (acetyl-HSA), or 56 to 57 lysine residues alone (O-deacetyl-HSA) are modified, have been isolated. Their conformation has been tested by circular dichroism measurement, gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, and ultracentrifugation. From these analyses and binding studies it is concluded that only insignificant changes of conformation have occurred. The binding properties of the HSA derivatives have been tested with bilirubin, diazepam (a benzodiazepine drug), phenylbutazone, and indomethacin by circular dichroism. The binding of diazepam to DHCH-HSA is almost completely inhibited and that of phenylbutazone and indomethacin decreased, while the binding of bilirubin is essentially unaffected. In acetyl-HSA and O-deacetyl-HSA, the bilirubin binding is significantly decreased, while the binding of the drugs mentioned is less affected. It is concluded that bilirubin and the drugs bind to two separate sites which contain positive charges essential for the binding properties. The charge(s) in the benzodiazepine site from arginine."

The vesicles are 0.5 to 2.0 micrometers in diameter, and their membranes are predominantly oriented inside-out. The vesicles lack protein bands 1, 2, 5, and 6 (nomenclature of Steck, T.L. (1974) J. Cell Biol. 62, 1-19) of the erythrocyte membrane. L-Sorbose, a substrate of the monosaccharide transport system in erythrocytes, is transported by the vesicles. Based on comparisons between erythrocytes and vesicles with regard to specificity, temparture dependence, and effects of inhibitors, we conclude that sorbose uptake into the vesicles occurs by way of the monosaccharide transport system. The specific activity of the transport system in vesicles, as determined by initial rate measurements of sorbose uptake, averaged 58% of that in erythrocytes. This finding indicates that the major polypeptides of Bands 1, 2, 5, and 6 do not play an obligatory role in monosaccharide transport."

ANDERSON(~ From the Department of Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota 55108 A polysaccharide of alternating glucose and N-acetylman- nosaminuronic acid residues is formed in the second stage of teichuronic acid biosynthesis by the particulate enzyme fraction of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Di(N-acetylmannosa- minuronylj-N-acetylglucosaminyl carrier lipid, the third in- termediate formed in the initial stage of teichuronic acid synthesis, serves as an acceptor for the sequential and alter- nating addition of glucose residues from uridine diphos- phate glucose and N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid residues from uridine diphosphate N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid. Glucosyl - di (N - acetylmannosaminuronyl j-N - acetylglu- cosaminyl carrier lipid and N-acetylmannosaminuronylglu- cosyl-di(N-acetylmannosaminuronyl) - N-acetylglucosami- nyl carrier lipid are intermediates formed by the action of the glucosyltransferase and the N-acetylmannosaminuron- yltransferase, respectively. Both uridine diphosphate glu- cose and uridine diphosphate N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid produce uridine diphosphate in an amount stoichiomet- ric with the incorporation of monosaccharide residues into teichuronic acid. The transferases which catalyze the second stage of tei- churonic acid synthesis are solubilized from the particulate enzyme fraction by Triton X-100. The glucosyltransferase can be selectively released at 5 to 10 mM magnesium ion, whereas at a concentration of 1 mM or less the N-acetylman- nosaminuronyltransferase is also solubilized."
https://openalex.org/W1517549059,"Antibodies specific for the brain isoenzymes (BB) of creatine kinase were prepared by the injection of the highly purified rabbit enzyme into roosters. The antibodies were found to cross-react only partially with BB of rat, guinea pig, sheep, monkey, and man, demonstrating that these proteins are not entirely identical with respect to their antigenic sites. A greater degree of species specificity seems to exist for BB than for the muscle isoenzyme (MM) suggesting that BB may have undergone considerable evolutionary modification. Developmentally mature rabbit cardiac and skeletal muscles contained large quantites of an enzymatically inactive BB which can be detected immunochemically. It is antigenically identical with active rabbit BB but the two proteins can be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Enzymatically inactive BB is also present in human skeletal muscle. The presence of MM in muscle provides sufficient catalytic function and may have permitted the evolution of inactive BB in an additional (noncatalytic) metabolic role."
https://openalex.org/W1989781264,"The XO sex chromosome constitution has been found in both sexes of the mole-vole (Ellobius lutescens) belonging to the rodent family Microtinae. This enigmatic species has apparently been enduring a 50% zygotic lethality. The current serological study revealed the presence in XO males and the absence from XO females of H-Y (histocompatibility Y) antigen. In all the mammalian species studied thus far, the expression of H-Y antigen strictly coincided with the presence of testicular tissue and not necessarily with the presence of the Y chromosome. The testis-organizing function of the H-Y gene appears to have been confirmed. In the mole-vole, X linkage of the testis-organizing H-Y gene is favored over its autosomal inheritance. Only X linkage of the H-Y gene creates a compelling evolutionary need to change the female sex chromosome constitution from XX to XO, and to abandon the dosage compensation by an X inactivation mechanism, so that the nonproductive XH-YX zygote can be eliminated as an embryonic lethal. With regard to the electrophoretic mobilities of three X-linked marker enzymes, however, a genetic difference between the male-specific XH-Y and the female-specific X was not detected. This might reflect a relatively recent speciation."

Nevertheless, the purified enzyme contained as many as seven extraneous protein species when examined by disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The purified preparation also showed antigenic heterogeneity when it reacted in agar gel double immunodiffusion analysis with antibodies produced against it in the rooster. At least some of the extraneous proteins appeared to arise from BB during storage. Subsequently BB was purified to hemogeneity by disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. It was excised from the gel and injected repeatedly with Freund's complete adjuvant into roosters. A single immunoprecipitin line was noted in agar gel double immunodiffusion analysis when partially pure enzyme reacted with the antibodies raised to the electrophoretically pure protein. These antibodies inhibited the enzymatic activity of BB in both soluble and insoluble immune complexes. They did not, however, form immunoprecipitates with or inhibit rabbit muscle (MM) or rabbit hybrid (MB) creatine kinases. The antibodies were therefore specific for BB and did not react with MM or MB."
https://openalex.org/W1544581901,"Saturation curves for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase using the substrate analogues O-propionyl-L-serine, O-butyryl-L-serine, and beta-chloro-L-alanine all exhibit substrate inhibition and yield Km values comparable to O-acetyl-L-serine, except the O-butyryl derivative which has a Km 5-fold higher. Since all analogues are used as substrates and yield similar kinetic parameters in most cases, it is possible that they share a common intermediate. This evidence also suggests that specificity of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase resides in the fact that the beta-substituted moiety on L-serine is a good leaving group. The overall rate equation for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase was derived. A comparison of the numerical integration of the rate equation and an experimental time course is given."
https://openalex.org/W2023368091,"The genes of sheep betaA, betaC, and gamma globin were all present in DNA from erythroid cells which synthesized only betaC globin. Similarly, selective excision of non-expressed genes was shown not to occur during human erythroid differentiation. In contrast, evolutionary deletion of the betaC gene accounts for the inability of many sheep to make this globin."
https://openalex.org/W1550494278,"Abstract Recovery of ribonuclease activity by complementation of peptides of barnase is reported. Activity is restored to barnase-(1-102), which lacks eight amino acids from its COOH terminus, by combination with peptides-(88-110), -(95-110), or -(99-108), and also with succinylated peptide-(88-110). The dissociation constants are about 8 X 10(-6) M for the first two combinations and little, if any, greater for the other two. Based on barnase-(1-102) concentration, up to 80% of native activity is obtained with peptide-(88-110) but only 5 to 20% with the others. The octapeptide-(103-110), equivalent to the residues missing from barnase-(1-102), does not complement barnase-(1-102), suggesting that an intact sequence about His-102 and Tyr-103 is required for activity. Barstar, the natural inhibitor of barnase, completely inhibits all activity of the complementing peptides."

The resulting peptides were purified by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and preparative paper electrophoresis and chromatography. Determination of the amino acid compositions of the cystine-containing peptides purified demonstrated the existence of disulfide bonds linking half-cystine residues 12 and 24, 21 and 51, and 35 and 38. The fourth bond, involving half-cystines 10 and 47, was assigned by difference."
https://openalex.org/W1509412785,"The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was isolated from the spleen of a patient with leukemic reticuloendotheliosis. The unique characteristic of the enzyme is its similar reactivity toward p-nitrophenylphosphate, inorganic pyrophosphate ADP, and ATP. When ATP was incubated with the enzyme, the initial products were ADP and inorganic phosphate. The kinetic data confirmed that these substrates were hydrolyzed by the same enzyme. This type of substrate specificity is clearly different from acid phosphatase and pyrophosphatases previously described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W1569293191,"Rabbits were fed a vitamin E-deficient diet for 7 weeks. Control rabbits, paired for weight, were pair-fed an identical diet supplemented with vitamin E. After 3 weeks the expermental animals showed a rise in serum creatin kinase activity which was attributable to the muscle isoenzyme (MM). No rise in creatine kinase activity or appearance of MM was noted in the serum of the control rabbits. Total creatine kinase activity and MM activity were reduced in the gastrocnemii of the experimental animals while the activities of the brain (BB) and hybird (MB) isoenzymes were increased. The specific activity of BB based on immunochemically determined BB protein was not different from normal in either the experimental or control group. Activation of pre-existing inactive BB is probably not the explanation for increased BB activity in the gastroncnemii of the experimental group."
