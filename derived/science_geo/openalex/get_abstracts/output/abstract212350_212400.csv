The compound is not virucidal and appears to act by interfering with the penetration of the host cell by the virus. In influenza infections of mice, greatest efficacy occurs with treatment at the time of infection; however, there is significant antiviral activity with treatment delayed up to 72 hours after infection. Virus inhibition is not complete and survivors are immune to a challenge infection with the original infecting virus."

https://openalex.org/W2029122327,"MELATONIN (5-methoxy N-acetyltryptamine) has been found to be highly localized in the pineal bodies of a number of mammalian species1,2. The melatonin synthesizing enzyme (hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase (HIOMT)) has also been found in all mammals examined3, and is present only in the pineal gland4. Evidence has been presented demonstrating that melatonin is secreted by the mammalian pineal and acts on the gonads5. This communication describes the enzymatic synthesis of melatonin in a class other than the mammal: birds. It further demonstrates that the synthesis of melatonin is influenced by lighting, which also affects the bird gonads6."

https://openalex.org/W2094262317,"IN 1961 Allison and Blumberg described genetically determined low-density β-lipoprotein differences in human sera revealed by means of a gel-diffusion technique, where about 60 per cent of U.S. white sera formed precipitates with serum from a repeatedly transfused patient (C. de B.)1–3. The new system was called the Ag-system and the two types of human sera revealed by the antiserum C. de B. were called Ag (a +) (reactors) and Ag (a −) (non-reactors). In 1963, Blumberg and Riddell described a second antiserum (the New York antiserum I. M.) reacting with about 97 per cent of U.S. white sera3. Sera forming precipitates with the I. M. antiserum were denoted as Ag (b +), non-reactors as Ag (b −)3. Recently, Bundschuh et al.4 described another anti-Ag serum reacting with about 65 per cent of sera from individuals living in Berlin (D.D.R.)."

https://openalex.org/W1987347077,"THE cells responsible for the immune response vary in susceptibility to inhibitory agents at different stages of the response. Radiation and busulphan (‘Myleran’) inhibit the response to the greatest degree if administered before the antigen and are relatively ineffective if given afterwards1,2. Alkylating agents other than busulphan (the mustards and ethylene imines) and the antimetabolites are most effective if given some 1–3 days after the antigen and are less effective if given beforehand2,3."

https://openalex.org/W1981123860,I HAVE recently demonstrated that a possible explanation to account for the gross memory disorder in some elderly psychiatric patients is a lowered energy of rever-beratory activity in neural cells; a reduction in cerebral excitation which mitigates against short-term storage1. This in turn is related to the pathology associated with senile dementia and cerebral arteriosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W1968057882,"β-METHYLASPARTATE (β-MA) was identified1 as a product of glutamate metabolism in cell-free extracts of Clostridium tetanomorphum. β-MA is a strong antimeta-bolite toward aspartate: it is an inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis from aspartate2 and of urea synthesis from citrulline + aspartate3. In addition, β-MA seems to have certain interesting metabolic activities: it participates in transamination reactions in rat and rabbit liver and brain4 and in Escherichia coli5, and it may also be a precursor in the de novo synthesis of thimine6."
https://openalex.org/W2080682521,TELEOSTS possess both neural and humoral pigmentomotor control. The neural control of teleost melanophores is known to be autonomic1. A melanophore-aggregating centre exists in the medulla of the minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus L.). A spinal pigmentomotor tract passes caudally from the medulla and has a spinal outflow localized around vertebra 15. The pigmentomotor nerves then pass cephalically and caudally along the sympathetic chains and innervate the melanophores through the spinal and trigeminal nerves2. The investigation recorded here was concerned with the location of the spinal pigmentomotor tract.

https://openalex.org/W2095171472,"RECENT investigations have shown that the fluoride content of Greek teeth from the cities of Athens and Salonika was considerably high1,2. This may explain, at least in part, the low prevalence of dental caries observed in Greece3. However, the source of fluoride intake is not known. Water alone could not have been responsible, since the fluoride content of the water supplies of Athens and Salonika has been reported to be low: 0.04 p.p.m. and 0.5 p.p.m., respectively1,2. For an explanation, the opinion was advanced that the diet of the people may include some common foods, produced and consumed in Greece, which are rich in fluoride1. It has been proposed that one such food item, which is consumed in Greece apparently in considerable amounts, is salt produced by solar evaporation of sea water4. The fluoride content of sea salt has been reported to be about 40 p.p.m.5."
