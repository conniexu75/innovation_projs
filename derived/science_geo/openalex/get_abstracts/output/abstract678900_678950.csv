https://openalex.org/W3191451220,"Abstract Genome-wide association studies have uncovered thousands of common variants associated with human disease, but the contribution of rare variants to common disease remains relatively unexplored. The UK Biobank contains detailed phenotypic data linked to medical records for approximately 500,000 participants, offering an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effect of rare variation on a broad collection of traits 1,2 . Here we study the relationships between rare protein-coding variants and 17,361 binary and 1,419 quantitative phenotypes using exome sequencing data from 269,171 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Gene-based collapsing analyses revealed 1,703 statistically significant gene–phenotype associations for binary traits, with a median odds ratio of 12.4. Furthermore, 83% of these associations were undetectable via single-variant association tests, emphasizing the power of gene-based collapsing analysis in the setting of high allelic heterogeneity. Gene–phenotype associations were also significantly enriched for loss-of-function-mediated traits and approved drug targets. Finally, we performed ancestry-specific and pan-ancestry collapsing analyses using exome sequencing data from 11,933 UK Biobank participants of African, East Asian or South Asian ancestry. Our results highlight a significant contribution of rare variants to common disease. Summary statistics are publicly available through an interactive portal ( http://azphewas.com/ )."
https://openalex.org/W3188048115,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced novel stressors into the lives of youth. Identifying factors that protect against the onset of psychopathology in the face of these stressors is critical. We examine a wide range of factors that may protect youth from developing psychopathology during the pandemic. We assessed pandemic-related stressors, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and potential protective factors by combining two longitudinal samples of children and adolescents (N = 224, 7–10 and 13–15 years) assessed prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home orders, and six months later. We evaluated how family behaviors during the stay-at-home orders were related to changes in psychopathology during the pandemic, identified factors that moderate the association of pandemic-related stressors with psychopathology, and determined whether associations varied by age. Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology increased substantially during the pandemic. Higher exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms early in the pandemic and six months later. Having a structured routine, less passive screen time, lower exposure to news media about the pandemic, and to a lesser extent more time in nature and getting adequate sleep were associated with reduced psychopathology. The association between pandemic-related stressors and psychopathology was reduced for youths with limited passive screen time and was absent for children, but not adolescents, with lower news media consumption related to the pandemic. We provide insight into simple, practical steps families can take to promote resilience against mental health problems in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic and protect against psychopathology following pandemic-related stressors."
https://openalex.org/W3191114329,"Mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism are essential for regulating the inflammatory state of monocytes. This state is partially controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Disruption of these processes can also contribute to the initiation of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-dependent N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation has recently been shown to regulate a variety of inflammatory processes. However, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation in affecting mitochondrial metabolism in monocytes under inflammation is unclear, nor is there an established relationship between m<sup>6</sup>A methylation and PGC-1α. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism by which METTL3 acts during oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced monocyte inflammation, where METTL3 and YTH N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) cooperatively modify <i>PGC-1α</i> mRNA, mediating its degradation, decreasing PGC-1α protein levels, and thereby enhancing the inflammatory response. METTL3 coordinated with YTHDF2 to suppress the expression of <i>PGC-1α</i>, as well as that of cytochrome <i>c</i> (CYCS) and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2 (NDUFC2) and reduced ATP production and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). This subsequently increased the accumulation of cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in inflammatory monocytes. These data may provide new insights into the role of METTL3-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification of <i>PGC-1α</i> mRNA in the monocyte inflammation response. These data also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of monocyte-macrophage inflammation-associated diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3187642447,"Coral reefs are increasingly affected by a combination of acute and chronic disturbances from climate change and local stressors. The coral reefs of the Republic of Kiribati’s Gilbert Islands are exposed to frequent heat stress caused by central-Pacific type El Niño events, and may provide a glimpse into the future of coral reefs in other parts of the world, where the frequency of heat stress events will likely increase due to climate change. Reefs in the Gilbert Islands experienced a series of acute disturbances over the past fifteen years, including mass coral bleaching in 2004–2005 and 2009–2010, and an outbreak of the corallivorous sea star Acanthaster cf solaris , or Crown-of-Thorns (CoTs), in 2014. The local chronic pressures including nutrient loading, sedimentation and fishing vary within the island chain, with highest pressures on the reefs in urbanized South Tarawa Atoll. In this study, we examine how recovery from acute disturbances differs across a gradient of human influence in neighboring Tarawa and Abaiang Atolls from 2012 through 2018. Benthic cover and size frequency data suggests that local coral communities have adjusted to the heat stress via shifts in the community composition to more temperature-tolerant taxa and individuals. In densely populated South Tarawa, we document a phase shift to the weedy and less bleaching-sensitive coral Porites rus , which accounted for 81% of all coral cover by 2018. By contrast, in less populated Abaiang, coral communities remained comparatively more diverse (with higher percentages of Pocillopora and the octocoral Heliopora) after the disturbances, but reefs had lower overall hard coral cover (18%) and were dominated by turf algae (41%). The CoTs outbreak caused a decline in the cover and mean size of massive Porites , the only taxa that was a ‘winner’ of the coral bleaching events in Abaiang. Although there are signs of recovery, the long-term trajectory of the benthic communities in Abaiang is not yet clear. We suggest three scenarios: they may remain in their current state (dominated by turf algae), undergo a phase shift to dominance by the macroalgae Halimeda , or recover to dominance by thermally tolerant hard coral genera. These findings provide a rare glimpse at the future of coral reefs around the world and the ways they may be affected by climate change, which may allow scientists to better predict how other reefs will respond to increasing heat stress events across gradients of local human disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3192234188,"The breakthrough potentials of research papers can be explained by their boundary-spanning qualities. Here, for the first time, we apply the structural variation analysis (SVA) model and its affiliated metrics to investigate the extent to which such qualities characterize a group of Nobel Prize winning papers. We find that these papers share remarkable boundary-spanning traits, marked by exceptional abilities to connect disparate and topically-diverse clusters of research papers. Further, their publications exert structural variations on the scale that significantly alters the betweenness centrality distributions of existing intellectual space. Overall, SVA not only provides a set of leading indicators for describing future Nobel Prize winning papers, but also broadens our understanding of the similar prize-winning properties that may have been overlooked among other regular publications."
https://openalex.org/W3187406694,"Introduction Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA scaffolds enriched with antimicrobial proteins. NETs have been implicated in the development of various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigate the association of demographic and cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors with NETs in the general population. Material and methods Citrated plasma was collected from 6449 participants, aged ≥55 years, as part of the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. NETs were quantified by measuring MPO-DNA complex using an ELISA. We used linear regression to determine the associations between MPO-DNA complex and age, sex, cardio-metabolic risk factors, and plasma markers of inflammation and coagulation. Results MPO-DNA complex levels were weakly associated with age (log difference per 10 year increase: -0.04 mAU/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.06;-0.02), a history of coronary heart disease (yes versus no: -0.10 mAU/mL, 95% CI -0.17;-0.03), the use of lipid-lowering drugs (yes versus no: -0.06 mAU/mL, 95% CI -0.12;-0.01), and HDL-cholesterol (per mmol/l increase: -0.07 mAU/mL/, 95% CI -0.12;-0.03). Conclusions Older age, a history of coronary heart disease, the use of lipid-lowering drugs and higher HDL-cholesterol are weakly correlated with lower plasma levels of NETs. These findings show that the effect of CVD risk factors on NETs levels in a general population is only small and may not be of clinical relevance. This supports that NETs may play a more important role in an acute phase of disease than in a steady state situation."

https://openalex.org/W3193068919,"Observational studies suggest alcohol use promotes the development of some adverse cardiometabolic traits but protects against others including outcomes related to coronary artery disease. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between the degree of alcohol consumption and several cardiometabolic traits in the UK Biobank. Using the well-established ADH1B Arg47His variant (rs1229984) and up to 24 additional SNPs recently found to be associated with alcohol consumption in an independent dataset as instruments, we conducted two-stage least squares and inverse weighted variance MR analyses, both as one-sample analyses in the UK Biobank and as two-sample analyses in external consortia. In the UK Biobank inverse variance weighted analyses, we found that one additional drink of alcohol per day was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (beta = 2.65 mmHg [1.40, 3.89]), hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 2.25 [1.41, 3.60]), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.26 [1.07, 1.48]), which were replicated in multivariable analyses. Alcohol was also associated with all cardiovascular disease and all-cause death. A positive association with myocardial infarction did not replicate in multivariable analysis, with suggestive mediation through blood pressure; similarly, a positive association between alcohol use with type 2 diabetes was mitigated by BMI in multivariable analysis. Findings were generally null in replication with two-sample analyses. Alcohol was not protective for any disease outcome with any analysis method, dataset, or strata. Stratifications by sex and smoking in the UK Biobank revealed higher point estimates of risk for several outcomes for men and mixed results for smoking strata, but no statistically significant heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with an overall harmful and/or null effect of alcohol on cardiometabolic health at all levels of use and suggest that even moderate alcohol use should not be promoted as a part of a healthy diet and lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W3187719026,"Growing evidence suggests that human gut bacteria, which comprise the microbiome, are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. An imbalance in the bacterial population in the gut of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has been detected in several studies. This dysbiosis very likely decreases or increases microbiome-derived molecules that are protective or detrimental, respectively, to the human body and those changes are communicated to the brain through the so-called 'gut-brain-axis'. The microbiome-derived molecule queuine is a hypermodified nucleobase enriched in the brain and is exclusively produced by bacteria and salvaged by humans through their gut epithelium. Queuine replaces guanine at the wobble position (position 34) of tRNAs with GUN anticodons and promotes efficient cytoplasmic and mitochondrial mRNA translation. Queuine depletion leads to protein misfolding and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways in mice and human cells. Protein aggregation and mitochondrial impairment are often associated with neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration. To elucidate whether queuine could facilitate protein folding and prevent aggregation and mitochondrial defects that lead to proteinopathy, we tested the effect of chemically synthesized queuine, STL-101, in several in vitro models of neurodegeneration. After neurons were pretreated with STL-101 we observed a significant decrease in hyperphosphorylated alpha-synuclein, a marker of alpha-synuclein aggregation in a PD model of synucleinopathy, as well as a decrease in tau hyperphosphorylation in an acute and a chronic model of AD. Additionally, an associated increase in neuronal survival was found in cells pretreated with STL-101 in both AD models as well as in a neurotoxic model of PD. Measurement of queuine in the plasma of 180 neurologically healthy individuals suggests that healthy humans maintain protective levels of queuine. Our work has identified a new role for queuine in neuroprotection uncovering a therapeutic potential for STL-101 in neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3188490464,"Increasing multimorbidity is often associated with declining physical functioning, with some studies showing a disproportionate impact on functioning when mental health conditions are present. More research is needed because most multimorbidity studies exclude mental health conditions.This study aims to improve our understanding of the association between functional limitation and multimorbidity, including a comparison of those with multimorbidity that includes versus excludes mental health conditions.This is a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of data from The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Functional limitation was defined as the presence of any of 14 activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Multimorbidity, measured by the number of chronic conditions, included mood and anxiety disorders. Logistic regression explored the association between multimorbidity (with and without mental health conditions) and functional limitation. Factor analysis identified common condition clusters to help understand clinical complexity in those with mood/anxiety disorders and the potential influences on functional limitation.There were 51,338 participants, with a similar proportion of men and women (49% versus 51%) and 42% age 65 years or older. Fifteen percent (15%) had no chronic conditions and 17% had 5+. Ten percent (10%) reported at least one ADL or IADL limitation. Odds ratios (ORs) for functional limitation increased with multimorbidity and were generally higher for those with versus without mental health conditions (e.g., ORs from 1 to 5+ chronic conditions increased 1.9 to 15.8 for those with mood/anxiety disorders versus 1.8 to 10.2 for those without). Factor analysis showed that mood/anxiety conditions clustered with somatic conditions (e.g., migraines, bowel/gastrointestinal disorders).This study found higher odds of functional limitation for those with multimorbidity that included versus excluded mental health conditions, at all levels of multimorbidity. It highlights the need for concurrent management of mental and physical comorbidities to prevent functional limitations and future decline. This approach is aligned with the NICE clinical assessment and management guidelines for people with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3189418214,"Genetic studies have identified BIN1 as the second most important risk locus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, it is unclear how mutation of this locus mechanistically promotes Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Here we show the consequences of two coding variants in BIN1 (rs754834233 and rs138047593), both in terms of intracellular beta-amyloid (iAbeta) accumulation and early endosome enlargement, two interrelated early cytopathological AD phenotypes, supporting their association with LOAD risk. We previously found that Bin1 deficiency potentiates iAbeta production by enabling BACE1 cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein in enlarged early endosomes due to decreased BACE1 recycling. Here, we discovered that the expression of the two LOAD mutant forms of Bin1 does not rescue the iAbeta accumulation and early endosome enlargement induced by Bin1 knockdown and recovered by wild-type Bin1. Moreover, the overexpression of Bin1 mutants, but not wild-type Bin1, increased the iAbeta42 fragment by reducing the recycling of BACE1, which accumulated in early endosomes, recapitulating the phenotype of Bin1 knockdown. We showed that the mutations in Bin1 reduced its interaction with BACE1. The endocytic recycling of transferrin was similarly affected, indicating that Bin1 is a general regulator of endocytic recycling. These data demonstrate that the LOAD-coding variants in Bin1 lead to a loss of function in endocytic recycling, which may be an early causal mechanism of LOAD."
https://openalex.org/W3191412880,"Examine patterns of contraceptive use and contraceptive transitions over time among an Australian cohort of women through their later reproductive years.Latent Transition Analysis was performed using data on 8,197 women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health's 1973-78 cohort to identify distinct patterns of contraceptive use across 2006, 2012 and 2018. Women were excluded from the analysis at time points where they were not at risk of an unintended pregnancy. Latent status membership probabilities, item-response probabilities, transitions probabilities and the effect of predictors on latent status membership were estimated and reported.Patterns of contraceptive use were relatively consistent over time, particularly for high efficacy contraceptive methods with 71% of women using long-acting reversible contraceptives in 2012 also using long-acting reversible contraceptives in 2018. Multiple contraceptive use was highest in 2006 when women were aged 28-33 years (19.3%) but declined over time to 14.3% in 2018 when women were aged 40-45 years. Overall, contraceptive patterns stabilised as the women moved into their late 30s and early 40s.Although fertility declines with age, the stability of contraceptive choice and continued use of short-acting contraception among some women suggests that a contraceptive review may be helpful for women during perimenopause so that they are provided with contraceptive options most appropriate to their specific circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3187734842,"Plasmodium parasites cause malaria and are responsible annually for hundreds of thousands of deaths. Kinesins are a superfamily of microtubule-dependent ATPases that play important roles in the parasite replicative machinery, which is a potential target for antiparasite drugs. Kinesin-5, a molecular motor that cross-links microtubules, is an established antimitotic target in other disease contexts, but its mechanism in Plasmodium falciparum is unclear. Here, we characterized P. falciparum kinesin-5 (PfK5) using cryo-EM to determine the motor's nucleotide-dependent microtubule-bound structure and introduced 3D classification of individual motors into our microtubule image processing pipeline to maximize our structural insights. Despite sequence divergence in PfK5, the motor exhibits classical kinesin mechanochemistry, including ATP-induced subdomain rearrangement and cover neck bundle formation, consistent with its plus-ended directed motility. We also observed that an insertion in loop5 of the PfK5 motor domain creates a different environment in the well-characterized human kinesin-5 drug-binding site. Our data reveal the possibility for selective inhibition of PfK5 and can be used to inform future exploration of Plasmodium kinesins as antiparasite targets."
https://openalex.org/W3134181831,"Data collected in criminal investigations may suffer from: (i) incompleteness, due to the covert nature of criminal organisations; (ii) incorrectness, caused by either unintentional data collection errors and intentional deception by criminals; (iii) inconsistency, when the same information is collected into law enforcement databases multiple times, or in different formats. In this paper we analyse nine real criminal networks of different nature (i.e., Mafia networks, criminal street gangs and terrorist organizations) in order to quantify the impact of incomplete data and to determine which network type is most affected by it. The networks are firstly pruned following two specific methods: (i) random edges removal, simulating the scenario in which the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) fail to intercept some calls, or to spot sporadic meetings among suspects; (ii) nodes removal, that catches the hypothesis in which some suspects cannot be intercepted or investigated. Finally we compute spectral (i.e., Adjacency, Laplacian and Normalised Laplacian Spectral Distances) and matrix (i.e., Root Euclidean Distance) distances between the complete and pruned networks, which we compare using statistical analysis. Our investigation identified two main features: first, the overall understanding of the criminal networks remains high even with incomplete data on criminal interactions (i.e., 10% removed edges); second, removing even a small fraction of suspects not investigated (i.e., 2% removed nodes) may lead to significant misinterpretation of the overall network."
https://openalex.org/W3187815618,"Background Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) can lead to gastric cancer. Until now, there have been limited studies of predictors for regression and progression of IM. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with regression or progression of IM for guiding proper management and prevention of gastric cancer. Methods 2,025 patients undergoing gastroscopy in Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were enrolled during September 2017-August 2019. Patients’ data including baseline characteristics, laboratory results, and histopathology of gastric biopsies from University medical database were extensively reviewed. Results 2,025 patients had mean age of 61.3 years and 44.2% were males. Overall H . pylori prevalence was 47.5%. There were 1,551(76.6%) patients with chronic gastritis and 361(17.8%) with IM. Of 400 patients with chronic gastritis having follow-up endoscopy and repeated gastric biopsies, 104(26%) had persistent H . pylori infection and 27(26%) developed IM during mean follow-up time of 24 months. Persistent H . pylori infection was significantly associated with development of IM (OR 3.16, 95%CI 1.56–6.39, p = 0.001). Regression, persistence, and progression of IM were demonstrated in 57.3%, 39.2%, and 3.5% of patients, respectively. Age &gt;65 years, persistent H . pylori infection, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with persistent IM or progression to dysplasia with OR 2.47(95%CI 1.33–4.61, p = 0.004), OR 2.64(95%CI 1.13–6.18, p = 0.025), and OR 2.54(95%CI 1.16–5.54, p = 0.019), respectively. Patients without H . pylori infection had more IM regression than patients with persistent infection (60.4%vs.39.4%, p = 0.035). Patients with persistent H . pylori infection significantly had higher IM progression to dysplasia (15.2%vs.2.1%; OR 11.15, 95%CI 1.18–105.24, p = 0.035) than noninfected. During 24 months of study, 30 patients (1.5%) were diagnosed with gastric cancer. Conclusion Regression of IM could be achieved by successful H . pylori eradication. Persistent H . pylori infection was significantly associated with development and progression of IM to dysplasia. Age &gt;65 years and diabetes mellitus were also significant predictors for IM progression."

Recently, diverse mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in United Kingdom (Alpha) and South Africa (Beta) strains which raise concerns over the potential increase in binding affinity towards the host cell receptor and diminished host neutralization capabilities. In order to study the effect of mutation in the binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with anti-SARS-CoV/CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we have produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD and two variants SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Alpha RBD and Beta RBD) in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. Plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc, Alpha RBD-Fc and Beta RBD-Fc exhibited specific binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor determined by ELISA. Intriguingly, the binding of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins to plant-produced mAbs CR3022, B38, and H4 was found to be different depending on the variant mutation. In contrary to the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc and Alpha RBD-Fc, Beta RBD-Fc variant showed weak binding affinity towards the mAbs. The result suggested that the Beta RBD variant might have acquired partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies compared to other variants. However, further studies with sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals are required to confirm this finding."
https://openalex.org/W3161449705,"Prestige-biased social learning (henceforth “prestige-bias”) occurs when individuals predominantly choose to learn from a prestigious member of their group, i.e. someone who has gained attention, respect and admiration for their success in some domain. Prestige-bias is proposed as an adaptive social-learning strategy as it provides a short-cut to identifying successful group members, without having to assess each person’s success individually. Previous work has documented prestige-bias and verified that it is used adaptively. However, the domain-specificity and generality of prestige-bias has not yet been explicitly addressed experimentally. By domain-specific prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from a prestigious model only within the domain of expertise in which the model acquired their prestige. By domain-general prestige-bias we mean that individuals choose to learn from prestigious models in general, regardless of the domain in which their prestige was earned. To distinguish between domain specific and domain general prestige we ran an online experiment (n = 397) in which participants could copy each other to score points on a general-knowledge quiz with varying topics (domains). Prestige in our task was an emergent property of participants’ copying behaviour. We found participants overwhelmingly preferred domain-specific (same topic) prestige cues to domain-general (across topic) prestige cues. However, when only domain-general or cross-domain (different topic) cues were available, participants overwhelmingly favoured domain-general cues. Finally, when given the choice between cross-domain prestige cues and randomly generated Player IDs, participants favoured cross-domain prestige cues. These results suggest participants were sensitive to the source of prestige, and that they preferred domain-specific cues even though these cues were based on fewer samples (being calculated from one topic) than the domain-general cues (being calculated from all topics). We suggest that the extent to which people employ a domain-specific or domain-general prestige-bias may depend on their experience and understanding of the relationships between domains."
https://openalex.org/W3189142631,"Increasing attention is paid to the interdependence between the ecological and human dimensions to improve the management of natural resources. Understanding how artisanal fishers see and use the common-pool resources in a co-management system may hold the clue to establishing effective coastal fisheries policies or strengthening existing ones. A more comprehensive planning of the system will also have a bearing on how to reduce conflicts and strengthen social networks. We surveyed artisanal fishers and decision-makers to determine their perceptions about the Management and Exploitation Areas of Benthic Resources (known as MEABR) in Chile’s Biobio region. We performed a field study from November 2018 to August 2019, applying a set of questionnaires to determine the ecological and human attributes that contribute to MEABR outcomes, and then constructed composite scores for those attributes according to a multidimensional scaling technique (“Rapfish”). We find that fishers have different perspectives: surprisingly, women highlighted that the institutional dimension was the most influential on MEABR performance, whereas men highlighted the ecological and economic outcomes. The decision-makers’ role in the MEABR system was considered adequate, but communication and socialization of regulations were irregular. Results also showed that fishers expressed dissatisfaction with illegal fishing practices (poaching), productivity, profits, and conflicts inside and outside the MEABRs. Our study allowed us to better understand how the MEABR has developed in the region. We recommend strengthening local management strategies with particular attention paid to networking among stakeholders, including gender inclusive relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3189320191,"Background Video analysis is one of the most commonly applied methods for analysing football injuries. Purpose The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of video analysis for recording head injuries in professional football from official matches in the four highest men’s professional football leagues in Germany. Methods In this cohort study, head injuries detected by means of video analysis of all official matches over one season (2017–18) were compared to head injuries registered with the German statutory accident insurance. Results Our video analysis yielded 359 head injuries of 287 players. The comparison of head injuries found in our video analysis to those registered with the accident insurance only yielded a match in 23.1% (n = 83), which presents a rather low verification rate. The verification rates varied between the leagues (7.0–30.8%). All injuries documented in the accident insurance registry were found in the video analysis (100%). The types of head injury most often verified by the accident insurance registry (n = 83) were contusion (43.4%), bone fractures (19.3%) and skin lacerations (18.1%). Only 66 of the 359 head injuries (18.4%) resulted in absence from at least one training session and involved a mean time loss of 18.5 days (1–87 days). Conclusion The mismatch between the number of head injuries found in the video analysis and head injuries registered with the accident insurance is an important methodological issue in scientific research. The low verification rate seems to be due to the unclear correlation between injury severity and clinical consequences of head injuries detected by means of video analysis and the failure of football clubs to register minor head injuries with the accident insurance."
https://openalex.org/W3118606406,"Can outside interventions foster socio-culturally diverse friendships? We executed a large field experiment that randomized the seating charts of 182 3 rd through 8 th grade classrooms ( N = 2,966 students) for the duration of one semester. We found that being seated next to each other increased the probability of a mutual friendship from 15% to 22% on average. Furthermore, induced proximity increased the latent propensity toward friendship equally for all students, regardless of students’ dyadic similarity with respect to educational achievement, gender, and ethnicity. However, the probability of a manifest friendship increased more among similar than among dissimilar students—a pattern mainly driven by gender. Our findings demonstrate that a scalable light-touch intervention can affect face-to-face networks and foster diverse friendships in groups that already know each other, but they also highlight that transgressing boundaries, especially those defined by gender, remains an uphill battle."
https://openalex.org/W3190278629,"Fused in sarcoma (FUS) encodes an RNA-binding protein with diverse roles in transcriptional activation and RNA splicing. While oncogenic fusions of FUS and transcription factor DNA-binding domains are associated with soft tissue sarcomas, dominant mutations in FUS can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. FUS has also been implicated in genome maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms of its actions in genome stability are unknown. Here, we applied gene editing, functional reconstitution, and integrated proteomics and transcriptomics to illuminate roles for FUS in DNA replication and repair. Consistent with a supportive role in DNA double-strand break repair, FUS-deficient cells exhibited subtle alterations in the recruitment and retention of double-strand break-associated factors, including 53BP1 and BRCA1. FUS-/- cells also exhibited reduced proliferative potential that correlated with reduced speed of replication fork progression, diminished loading of prereplication complexes, enhanced micronucleus formation, and attenuated expression and splicing of S-phase-associated genes. Finally, FUS-deficient cells exhibited genome-wide alterations in DNA replication timing that were reversed upon re-expression of FUS complementary DNA. We also showed that FUS-dependent replication domains were enriched in transcriptionally active chromatin and that FUS was required for the timely replication of transcriptionally active DNA. These findings suggest that alterations in DNA replication kinetics and programming contribute to genome instability and functional defects in FUS-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W3190625088,"The naive social Darwinism, also called the Competitive Jungle Belief (CJB), according to the theory of the Dual-Process Motivational (DPM) model, is recognized as an expanded perceptual scheme acting as a cognitive mediator between deep individual characteristics and the area of socio-political attitudes and ideologies. This article aims to show the individual differences that can be dispositional characteristics to believe in the Competitive Jungle scheme’s principles. The presented studies’ main theoretical question is to find out whether the CJB bases on positive ""individual resources"" or rather some psychological deficits. In an extensive survey study, including four random-representative samples of adults Poles (with N ranging from 624 to 853 respondents), we tested the predictive power of the five categories of variables: 1) attachment styles; 2) Big Five personality traits; 3) Dark Triad of personality; 4) basic human values and 5) moral judgments. The results showed the psychological profile of social Darwinists as clearly dysfunctional in terms of personal life quality. They express characteristics like admiration for power and desire to dominate, pursue one’s goals at all costs, exploitative attitude towards people, and hostility. On the other hand, they reveal a fearful style in close relations with others and have low self-esteem and low self-sufficiency. From the societal perspective, such beliefs make up a vision of social life that is unfavorable for building a cooperative, helpful, and relatively egalitarian society. The supreme idea that only those who do not sympathize with others and are ready to use them can be successful and survive is far from the principles of liberal democracy."
https://openalex.org/W3188442326,"Epidemiological and genetic studies on COVID-19 are currently hindered by inconsistent and limited testing policies to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to predict COVID-19 cases using cross-sectional self-reported disease-related symptoms. Here, we demonstrate that this COVID-19 prediction model has reasonable and consistent performance across multiple independent cohorts and that our attempt to improve upon this model did not result in improved predictions. Using the existing COVID-19 prediction model, we then conducted a GWAS on the predicted phenotype using a total of 1,865 predicted cases and 29,174 controls. While we did not find any common, large-effect variants that reached genome-wide significance, we do observe suggestive genetic associations at two SNPs (rs11844522, p = 1.9x10-7; rs5798227, p = 2.2x10-7). Explorative analyses furthermore suggest that genetic variants associated with other viral infectious diseases do not overlap with COVID-19 susceptibility and that severity of COVID-19 may have a different genetic architecture compared to COVID-19 susceptibility. This study represents a first effort that uses a symptom-based predicted phenotype as a proxy for COVID-19 in our pursuit of understanding the genetic susceptibility of the disease. We conclude that the inclusion of symptom-based predicted cases could be a useful strategy in a scenario of limited testing, either during the current COVID-19 pandemic or any future viral outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3188850577,"13 Reasons Why is a Netflix original series adapted from Jay Asher’s 2007 young adult novel with the same title. Season 1 premiered on March 31, 2017 and featured the sensitive issue of teen suicide along with bullying, substance use, depression, and sexual assault. Unlike the typical teen dramas on popular streaming platforms, this show was created not only for entertainment, but also to stimulate conversations about taboo topics that people often shy away from. However, it also caused significant controversy, especially criticism around the main character Hannah’s suicide scene. More than three years into the initial controversy and at least two dozen scholarly publications later, this study is the first to examine the entertainment narrative content of 13 Reasons Why Season 1 to better understand how these health and social issues were portrayed in the show, what specific examples we could identify as potential behavioral modeling, and to what degree it complied with the 2017 WHO guidelines for media professionals. We used the framing theory and social cognitive theory in communication research and media studies as our guiding conceptual frameworks and a narrative analysis approach to investigate a total of 660 cut scenes in all 13 episodes. Our findings provided empirical evidence, along with contextual information and detailed examples, to demonstrate that a popular entertainment program like the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why serves as a double-edged sword. The production team’s good will and due diligence are commendable. Yet, additional steps can be taken in the future to effectively promote professional resources and reduce viewers’ risks, especially the most vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W3189113687,"During general anesthesia, both behavioral and autonomic changes are caused by the administration of anesthetics such as propofol. Propofol produces unconsciousness by creating highly structured oscillations in brain circuits. The anesthetic also has autonomic effects due to its actions as a vasodilator and myocardial depressant. Understanding how autonomic dynamics change in relation to propofol-induced unconsciousness is an important scientific and clinical question since anesthesiologists often infer changes in level of unconsciousness from changes in autonomic dynamics. Therefore, we present a framework combining physiology-based statistical models that have been developed specifically for heart rate variability and electrodermal activity with a robust statistical tool to compare behavioral and multimodal autonomic changes before, during, and after propofol-induced unconsciousness. We tested this framework on physiological data recorded from nine healthy volunteers during computer-controlled administration of propofol. We studied how autonomic dynamics related to behavioral markers of unconsciousness: 1) overall, 2) during the transitions of loss and recovery of consciousness, and 3) before and after anesthesia as a whole. Our results show a strong relationship between behavioral state of consciousness and autonomic dynamics. All of our prediction models showed areas under the curve greater than 0.75 despite the presence of non-monotonic relationships among the variables during the transition periods. Our analysis highlighted the specific roles played by fast versus slow changes, parasympathetic vs sympathetic activity, heart rate variability vs electrodermal activity, and even pulse rate vs pulse amplitude information within electrodermal activity. Further advancement upon this work can quantify the complex and subject-specific relationship between behavioral changes and autonomic dynamics before, during, and after anesthesia. However, this work demonstrates the potential of a multimodal, physiologically-informed, statistical approach to characterize autonomic dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3189604652,"The replication of DNA is an essential process in all domains of life. A protein often involved in replication is the sliding clamp. The sliding clamp encircles the DNA and helps replicative polymerase stay attached to the replication machinery increasing the processivity of the polymerase. In eukaryotes and archaea, the sliding clamp is called the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and consists of two domains. This PCNA forms a trimer encircling the DNA as a hexamer. In bacteria, the structure of the sliding clamp is highly conserved, but the protein itself, called beta clamp, contains three domains, which dimerize to form a hexamer. The bulk of literature touts a conservation of the structure of the sliding clamp, but fails to recognize the conservation of protein sequence among sliding clamps. In this paper, we have used PSI blast to the second iteration in NCBI to show a statistically significant sequence homology between Pyrococcus furiosus PCNA and Kallipyga gabonensis beta clamp. The last two domains of beta clamp align with the two domains of PCNA. This homology data demonstrates that PCNA and beta clamp arose from a common ancestor. In this paper, we have further used beta clamp and PCNA sequences from diverse bacteria, archaea and eukarya to build maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Most, but not all, species in different domains of life harbor one sliding clamp from vertical inheritance. Some of these species that have two or more sliding clamps have acquired them from gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer events."

https://openalex.org/W3190542093,"Without effective homeostatic systems in place, excess copper (Cu) is universally toxic to organisms. While increased utilization of anthropogenic Cu in the environment has driven the diversification of Cu-resistance systems within enterobacteria, little research has focused on how this change in bacterial architecture impacts host organisms that need to maintain their own Cu homeostasis. Therefore, we utilized a simplified host-microbe system to determine whether the efficiency of one bacterial Cu-resistance system, increasing Cu-efflux capacity via the ubiquitous CusRS two-component system, contributes to the availability and subsequent toxicity of Cu in host Caenorhabditis elegans nematode. We found that a fully functional Cu-efflux system in bacteria increased the severity of Cu toxicity in host nematodes without increasing the C. elegans Cu-body burden. Instead, increased Cu toxicity in the host was associated with reduced expression of a protective metal stress-response gene, numr-1, in the posterior pharynx of nematodes where pharyngeal grinding breaks apart ingested bacteria before passing into the digestive tract. The spatial localization of numr-1 transgene activation and loss of bacterially dependent Cu-resistance in nematodes without an effective numr-1 response support the hypothesis that numr-1 is responsive to the bacterial Cu-efflux capacity. We propose that the bacterial Cu-efflux capacity acts as a robust spatial determinant for a host's response to chronic Cu stress."
https://openalex.org/W3190506780,"Background Cancer patients are at significant risk of developing sepsis due to underlying malignancy and necessary treatments. Little is known about the economic burden of sepsis in this high-risk population. We estimate the short- and long-term healthcare costs of care of cancer patients with and without sepsis using individual-level linked-administrative data. Methods We conducted a population-based matched cohort study of cancer patients aged ≥18, diagnosed between 2010 and 2017. Cases were identified if diagnosed with sepsis during the study period, and were matched 1:1 by age, sex, cancer type and other variables to controls without sepsis. Mean costs (2018 Canadian dollars) for patients with and without sepsis up to 5 years were estimated adjusted using survival probabilities at partitioned intervals. We estimated excess cost associated with sepsis presented as a cost difference between the two cohorts. Haematological and solid cancers were analysed separately. Results 77,483 cancer patients with sepsis were identified and matched. 64.3% of the cohort were aged ≥65, 46.3% female and 17.8% with haematological malignancies. Among solid tumour patients, the excess cost of care among patients who developed sepsis was $29,081 (95%CI, $28,404-$29,757) in the first year, rising to $60,714 (95%CI, $59,729-$61,698) over 5 years. This was higher for haematology patients; $46,154 (95%CI, $45,505-$46,804) in year 1, increasing to $75,931 (95%CI, $74,895-$76,968). Conclusions Sepsis imposes substantial economic burden and can result in a doubling of cancer care costs, particularly during the first year of cancer diagnosis. These estimates are helpful in improving our understanding of burden of sepsis along the cancer pathway and to deploy targeted strategies to alleviate this burden."

Although augmented reality assistance can be hypothesized to improve pilots' performance and the safety of landing maneuvers by guiding action toward optimal behavior in complex and stressful situations, the question of the optimal information to be displayed to feed the pilots' natural information-movement coupling remains to be investigated. Novice participants were instructed to land a simplified helicopter on a ship in a virtual reality simulator while minimizing energy at impact and landing duration. The wave amplitude and related ship heave were manipulated. We compared the benefits of two types of visual augmentation whose design was based on either solving cockpit-induced visual occlusion problems or strengthening the online regulation of the deceleration by keeping the current [Formula: see text] variable around an ideal value of -0.5 to conduct smooth and efficient landing. Our results showed that the second augmentation, ecologically grounded, offers benefits at several levels of analysis. It decreases the landing duration, improves the control of the helicopter displacement, and sharpens the sensitivity to changes in [Formula: see text]. This underlines the importance for designers of augmented reality systems to collaborate with psychologists to identify the relevant perceptual-motor strategy that must be encouraged before designing an augmentation that will enhance it."

We evaluated Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, Inc. (CARE's) community score card (CSC) in 11 purposively selected health facilities, assessing the effect on: (1) retention in PMTCT services, (2) uptake of early infant diagnosis (EID), (3) collective efficacy among clients, and (4) self-efficacy among health care workers (HCWs) in delivering quality services. The CSC is a participatory community approach. In this study, HCWs and PMTCT clients identified issues impacting PMTCT service quality and uptake and implemented actions for improvement. A mixed-methods, pre- and post-intervention design was used to evaluate the intervention. We abstracted routine clinical data on retention in PMTCT services for HIV-positive clients attending their first antenatal care visit and EID uptake for their infants for 8-month periods before and after implementation. To assess collective efficacy and self-efficacy, we administered questionnaires and conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) pre- and post-intervention with PMTCT clients recruited from CSC participants, and HCWs providing HIV care from facilities. Retention of HIV-positive women in PMTCT services at three and six months and EID uptake was not significantly different pre- and post-implementation. For the clients, the collective efficacy scale average improved significantly post-intervention, (p = 0.003). HCW self-efficacy scale average did not improve. Results from the FGDs highlighted a strengthened relationship between HCWs and PMTCT clients, with clients reporting increased satisfaction with services. However, the data indicated continued challenges with stigma and fear of disclosure. While CSC may foster mutual trust and respect between HCWs and PMTCT clients, we did not find it improved PMTCT retention or EID uptake within the short duration of the study period. More research is needed on ways to improve service quality and decrease stigmatized behaviors, such as HIV testing and treatment services, as well as the longer-term impacts of interventions like the CSC on clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3191178887,"Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is effective for menopausal symptoms, however, its use is also associated with risks of serious health conditions including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism. MHT-related health risks increase with longer durations of use. In Australia, while overall MHT use fell when risk-related findings were published in 2002, a significant number of women continue using MHT long-term. We aimed to examine socio-demographic, health-related and lifestyle characteristics in relation to post-2002 MHT use, and to compare use for &lt;5 and ≥5 years. Data from 1,561 participants from an Australian, national, cross-sectional survey of women aged 50–69 in 2013 were analysed. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression for characteristics related to overall MHT use post-2002 and multinomial logistic regression for associations between MHT duration of use [never/&lt;5 years/≥5 years] and personal characteristics, adjusting for sociodemographic, reproductive, health and lifestyle factors. Post-2002 MHT use was associated with increasing age (p-trend&lt;0.001), hysterectomy versus no hysterectomy (OR:2.55, 95%CI = 1.85–3.51), bilateral oophorectomy vs no oophorectomy (OR:1.66, 95%CI = 1.09–2.53), and ever- versus never-use of therapies other than MHT for menopausal symptoms (OR:1.93, 95%CI = 1.48–2.57). Women with prior breast cancer (OR:0.35, 95%CI = 0.17–0.74) and with more children (p-trend = 0.034) were less likely than other women to use MHT. Prior hysterectomy was more strongly associated with MHT use for ≥5 years than for &lt;5 years (p = 0.004). Ever-use of non-MHT menopausal therapies was associated with MHT use for &lt;5 years but not with longer-term use (p = 0.004). This study reinforces the need for MHT users and their clinicians to re-evaluate continued MHT use on an ongoing basis."

Based on an analysis of the engineering and construction chains and agent relationships and agent networks of industrial projects, a complex network of the engineering and construction agents of industrial projects is established, and the complex network structural holes theory is applied to study the nonrepeated relationships among agents in industrial projects. Assuming agents are linked through contract relations and the most critical contract index between the agents in the contract amount, through structural hole analysis considering the EPC and PMC model, the aggregate constraint list is obtained, 2D network diagram and 3D network diagram are shown. According to the aggregate constraint value, the EPC contractor with the minimum aggregate constraint value and the project management company with the minimum aggregate constraint value are the critical agent in EPC and PMC model.

https://openalex.org/W3192988567,"Bats are highly gregarious animals, displaying a large spectrum of social systems with different organizational structures. One important factor shaping sociality is group stability. To maintain group cohesion and stability, bats often rely on vocal communication. The Honduran white bat, Ectophylla alba , exhibits an unusual social structure compared to other tent-roosting species. This small white-furred bat lives in perennial stable mixed-sex groups. Tent construction requires several individuals and, as the only tent roosting species so far, involves both sexes. The bats´ social system and ecology render this species an interesting candidate to study social behaviour and vocal communication. In our study, we investigated the social behaviour and vocalizations of E . alba in the tent by observing two stable groups, including pups, in the wild. We documented 16 different behaviours, among others play and fur chewing, a behaviour presumably used for scent-marking. Moreover, we found 10 distinct social call types in addition to echolocation calls, and for seven call types we were able to identify the corresponding broad behavioural context. Most of the social call types were affiliative, including two types of contact calls, maternal directive calls, pup isolation calls and a call type related to the fur-chewing behaviour. In sum, this study entails an ethogram and describes the social vocalizations of a tent-roosting phyllostomid bat, providing the basis for further in-depth studies about the sociality and vocal communication in E . alba ."
https://openalex.org/W3193249424,"Growth is a significant factor that results in deformations of tubular organs, and particular deformations associated with growth enable tubular organs to perform certain physiological functions. Configuring growth profiles that achieve particular deformation patterns is critical for analyzing potential pathological conditions and for developing corresponding clinical treatments for tubular organ dysfunctions. However, deformation-targeted growth is rarely studied. In this article, the human cervix during pregnancy is studied as an example to show how cervical thinning and dilation are generated by growth. An advanced hyperelasticity theory called morphoelasticity is employed to model the deformations, and a growth tensor is used to represent growth in three principle directions. The computational results demonstrate that both negative radial growth and positive circumferential growth facilitate thinning and dilation. Modeling such mixed growth represents an advancement beyond commonly used uniform growth inside tissues to study tubular deformations. The results reveal that complex growth may occur inside tissues to achieve certain tubular deformations. Integration of further biochemical and cellular activities that initiate and mediate such complex growth remains to be explored."

https://openalex.org/W3188301275,"Tail flukes as well as the dorsal fin are the apomorphic traits of cetaceans which appeared during the evolutionary process of adaptation to the aquatic life. Both appendages present a wing-like shape associated with lift generation and low drag. We hypothesized that the evolution of fins as lifting structures led to a generic wing design, where the dimensionless parameters of the fin cross-sections are invariant with respect to the body length and taxonomy of small cetaceans (Hypothesis I). We also hypothesized that constraints on variability of a generic fin shape are associated with the primary function of the fin as a fixed or flapping hydrofoil (Hypothesis II). To verify these hypotheses, we examined how the variation in the fin’s morphological traits is linked to the primary function, species and body length. Hydrodynamic characteristics of the fin cross-sections were examined with the CFD software and compared with similar engineered airfoils. Generic wing design of both fins was found in a wing-like planform and a streamlined cross-sectional geometry optimized for lift generation. Divergence in a generic fin shape both on the planform and cross-sectional level was found to be related with the fin specialization in fixed or flapping hydrofoil function. Cross-sections of the dorsal fin were found to be optimized for the narrow range of small angles of attack. Cross-sections of tail flukes were found to be more stable for higher angles of attack and had gradual stall characteristics. The obtained results provide an insight into the divergent evolutionary pathways of a generic wing-like shape of the fins of cetaceans under specific demands of thrust production, swimming stability and turning control."

https://openalex.org/W3190401855,"Background Settings where Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are provided to stabilize patients and transport them to locations better equipped to provide comprehensive care, “prehospital settings,” are not frequently considered when designing packaged products. Packaging design is an understudied area, potentially impacting both healthcare provider behavior and patient outcomes. Our objectives were to: 1) describe difficulties associated with packaging in prehospital settings 2) investigate the coping strategies used by paramedics when difficulties occurred, and 3) assess the potential impacts these difficulties had on patient care. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was distributed via email using the National EMS Certification database maintained by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) to a random sample of nationally-certified paramedics. Eligible respondents were aged 18 and older, employed as paramedics and had administered care in a prehospital setting within the previous 12 months. Survey items explored difficulties experienced and coping strategies used when difficulty was encountered identifying or opening medications and/or medical supplies. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were calculated to analyse responses for trends. Results Of the 12,000 emails sent, 1,912 participants responded (response rate = 16%). After removing respondents who had not administered care within the past 12 months and partial surveys, data from 1,702 respondents were analysed. Nearly 20% of all respondents reported that they had experienced difficulties identifying (21.1%) or opening (20.5%) medications and identifying (17.0%) or opening (23.4%) medical supplies within the past year. Between 1.2% (identifying a medication) and 3.0% (opening supplies) of those included in the analysis indicated that reported difficulties had negatively impacted patient care. Common coping strategies reported to deal with difficulty opening included partner assistance, tool use (scissors, pens, and knives), and the use of teeth, all potential pathways for the transmission of microbes, conceivably further impacting outcomes. Conclusion More thoughtfully designed packaging for prehospital settings has the potential to benefit both EMS providers and the patients that they care for."

Previous literature has established the capacity of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to predict soil pH, but limitations of CARTs in this context have not been fully explored. The current study collected soil pH, climatic, and topographic data from 100 locations across New York’s Temperate Deciduous Forests (in the United States of America) to investigate the extrapolative capacity of a previously developed CART model as compared to novel CART and random forest (RF) models. Results showed that the previously developed CART underperformed in terms of predictive accuracy (RRMSE = 14.52%) when compared to a novel tree (RRMSE = 9.33%), and that a novel random forest outperformed both models (RRMSE = 8.88%), though its predictions did not differ significantly from the novel tree (p = 0.26). The most important predictors for model construction were climatic factors. These findings confirm existing reports that CART models are constrained by the spatial autocorrelation of geographic data and encourage the restricted application of relevant machine learning models to regions from which training data was collected. They also contradict previous literature implying that random forests should meaningfully boost the predictive accuracy of CARTs in the context of soil pH."

Sixty-four patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the palatine tonsil were included. A ROI was drawn, including all slices, to involve the entire tumor. The contralateral normal tonsil was used for comparison with the tumors. Texture analysis parameters, mean, standard deviation (SD), entropy, mean positive pixels, skewness, and kurtosis were obtained using commercially available software. Parameters were compared between the tumor and the normal palatine tonsils. Comparisons were also performed among early tonsil cancer, advanced tonsil cancer, and normal tonsils. An ROC curve analysis was performed to assess discrimination of tumor from normal tonsils. Correlation between texture analysis and 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed. Compared to normal tonsils, the tumors showed a significantly lower mean, higher SD, higher entropy, lower skewness, and higher kurtosis on most filters (p<0.001). On comparisons among normal tonsils, early cancers, and advanced tonsil cancers, SD and entropy showed significantly higher values on all filters (p<0.001) between early cancers and normal tonsils. The AUC from the ROC analysis was 0.91, obtained from the entropy. A mild correlation was shown between texture parameters and metabolic parameters. The texture analysis parameters, especially entropy, showed significant differences in contrast-enhanced CT results between tumor and normal tonsils, and between early tonsil cancers and normal tonsils. Texture analysis can be useful as an adjunctive tool for the diagnosis of tonsil cancers."

https://openalex.org/W3192610664,"An inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ASA) causes the lysosomal storage disease metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by massive intralysosomal storage of the acidic glycosphingolipid sulfatide and progressive demyelination. Lyso-sulfatide, which differs from sulfatide by the lack of the N-linked fatty acid, also accumulates in MLD and is considered a key driver of pathology although its concentrations are far below sulfatide levels. However, the metabolic origin of lyso-sulfatide is unknown. We show here that ASA-deficient murine macrophages and microglial cells express an endo-N-deacylase that cleaves the N-linked fatty acid from sulfatide. An ASA-deficient astrocytoma cell line devoid of this activity was used to identify the enzyme by overexpressing 13 deacylases with potentially matching substrate specificities. Hydrolysis of sulfatide was detected only in cells overexpressing the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). A cell-free assay with recombinant FAAH confirmed the novel role of this enzyme in sulfatide hydrolysis. Consistent with the in vitro data, deletion of FAAH lowered lyso-sulfatide levels in a mouse model of MLD. Regardless of the established cytotoxicity of lyso-sulfatide and the anti-inflammatory effects of FAAH inhibition seen in mouse models of several neurological diseases, genetic inactivation of FAAH did not mitigate, but rather exacerbated the disease phenotype of MLD mice. This unexpected finding was reflected by worsening of rotarod performance, increase of anxiety-related exploratory activity, aggravation of peripheral neuropathy, and reduced life expectancy. Thus, we conclude that FAAH has a protective function in MLD and may represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of this fatal condition."

After successfully preparing a rabbit model of diabetic hindlimb vascular disease, 16 rabbits were randomly assigned to two groups. Of these, 8 rabbits received PTA surgery alone (PTA group), and the other 8 rabbits received PTA and HUCBSC (PTA+HUCBSC group) treatments. Five more healthy rabbits were set as healthy control (HC group). Samples were collected after 4 weeks of treatment. The expressions of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) and calcineurin A (CnA) in the diseased artery were detected by immunofluorescence staining. The distribution of HUCBSCs was observed by pathological examination in transplanted artery, distal artery, and liver. Cytology experiments were applied to assess the levels of JAK and STAT3, and the migration and proliferation of human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMC). In the rabbit model of diabetic vascular lesions in the hindlimbs, we found the stenosis of the femoral artery became more and more serious with time, and the expression level of PCNA positive cells was also gradually increased. The expression levels of RCAN1 and CnA in the PTA+HUCBSC group were significantly lower than those in PTA group. HUCBSC inhibited the migration and proliferation of HA-VSMC via JAK/STAT3 pathway. After HUCBSC local transplantation, HUCBSC had no distal tissue distribution. HUCBSC transplantation may prevent restenosis after PTA of diabetic hindlimb vascular disease through JAK/STAT3 pathway."

Our population-based, case-control study included 1366 individuals (664 gastric cancer cases and 702 controls) from Western Honduras, a high incidence region of Latin America. CagA seropositivity was strongly associated with cancer (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 2.6, 5.1). The ODC1 variant rs2302615 was associated with gastric cancer (OR = 1.36; p = 0.018) in a model adjusted for age, sex, and CagA serostatus. Two additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CASP1 (rs530537) and TLR4 (rs1927914) genes were also associated with gastric cancer in univariate models as well as models adjusted for age, sex, and CagA serostatus. The ODC1 SNP association with gastric cancer was stronger in individuals who carried the TT genotype at the associating TLR4 polymorphism, rs1927914 (OR = 1.77; p = 1.85 × 10−3).

https://openalex.org/W3188382399,"Objective Approximately 50% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients have cognitive and behavioural dysfunction in varying degrees and forms. Previous studies have shown that cognitive and behavioural changes may indicate a poor prognosis, and cognitive function gradually deteriorates over the course of disease, but the results of different studies have been inconsistent. In addition, there are relatively limited long-term follow-up studies tracking death as an endpoint. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical prognostic characteristics of ALS patients with cognitive behavioural changes through long-term follow-up in a cohort. Methods A total of 87 ALS patients from 2014 to 2015 in the Third Hospital of Peking University were selected and divided into a pure ALS group, an ALS with behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (ALS-bvFTD) group, and an ALS with cognitive and behaviour changes group. All patients were followed up for 60 months. The main end point was death and tracheotomy. Results There was no significant difference in survival curve between pure ALS and ALS with cognitive and behavioural change group, but the survival time of ALS-bvFTD group was significantly lower than the other two groups (P &lt; 0.001). For those who was followed up to the endpoint, the survival time of the ALS-bvFTD group was significantly shorter than that of the pure ALS group (t = 5.33, p &lt; 0.001) or the ALS with cognitive and behaviour changes group (t = 4.25, p &lt; 0.001). The progression rate of ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (FRS-R) scores from recruitment to endpoint was significantly faster in the ALS-bvFTD group than in the pure ALS group (z = 2.68, p = 0.01) or the ALS with cognitive and behavioural changes group (z = 2.75, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in survival time (t = 0.52, P = 0.60) or FRS-R score progression rate (z = 0.31, p = 0.76) between the pure ALS group and the ALS with cognitive and behavioural changes group. The total Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Screen (ECAS) score was positively correlated with survival time (r = 0.38, p = 0.01). Conclusion ALS-bvFTD patients have shorter survival time. The total ECAS score may be correlated with survival time."
https://openalex.org/W3190673082,"Aging is universal, yet characterizing the molecular changes that occur in aging which lead to an increased risk for neurological disease remains a challenging problem. Aging affects the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which governs executive function, learning, and memory. Previous sequencing studies have demonstrated that aging alters gene expression in the PFC, however the extent to which these changes are conserved across species and are meaningful in neurodegeneration is unknown. Identifying conserved, age-related genetic and morphological changes in the brain allows application of the wealth of tools available to study underlying mechanisms in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. RNA sequencing data from human PFC and fly heads were analyzed to determine conserved transcriptome signatures of age. Our analysis revealed that expression of 50 conserved genes can accurately determine age in Drosophila (R2 = 0.85) and humans (R2 = 0.46). These transcriptome signatures were also able to classify Drosophila into three age groups with a mean accuracy of 88% and classify human samples with a mean accuracy of 69%. Overall, this work identifies 50 highly conserved aging-associated genetic changes in the brain that can be further studied in model organisms and demonstrates a novel approach to uncovering genetic changes conserved across species from multi-study public databases."
