https://openalex.org/W1536635467,"The ability to adapt successfully to periods of relative hypoxia is crucial to the survival of all higher life forms. Several genes have previously been identified which are up-regulated in response to hypoxia; these include the genes encoding erythropoietin (Epo), platelet-derived growth factor B chain, endothelin, interleukin-1 alpha, ornithine decarboxylase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia is sensed remain enigmatic. In addition, it is unknown whether the genes mentioned share a common oxygen-sensing signal transduction pathway. In this report we demonstrate multiple similarities between the oxygen-sensing mechanisms regulating the expression of VEGF and Epo. The expression of both mRNAs is significantly up-regulated by hypoxia and cobalt chloride (CoCl2), and the half-life of both mRNAs is markedly prolonged by cycloheximide. In addition, hypoxic induction of both Epo and VEGF is inhibited by carbon monoxide. As part of our investigation into the signal transduction pathway responsible for the hypoxia and cobalt induction of these genes, we discovered that the expression of members of the jun and fos protooncogene families is also up-regulated early after exposure to either of these stimuli. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the mechanism(s) by which hypoxia is sensed at a molecular level may be highly conserved and tightly regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1543776771,"Abstract We recently reported the discovery that a series of novel prostaglandin (PG)F2-like compounds (F2-isoprostanes) are produced in vivo independent of the cyclooxygenase as products of free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. F2-isoprostanes are initially formed in situ from arachidonic acid esterified to phospholipids and then released preformed. We have now investigated whether PGD2/E2-like isoprostanes are also produced by rearrangement of the PGG2-like intermediates involved in isoprostane formation. Using a variety of approaches utilizing mass spectrometry, compelling evidence was obtained for the presence of D2/E2-isoprostane-containing phosphospholipids in the liver (85 +/- 33 ng/g of liver) and free D2/E2-isoprostanes in the circulation (215 +/- 90 pg/ml) of rats treated with CCl4 to induce lipid peroxidation. In untreated rats, levels of D2/E2-isoprostanes esterified in liver phospholipids were much lower (0.90 +/- 0.10 ng/g), and free compounds could not be detected in the circulation (< 5 pg/ml). Interestingly, one of the E2-isoprostanes that would be expected to be formed in abundance, 8-epi-PGE2, was found to be a potent renal vasoconstrictor, and these effects could be abrogated by SQ29548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist. Further understanding of the biological consequences of the formation of these novel compounds and factors that influence their formation may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of oxidant injury."
https://openalex.org/W1504197390,"The role of heparin or heparan sulfates in the interaction of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) with its high affinity receptor were investigated using purified extracellular ligand-binding region of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and intact receptors expressed in a myeloid cell line (32D) that does not express detectable levels of heparan sulfate proteoglycans or in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in heparan sulfate synthesis. The purified extracellular domain of FGFR-1 formed complexes with 125I-bFGF both in the presence or absence of heparin. Intact FGFR-1 expressed in 32D cells also bound the same amount of 125I-bFGF in the presence or absence of heparin when saturating concentrations of bFGF were used. Varying the concentration of 125I-bFGF showed that heparin increased the amount of 125I-bFGF bound at low bFGF concentrations and increased the affinity of bFGF for its receptor by about 3-fold. To eliminate the possibility of alteration of bFGF properties through the chemical modification reactions, bFGF was labeled biosynthetically. The binding of biosynthetically labeled bFGF to FGFR-1 also did not require heparin. When FGFR-1 or FGFR-2 were expressed in mutant CHO cells deficient in heparan sulfate synthesis, the cells also bound 125I-bFGF in the absence of heparin, and the addition of heparin increased the affinity of bFGF for its receptors 2-3-fold. Thus, heparin or heparan sulfate is not required for the binding of bFGF to its receptors but increases the binding affinity to a moderate degree. Finally, the requirement for heparin in signal transduction through the receptor was investigated. Expression of c-fos mRNA was induced by bFGF in 32D cells expressing FGFR-1 to the same extent in the presence or absence of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1513792874,"Treatment of HL-60 cells with a 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces activation of a neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase), resulting in a decrease in (SM) levels and an increase in ceramide levels in a proposed sphingomyelin cycle of cell regulation (Okazaki, T., Bell, R., and Hannun, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). Cell-permeable synthetic ceramides induce HL-60 cell differentiation toward a monocytic lineage without conversion to sphingosine, suggesting that ceramide is a lipid mediator of cell differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bielawska, A., Bell, R., and Hannun, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15823-15831). In this study, we investigated a novel SMase that was activated 2-2.5 h after treatment of cells with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The activated SMase was localized to the cytosolic fraction. It was inhibited by copper, ferric iron, and zinc and showed optimal activity at pH 7.5. A mixed micellar assay was developed for the enzyme, with optimal activity achieved at 12 mol% SM in Triton X-100 mixed micelles and at 20 mol% SM in deoxycholate micelles. The activity was modestly enhanced by phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylinositol, but not by other major phospholipids. Purification was performed by chromatography on DEAE anion-exchange, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, hydroxylapatite, sphingosylphosphocholine affinity, and Superose 12 gel filtration columns. Two peaks of activity with molecular masses of 45 and 95 kDa were resolved by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12. The specific activities of the purified 45- and 95-kDa enzymes were 2780 and 2790 nmol/mg/h, respectively. These data identify a novel cytosolic, magnesium-independent, neutral SMase(s) that is activated during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1529636312,"We have mutated Asp-251, Thr-252, and Lys-178 in cytochrome P-450cam and studied their effect on steady-state P-450cam catalysis. The mutation of Asp-251 to Asn, which dramatically slows the reaction rate, affects a pH-dependent step in the reaction cycle. By examining the individual steps in the reaction cycle, we have determined that the effect of the D251N mutation occurs after dioxygen binding. Furthermore, our results suggest that the rate-limiting step of the D251N reaction cycle is the O-O bond scission event and that this residue also plays a crucial role in O-O bond scission in wild-type P-450cam. Based on homology with other P-450 enzymes and previous mutagenesis investigations, this role may be common to other P-450 systems, and we suggest a mechanism that is consistent with the effects of these mutations on enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1575223177,"The beta and gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) form tightly associated complexes. To examine functional differences among the large number of possible combinations of unique beta and gamma subunits, we have synthesized and characterized beta gamma complexes containing gamma 5 and gamma 7, two widely distributed gamma subunits. When either gamma 5 or gamma 7 is expressed concurrently with beta 1 or beta 2 subunits in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, all four subunit complexes support pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rGi alpha 1 (where r indicates recombinant), indicating formation of functional complexes. Each of the complexes was purified by subunit exchange chromatography, using the G203A mutant of rGi alpha 1 as the immobilized ligand. The purified preparations were compared with other recombinant beta gamma subunits, including beta 1 gamma 1 and beta 1 gamma 2, for their ability to modulate type I and II adenylyl cyclase activities; stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C beta; support pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rGi alpha 1 and Go alpha; and inhibit steady-state GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by Gs alpha, Go alpha, and myristoylated rGi alpha 2. The results emphasize the unique properties of beta 1 gamma 1. The properties of the complexes containing gamma 5 or gamma 7 were similar to each other and to those of beta 1 gamma 2."
https://openalex.org/W1526569781,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces growth arrest and differentiation of a number of leukemia cell lines including HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia. We investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes in phorbol ester-induced differentiation using the phorbol ester-tolerant PET mutant of HL-60 cells, which (in contrast to the parent phorbol ester-sensitive (wild-type) S variant of HL-60 cells) does not growth-arrest, become adherent, or undergo apoptosis when exposed to TPA (Macfarlane, D. E., Gailani, D., and Vann, K. (1988) Br. J. Haematol. 68, 291-302). In comparison to S cells, we found that proliferating PET cells markedly underexpress mRNA for PKC beta, but do express PKC alpha and PKC delta. The PKC beta-selective activator 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate induces growth arrest, adherence, surface expression of CD11a, and apoptosis in S cells, but not in PET cells. Expression of PKC beta in PET cells can be restored by exposing them to dihydroxyvitamin D3, and this treatment restores the ability of subsequently added 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate or TPA to induce immediate cell adherence and growth arrest of PET cells. These data led us to conclude that activation of PKC beta is both necessary and sufficient for phorbol ester-induced growth arrest and adherence in these myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584731332,"We have previously shown that the inflammatory mediator interleukin-1 suppressed transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs (Barker, C.W., Fagan, J.B., and Pasco, D.S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8050-8055). Since many of the actions of inflammatory mediators are mimicked by oxidative stress, we treated isolated hepatocytes with 0.25-1.0 mM H2O2 to determine whether expression of these genes is also modulated by oxidative stress. Inducer-dependent accumulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were maximally reduced approximately 50 and 70%, respectively, by 1.0 mM H2O2. Run-on transcription analysis suggested that the effect of H2O2 was mediated transcriptionally. The reduction in CYP1A mRNA levels was not due to a reduction in the levels of all mRNAs due to some general toxic effect since H2O2 did not reduce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, beta-fibrinogen, or albumin mRNA levels, and did not increase lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium. Insulin-mimicked H2O2 action, reducing the expression of both mRNAs, and N-acetylcysteine, which increases intracellular glutathione levels, completely reversed the insulin effect on both mRNAs and the H2O2 effect on CYP1A1 mRNA, but only partially reversed the H2O2 effect on CYP1A2 mRNA. This study indicates that the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes are responsive to oxidative stress and that the majority of this responsiveness can be modified by cellular redox potential."
https://openalex.org/W155334109,"Stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells to proliferate leads to a selective 6-fold increase in the rate of translation of protein synthesis elongation factor eEF-1 alpha. Northern blot and solution hybridization protection studies show that levels of eEF-1 alpha mRNA remain constant following serum stimulation, demonstrating that eEF-1 alpha transcripts are not degraded following mitogenic stimulation and that the increase in eEF-1 alpha synthesis is accounted for by pre-existing mRNA. Localization of these transcripts in resting cells shows that they are largely distributed equally between stored mRNA protein particles and monosomes/disomes. Following serum addition, eEF-1 alpha transcripts present in mRNA protein particles redistribute to large polysomes rather than to monosomes and disomes as would be expected. The same is true for those transcripts present in monosomes and disomes. Salt-shift and translational runoff studies indicate that eEF-1 alpha transcripts sedimenting with monosomes and disomes in quiescent cells are associated with actively translating ribosomes. The results suggest that a specific transcript can move within polysome profile as a function of the affinity of translational apparatus for that transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1845040160,"Bacterial periplasmic binding proteins are initial receptors in the process of active transport across cell membranes and/or chemotaxis. Among them, the histidine-binding protein (HisJ) has been extensively studied from the biochemical, physiological, and genetic points of view. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the histidine-binding protein complexed with histidine has been determined at 2.5-A resolution by the molecular replacement method using a probe structure the previously solved lysine-liganded structure of the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAO), which shares 70% sequence identity with HisJ. The structure is bi-lobate; the two lobes, one bigger than the other, are connected by two short strands and are in contact with each other (closed) enclosing the histidine. Charged, polar, and non-polar side chains, as well as the peptide backbone, are involved in tight binding of the histidine. The bound histidine is involved in eight direct hydrogen bonds, six with the bigger lobe and two with the smaller lobe, in one potential water-mediated hydrogen bond with the bigger lobe, as well as in ionic interactions. The HisJ residues surrounding the ligand are the same as the LAO residues interacting with lysine, except for residue 52 which is leucine in HisJ and phenylalanine in LAO. The Leu-52 in HisJ makes a hydrophobic interaction with the imidazole ring of histidine. Of seven mutations affecting the ligand-binding site, five are located in the ligand-binding site, one in a connecting strand, and one at the domains interface. Based on comparisons among related binding proteins, the specific interactions between the ligands and the respective binding protein residues are predicted for the glutamine-binding protein and the opines-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1498582395,"NADPH-dependent superoxide generation was activated by anionic amphiphiles plus GTP gamma S in a cell-free system consisting of plasma membranes plus recombinant p47-phox, p67-phox, and the small GTP-binding protein Rac1. Rac1 was expressed in Escherichia coli both as the native form and as a mutant form (Rac1(C189S)) lacking the prenylation site. When preloaded with GTP gamma S, both Rac proteins supported activity to a level comparable to that seen using cytosol. A peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region of Rac1 was used to investigate oxidase assembly and activation. Rac1(178-188), but not several control peptides, inhibited activity. The peptide inhibited competitively (Ki = 15 microM) with respect to Rac1(C189S), while inhibition was noncompetitive or mixed with respect to p47-phox and p67-phox. This indicated specific inhibition of the interaction of the Rac protein with its target, possibly cytochrome b558. The peptide was effective only when added prior to activation with arachidonic acid, suggesting that it affects assembly rather than activity. Consistent with this possibility, the peptide prevented translocation of p47-phox and p67-phox to the plasma membrane. Thus, Rac plays a central role in the assembly of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1570223362,"Transcriptional activity of the TATA-less cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) gene promoter depends upon two tandemly repeated sequence elements, each mapping immediately downstream of major loci of transcriptional initiation. In this paper, we demonstrate that binding of the GA-binding protein (GABP) to ets sequence motifs within each repeated unit is required for transcriptional activation of the COXIV promoter. High affinity binding of GABP to the COXIV promoter required both the DNA-binding GABP alpha subunit and the non-DNA-binding GABP beta subunit. Binding of the heteromeric GABP complex to sequences containing two GABP binding sites was shown to have a 10-20-fold greater affinity than to DNA sequences with a single site. GABP binding was necessary for promoter function of a 33-base pair fragment of the COXIV initiation region in transfected 3T3 or COS cells. Binding of GABP to the COXIV initiation region was also required for maximal transcriptional stimulation by an upstream Sp1 binding site. The initiation region was demonstrated to direct accurate transcriptional initiation in vitro, and mutations to the GABP binding sites affected not only transcriptional activity but also initiation site selection. These results indicate that the initiation region repeats of the COXIV promoter may function as GABP-dependent initiator motifs that position mRNA start sites in the absence of a TATA box or other promoter elements."
https://openalex.org/W1593222340,"In a study of intracellular pH (pHi) regulation, we compared c-H-ras-transformed fibroblasts (FT9s) with parental NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were grown on a coverslip and placed in a flow-through cuvette; pHi was monitored using a fluorescent dye. Whether cells were in a CO2-free or CO2-containing solution, steady-state pHi was approximately 0.5 higher in FT9s than in 3T3s. Rates of pHi recovery from acid loads in the presence of CO2 indicate that total net acid extrusion (Jtotal) was far greater in FT9s than 3T3s in the pHi range 6.3-7.4. In both FT9s and 3T3s, pHi recovery was blocked by removing Na+. In FT9s, most of Jtotal was blocked by ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) and was probably due to Na-H exchange. A smaller component was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) and required Cl- and was probably due to Na(+)-dependent Cl-HCO3 exchange. In 3T3s, the DIDS-sensitive and Cl(-)-dependent components of Jtotal were very small. The dominant acid-extruder in 3T3s appears to be a Na-H exchanger insensitive to 50 microM EIPA. We determined the flux-pHi relationships for both the Na-H and Na(+)-dependent Cl-HCO3 exchangers in both FT9s and 3T3s. p21ras alkaline shifts the pHi profile of each transporter by approximately 0.7, without affecting the Vmax. These shifts in the flux-pHi relationships provide a mechanism for the large increase in steady-state pHi produced by long-term expression of p21ras."
https://openalex.org/W1555621727,"The in vitro phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau by casein kinase II was studied. Purified human brain tau was phosphorylated by casein kinase II to a stoichiometry of 0.7 mol of 32P/mol of tau. Individual recombinant human tau isoforms were phosphorylated to stoichiometries ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mol of 32P/mol of tau. Casein kinase II catalyzed a 4-fold greater incorporation of phosphate into the tau isoform containing a 58-amino acid insert near its amino terminus (T4L) than the isoforms without the 58-amino acid insert (T3 and T4). Phosphopeptide mapping of casein kinase II phosphorylated human tau and recombinant tau isoforms suggested that the isoforms containing an amino-terminal insert constitute the major substrates for casein kinase II within the tau family. The sites of phosphorylation on T4L were identified by digesting phosphorylated T4L with the protease Asp-N, separating the peptides by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzing the isolated peptides by liquid-secondary ion mass spectrometry and solid-phase amino-terminal sequencing. Thr39 was identified as the predominant phosphorylation site, which is located 5 residues from the amino-terminal insert in T4L. Phosphopeptide mapping of tau isolated from LA-N-5 neuroblastoma cells indicates that Thr39 is phosphorylated in situ. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a differential phosphorylation of the human tau isoforms, with the isoforms containing the acidic amino-terminal insert being the preferred substrates of casein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1508698624,"A cell-free extract from the xylem of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) catalyzes the conversion of [1-3H1]geranyl pyrophosphate to a variety of monoterpene olefins found in lodgepole pine oleoresin. This monoterpene synthase activity is similar to previously described terpenoid cyclases from grand fir (Abies grandis) and other higher plants in molecular mass (67 +/- 2 kDa as estimated by size-exclusion chromatography), Km for geranyl pyrophosphate (7.8 +/- 1.9 microM), and isoelectric point (4.75 +/- 0.2 as determined by isoelectric focusing), but the cyclases from both lodgepole pine and grand fir are unlike previously characterized terpenoid cyclases from angiosperms and fungi, in that they have an alkaline pH optimum (pH 7.8), are activated by K+, Rb+, Cs+, or NH+4 (Li+ and Na+ are not effective), require either Mn2+ or Fe2+ as divalent metal ion cofactors (Mg2+ is not effective), and are not protected by the substrate-metal ion complex against inhibition by the histidine-directed reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate. Chromatography of the pine xylem extracts on a quaternary amino anion-exchange resin results in the separation of four similar, but distinct, multiple product monoterpene synthases that produce sabinene, beta-phellandrene, 3-carene, and beta-pinene as the principal components, respectively. The major cyclase (phellandrene synthase) was subsequently purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography and electrophoresis. V8 proteolysis provided a peptide map significantly different from that obtained with limonene synthase from spearmint (Mentha spicata), and limited NH2-terminal sequencing of the phellandrene synthase fragments revealed no significant similarity to the deduced amino acid sequence of the angiosperm limonene synthase, the only monoterpene cyclase to be cloned and sequenced thus far. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies raised against the angiosperm limonene synthase did not detectably cross-react with any proteins in extracts from either lodgepole pine or grand fir by immunoblotting analysis. In addition to these structural differences between cyclases from conifers and herbaceous angiosperms, the unusual pH optimum, mono- and divalent metal ion requirement, and reactivity toward histidine carbethoxylation indicate that monoterpene cyclases isolated from conifers may also have a different complement of active-site amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis than those of terpenoid cyclases previously isolated from angiosperms."
https://openalex.org/W1595295964,"Acetylcholine mustard (AChM) is an analogue of acetylcholine (ACh) in which the onium headgroup is replaced by a chemically reactive aziridinium moiety. AChM aziridinium has agonist activity, but, having bound, reacts with and blocks the muscarinic receptor (mAChR) binding site. Purified mAChRs from rat forebrain have been specifically labeled with [3H]AChM. The linkage formed is cleaved by hydroxylamine, is found within cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides with molecular masses of approximately 2.4 and 3.9 kDa, and is close to a disulfide-bonded cysteine. Edman degradation reveals a site of label attachment 26 residues C-terminal to a CNBr cleavage site. As in the case of the alkylating antagonist analogue [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard, these findings indicate that a conserved aspartic acid residue in transmembrane helix 3 of the mAChRs, corresponding to Asp-105 (m1 sequence), is the site of label attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1525010478,"The identification of an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), defined by the 53-kDa transmembrane marker protein ERGIC-53, has added to the complexity of the exocytic pathway of higher eukaryotic cells. Recently, a subcellular fractionation procedure was established for the isolation of the ERGIC from Vero cells (Schweizer, A., Matter, K., Ketcham, C. M., and Hauri, H.-P. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 113, 45-54) which provides a means to study more precisely the compartmentalization of the various enzymic functions along the early secretory pathway. Here, we have investigated if O-glycan initiation and sphingomyelin synthesis are associated with the ERGIC by analyzing both the responsible enzyme activities and their corresponding products. Moreover, the synthesis of glucosylceramide, the precursor of most glycosphingolipids, was also analyzed. In the purified ERGIC fraction UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc transferase) was only minimally enriched, sphingomyelin synthase was not enriched, and UDP-glucose:ceramide-glucosyl transferase specific activity was lower than in the homogenate. On Percoll gradients all three enzymes cofractionated with Golgi markers rather than ERGIC-53. Accordingly, sphingomyelin concentrations were extremely low in the ERGIC fraction. Double immunofluorescence localization of core N-acetylgalactosamine, the product of GalNAc transferase, by monoclonal antibodies against GalNAc-Ser/Thr (Tn antigen) revealed only little apparent overlap with ERGIC-53. This was particularly evident in brefeldin A-treated cells which showed entirely different patterns of Tn antigens and ERGIC-53. The results suggest that in the secretory pathway of Vero cells O-glycan initiation and sphingomyelin as well as glucosylceramide synthesis mainly occur beyond the ERGIC in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1520441844,"Thyroid hormones may stimulate or repress transcriptional activity depending upon the specific gene. Whereas, a palindromic DNA sequence, TREpal, mediates positive regulation by thyroid hormone, the negative response element (nT3RE) remains undefined. Therefore, we have examined the DNA sequences that mediate the inhibitory effects of thyroid hormone on the transcription of the beta-subunit gene of rat thyrotropin (rTSH beta). In rat pituitary tumor cells (GH3), transient expression of plasmid constructs containing the putative nT3RE of rTSH beta mediated negative regulation by L-triiodothyronine (T3). Since this nT3RE contained sequences which resembled a half-site motif of the consensus T3RE and the idealized palindrome (TREpal), we tested a construct containing this half-site motif in the same cells. T3 decreased the activity of this plasmid. Cotransfection studies in T3-receptor (T3R)-deficient cells indicated that either alpha or beta isoforms of T3R were required for the inhibitory effects of the hormone. Both T3R isomers bind to DNA sequences containing the nT3RE from rTSH beta DNA or the half-site motif of TREpal. In summary, our results show that the repressive properties of T3 are mediated by a nT3RE from rTSH beta. Unexpectedly, this motif resembles a half-site component of TREpal which enhances promoter activity in response to T3."
https://openalex.org/W1578918269,"It is believed that induction of cytokine expression by bacterial cell wall components plays a role in the development and course of sepsis. However, most attention has been focused on lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We studied the ability of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamyl-m-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine (G(Anh)MTetra), a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli, to induce cytokine expression in human monocytes. G(Anh)MTetra was found to strongly induce interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression after 2 h and IL-1 beta and IL-6 protein secretion after 48 h of activation. The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 transcription factor expression. Experiments using inhibitors of protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways revealed that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression involves activation of an H7-inhibitable pathway. By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, it was shown that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein, whereas G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation does not. When responses to G(Anh)MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide (MDP), it was found that the optimal response to G(Anh)MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP. Furthermore, maximal G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression could be enhanced by co-stimulation with LPS or MDP, suggesting that different receptors and/or transduction pathways were involved. These results indicate that G(Anh)MTetra induces IL-1 beta and IL-6 expression in human monocytes suggesting a possible role for G(Anh)MTetra in the release of cytokines during sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W1520656906,"Subtilisin, an extracellular serine protease from Bacillus subtilis, requires the amino-terminal propeptide of 77 amino acid residues for the formation of the active enzyme. The propeptide is cleaved upon completion of folding. Serine 221 at the active center was substituted with cysteine, and the mutant enzyme (prothiolsubtilisin) was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of a T7 promoter. Prothiosubtilisin, which was produced as inclusion bodies, was dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl and purified to near homogeneity in the presence of 5 M urea. The purified protein was renatured by stepwise dialysis. In spite of the mutation at the active center, the propeptide was found to be autoprocessed with approximately 60-80% efficiency. However, protease activity could not be detected in the final product by the spectrophotometric assay. Moreover, the cleaved propeptide remained tightly bound to thiolsubtilisin without being digested, as evident by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino-terminal sequence of the processed thiolsubtilisin was determined and proved that the propeptide was cleaved at a site identical to that of wild-type prosubtilisin. The processed thiolsubtilisin was also found to contain one free SH group/molecule. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the processing of prosubtilisin occurs by an intramolecular autoprocessing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1564074904,"Abstract The regulation of diacylglycerol (DG) kinase activity was studied in fibroblasts and Jurkat T cells. We questioned whether enzyme activity only depends on substrate availability or whether it requires receptor stimulation. To this end, we raised DG levels up to 15-fold by treatment of cells with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC). In detergent cell lysates, DG kinase was readily capable of converting this surplus of DG to phosphatidic acid (PA), but in intact cells the enzyme remained inactive. Stimulation of fibroblasts with bradykinin or endothelin and Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 resulted in DG kinase-mediated formation of PA, but its level was unaffected by PLC pretreatment. Likewise, in streptolysin O-permeabilized fibroblasts, where bradykinin stimulation in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) generates [32P]PA exclusively via DG kinase, PLC pretreatment did not affect the amount of [32P]PA formed. We conclude that DG kinase acts on DG generated by receptor stimulation, but not on DG generated by exogenous PLC. We propose a model in which DG kinase physically associates with endogenous PLC. Within this complex, receptor-induced DG would then be transmitted (channeled) from endogenous PLC to the active site of DG kinase, whereas excess DG generated randomly in the plasma membrane by bacterial PLC is inaccessible to this catalytic site."

Val68(E11) was replaced by Phe in the same protein to increase its stability. When excess Tyr64-Val68 apoglobin is mixed with either metmyoglobin or methemoglobin, the solution turns from brown to green, and the absorbance changes can be used to measure complete time courses for hemin dissociation from either holoprotein. This assay has been used to measure rates of hemin dissociation from native metmyoglobin, four myoglobin mutants (Ala64(E7), Ala68(E11), Phe68(E11), and Glu45(CD3)), native methemoglobin, valence hybrid hemoglobins, and two mutant hemoglobins ((alpha(Gly-E7)beta(native))2, and (alpha(native)beta(Gly-E7))2). Two kinetic phases were observed for hemin dissociation from native human hemoglobin at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C. Valence and mutant hybrid hemoglobins were used to assign the faster phase (k = 7.8 +/- 2.0 h-1) to hemin dissociation from ferric beta subunits and the slower (k = 0.6 +/- 0.15 h-1) to dissociation from alpha subunits. The corresponding rate for wild-type metmyoglobin is 0.007 +/- 0.004 h-1."
https://openalex.org/W1546893655,"The precursor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and the 56-amino acid GnRH-associated peptide is encoded in an mRNA of about 560 bases in length. This mRNA derives from an approximately 4300-base pair-long gene consisting of four relatively short exons (denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4) and three large introns (A, B, and C). In this study, we characterized the order by which the three introns are spliced from the primary transcript and processing intermediates to give rise to a mature mRNA and evaluated the potential role of gene transcription and pre-mRNA processing in the control of proGnRH mRNA levels in vivo. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions isolated from rat preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH) and basal olfactory area (located rostral to the POA) were analyzed by 1) solution hybridization-RNase protection mapping using several RNA probes directed at various regions of the proGnRH gene and 2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using several oligonucleotide primers. Both types of analysis showed that proGnRH pre-mRNA processing begins with the splicing of intron B from the primary gene transcript. Hence, intron B is the ideal target for studying proGnRH primary transcript by in situ hybridization. Subsequent splicing of introns A and C appeared to take place in two alternative, although not equally prevalent pathways. Quantitative analysis indicated that the proGnRH hnRNA species constituted, on a mole basis, about 20% of the total gene transcripts in the POA-AH. The primary transcript alone constituted about 10% of the total gene transcripts in the POA-AH and as much as 20% in the basal olfactory area. The prospect of blockade of proGnRH hnRNA processing by means of hybridization with endogenous antisense RNAs (transcribed from the SH gene on the opposite strand of the same DNA locus) did not prove to be likely, as the SH transcripts were present at very low levels compared to any of the proGnRH RNA species. We conclude that the relatively large pool of proGnRH hnRNA may reflect a high rate of gene transcription and/or slow RNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1510806403,"Abstract A DNA binding assay was developed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase. The assay was capable of defining discrete complexes between the enzyme and the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) substrate. DNA binding reflected the sequence requirements previously demonstrated for the enzyme's 3'-end processing activity. Binding exhibited a nonlinear dependence on integrase concentration, suggesting that the enzyme functions as a multimer. The oligomeric state was investigated by UV-photo-cross-linking of integrase-LTR oligonucleotide complexes using DNA substrates substituted with 5-bromo-2'-deoxycytidine within the integrase recognition sequence. In the absence of divalent cation, integrase cross-linked to the LTR oligonucleotide as a single species whose mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was consistent with the formation of tetramers. Using these techniques, analysis of the binding properties of integrase mutants demonstrated that the catalytic and sequence-specific DNA binding activities of the enzyme are distinct, involving residues within the conserved DD(35)E and zinc finger motifs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1552246413,"We have isolated an NH2-terminal fragment of filamin (M(r) = 70,000) after digestion with Staphylococus aureus V8 protease. This fragment was shown to interact with filamentous actin in cosedimentation assays. Using cross-reactive anti-peptides antibodies directed against the strongly conserved 27-mer sequence of alpha-actinin, already implicated as an actin binding site (Kuhlman, P. A., Hemmings, L., and Critchley, D. R. (1992) FEBS Lett. 304, 201-206), we obtained evidence suggesting that the homologous sequence of filamin (121-147 sequence) is the major element in the interaction with actin. In particular, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments, in conjunction with a synthetic peptide approach, and found that the hydrophobic part of the 27-mer peptide (141-147 sequence) is largely involved in actin binding. Thus, the filamin sequence 121-147 (or the alpha-actinin sequence 108-134) and the actin counterpart composed of residues 112-125 and 360-372 (we have already implicated) could constitute the main interface between actin and these cytoskeletal proteins. However, the divergent behavior of filamin and alpha-actinin toward conformational changes of actin argues in favor of distinctive interfaces. Finally, the ionic strength dependence of the filamin-actin interaction, in contrast to that with alpha-actinin, strongly suggests that, besides hydrophobic interactions conferred by the 27-mer sequence, more hydrophilic region(s) of filamin participate(s) in the binding."

A cDNA encoding the murine ferrochelatase (Taketani, S., Nakahashi, Y., Osumi, T., and Tokunaga, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 19377-19380) has been expressed in Escherichia coli, using the alkaline phosphatase promoter. Ferrochelatase was not only overexpressed in an active form, but more importantly, was produced as a (i.e. associated with the bacterial protein fraction). A simple purification from the ferrochelatase overproducing bacterial strain yielded approximately 50 mg of protein/2-3 liters of bacterial culture. Recombinant ferrochelatase exhibited identical physical and catalytic properties to those of mammalian ferrochelatases. Specifically, the recombinant ferrochelatase has iron and porphyrin as substrates, and N-methylprotoporphyrin and metal ions (e.g. Hg2+ and Mn2+), as strong inhibitors of its enzyme activity. The Km values are 112.5 microM for iron and 95 microM for deuteroporphyrin IX, which are in the same range of the Km values determined for the ferrochelatases isolated from natural sources. This report describes the overexpression of a mammalian ferrochelatase in E. coli, as a protein, and its purification from an overproducing strain. The production of a functional and soluble ferrochelatase has significance for the pursuit of structural and functional studies of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1493475842,"DNA damage in HeLa nuclei and isolated nucleosome core particles has been examined for several members of the enediyne family of antitumor antibiotics: calicheamicin gamma 1I (CAL), esperamicin A1 (ESP A1), esperamicin C (ESP C), and neocarzinostatin (NCS). In nuclei, both NCS and ESP A1 produced DNA damage limited to the linker region of the nucleosome, while CAL and ESP C, an analog of ESP A1 missing the deoxyfucose-anthranilate moiety, damaged both the core and linker DNA. DNA fragments produced by CAL and ESP C in the nucleosome core occurred with a 10-11-nucleotide periodicity similar to that produced by DNase I, while damage produced by NCS and ESP A1 appeared to be limited to the terminal portions of the core DNA. The damage in nuclei is shown to be caused directly by the drugs with little contribution from endogenous factors, such as nucleases and topoisomerases. Features of drug structure that may limit damage to the nucleosome core include the presence of substituents on both sides of the CAL/ESP-type core, and the presence of an intercalating moiety, such as the naphthoate of NCS and possibly the anthranilate of ESP A1."
https://openalex.org/W1510351771,"It has been proposed that the histidine at position 21 (H21) of the diphtheria toxin A subunit (DTA) plays an important role in the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) activity of the toxin. The region of DT encompassing H21 demonstrates sequence similarity with other toxins exhibiting ADPRT activity, is located along the catalytic cleft of DTA, and when H21 is chemically modified, ADPRT activity is abolished. H21 was mutagenized by a polymerase chain reaction-based system whereby all alternative amino acids were substituted in place of the histidine. The majority of the substitutions virtually abolished enzymatic activity, the exception being a mutant in which H21 was replaced with asparagine (DTA-H21N). This mutant demonstrated only a slight increase in Km and relatively small decreases in both reaction rate (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Asparagine is a sterically conserved substitution, but its side-chain is unable to replace the imidazole group of histidine in general acid-base mechanisms or to participate in electrostatic interactions. This suggests that H21 is important in maintaining a steric conformation required for catalysis rather than in participating in an electrostatic or acid-base type of exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1552633499,"Human skin fibroblasts labeled with [5,6,8,9,11,12,-14,15-3H]arachidonic acid produce a radioactive metabolite that has a shorter retention time on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography than arachidonic acid. This product is not retained in the cells; it is released entirely into the extracellular fluid in a time-dependent manner. The metabolite does not cochromatograph with any of the eicosanoid standards, and its formation is not prevented by the addition of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P-450 inhibitors. The compound is not produced by fibroblasts labeled with [1-14C]arachidonic acid, suggesting that it is formed through an oxidative process. Chemical analyses indicated that the metabolite is 4,7,10-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3). Peroxisome-deficient human skin fibroblasts did not produce 16:3, indicating that it probably is formed through peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and porcine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells also release radioactive 16:3 following labeling with [3H]arachidonic acid. Therefore, the production of this metabolite is not limited only to fibroblasts. The fact that 16:3 is released into the extra-cellular fluid suggests that it may be a new type of lipid mediator derived from arachidonic acid, formed through a peroxisome-dependent oxidative process."
https://openalex.org/W1524872479,"We have previously reported that 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM), a specific alpha-mannosidase I inhibitor interfered with the uptake of D-[2-3H]mannose in differentiated HT-29 cells (a cell line derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma) (Ogier-Denis, E., Trugnan, G., Sapin, C., Aubery, M., and Codogno, P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5366-5369). In the present work, we have used another cell line derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma, Caco-2 cells, which has the capacity to grow and to differentiate on porous filters. We have determined that mannose could enter the cells by two distinct transporters. One sensitive to dMM, present at the basolateral membrane of differentiated Caco-2 cells, and one insensitive to the drug localized at the brush border membrane of these cells. The basolateral mannose uptake is mediated by a Na(+)-independent transporter whereas the apical entry of mannose is under the dependence of Na+. We have focused our studies on the basolateral dMM-sensitive mannose carrier. Kinetic studies indicated that this facilitative mannose transporter has a Km and a Vmax of 55 +/- 8 microM and 0.144 +/- 0.005 mumol/mg of protein/min, respectively. This basolateral transporter is clearly distinct from facilitative glucose transporters. Moreover, this dMM-sensitive mannose transport accurately follows the differentiation process of intestinal epithelial cells as well in vitro as shown using Caco-2 cells as in vivo when experiments were done on crypt cells and villus cells isolated from rat jejunum."
https://openalex.org/W1530871819,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent mediator which produces a wide range of biological responses by binding to specific, high affinity receptors on the target cell surface. In addition, we and others have observed cellular responses to PAF which are not receptor-mediated. We report here that in HBE-16 human bronchial epithelial cells, PAF produces a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i consisting of a rapid initial increase due to release from intracellular stores followed by a gradual, sustained phase caused by influx of extracellular Ca2+. Under certain conditions, the PAF receptor antagonist L-659,989 completely blocks the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, suggesting a complete block of the receptor-mediated response. Under these same conditions, a residual influx of extracellular Ca2+ is observed, suggesting a possible receptor-independent response. HBE-16 cells partially metabolize PAF to 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (AAG), a bioactive diacylglycerol analog. Moreover, AAG stimulates Ca2+ influx in these cells; the response to AAG is at least 100-fold more potent than that to PAF. Taken together, these results suggest that PAF may stimulate Ca2+ influx in HBE-16 cells through a receptor-independent pathway mediated by AAG. Thus these studies suggest a previously unrecognized dual-pathway regulatory mechanism for PAF in the airway."

This soluble 1-kinase activity was resolved from the soluble activity that phosphorylated inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate by anion-exchange chromatography.

The fusogenic activity was dependent on the presence of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, was pH-sensitive, and had a pH threshold of activation similar to that of the native virus. The extent of fusion was dependent upon the lipid composition of the vesicles. This technique will allow vesicles prepared by any method to be made fusogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1516201963,"Activation of platelets with physiological agents results in distinct cellular events such as shape change, cell aggregation, granule secretion, and clot retraction. Translocation of soluble cytoplasmic myosin to the actin cytoskeleton occurs during activation and may be involved in some of these physiological responses. Phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain occurs in parallel with myosin translocation; however, exceptions to this correlation have been reported. The present study tests the hypothesis that the actin- and myosin-binding protein, caldesmon, is required for this enhanced binding of myosin to the actin cytoskeleton. Caldesmon, a putative regulatory protein found in non-muscle and smooth muscle cells, binds actin and myosin simultaneously to form an actin-caldesmon-myosin complex and tethers myosin to actin in a manner that promotes, rather than inhibits, translocation of actin filaments relative to myosin. In this study, we demonstrated that a purified myosin-binding fragment of caldesmon competitively blocks caldesmon-dependent tethering in an in vitro motility assay and that this effect is prevented by phosphorylating the fragment. More importantly, we demonstrated that the unphosphorylated, but not the phosphorylated, fragment displaces myosin from the cytoskeleton of activated platelets; this suggests that caldesmon enhances the binding of myosin to the cytoskeleton during platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1573072182,"Identification of the factors controlling transcription of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene is essential for understanding regulation of the EGF receptor and its overexpression in human carcinomas. In this study, we have identified a 60-base pair (bp) region (-919 to -860) relative to the AUG translation initiation codon in the EGF receptor 5' promoter that functions as a cis-acting EGF receptor transcriptional repressor (ETR). This fragment also acted as a repressor when linked to the thymidine kinase promoter. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that trans-acting factors bind to 60- and 19-bp fragments. Competition and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays with oligonucleotides containing mutations and deletions in this region indicate that the TTCGAGGG sequence (-877 to -870) is required for binding as well as repressor activity. While the ETR-protected region contains consensus sequences for the E2F binding site, no competition was observed with an E2F binding fragment. However, DNA-protein blot analysis indicates that both the 60- and 19-bp fragments specifically bind a 128-kDa polypeptide in extracts from HeLa or A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. These results suggest that a novel transcription factor(s) negatively regulates EGF receptor gene expression through binding to the ETR element."

The integrity of the disulfide bonds in the binding protein is essential for this activity as reduction abolishes the protein's ability to bind corticotropin-releasing factor. The disulfide arrangement of the 10 cysteines present in the mature protein was established by analysis of proteolytically cleaved protein and sequence analysis of cystine containing fragments. A pattern is observed where each cysteine is connected to the next one in a sequential manner. Inspection of the genomic DNA encoding for this protein reveals that four of the domains defined by disulfide linkage coincide with four different exons."
https://openalex.org/W1568091107,"The delta subunit of the F1-ATPase from Escherichia coli contains 2 cysteine residues, one at position 64 and the second at position 140 of the amino acid sequence. These residues were specifically labeled with sulfhydryl reagents in this study without labeling other -SH groups in the enzyme. Modification of Cys140 by maleimides such as N-ethylmaleimide or fluorescein maleimide resulted in a reconstitutively active enzyme that was indistinguishable from the native protein. Labeling of Cys64 with or without concomitant labeling of Cys140 resulted in a reconstitutively inactive enzyme. The ATPase activity of either form of the labeled enzyme was unaffected. However, labeling of Cys64 was accompanied by dissociation of the delta subunit from the enzyme. These observations suggest a role for the microenvironment of Cys64 in interactions of the delta subunit with other subunits in the enzyme. Two types of evidence support the conclusion that the 2 cysteine residues of the delta subunit are in close proximity. First, incorporation of pyrene maleimide into both delta cysteines led to excimer formation. Second, incubation of F1 with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) resulted in quantitative formation of a disulfide bond between Cys64 and Cys140, presumably via disulfide interchange. The enzyme containing the internally cross-linked delta subunit exhibited an undiminished ability to support proton pumping when reconstituted into F1-depleted membrane vesicles. The presence of 2 closely apposed cysteinyl residues in the delta subunit of the native enzyme places constraints on the type of structure that may be proposed for the subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1513711706,"Abstract Aldolase C mRNA is detected by Northern blot in all fetal tissues in rat; it is very abundant in the adult brain and undetectable in the other adult tissues. However, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification indicates that this gene is not totally repressed in these tissues. A DNase-I hypersensitivity site located in a 115-base pair proximal promoter fragment is detectable in the brain as well as in other adult tissues. Two MspI/HpaII restriction sites located at -3800 and -450 base pairs are demethylated in the brain and totally or partially methylated in other tissues. In transgenic mice, a 12.5-kilobase genomic fragment is strongly and tissue specifically expressed in different lines, with conservation of a methylation pattern similar to that of the endogenous gene. A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene directed by either 800 or 115 base pairs of aldolase C 5'-flanking sequences is tissue specifically expressed in transgenic mice, but the level of expression is very low. This level is greatly increased when the transgene consists of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase hybrid gene directed by 5.5 kilobases of aldolase C 5'-flanking sequences. We propose therefore that the chromatin structure around the aldolase C promoter is accessible in fetal tissues, then remains open in the adult brain, where the gene is very active, as well as in tissues in which it is practically inactive. The specificity of expression in the brain is conferred by a short 115-base pair proximal promoter fragment that needs more upstream sequences to be fully active."
https://openalex.org/W1559008832,"Tus, a DNA-binding protein, mediates arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Tus binds to DNA sequences called Ter sites, located in the terminus region of the chromosome, and forms replication-arrest complexes that block movement of DNA replication forks in a polar fashion. We have analyzed Tus to determine some of its physical parameters and biochemical characteristics. Native Tus had an 8(20,w) of 3.2, a Stokes' radius of 23 A, an axial ratio of 2, and a molar absorption coefficient of 39,700 M-1 cm-1. The data also indicated that Tus existed as a monomeric protein in solution and when complexed with its cognate DNA binding site. Secondary structure estimated from the circular dichroism spectrum suggested that Tus consisted of 40% alpha-helix, 0% beta-sheet, 15% turn, and 45% aperiodic structure. The isoelectric point of native Tus (pH 7.5) was significantly different than that calculated from its amino acid sequence (pH 10.1), possibly because the tertiary structure of Tus perturbs the ionization of several residues. In addition, partial proteolytic digests of free Tus protein did not produce a subfragment of Tus that retained DNA binding activity, but did demonstrate that Tus was resistant to proteolysis when complexed with a Ter site."
https://openalex.org/W1592755914,"Abstract This laboratory previously described an L1210 leukemia cell line (MTXrA) selected for resistance to methotrexate by virtue of impaired transport. In this line, the reduced folate carrier had unchanged affinity for methotrexate, was present at the cell surface in usual quantity, but did not deliver drug into the cell, indicative of a functional defect in the translocation process. In this study, we further characterize this cell line along with a subline (F2-MTXrA) selected for growth in low levels of folic acid. This subline demonstrates continued high resistance to methotrexate and very low influx of [3H]methotrexate and 5-[3H]formyltetrahydrofolate, indicating the persistence of the defect in the reduced folate carrier. Both MTXrA and F2-MTXrA are shown to overexpress FBP2, the murine homolog of a folate-binding protein initially isolated from human placenta. Compared with parent L1210 cells, Northern analysis revealed FBP2 expression to be elevated 40-fold in the MTXrA line and 500-fold in F2-MTXrA. The large increase in FBP2 expression in the F2-MTXrA line correlates with a 10-fold increase in [3H]folic acid membrane surface binding and a 1000-fold decrease in the folic acid growth requirement compared with parental L1210 cells. Also, there are 20- and 500-fold decreases in the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate growth requirement compared with parent L1210 and MTXrA cells, respectively. Finally, the genomic organization of the FBP2 locus is presented. The results of Northern analyses using probes specific to FBP2 5'-untranslated sequences or to a splice junction within this region suggest that the up-regulated FBP2-specific message in F2-MTXrA utilizes 5'-noncoding sequences distinct from those used in the message encoded in L1210 cell lines with low level FBP2 expression. The MTXrA cells provide an example of a line selected for primary resistance to methotrexate that also exhibits concomitant increased expression of a folate-binding protein. Further overexpression of this folate-binding protein (which has homology to that initially identified in placenta) provides cells with the ability to meet cellular folate needs in a folate-deprived environment."
https://openalex.org/W1958669823,"A total of 110 revertants have been isolated from two well-characterized cytochrome b deficient (mit-) mutants. The mit- mutations are located in an extramembranous loop linking the transmembrane alpha-helices IV and V of cytochrome b which has been postulated to be part of the catalytic center QN and therefore is assumed to be essential for the functioning of the bc1 complex. The molecular bases of the reversions were identified by sequencing the cytochrome b mRNAs. This allowed us to identify seven new structures of cytochrome b which are more or less compatible with its catalytic activity. The secondary mutations occurred either at the level of the original site mutation or at adjacent positions (region 204-208 of the polypeptide chain), or even at a distance of more than 150 amino acids (position 30) suggesting topological interaction between these two areas. All the revertants recovered cytochrome contents and phosphorylation efficiencies similar to the wild-type ones, albeit differences appeared in their specific growth rates and NADH respirations. The failure in bc1 complex functioning induced by the mutation S206L and its restoration by non native reversions are tentatively explained."
https://openalex.org/W1510412284,"The ability of cells to re-repress ferritin synthesis after removal of an inducing agent (iron or heme) was investigated. Re-repression was found to be a slow process, requiring approximately 4 (after iron removal) to 10 h (after heme removal) for completion. Desferrioxamine mesylate (Desferal) had only a slight effect on the rate of re-repression, whereas cycloheximide was strongly inhibitory, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for re-repression. Re-repression occurred at a slow but significant rate in the presence of both Desferal and cycloheximide. These results indicate that, in the absence of an iron chelator, the induction of ferritin synthesis is essentially irreversible. The kinetics of the previously reported covalent modification of IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) were then examined, to see whether this phenomenon might account (at least in part) for the irreversibility of induction. It was found that the heme- or iron-dependent disappearance of 98-kDa IRE-BP occurred rapidly (within 1 h), and was equally rapidly reversed upon removal of heme after a 1-h exposure. By contrast, after a 4-h exposure to heme, little 98-kDa IRE-BP could be regenerated after heme removal. These results suggest that the slow, irreversible covalent modification of IRE-BP correlates closely over time with the induction of ferritin synthesis. The covalent modification of IRE-BP depends on cell growth rate, and is most readily detected in rapidly growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574163474,"Inactivation of rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase by the site-directed reagent 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) is associated with the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-78 and Cys-112 (Takata, Y., and Fujioka, M. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4357-4362; Gomi, T., Ogawa, H., and Fujioka, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13422-13425). To characterize the inactivation mechanism more precisely, the properties of four hydrolase proteins mutated at Cys-78 or Cys-112 were compared to those of the wild-type enzyme. When Cys-78 was mutated to either a serine or an alanine, proteins with greatly reduced enzymatic activity were obtained, large effects on kinetic constants were observed, and enzymatic activity was not affected by incubation with FSBA. When Cys-112 was mutated to either a serine or an alanine, the activity was similar to the wild-type protein, only small changes in the kinetic constants were observed, and the enzyme was inactivated more rapidly upon incubation with FSBA. FSBA inactivation of the C112A mutant protein was accompanied by the formation of a disulfide between Cys-78 and Cys-52. The data indicate that FSBA initially reacts with Cys-78 and that Cys-78 has an important role in the structure of the enzyme."

Oxidation of L79CC81A (R-form) yielded two isomers, L79CC81A-a (A-form) with tandem-linked Cys65-Cys77 and Cys79-Cys95, and L79CC81A-b (B-form) with cross-linked Cys65-Cys79 and Cys77-Cys95 (Kanaya, E., Ishihara, K., Tsunasawa, S., Nokihara, K., and Kikuchi, M. (1993) Biochem. J. 292, 469-476). PDI mainly enhanced the formation of the A- form in the absence of oxidized glutathione (GSSG); however, as the concentration of GSSG increased, it markedly accelerated the formation of the B-form. In contrast, the DspA/PpfA protein mainly enhanced the formation of the A-form, regardless of the presence or absence of GSSG. These results and the presumed spatial locations of Cys65, Cys77, and Cys79-Cys95 in the R-form suggest that 1 of the half-cystine residues in the active site of PDI and the DsbA/PpfA protein can react with 1 of the 2 free Cys residues of the R-form. The dependence on GSSG of the B-form formation with PDI can be explained by the formation of two transient intermolecular disulfide bonds between PDI and the R-form and the attack of GSSG by the resultant thiolate anion of Cys79 or Cys95. The independence of the reaction with the DsbA/PpfA protein from GSSG can be explained by the formation of one transient intermolecular disulfide bond. The possible formation of the two transient intermolecular disulfide bonds involving two sulfur atoms of PDI and 2 cysteine or half-cystine residues of the substrate could explain the high isomerase activity of PDI."

To identify the epitope residues within these 104 residues, we introduced random mutations in the region, and clones without binding activity to the mAb, beta 12 and beta 31, were screened. beta subunits defective in binding with mAb beta 12 or beta 31 had amino acid replacements at residues 26, 40, 52, 71, and 74 or at residues 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, and 52, respectively. These residues could be part of the epitope and are possibly located close together. We tested the effects of the mutations on oxidative phosphorylation-dependent growth by introducing expression plasmids of the beta subunit gene with the point mutations into the beta-less mutant, JP17. The alpha and beta subunits were missing from the JP17 membranes, and both subunits were assembled functionally after expression of the beta subunit was induced by introducing the expression plasmid. The replacement of Leu-40 by Pro caused the amounts of the alpha and beta subunits on the membranes to be reduced less than 20% of the amounts in wild type. The replacement of Glu-41 by Lys caused a loss of the alpha subunit on the membranes, without any decrease in the beta subunit. These results indicated that the mutation of Leu-40 to Pro affects the essential role of the beta subunit in the assembly of the alpha and beta subunits on the membranes and that the mutation of Glu-41 to Lys partly affects it. The amino-terminal region of the beta subunit, in particular its ternary structure, including residues 40 and 41, plays an important role in the molecular assembly of the alpha and beta subunits on the membranes."

The Ca(2+)-ATPase was inhibited strongly. The enzyme was almost completely protected either by 20 mM Mg.ATP or by 50 mM acetyl phosphate against this inhibition. Pi gave no protection. There was a linear relationship between the extent of this inhibition and the Mg.ATP-sensitive part of the content of bound FDNP-ATP. Extrapolation showed that the enzyme is completely inhibited by Mg.ATP-sensitive binding of 3.6 nmol of FDNP-ATP/mg of the vesicle protein. This value is in good agreement with the content of the phosphorylation site (3.3 nmol/mg of the vesicle protein) in the vesicles used. These findings indicate that binding of 1 mol of FDNP-ATP per mol of the active sites leads to a complete inhibition of the enzyme. The acetylphosphatase activity and phosphorylation with ATP were also strongly inhibited by this labeling, whereas phosphorylation with Pi was not inhibited. The labeled vesicles were solubilized in SDS, and the Ca(2+)-ATPase was purified by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Mapping the labeled peptides in the tryptic digest by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing showed that Lys-492 was exclusively labeled with FDNP-ATP. These results show that Lys-492 is located in or near the ATP binding site and apart from the phosphorylation site and Pi binding site. Molecular modeling of FDNP-ATP suggests that this Lys-492 residue is situated on the 3'-OH side of the ribose moiety of bound ATP and is close to the alpha-phosphoryl group."
https://openalex.org/W1537891552,"In this study, the structure of the immunodominant carbohydrate epitope of the extracellular polysaccharides from mold species belonging to the order Mucorales reactive with rabbit IgG antibodies was elucidated. An exo-alpha-D-mannanase which was able to abolish the antigenicity of these polysaccharides completely was purified and characterized, and the activity was compared with that of an alpha-D-mannosidase. Analysis of the monomeric reaction products after enzymatic treatment revealed the presence of 2-O-methyl-D-mannose residues. This compound is a constituent of the polysaccharides from the mold genera Mucor, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, Absidia, Syncephalastrum, and Thamnidium, and its occurrence in fungi has not been reported until now. Two mannan fractions which are highly reactive with rabbit IgG were isolated from the extracellular polysaccharides of Mucor racemosus and characterized with ethylation analysis. The role of the newly found 2-O-methyl-D-mannose residues in the immunoreactivity was assessed by specific degradation of these mannans with the exo-alpha-D-mannanase and subsequent ethylation analysis. It was concluded that the immunodominant carbohydrates reactive with rabbit IgG are chains composed of a single terminal non-reducing 2-O-methyl-D-mannose residue, alpha (1-2)-linked to a short sequence of alpha(1-2)-linked D-mannose residues."
https://openalex.org/W1534319452,"Human choriogonadotropin (hCG) was trace-labeled with [3H]acetic anhydride and then incubated with transformed murine Leydig cells (MA-10). The bound hormone was recovered, subunits (alpha and beta) were separated and then cleaved, and the peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of the labeling patterns of peptides from the initial preparation and the bound hCG fraction enabled us to determine the protection factor of several amino groups, which is a measure of the effects of acetylation on receptor binding. The largest protection factors, indicating lower labeling in the bound fraction, were found on beta and involved the alpha-amino group/Lys2 (analyzed together) and Lys104, which exhibited 6-fold and 5-fold selections against binding, respectively. Thus, acetylation at either of these amino groups does not prevent binding but results in selection against hormone association with receptor. Other amino groups were analyzed (e.g. Lys122 on beta; the alpha-amino group and lysines 44/45 (analyzed as a pair), 51, and 75 on alpha), and the selection factors indicated either no change or only modest changes (2-fold) in selection for or against binding. These results indicate that the alpha-amino group/Lys2 and Lys104 of the hormone-specific beta subunit participate, either directly or indirectly, in receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W1562981786,"The tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been found to bind reversibly to human fibronectin (Fn). To locate the binding site on Fn for t-PA, the Fn was degraded with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, and the resulting fragments were monitored by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method for t-PA binding activities. A 20-kDa fragment with t-PA binding activity was identified, separated, and purified. It was subjected to further degradation with Staphylococcus aureus proteinase V8. An active 10-kDa fragment was finally purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C3 column. The dissociation constants of the binding of Fn and the 10-kDa fragment to t-PA were estimated by Scatchard plot to be 1.13 x 10(-8) and 2.08 x 10(-8) M, respectively. The 10-kDa fragment was sequenced and proved to be located at the 8-9th domains of type I homology of Fn. Based on the structural analysis of the 8-9th domains, a heptadecapeptide corresponding to the sequence Thr535-Glyl551 of Fn, which resided at the large disulfide loop of domain (I-9), was designed and synthesized. Both the 10-kDa fragment and the synthetic peptide could competitively inhibit the binding of Fn to t-PA. The synthetic peptide showed about one-tenth of the binding activity of Fn to t-PA with a dissociation constant of 1.35 x 10(-7) M and was proved to be the binding region of Fn for t-PA. In addition, like the intact Fn, both the 10-kDa fragment and the synthetic peptide could remarkably enhance the amidolytic activity of t-PA in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by using S-2288 as a chromogenic substrate."
