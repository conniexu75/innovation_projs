Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ) administered by mosquito bites are the only immunogens shown to induce such protection in humans. Such protection is thought to be mediated by CD8(+) T cells in the liver that secrete interferon-γ (IFN-γ). We report that purified irradiated PfSPZ administered to 80 volunteers by needle inoculation in the skin was safe, but suboptimally immunogenic and protective. Animal studies demonstrated that intravenous immunization was critical for inducing a high frequency of PfSPZ-specific CD8(+), IFN-γ-producing T cells in the liver (nonhuman primates, mice) and conferring protection (mice). Our results suggest that intravenous administration of this vaccine will lead to the prevention of infection with Pf malaria."

Whereas astrocyte progenitor cells can be cultured from neonatal brain, culture of mature astrocytes from postnatal brain has not been possible. Here, we report a new method to prospectively purify astrocytes by immunopanning. These astrocytes undergo apoptosis in culture, but vascular cells and HBEGF promote their survival in serum-free culture. We found that some developing astrocytes normally undergo apoptosis in vivo and that the vast majority of astrocytes contact blood vessels, suggesting that astrocytes are matched to blood vessels by competing for vascular-derived trophic factors such as HBEGF. Compared to traditional astrocyte cultures, the gene profiles of the cultured purified postnatal astrocytes much more closely resemble those of in vivo astrocytes. Although these astrocytes strongly promote synapse formation and function, they do not secrete glutamate in response to stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2062663442,"Rainstorms, insect swarms, and galloping horses produce ""sound textures""--the collective result of many similar acoustic events. Sound textures are distinguished by temporal homogeneity, suggesting they could be recognized with time-averaged statistics. To test this hypothesis, we processed real-world textures with an auditory model containing filters tuned for sound frequencies and their modulations, and measured statistics of the resulting decomposition. We then assessed the realism and recognizability of novel sounds synthesized to have matching statistics. Statistics of individual frequency channels, capturing spectral power and sparsity, generally failed to produce compelling synthetic textures; however, combining them with correlations between channels produced identifiable and natural-sounding textures. Synthesis quality declined if statistics were computed from biologically implausible auditory models. The results suggest that sound texture perception is mediated by relatively simple statistics of early auditory representations, presumably computed by downstream neural populations. The synthesis methodology offers a powerful tool for their further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1990350348,"Part of the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the upregulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) resulting in increased NO production. NO contributes to cell signaling by inducing posttranslational protein modifications. Under pathological conditions there is a shift from the signal transducing actions to the formation of protein tyrosine nitration by secondary products like peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide. We identified amyloid β (Aβ) as an NO target, which is nitrated at tyrosine 10 (3NTyr10-Aβ). Nitration of Aβ accelerated its aggregation and was detected in the core of Aβ plaques of APP/PS1 mice and AD brains. NOS2 deficiency or oral treatment with the NOS2 inhibitor L-NIL strongly decreased 3NTyr10-Aβ, overall Aβ deposition and cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. Further, injection of 3NTyr10-Aβ into the brain of young APP/PS1 mice induced β-amyloidosis. This suggests a disease modifying role for NOS2 in AD and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target.

A posttranslational modification of Aβ mediated by NOS2 Nitration of Aβ at tyrosine 10 regulates its aggregation in vitro and in vivo Nitrated Aβ is found in the core of amyloid plaques in AD and in APP/PS1 mice Nitrated Aβ acts as a seeding agent in the brains of APP/PS1 mice Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and decline of cognitive functions. Besides the classical histopathological hallmarks, extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, neuroinflammation has been established as a major component (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010Querfurth H.W. LaFerla F.M. Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). This inflammatory response includes the activation of astrocytes and microglial cells localized to senile plaques and the release of biochemical markers, including cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide, that are found to be increased in the brains of patients with AD (Glass et al., 2010Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Mechanisms underlying inflammation in neurodegeneration.Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). While the generation of Aβ peptides from the amyloid precursor protein as well as their propensity to aggregate into β-cross sheet fibrils has been well characterized (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010Querfurth H.W. LaFerla F.M. Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar), the mutual interactions between neuroinflammation, Aβ formation and deposition remain to be elucidated. While neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) is constitutively expressed in a subset of neurons, AD-associated inflammation can increase NOS1 and the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression in neurons (Fernández-Vizarra et al., 2004Fernández-Vizarra P.

NOS2 catalyzes the generation of NO, which has been implicated in impairment of mitochondrial respiration (Beal, 2000Beal M.F.

Lipton S.A. Cell death: protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases.Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) during neurodegeneration. One of the fingerprints of NO is tyrosine nitration, a posttranslational protein modification, resulting in the formation of 3′-nitrotyrosine residues (Radi, 2004Radi R. Nitric oxide, oxidants, and protein tyrosine nitration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4003-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) that can induce structural changes leading to protein aggregation (Radi, 2004Radi R.

Aberrant expression of NOS isoforms in Alzheimer's disease is structurally related to nitrotyrosine formation.Brain Res. 2002; 953: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), prominently in brain areas that are affected in AD (Hensley et al., 1998Hensley K. Maidt M.L. Yu Z. Sang H. Markesbery W.R. Floyd R.A. Electrochemical analysis of protein nitrotyrosine and dityrosine in the Alzheimer brain indicates region-specific accumulation.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8126-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, it is unknown why the Aβ peptide, present at high levels under nonpathological conditions in humans, under certain circumstances starts to multimerize leading to the formation of Aβ oligomers and further to high molecular weight fibrils and plaques. In murine models of AD, the overexpression of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in the formation of plaque pathology, whereas wild-type mice and rats do not innately develop amyloid deposits with age (Shivers et al., 1988Shivers B.D. Hilbich C. Multhaup G. Salbaum M. Beyreuther K. Seeburg P.H. Alzheimer's disease amyloidogenic glycoprotein: expression pattern in rat brain suggests a role in cell contact.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), even after overexpression of endogenous APP (Jankowsky et al., 2007Jankowsky J.L. Younkin L.H. Gonzales V. Fadale D.J. Slunt H.H. Lester H.A. Younkin S.G. Borchelt D.R. Rodent A beta modulates the solubility and distribution of amyloid deposits in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22707-22720Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). APP is a highly conserved transmembrane protein with only 4% difference in amino acid between human, monkey, mouse, and rat sequence. Three of these differences (R5 → G, Y10 → F, and H13 → R) are localized to the Aβ domain (Figure 1A ), giving rise to speculations about the importance of these changes for amyloid deposition. Surprisingly, synthetic peptides containing these mutations do not differ in the propensity to form high molecular weight aggregates in vitro (Wahle et al., 2006Wahle T. Thal D.R. Sastre M. Rentmeister A. Bogdanovic N. Famulok M. Heneka M.T. Walter J. GGA1 is expressed in the human brain and affects the generation of amyloid beta-peptide.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12838-12846Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation could be that posttranslational modifications of the Aβ peptide are essential to initiate its aggregation, as it has been shown for pyroglutamate-modified Aβ (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010Querfurth H.W. LaFerla F.M. Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar, He and Barrow, 1999He W. Barrow C.J. The A beta 3-pyroglutamyl and 11-pyroglutamyl peptides found in senile plaque have greater beta-sheet forming and aggregation propensities in vitro than full-length A beta.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Of note, induction of aggregation by NO modifications has been reported for other disease-relevant proteins (Nakamura and Lipton, 2009Nakamura T. Lipton S.A. Cell death: protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases.Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With regards to the amino acid sequence of Aβ, the tyrosine at position 10 is a potential target for protein nitration. Since there is so far no mechanistic explanation of how expression of NOS2 and the subsequent production of NO and its reaction products modulate the progression of AD, we speculated that nitration of Aβ might contribute to AD pathology. We report here the presence of Aβ nitrated at tyrosine 10 in AD as well as in AD mouse models. This modification accelerated the deposition of human Aβ. We further find that Aβ burden and deficits in memory formation were ameliorated in APP/PS1 NOS2 (−/−) mice or by pharmacological treatment with a NOS2 inhibitor. Finally, nitrated Aβ was able to induce β-amyloidosis in APP/PS1 mice. These results underline the importance of this posttranslational modification as a potential therapeutic target. Since tyrosine 10 represents a potential nitration side (Figure 1A), we tested the availability of this amino acid for this posttranslational modification in vitro. Performing mass spectrometry analysis after tryptic digestion of Aβ1-42 that was either nitrated using peroxynitrite or the NO-donor Sin-1, we observed the described fragmentation pattern of a nitrated peptide (Petersson et al., 2001Petersson A.S. Steen H. Kalume D.E. Caidahl K. Roepstorff P. Investigation of tyrosine nitration in proteins by mass spectrometry.J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 616-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This pattern was missing using Aβ1-42 bearing a tyrosine to alanine mutation (see Figure S1 available online), suggesting that tyrosine 10 is a potential nitration target in vitro. To detect Aβ nitrated at tyrosine 10 (3NTyr10-Aβ), we generated an antiserum specifically recognizing this epitope (3NTyr10-Aβ antiserum). This antiserum showed strong immunoreactivity against peroxynitrite-treated Aβ1-42 peptide or synthetically-nitrated Aβ1-42 (Aβ42(3NT)Y), which was absent in case of the untreated peptide (Figure 1B). We observed a very low amount of reactivity when treating Aβ1-42Y10F mutant peptide with peroxynitrite. This might be caused by the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine by hydroxyl radicals generated during the decomposition of peroxynitrite (Ferger et al., 2001Ferger B. Themann C. Rose S. Halliwell B. Jenner P. 6-hydroxydopamine increases the hydroxylation and nitration of phenylalanine in vivo: implication of peroxynitrite formation.J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, there was no reactivity toward Aβ1-42 bearing a Y10A mutation after incubation with peroxynitrite (Figure S1). Using this antiserum, we were able to detect 3NTyr10-Aβ in the supernatant of NOS2 overexpressing HEK293 cells after exogenous addition of nonaggregated Aβ, demonstrating that NOS2 is able to induce this posttranslational modification before Aβ deposits form (Figure S1). Immunohistochemical analysis of AD and control brains by 3NTyr10-Aβ antiserum revealed a lack of immunoreactivity in control brains, whereas in AD brain, the core of amyloid plaques was intensively labeled, as confirmed by IC16 double staining (Figure 1C). Measuring the relative amounts of 3NTyr10-Aβ by sandwich ELISA in SDS-soluble fractions of human brain samples, we detected 3NTyr10-Aβ in the SDS fraction of AD patients and only to very low amount in nondemented controls (Figure 1D). Further, the relative signal ratio of 3NTyr10-Aβ between control and AD patients was comparable to that of Aβ1-42 (Figure 1D). Of note, we failed to detect any 3NTyr10-Aβ in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of control, mild cognitive impaired, and AD patients underlining the insoluble properties of this species (Figure S1). Analysis of brain sections from 5- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice revealed a colocalization of antibody IC16 against Aβ with the 3NTyr10-Aβ antiserum from beginning of plaque formation starting at 5 months of age in this AD mouse model (Figures 2A and 2B ). This costaining was observed in all brain areas where amyloid plaques are formed. In addition, colocalization was observed independently of plaque size, since it was already detectable in tiny plaques of 10 μm diameter in 5-month-old animals (Figure 2C), suggesting that formation of 3NTyr10-Aβ is an early event in plaque development. Similar to human AD brain, in APP/PS1 the 3NTyr10-Aβ immunoreactivity was localized to the core of the plaque surrounded by IC16 immunoreactivity (Figure 2D). Evaluation of individual Aβ plaque sizes by immunohistochemistry with antibody IC16 and the area of the 3NTyr10-Aβ positive core of 5- and 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice revealed that there are no changes in the average 3NTyr10-Aβ core size (Figures 2E and 2F), suggesting that the core, once formed, does not substantially increase in size any further. Nevertheless, we observed plaque growth between 5 and 9 months that was solely caused by accumulation of nonnitrated Aβ, as detected by IC16 immunoreactivity (Figures 2E and 2F). As a consequence, there was a highly significant drop in the 3NTyr10-Aβ/Aβ ratio (Figure 2G). In addition, we were able to immunoprecipitate 3NTyr10-Aβ of brain homogenates sequentially extracted with PBS, RIPA, SDS, and HIFP using 3NTyr10-Aβ antiserum. Using 6E10 as detection antibody, we were able to detect high amounts of nitrated Aβ in the SDS-soluble fraction and to smaller extent in the RIPA- and HFIP-soluble fractions of APP/PS1 mice (Figure 2H). Determining the relative amounts of 3NTyr10-Aβ in SDS fractions of wild-type, APP/PS1, and APP/PS-1 NOS2 (−/−) animals by sandwich ELISA, we were unable to detect this species in wild-type mice, but in APP/PS1 mice. In turn, APP/PS1 mice lacking NOS2 (−/−) showed a 74% reduction of 3NTyr10-Aβ (Figure 2I). Since N-terminal modifications of Aβ have been shown to induce its aggregation, we speculated whether nitration of Aβ exerts a similar effect. Indeed, incubation of synthetic Aβ1-42 with peroxynitrite or the NO donor Sin-1 resulted in increased generation of high molecular weight SDS-resistant oligomers (Figures 3A and S2). Using Aβ1-42 peptides with a tyrosine to alanine or phenylalanine mutation (Aβ42Y10A or Aβ42Y10F) reduced aggregation to the level of untreated Aβ1-42 (Figures 3A and S2). In case of the nonmutated Aβ1-42, we observed the incorporation of nitrated Aβ1-42 into oligomers (Figure 3C). There was a very low amount of nitrated Aβ1-42Y10F detectable using the 3NTyr10-Aβ antiserum. Finally, we confirmed our western blot results by detecting an increased formation rate of β sheet amyloid fibril structures of nitrated Aβ1-42 using thioflavin T (Figure 3D), which was prevented using the Aβ42Y10F peptide treated with peroxynitrite. Oxidative conditions can also result in the formation of dityrosine cross-linked proteins (Kato et al., 2000Kato Y. Wu X. Naito M. Nomura H. Kitamoto N. Osawa T. Immunochemical detection of protein dityrosine in atherosclerotic lesion of apo-E-deficient mice using a novel monoclonal antibody.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether peroxynitrite is able to induce this modification as well. Using the dityrosine specific antibody IC3 we were able to detect dityrosine cross-linked Aβ in vitro after incubation with increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite (Figure 3E). High concentrations of peroxynitrite resulted in decreased formation of this species, whereas formation of 3NTyr10-Aβ increased even further (Figure 3E). Dityrosine immunoreactivity was also found to be present in the insoluble fractions of aggregated Aβ (Figure 3F). In addition, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of dityrosine with Aβ or 3NTyr10-Aβ in sections of APP/PS1 mice, revealing plaque localization and 3NTyr10-Aβ colocalization of dityrosine immunoreactivity (Figure 3G). These results suggest that dityrosine formation might also contribute to Aβ aggregation. Looking at effects on spatial memory formation by radial arm maze in 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice, we noticed a strong protection of the NOS2 gene knockout for memory deficits (Figure 4A ). In addition, we conducted a therapeutic approach by treating plaque containing mice from 7–12 months with the selective NOS2 inhibitor L-NIL resulting in a reversion of APP/PS1 phenotype concerning reference memory errors (Figure 4A). Since memory formation and synaptic plasticity are closely connected, we determined the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of the CA1 region in response to a stimulus of the Schaffer's collaterals in WT, APP/PS1, NOS2 (−/−), APP/PS1 NOS2 (−/−), and APP/PS1 L-NIL treated mice at 4 months (Figure S3). APP/PS1 mice of that age already contain insoluble, high-density amyloid depositions that are positive 3NTyr10-Aβ (Figure S3), that were also found at later age, as well as in AD patients (Figure S3). Analysis of the LTP in APP/PS1 mice showed a reduction LTP, which was not observed in wild-type, NOS2-deficient, or L-NIL-treated mice (Figure S3). In order to establish a causal link between the observed protective phenotype of NOS2 deficiency and Aβ nitration, we studied the effects of nitrated Aβ on synaptic plasticity. Therefore we treated wild-type (WT) mice acute hippocampal slices with either untreated Aβ1-42, nitrated Aβ1-42, or a control sample that underwent the same nitration steps without adding Aβ. The application of untreated Aβ1-42 decreased LTP 55–60 min after TBS application compared to the slices treated with the control sample (p = 0.03, Student's t test); Figure 4B). When Aβ1-42 was additionally nitrated, the initial phase of LTP was already significantly decreased compared to controls and this resulted in highly significant differences 55–60 min after TBS (p = 0.0001, Student's t test). The average potentiation in control treated slices was 199 ± 8.6% (n = 11 slices /5 animals), Aβ1-42 treated slices reached a value of 163% ± 10.9% (n = 11 slices/6 animals), and peroxynitrite treated Aβ1-42 led to a potentiation of 141% ± 7.8% (n = 12 slices/7 animals) (Figure 4B). Comparing the results of the nitrated Aβ1-42 with the untreated Aβ1-42 revealed that the nitrated Aβ1-42 showed a significantly reduced potentiation (t = 60 min, p = 0.02; t = 80 min, p = 0.028; Student's t test) in comparison to untreated Aβ1-42. Overall the strongest effect on synaptic plasticity was observed, when Aβ1-42 was nitrated. This is in line with the behavioral data and supports the notion, that nitrated Aβ1-42 is more powerful in disturbing processes of synaptic plasticity than Aβ1-42 alone. Subsequent analysis of the mice from the behavioral experiment for Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 revealed a strong reduction in the SDS-soluble fraction (Figures 4C–4F), which was smaller than the reduction of 3NTyr10-Aβ (Figure 2I). Consequently, we observed an increase in the Aβ40/3NTyr10-Aβ and Aβ42/3NTyr10-Aβ ratio (Figure 4G). There were no changes in the expression of APP, neprilysin, and IDE at 12 months of age (Figures 4C and 4D). These findings were confirmed by reduced plaque load in the neocortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 NOS2 (−/−) mice by thioflavin S staining (Figures 4H and 4I). In keeping with this, loss of NOS2 activity during the phase of plaque formation has a beneficial effect on the formation of Aβ deposits. It is conceivable that the formation of amyloid plaques needs a nucleation event. We therefore tested whether nitrated Aβ1-42 can act as a seed of deposition. Testing whether small amounts of nitrated Aβ1-42 induces the formation of Aβ oligomers in vitro, we observed a concentration dependent increase in high molecular weight oligomers by western blot analysis (Figure 5A ). To test the hypothesis in vivo, we injected 2.5 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml solution of either Aβ1-42 or nitrated Aβ1-42 aged for 18 hr into the brain of 2.5-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Verification of the injected Aβ peptides by western blot demonstrated the nitration status using the 3NTyr10-Aβ antibody and increased formation of Aβ oligomers using antibody 6E10 (Figure 5B). Analysis of the mice after 8 weeks showed strong 3NTyr10-Aβ immunoreactivity in case of the mice injected with nitrated Aβ1-42 (Figure 5D). In addition, nitrated Aβ1-42 was able to induce amyloid seeds that were localized distant from the injection side (Figure 5D), that were missing in mice injected with nonnitrated Aβ (Figure 5C). These seeds were composed of nitrated Aβ surrounded by nonnitrated Aβ (Figure 5E), thus resembling the immunomorphological appearance of plaques detected in AD brains. In addition, this species also evoked an increase of Iba1 suggesting a role for microglial activation. Direct propagation of Aβ aggregation by neuroinflammation is unknown; even so, this may be important for the development of disease modifying therapies. In this study, we propose a causative link among the Aβ cascade, activation of NOS2, and the subsequent increase in its reaction product nitric oxide during AD. NO is a free radical gas that functions physiologically as a diffusible neurotransmitter and signaling molecule. Depending on its concentration it can conduct different actions. At low concentrations, it competes with oxygen for cytochrome oxidase, thereby regulating energy metabolism (Poderoso, 2009Poderoso J.J. The formation of peroxynitrite in the applied physiology of mitochondrial nitric oxide.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 484: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indirect effects are also mediated by regulating cGMP synthesis and subsequently cGMP-dependent signaling cascades (Poderoso, 2009Poderoso J.J. The formation of peroxynitrite in the applied physiology of mitochondrial nitric oxide.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 484: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, at high concentration, NOS2-derived NO results in the formation of reactive peroxynitrite, which causes irreversible nitration or nitrosylation of specific amino acid residues, resulting in aberrant protein conformation and function, e.g., in the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (Szabó et al., 2007Szabó C.

Since nitric oxide and its reaction products like peroxynitrite are able to introduce posttranslational modifications at cysteine and tyrosine residues (Gow et al., 2004Gow A.J. Farkouh C.R. Munson D.A. Posencheg M.A. Ischiropoulos H. Biological significance of nitric oxide-mediated protein modifications.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that Aβ nitrated at tyrosine 10 has an increased propensity to form high molecular weight aggregates in vitro. In line with this, we observed a protective effect on amyloid plaque formation and memory function by deleting the NOS2 gene from APP/PS1 mice. Our data are in accordance with a previous report using the Tg2576 mouse model crossbred with the human PS1 A246E mutation (Nathan et al., 2005Nathan C. Calingasan N. Nezezon J. Ding A. Lucia M.S.

To explore the consequences of this interaction, we examined task-related firing of single units from the mPFC of mice exploring standard and modified versions of the elevated plus maze (EPM), an innate anxiety paradigm. Hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) were simultaneously monitored. The population of mPFC units distinguished between safe and aversive locations within the maze, regardless of the nature of the anxiogenic stimulus. Strikingly, mPFC units with stronger task-related activity were more strongly coupled to theta-frequency activity in the vHPC LFP. Lastly, task-related activity was inversely correlated with behavioral measures of anxiety. These results clarify the role of the vHPC-mPFC circuit in innate anxiety and underscore how specific inputs may be involved in the generation of behaviorally relevant neural activity within the mPFC."

https://openalex.org/W2041373424,"A fundamental property of neuronal circuits is the ability to adapt to altered sensory inputs. It is well established that the functional synaptic changes underlying this adaptation are reflected by structural modifications in excitatory neurons. In contrast, the degree to which structural plasticity in inhibitory neurons accompanies functional changes is less clear. Here, we use two-photon imaging to monitor the fine structure of inhibitory neurons in mouse visual cortex after deprivation induced by retinal lesions. We find that a subset of inhibitory neurons carry dendritic spines, which form glutamatergic synapses. Removal of visual input correlates with a rapid and lasting reduction in the number of inhibitory cell spines. Similar to the effects seen for dendritic spines, the number of inhibitory neuron boutons dropped sharply after retinal lesions. Together, these data suggest that structural changes in inhibitory neurons may precede structural changes in excitatory circuitry, which ultimately result in functional adaptation following sensory deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2071266986,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by neuronal loss and brain plaques of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ), but the means by which Aβ may induce neuronal loss is not entirely clear. Although high concentrations of Aβ (μm) can induce direct toxicity to neurons, we find that low concentration (nm) induce neuronal loss through a microglia-mediated mechanism. In mixed neuronal-glial cultures from rat cerebellum, 250 nm Aβ1–42 (added as monomers, oligomers or fibers) induced about 30% loss of neurons between 2 and 3 days. This neuronal loss occurred without any increase in neuronal apoptosis or necrosis, and no neuronal loss occurred with Aβ42–1. Aβ greatly increased the phagocytic capacity of microglia and induced phosphatidylserine exposure (an “eat-me” signal) on neuronal processes. Blocking exposed phosphatidylserine by adding annexin V or an antibody to phosphatidylserine or inhibiting microglial phagocytosis by adding either cytochalasin D (to block actin polymerization) or cyclo(RGDfV) (to block vitronectin receptors) significantly prevented neuronal loss. Loss of neuronal synapses occurred in parallel with loss of cell bodies and was also prevented by blocking phagocytosis. Inhibition of phagocytosis prevented neuronal loss with no increase in neuronal death, even after 7 days, suggesting that microglial phagocytosis was the primary cause of neuronal death induced by nanomolar Aβ.

Alzheimer disease is also characterized by extensive loss of neurons and synapses. However, there is little or no evidence of excess neuronal death in AD patient brains compared with age-matched controls (1Perry G. Nunomura A. Lucassen P. Lassmann H. Smith M.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1268-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raina A.K. Zhu X. Monteiro M. Takeda A. Smith M.A. Prog.

One possible explanation for this is that neuronal death rates are low, and dead neurons are removed almost immediately after they are generated (1Perry G. Nunomura A. Lucassen P. Lassmann H. Smith M.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1268-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that the neurons are removed by phagocytosis before they die (4Fuhrmann M. Bittner T. Jung C.K.

This type of cell death we shall refer to as “primary phagocytosis” with the defining characteristic that inhibition of phagocytosis prevents cell death.

The main phagocytes in the brain are microglia, which are essentially resident brain macrophages. In AD, neuritic plaques of fibrillar amyloid contain inflammatory-activated microglia (5Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and in culture, Aβ potently activates microglia and their phagocytic capacity (6Wilkinson B. Koenigsknecht-Talboo J. Grommes C. Lee C.Y. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20842-20850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fibrillar Aβ (at high concentrations) activates microglia via a variety of receptors including TLR2, TLR4, CD36, CD47, and class A scavenger receptors, which activate Src, Vav, and Rac, which in turn activate both the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and phagocytosis (7Reed-Geaghan E.G. Savage J.C. Hise A.G. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11982-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of cells, however, requires recognition by the microglia of signals present on the target cell. Exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells is a signal recognized by phagocytes to eat that cell (i.e. it is an “eat-me” signal). Receptors/adaptors thought to be involved in PS recognition include the vitronectin receptor, an integrin αvβ3/5, binding PS via adaptor proteins such as MFG-E8 (8Witting A. Müller P. Herrmann A. Kettenmann H. Nolte C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Wu Y. Tibrewal N. Birge R.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 189-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The most well known cause of PS exposure on the surface of a cell is as a result of apoptotic signaling (10Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, 11Van den Eijnde S.M. Boshart L. Reutelingsperger C.P. De Zeeuw C.I. Vermeij-Keers C. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, PS can be exposed reversibly or irreversibly for a variety of other reasons, including the following: calcium- or oxidant-induced activation of the phospholipid scramblase (which transports PS between the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane) and oxidant- or ATP-depletion-induced inactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase (which pumps PS from the outer to inner leaflet) (12Bratton D.L.

Aβ itself can induce neurons to expose PS (15Mohmmad Abdul H. Butterfield D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1741: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and PS exposure may be elevated on neurons in Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive deficit (16Bader Lange M.L. Cenini G.

Thus, Aβ may both activate phagocytosis by microglia and cause neurons to expose the “eat-me” signal PS. This suggests the possibility that Aβ may cause microglial phagocytosis of viable PS-exposing neurons. At high concentrations (μm), Aβ can directly kill neurons in culture, but at lower concentrations (nm), Aβ kills neurons at least partly via inflammatory activation of glia (18Maezawa I. Zimin P.I. Wulff H. Jin L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3693-3706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the direct Aβ neurotoxicity are unclear but may involve activation of receptors or formation of amyloid pores (19Cappai R. Barnham K.J. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, because the concentrations of Aβ1–42 required to induce direct neurotoxicity are so high (10–100 μm) (20Liao M.Q.

Int. 2009; 55: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), it is unclear whether this direct neurotoxicity is ever relevant in vivo. The mechanism of the indirect neurotoxicity of Aβ at low concentrations is also unclear, but in general, inflammatory-activated microglia kill neurons via oxidants from phagocyte NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide from inducible NO synthase, glutamate, or proteases (26Brown G.C. Neher J.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 2010; 41: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, recently, we have characterized a novel mechanism by which microglia activated by LPS or lipoteichoic acid (agonists for TLR4 and TLR2, respectively) induce neuronal death. This involved activated microglia inducing the reversible exposure of PS on neurons and then phagocytosing those neurons via a PS/MFG-E8/vitronectin receptor-mediated pathway (27Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Aβ can also activate microglia and their phagocytic capacity via TLR2/4 (7Reed-Geaghan E.G. Savage J.C. Hise A.G. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11982-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 28Jana M. Palencia C.A. Pahan K. J.

Immunol. 2010; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), and the potential involvement of phagocytosis in neuronal loss was indicated in preliminary experiments using Aβ25–35 (27Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested here whether Aβ-induced neuronal loss in culture is mediated by microglial phagocytosis. We find here that nanomolar Aβ1–42 induces microglia-dependent neuronal loss. Blocking phagocytosis prevents this neuronal loss and leaves live neurons, suggesting that Aβ is inducing the phagocytosis of live neurons and that blocking phagocytosis might be of therapeutic benefit.

After 10–20 min of incubation at room temperature, the solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm, supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and HFIP was evaporated. For soluble oligomers, the solution was incubated for 24 h at room temperature with shaking. Fibrils were prepared by incubating the solution for 7 days at room temperature. Monomers were prepared by dissolving Aβ1–42 in HFIP and, after removal of HFIP by evaporation, resuspending in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 0.5 mm. All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) and approved by the Cambridge University local ethical committee. Primary mixed neuronal/glial cultures from postnatal day 5–7 rat cerebella were prepared as described previously (32Kinsner A. Pilotto V. Deininger S. Brown G.C. Coecke S. Hartung T. Bal-Price A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well on poly-l-lysine coated 24-well plates and stimulated after 7–9 days in vitro. Glial cultures and pure microglial cultures were prepared as described previously (33Bal-Price A. Brown G.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6480-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To remove microglial cells, mixed neuronal/glial cultures were treated with 50 mm l-leucine-methyl-ester for 4 h, and then medium was replaced with conditioned medium from sister cultures. Cells were treated with 10 nm–10 μm of amyloid β 1–42. Cytochalasin D (1 μm) was added 48 h after stimulation. Annexin V (100 nm) and phosphatidylserine antibody (5 μg/ml) were added together with Aβ1–42 or 48 h after stimulation as specified. Cyclo(RGDfV)/cyclo(RADfV) peptides (50 μm) were added together with Aβ1–42. Phosphatidylserine antibody and mouse control IgG were washed with PBS using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (10-kDa molecular mass cut-off, Millipore). Antibodies were blocked with 5-fold molar excess of a Fc region-specific F(ab′) fragment to prevent recognition of the antibodies through their Fc domains by microglial Fcγ receptors. To test for LPS contamination, Aβ1–42 was preincubated with polymyxin B (1000 units/ml, 30 min at 37 °C) and then diluted into the culture medium (final polymyxin B concentration was 10 units/ml). LPS was used at 100 ng/ml. To induce neuronal apoptosis or necrosis, cultures were treated for 2 h with glutamate (200 μm) or peroxynitrite (100 μm), respectively. Cell densities were assessed 1, 2, 3, or 7 days after treatment. Cultures were labeled with nuclear stains Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) as well as microglia-specific marker Alexa Fluor 488-tagged isolectin B4 (2 μg/ml). Four images per well were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope. Healthy neurons were recognized by their morphology in phase contrast images, neurons with condensed chromatin were scored as apoptotic, whereas propidium iodide-positive neurons were scored as necrotic. Microglia cells separated from glial cultures were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on poly-l-lysine coated 24-well plates and left to adhere overnight. The culture was then treated with 250 nm Aβ1–42 for 1 h or 24 h before 3 μl of 1:10 dilution of 1 μm fluorescently labeled carboxylate-modified microspheres were added, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and the culture was washed several times to remove excess beads. Cells were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml), propidium iodide (1 μg/ml), and Alexa Fluor 488-tagged isolectin B4 (2 μg/ml). Four images per well were taken using a Leica DMI6000 CS microscope. Bead number per cell was evaluated in >50 cells per condition. Three days after treatment, live cells were incubated with EGFP-tagged annexin V reagent (1:250) for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde as described below. Cultures were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and quenched with 30 mm glycine solution in PBS. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Annexin V staining was detergent-sensitive; therefore, for annexin V-labeling of cells, the permeabilization step was omitted. Unspecific epitopes were blocked with 5% normal serum of secondary antibody host species for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then with secondary antibody in 2.5% normal serum of secondary antibody host for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem) and imaged under a Leica DMI6000 CS microscope or a confocal Olympus Fluoview 300 microscope. For all experiments, all conditions were repeated in duplicate. Experiments were replicated in at least three independent cultures. All data presented are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics software. Normality of data was verified by a Shapiro-Wilk test. Means were compared by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test. p values < 0.05 were considered as significant. We investigated the neurotoxicity of amyloid β 1–42 peptide (Aβ1–42) in mixed neuronal/glial cultures from rat cerebellum. These cultures consisted of 72 ± 7% of NeuN-positive neurons (almost all cerebellar granule neurons), 6 ± 1% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes and 3 ± 1% of isolectin B4-positive microglia. Cultures were treated with different concentrations of Aβ1–42 (2.5 nm–10 μm) for 3 days. There was significant loss of neurons in the cultures treated with 10 nm to 10 μm of Aβ1–42 without visible neuronal death by apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 1, A and B). Because these neurons are post-mitotic, and the number of neurons in untreated cultures changes little with time (see Fig. 3A), loss of neurons corresponds to either phagocytosis or neuronal disintegration. Half-maximal neuronal loss was at ∼5 nm Aβ1–42, but neuronal loss was not reliably reproducible at this concentration (Fig. 1A). Further experiments were performed using Aβ1–42 concentration of 250 nm, as this concentration caused maximal and reproducible neuronal loss of 28 ± 5%.FIGURE 3Neuronal loss occurs between 48 and 72 h of treatment. Mixed neuronal/glial cultures were treated with 250 nm Aβ1–42. Little or no loss is observed in non-treated control cultures (A) or during the first 2 days as well as from 3 to 7 days of Aβ1–42 treatment (B).

Dhawan G. Combs C.K. J. Neuroinflammation. 2009; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To investigate whether various conformations of Aβ1–42 peptide had different effects in mixed neuronal/glial culture, cells were treated with monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of Aβ1–42 at the same concentration. All conformations caused significant neuronal loss; however, there was no difference between monomeric and preaggregated Aβ1–42 forms (Fig. 2). The concentration dependence of neuronal loss induced by various Aβ1–42 conformations was also similar in the range of 2.5 nm to 1 μm (data not shown). This is perhaps unsurprising as over the 3 days of the experiment the different preparations of Aβ1–42 are likely to adopt the same conformation. The monomeric form of Aβ1–42 was used for all further experiments. To investigate the time course of Aβ1–42-induced neuronal loss, cultures were assessed at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days after Aβ1–42 was added (Fig. 3). Little or no neuronal loss was observed during the first 2 days of treatment; however, between 48 and 72 h of treatment, 29 ± 3% of neurons were lost in the Aβ1–42-treated culture. Aβ1–42 had no significant effect on the number of necrotic or apoptotic neurons compared with the untreated cultures at any particular time point. Thus, Aβ1–42 induced neuronal loss between 2 and 3 days without changing the number of dead cells significantly. Reverse peptide Aβ42–1, prepared in the same way, caused no loss of neurons (Fig. 4A). The solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) added alone also did not cause any neuronal loss (Fig. 4A). Because chemical synthesis of peptides is not performed under sterile conditions and a component of bacterial cell wall (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) is known to activate microglia and cause neuronal loss in mixed neuronal/glial cultures (27Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), the LPS-binding antibiotic polymyxin B was added to eliminate the possibility that neuronal loss occurred due to contamination of the Aβ1–42 with LPS. Although LPS-induced loss of neurons was completely prevented by polymyxin B, pre-incubation of Aβ1–42 with polymyxin B did not inhibit Aβ1–42-induced neuronal loss (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that this loss was not mediated by LPS. Because Aβ1–42 may cause neuronal loss due to direct neurotoxicity as well as through activated microglia, we tested whether the observed Aβ1–42-induced neuronal loss was dependent on the presence of microglial cells in the culture. Microglia were selectively eliminated by treatment with the lysosomotropic reagent l-leucine-methyl-ester. l-Leucine-methyl-ester treatment effectively removed microglia cells without affecting astrocytes or neurons in the culture (27Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). When these microglia-depleted cultures were treated with 250 nm Aβ1–42, no neuronal loss occurred (Fig. 4C), thereby implicating microglia as mediators of the neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 at low concentrations. In contrast, high concentration of Aβ1–42 killed neurons through microglia-independent mechanism because microglial cell removal did not prevent neuronal loss induced by 10 μm Aβ1–42 (Fig. 4C). Aβ1–42 is known to affect microglial phagocytic capacity. To investigate whether low concentrations of Aβ1–42 are sufficient to enhance phagocytic capacity of primary microglia, pure microglia were treated with Aβ1–42 and then presented with fluorescent carboxylate-modified microbeads. (The negative charge of carboxylate mimics that of phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of cells.) Stimulation with 250 nm Aβ1–42 increased microglial phagocytic capacity ∼2-fold after 1 h and ∼3-fold after 24 h (Fig. 5, A and B). Because Aβ increased microglial phagocytosis, it is possible that the Aβ-induced neuronal loss was due to microglial phagocytosis of neurons. Therefore, we investigated whether blocking phagocytosis could inhibit Aβ1–42-induced neuronal loss. Cytochalasin D was used to inhibit F-actin polymerization, which is essential for phagocytosis to occur. When cytochalasin D was added to Aβ1–42-treated cultures, it completely prevented neuronal loss (Fig. 6A), indicating that phagocytosis (or other processes dependent on F-actin polymerization) was required for Aβ-induced loss of neurons. Microglial phagocytosis of cells is mediated by recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on the external plasma membrane surface of target cell. Treatment of mixed neuronal cultures with Aβ1–42 increased PS exposure by ∼40% as determined by binding of fluorescently labeled annexin V (Fig. 7A). Most of the external PS was localized to neuronal processes and was distributed along β-tubulin III-positive neurites (Fig. 7B). To mask surface PS, we added annexin V, which is known to bind to PS with high affinity and to block phagocytosis mediated by PS (35Krahling S. Callahan M.K. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When annexin V was added to Aβ1–42-treated mixed cultures, neuronal loss was completely prevented (Fig. 6B). An antibody to phosphatidylserine also prevented Aβ1–42-induced neuronal loss, whereas control immunoglobulins did not have any effect (Fig. 6C). Cell surface phosphatidylserine is involved in Aβ binding to neurons (36Simakova O. Arispe N.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13719-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and annexin V can be protective against direct Aβ neurotoxicity (37Lee G. Pollard H.B. Arispe N. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1249-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D.J. Drew S.C. Smith D.G. Johanssen T. Lal V. Lau T.L. Perez K. Curtain C.C. Wade J.D. Separovic F. Masters C.L. Smith J.P. Barnham K.J. Cappai R. Neurobiol. Aging. 2011; 32: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that annexin V and the phosphatidylserine antibody blocked Aβ binding to cells and the subsequent activation of microglia rather than phagocytosis of PS-exposing neurons, these inhibitors were added 48 h after Aβ1–42. Both annexin V and PS antibody prevented neuronal loss when added at 48 h of treatment (Fig. 6D), indicating that the neuroprotective effect was due to the inhibition of phagocytosis. These experiments indicate that PS is an essential recognition signal for the Aβ-induced removal of neuronal cells by microglia. PS exposed on a target cell may be recognized by bridging proteins, including MFG-E8. MFG-E8, also known as lactadherin, is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to PS through C-terminal domains and to αv integrins expressed on the phagocytic cell through a RGD motif (39Raymond A. Ensslin M.A. Shur B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 106: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), thus establishing contact essential for phagocytosis. We used a specific αv/β3/5 receptor antagonist cyclo(RGDfV) (cRGD) peptide to inhibit this interaction (40Haubner R. Gratias R. Diefenbach B. Goodman S. Jonczyk A. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7461-7472Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar). cRGD effectively prevented neuronal loss, whereas a control peptide cyclo(RADfV) (cRAD) did not have any effect on neuronal loss (Fig. 6E). Note that these four different phagocytosis inhibitors (cytochalasin D, annexin V, PS antibody, and cyclo(RGDfV) all prevented Aβ-induced loss of live neurons, while causing no significant changes in the numbers of dead (apoptotic or necrotic) cells observed in the culture. This indicates that the neuronal loss was due to primary phagocytosis. If the neurons had been removed after they died (secondary phagocytosis), phagocytosis inhibitors would have increased the numbers of dead without changing the number of live cells. Thus, our results indicate that neuronal loss through phagocytosis was not preceded by neuronal death. Importantly, cRGD was equally protective at 7 days of treatment with Aβ1–42 (Fig. 6, F and G) as after 3 days, demonstrating that inhibition of phagocytosis did not merely delay neuronal death but rather saved viable neurons. When mixed neuronal/glial cultures were treated with Aβ1–42 for 3 days, the synaptic density of the culture was reduced by ∼30% as determined by synapsin I staining (Fig. 7, C and E). Co-treatment with cRGD or annexin V blocked synaptic loss (Fig. 7, C and E). Synapsin I staining was restricted to synaptic terminal"

These fossils reveal a mosaic of primitive and derived features that are distinct from those seen in other hominins. The ankle (talocrural) joint is mostly humanlike in form and inferred function, and there is some evidence for a humanlike arch and Achilles tendon. However, Au. sediba is apelike in possessing a more gracile calcaneal body and a more robust medial malleolus than expected. These observations suggest, if present models of foot function are correct, that Au. sediba may have practiced a unique form of bipedalism and some degree of arboreality. Given the combination of features in the Au. sediba foot, as well as comparisons between Au. sediba and older hominins, homoplasy is implied in the acquisition of bipedal adaptations in the hominin foot."

https://openalex.org/W1965586905,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine depletion alters neuronal activity in the direct and indirect pathways and leads to increased synchrony in the basal ganglia network. However, the origins of these changes remain elusive. Because GABAergic interneurons regulate activity of projection neurons and promote neuronal synchrony, we recorded from pairs of striatal fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and direct- or indirect-pathway MSNs after dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA. Synaptic properties of FS-MSN connections remained similar, yet within 3 days of dopamine depletion, individual FS cells doubled their connectivity to indirect-pathway MSNs, whereas connections to direct-pathway MSNs remained unchanged. A model of the striatal microcircuit revealed that such increases in FS innervation were effective at enhancing synchrony within targeted cell populations. These data suggest that after dopamine depletion, rapid target-specific microcircuit organization in the striatum may lead to increased synchrony of indirect-pathway MSNs that contributes to pathological network oscillations and motor symptoms of PD."

Mutations in mitochondrial respiratory chain genes cause a drop in intracellular ATP to levels sufficient for cell survival, but not sufficient to allow progression through the cell cycle (16Mandal S. Guptan P. Owusu-Ansah E. Banerjee U. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, in higher plants, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations suppress respiration (17Gonzalez-Meler M.A. Ribas-Carbo M. Siedow J.N. Drake B.G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The TCA cycle is a key component of cell metabolism. It not only generates the reduction equivalents needed to generate ATP in the respiratory chain, but also its metabolites serve as intermediates for the synthesis of amino acids, therefore providing the essential building blocks for cell growth and proliferation (18Weinberg F. Chandel N.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1177: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 2The abbreviations used are: IDHisocitrate dehydrogenasemiRNAmicroRNAmiR-183microRNA-183GPIglucose-6-phosphate isomeraseqPCRquantitative PCRLDHlactate dehydrogenaseαKGα-ketoglutarate. is a key enzyme of the TCA cycle that catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, generating one molecule of CO2 and a reduction equivalent in the process. In mammals, three isoforms of IDH have been described: one cytosolic NAD+-dependent form (IDH1) and two mitochondrial isoforms (IDH2 (NADP+-dependent) and IDH3 (NAD+-dependent)). Recently, it has been suggested that IDH2 serves as the main catalyst for this reaction in the TCA cycle outside the retina (19Hartong D.T. Dange M. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Colman R.F. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, a role for IDH2 in proliferation of cancer such as glioma or acute myeloid leukemia has been proposed (20Dang L. Jin S. Su S.M. Trends Mol.

Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15577) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes >1000 miRNAs, which may control ∼60% of mammalian genes (23Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6232) Google Scholar), suggesting that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of most cellular processes (24Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar).In this study, we provide evidence that high CO2 decreases cell proliferation (independently of pH and hypoxia) by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. This is due to induction of microRNA-183 (miR-183), which decreases IDH2 levels, leading to impaired cell proliferation and inability of the cells to survive during hypercapnia in galactose medium. Overexpression of IDH2 or inhibition of miR-183 ameliorates the effects of high CO2 on cell proliferation and enables cells to grow in galactose medium. Accordingly, high CO2 induces miR-183, which down-regulates IDH2, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased cell proliferation, which is of clinical relevance.DISCUSSIONPatients with chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can have high CO2 levels (hypercapnia), which are associated with worse outcomes (2Belkin R.A.

We observed decreased cell proliferation in cells exposed to high CO2 levels within 3 days, which was dose-dependent and independent from acidosis and hypoxia (Fig. 1). In commercial cell culture reactors, high CO2 was associated with decreased cell proliferation, which the authors attributed to increased osmolarity (32deZengotita V.M. Abston L.R. Schmelzer A.E. Shaw S. Miller W.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Zhu M.M. Goyal A. Rank D.L. Gupta S.K. Vanden Boom T. Lee S.S. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that the effects on proliferation are independent of osmolarity (supplemental Fig. S4). We also carried out our experiments with exposure to rather high pCO2 (120 mm Hg); therefore, we first set out to determine whether the decreased cell count observed could be attributed to cell death secondary to cytotoxic effects of CO2. We found that exposure to high CO2 did not result in increased cell death. We also did not find differences in the distribution of cell cycle phases in cells exposed to high CO2, which rules out a cell cycle arrest as the cause for decreased proliferation. However, the cells had a decreased population doubling rate, indicating that cells exposed to high CO2 have a prolonged cell cycle time. Cells exposed to high CO2 had a slower proliferation rate of 25–30%, pointing to an alteration in cell metabolism, also manifested by decreased oxygen consumption and lower levels of ATP production (see Fig. 3).Cells exposed to elevated CO2 were unable to grow in glucose-free medium supplemented with galactose (Fig. 3), suggesting that high levels of aerobic glycolysis are required. We confirmed these data utilizing shRNA to suppress the levels of GPI. Cells expressing the GPI shRNA constructs did not survive in galactose medium, suggesting that high CO2 levels cause mitochondrial dysfunction, rendering the cells dependent on glycolysis for survival. After completion of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where the carbon skeleton gets further degraded to two molecules of carbon dioxide. We hypothesized that exposure to high CO2 would impair those reactions. Studies performed over 30 years ago showed that bicarbonate levels alter the function of dehydrogenases (43Guly M.F. Skorik L.V. Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 160-164PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 53-55PubMed Google Scholar). The first CO2 molecule in the TCA cycle is produced when isocitrate is converted to αKG by the enzyme IDH. We found that the addition of αKG rescued the negative effect of high levels of CO2 on cell proliferation. This is in agreement with the suggestion of αKG as a potential pharmacological agent to improve some mitochondrial pathological disorders such as those with ATP synthase deficiency (45Sgarbi G. Casalena G.A. Baracca A. Lenaz G. DiMauro S. Solaini G. Arch. Neurol. 2009; 66: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in patients undergoing lung resection to decrease oxidative stress (46Matzi V. Lindenmann J. Muench A. Greilberger J. Juan H. Wintersteiger R. Maier A. Smolle-Juettner F.M. Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. 2007; 32: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Interestingly, upon investigation of mitochondrial IDH isoforms, we found that the NADP+-dependent IDH2 (but not the NAD+-dependent IDH3) is down-regulated and that cell proliferation and survival in glucose-free medium are dependent on IDH2. Cells in which IDH2 levels were decreased with siRNA had a slower proliferation rate and were unable to survive in glucose-free medium; conversely, A549 cells stably overexpressing IDH2 had an increased proliferation rate similar to control conditions when exposed to high CO2 and were able to survive in galactose-free medium when exposed to high CO2. These findings, together with insights gained from studies on otherwise healthy patients with retinitis pigmentosa due to IDH3 mutation (19Hartong D.T. Dange M. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Colman R.F. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggest that not IDH3 but IDH2 serves as the main catalyst of the conversion of isocitrate to αKG in the TCA cycle.miR-183 is overexpressed in tumors such as medulloblastomas or breast cancer, and it has been found to negatively regulate proliferation and migration (47Gokhale A. Kunder R. Goel A. Sarin R. Moiyadi A. Shenoy A. Mamidipally C. Noronha S. Kannan S. Shirsat N.V. J. Cancer Res. Ther. 2010; 6: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Lowery A.J. Miller N. Dwyer R.M. Kerin M.J. BMC Cancer. 2010; 10: 502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that the decrease in IDH2 is mediated by miR-183 and that inhibition of miR-183 would rescue our phenotype, whereas transfection of control cells with precursor miR-183 would mimic the results found in cells exposed to high CO2 (see Fig. 6).In summary, as depicted schematically in Fig. 7, we have provided evidence that elevated CO2 levels induce miR-183, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction by down-regulating IDH2, leading to impaired proliferation of normal fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells. These findings may explain how the cell resists a metabolic stress such as high CO2 by down-regulating cell metabolic activity and therefore proliferation and why in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia there is significant failure to thrive.

In mammals, three isoforms of IDH have been described: one cytosolic NAD+-dependent form (IDH1) and two mitochondrial isoforms (IDH2 (NADP+-dependent) and IDH3 (NAD+-dependent)). Recently, it has been suggested that IDH2 serves as the main catalyst for this reaction in the TCA cycle outside the retina (19Hartong D.T. Dange M. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Colman R.F. Nat.

Loedige I. Filipowicz W. Nat. Rev.

This is due to induction of microRNA-183 (miR-183), which decreases IDH2 levels, leading to impaired cell proliferation and inability of the cells to survive during hypercapnia in galactose medium. Overexpression of IDH2 or inhibition of miR-183 ameliorates the effects of high CO2 on cell proliferation and enables cells to grow in galactose medium. Accordingly, high CO2 induces miR-183, which down-regulates IDH2, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased cell proliferation, which is of clinical relevance.

The signaling pathways sensitive to changes in CO2 levels in mammalian non-neuronal cells are incompletely understood (37Briva A. Vadász I. Lecuona E. Welch L.C. Chen J. Dada L.A. Trejo H.E.

Schroeder J.I. Iba K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Hu J. Zhong C. Ding C. Chi Q. Walz A. Mombaerts P. Matsunami H. Luo M.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3875-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We studied the effects of high CO2 on cell proliferation in both a lung cancer epithelial cell line (A549 cells) and a lung primary cell line (N12 fibroblasts) and found that the effects of high CO2 were nearly identical in both cell lines. We observed decreased cell proliferation in cells exposed to high CO2 levels within 3 days, which was dose-dependent and independent from acidosis and hypoxia (Fig. 1). In commercial cell culture reactors, high CO2 was associated with decreased cell proliferation, which the authors attributed to increased osmolarity (32deZengotita V.M. Abston L.R. Schmelzer A.E. Shaw S. Miller W.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Zhu M.M. Goyal A. Rank D.L. Gupta S.K. Vanden Boom T. Lee S.S. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that the effects on proliferation are independent of osmolarity (supplemental Fig. S4). We also carried out our experiments with exposure to rather high pCO2 (120 mm Hg); therefore, we first set out to determine whether the decreased cell count observed could be attributed to cell death secondary to cytotoxic effects of CO2. We found that exposure to high CO2 did not result in increased cell death. We also did not find differences in the distribution of cell cycle phases in cells exposed to high CO2, which rules out a cell cycle arrest as the cause for decreased proliferation. However, the cells had a decreased population doubling rate, indicating that cells exposed to high CO2 have a prolonged cell cycle time. Cells exposed to high CO2 had a slower proliferation rate of 25–30%, pointing to an alteration in cell metabolism, also manifested by decreased oxygen consumption and lower levels of ATP production (see Fig. 3).Cells exposed to elevated CO2 were unable to grow in glucose-free medium supplemented with galactose (Fig. 3), suggesting that high levels of aerobic glycolysis are required. We confirmed these data utilizing shRNA to suppress the levels of GPI. Cells expressing the GPI shRNA constructs did not survive in galactose medium, suggesting that high CO2 levels cause mitochondrial dysfunction, rendering the cells dependent on glycolysis for survival. After completion of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where the carbon skeleton gets further degraded to two molecules of carbon dioxide. We hypothesized that exposure to high CO2 would impair those reactions. Studies performed over 30 years ago showed that bicarbonate levels alter the function of dehydrogenases (43Guly M.F. Skorik L.V. Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 160-164PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 53-55PubMed Google Scholar). The first CO2 molecule in the TCA cycle is produced when isocitrate is converted to αKG by the enzyme IDH. We found that the addition of αKG rescued the negative effect of high levels of CO2 on cell proliferation. This is in agreement with the suggestion of αKG as a potential pharmacological agent to improve some mitochondrial pathological disorders such as those with ATP synthase deficiency (45Sgarbi G. Casalena G.A. Baracca A. Lenaz G. DiMauro S. Solaini G. Arch. Neurol. 2009; 66: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in patients undergoing lung resection to decrease oxidative stress (46Matzi V. Lindenmann J. Muench A. Greilberger J. Juan H. Wintersteiger R. Maier A. Smolle-Juettner F.M. Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. 2007; 32: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Interestingly, upon investigation of mitochondrial IDH isoforms, we found that the NADP+-dependent IDH2 (but not the NAD+-dependent IDH3) is down-regulated and that cell proliferation and survival in glucose-free medium are dependent on IDH2. Cells in which IDH2 levels were decreased with siRNA had a slower proliferation rate and were unable to survive in glucose-free medium; conversely, A549 cells stably overexpressing IDH2 had an increased proliferation rate similar to control conditions when exposed to high CO2 and were able to survive in galactose-free medium when exposed to high CO2. These findings, together with insights gained from studies on otherwise healthy patients with retinitis pigmentosa due to IDH3 mutation (19Hartong D.T. Dange M. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Colman R.F. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggest that not IDH3 but IDH2 serves as the main catalyst of the conversion of isocitrate to αKG in the TCA cycle.miR-183 is overexpressed in tumors such as medulloblastomas or breast cancer, and it has been found to negatively regulate proliferation and migration (47Gokhale A. Kunder R. Goel A. Sarin R. Moiyadi A. Shenoy A. Mamidipally C. Noronha S. Kannan S. Shirsat N.V. J. Cancer Res. Ther. 2010; 6: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Lowery A.J. Miller N. Dwyer R.M. Kerin M.J. BMC Cancer. 2010; 10: 502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that the decrease in IDH2 is mediated by miR-183 and that inhibition of miR-183 would rescue our phenotype, whereas transfection of control cells with precursor miR-183 would mimic the results found in cells exposed to high CO2 (see Fig. 6).In summary, as depicted schematically in Fig. 7, we have provided evidence that elevated CO2 levels induce miR-183, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction by down-regulating IDH2, leading to impaired proliferation of normal fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells. These findings may explain how the cell resists a metabolic stress such as high CO2 by down-regulating cell metabolic activity and therefore proliferation and why in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia there is significant failure to thrive.

The signaling pathways sensitive to changes in CO2 levels in mammalian non-neuronal cells are incompletely understood (37Briva A. Vadász I. Lecuona E. Welch L.C. Chen J. Dada L.A. Trejo H.E.

We studied the effects of high CO2 on cell proliferation in both a lung cancer epithelial cell line (A549 cells) and a lung primary cell line (N12 fibroblasts) and found that the effects of high CO2 were nearly identical in both cell lines. We observed decreased cell proliferation in cells exposed to high CO2 levels within 3 days, which was dose-dependent and independent from acidosis and hypoxia (Fig. 1). In commercial cell culture reactors, high CO2 was associated with decreased cell proliferation, which the authors attributed to increased osmolarity (32deZengotita V.M. Abston L.R. Schmelzer A.E. Shaw S. Miller W.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Zhu M.M. Goyal A. Rank D.L. Gupta S.K. Vanden Boom T. Lee S.S. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that the effects on proliferation are independent of osmolarity (supplemental Fig. S4). We also carried out our experiments with exposure to rather high pCO2 (120 mm Hg); therefore, we first set out to determine whether the decreased cell count observed could be attributed to cell death secondary to cytotoxic effects of CO2. We found that exposure to high CO2 did not result in increased cell death. We also did not find differences in the distribution of cell cycle phases in cells exposed to high CO2, which rules out a cell cycle arrest as the cause for decreased proliferation. However, the cells had a decreased population doubling rate, indicating that cells exposed to high CO2 have a prolonged cell cycle time. Cells exposed to high CO2 had a slower proliferation rate of 25–30%, pointing to an alteration in cell metabolism, also manifested by decreased oxygen consumption and lower levels of ATP production (see Fig. 3). Cells exposed to elevated CO2 were unable to grow in glucose-free medium supplemented with galactose (Fig. 3), suggesting that high levels of aerobic glycolysis are required. We confirmed these data utilizing shRNA to suppress the levels of GPI. Cells expressing the GPI shRNA constructs did not survive in galactose medium, suggesting that high CO2 levels cause mitochondrial dysfunction, rendering the cells dependent on glycolysis for survival. After completion of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where the carbon skeleton gets further degraded to two molecules of carbon dioxide. We hypothesized that exposure to high CO2 would impair those reactions. Studies performed over 30 years ago showed that bicarbonate levels alter the function of dehydrogenases (43Guly M.F. Skorik L.V. Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 160-164PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shevchenko M.I. Mel'nichuk D.A. Romanenko A.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1979; 51: 53-55PubMed Google Scholar). The first CO2 molecule in the TCA cycle is produced when isocitrate is converted to αKG by the enzyme IDH. We found that the addition of αKG rescued the negative effect of high levels of CO2 on cell proliferation. This is in agreement with the suggestion of αKG as a potential pharmacological agent to improve some mitochondrial pathological disorders such as those with ATP synthase deficiency (45Sgarbi G. Casalena G.A. Baracca A. Lenaz G. DiMauro S. Solaini G. Arch. Neurol. 2009; 66: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in patients undergoing lung resection to decrease oxidative stress (46Matzi V. Lindenmann J. Muench A. Greilberger J. Juan H. Wintersteiger R. Maier A. Smolle-Juettner F.M. Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. 2007; 32: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon investigation of mitochondrial IDH isoforms, we found that the NADP+-dependent IDH2 (but not the NAD+-dependent IDH3) is down-regulated and that cell proliferation and survival in glucose-free medium are dependent on IDH2. Cells in which IDH2 levels were decreased with siRNA had a slower proliferation rate and were unable to survive in glucose-free medium; conversely, A549 cells stably overexpressing IDH2 had an increased proliferation rate similar to control conditions when exposed to high CO2 and were able to survive in galactose-free medium when exposed to high CO2. These findings, together with insights gained from studies on otherwise healthy patients with retinitis pigmentosa due to IDH3 mutation (19Hartong D.T. Dange M. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Colman R.F. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggest that not IDH3 but IDH2 serves as the main catalyst of the conversion of isocitrate to αKG in the TCA cycle. miR-183 is overexpressed in tumors such as medulloblastomas or breast cancer, and it has been found to negatively regulate proliferation and migration (47Gokhale A. Kunder R. Goel A. Sarin R. Moiyadi A. Shenoy A. Mamidipally C. Noronha S. Kannan S. Shirsat N.V. J. Cancer Res. Ther. 2010; 6: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Lowery A.J. Miller N. Dwyer R.M. Kerin M.J. BMC Cancer. 2010; 10: 502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that the decrease in IDH2 is mediated by miR-183 and that inhibition of miR-183 would rescue our phenotype, whereas transfection of control cells with precursor miR-183 would mimic the results found in cells exposed to high CO2 (see Fig. 6). In summary, as depicted schematically in Fig. 7, we have provided evidence that elevated CO2 levels induce miR-183, which in turn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction by down-regulating IDH2, leading to impaired proliferation of normal fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells. These findings may explain how the cell resists a metabolic stress such as high CO2 by down-regulating cell metabolic activity and therefore proliferation and why in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia there is significant failure to thrive.

These gaps are key features of vocal communication, but an ionic mechanism capable of generating fast offsets from auditory stimuli has proven elusive. Offset firing arises in the brainstem superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN), which receives powerful inhibition during sound and converts this into precise action potential (AP) firing upon sound termination. Whole-cell patch recording in vitro showed that offset firing was triggered by IPSPs rather than EPSPs. We show that AP firing can emerge from inhibition through integration of large IPSPs, driven by an extremely negative chloride reversal potential (ECl), combined with a large hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cationic current (IH), with a secondary contribution from a T-type calcium conductance (ITCa). On activation by the IPSP, IH potently accelerates the membrane time constant, so when the sound ceases, a rapid repolarization triggers multiple offset APs that match onset timing accuracy.

Offset responses encode the termination of a sensory synaptic stimulus SPN neurons have an intrinsic ionic mechanism to generate offset firing from IPSPs KCC2 is required to maintain low internal chloride which results in large IPSPs Large IPSPs trigger IH, accelerating tau, and mediate fast offset firing The duration and termination of a sensory input are universal parameters underlying sensory processing that require some element of neural computation. This is especially true in the auditory system, where preservation of timing information is important for sound localization, auditory scene analysis, and communication (Snell and Frisina, 2000Snell K.B.

The mammalian auditory brainstem possesses circuits involved in gap detection and sound duration encoding (Kadner and Berrebi, 2008Kadner A. Berrebi A.S.

Anisotropic organization of the rat superior paraolivary nucleus.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2000; 202: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is considered to be the homolog of the dorsomedial paraolivary nucleus in other mammals (Grothe and Park, 2000Grothe B. Park T.J. Structure and function of the bat superior olivary complex.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 382-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous presence of this nucleus across many mammalian species, independent of their specialization for low- or high-frequency sound localization, also suggests that the SPN is involved in functions other than sound localization (Behrend et al., 2002Behrend O.

The SPN receives a weak bilateral (predominantly contralateral) excitatory input from the cochlear nuclei (Kuwabara et al., 1991Kuwabara N. DiCaprio R.A. Zook J.M.

Brain Res. 1993; 95: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). During a sound, action potential (AP) firing is suppressed by MNTB inhibition, but when the sound ceases, the SPN is released from this inhibition and generates rebound APs as an “offset response” (Behrend et al., 2002Behrend O.

Physiological response properties of neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2299-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This IPSP-induced offset firing is mediated by glycine receptors (Kadner and Berrebi, 2008Kadner A. Berrebi A.S. Encoding of temporal features of auditory stimuli in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat.Neuroscience. 2008; 151: 868-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and three mechanisms have been postulated to explain the offset firing:(1)Coincident excitation and inhibition suppress firing during the sound, but the excitation outlasts the inhibition (discussed in Kulesza et al., 2003Kulesza Jr., R.J. Spirou G.A. Berrebi A.S. Physiological response properties of neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2299-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).(2)An initial evoked IPSP becomes depolarizing as a consequence of an activity-dependent shift in ECl (Kaila et al., 1997Kaila K. Lamsa K. Smirnov S. Taira T. Voipio J. Long-lasting GABA-mediated depolarization evoked by high-frequency stimulation in pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slice is attributable to a network-driven, bicarbonate-dependent K+ transient.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7662-7672PubMed Google Scholar).(3)The offset response is generated by the intrinsic conductances of the SPN neuron. It seems unlikely that release from MNTB inhibition could be the sole mechanism generating offset firing, since other major targets of MNTB inhibition (such as the medial and lateral superior olives) rarely exhibit offset firing (Barnes-Davies et al., 2004Barnes-Davies M. Barker M.C. Osmani F. Forsythe I.D. Kv1 currents mediate a gradient of principal neuron excitability across the tonotopic axis in the rat lateral superior olive.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Scott et al., 2005Scott L.L. Mathews P.J. Golding N.L. Posthearing developmental refinement of temporal processing in principal neurons of the medial superior olive.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7887-7895Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that offset firing is an intrinsic activity of SPN neurons with the ionic mechanism requiring three crucial elements: sound-evoked IPSPs, a large electrochemical chloride gradient, and the combination of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, IH, with a T-type calcium current, ITCa. Modeling has suggested that IH could contribute to stimulus duration encoding (Hooper et al., 2002Hooper S.L. Buchman E. Hobbs K.H. A computational role for slow conductances: single-neuron models that measure duration.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); our results provide experimental evidence for this but also demonstrate the crucial importance of the IPSP and enhanced chloride gradients, so that the inhibition can provide sufficient hyperpolarization to activate IH in response to physiological sensory input. We have confirmed this interpretation using sound-evoked SPN single-unit recordings in vivo, characterized the conductances using voltage clamp in vitro, and demonstrated that these conductances are sufficient to explain the results by computational modeling. The result is a physiologically elegant solution to computation of sound termination: a cell-specific conversion of inhibition into excitatory AP firing, which enhances timing accuracy and provides crucial information for downstream duration encoding. The majority of SPN neurons showed AP firing as an offset response following sound stimulation in vivo (64%, extracellular single unit, n = 15, Figures 1E, 1F, and 1I) or following hyperpolarization in vitro (89%, whole-cell patch clamp, n = 70, Figures 1C, 1H, and 1I). A minority of neurons showed no offset firing upon hyperpolarization (Figure 1I), but instead showed sustained or onset firing in vivo, as seen in other species (Behrend et al., 2002Behrend O. Brand A. Kapfer C. Grothe B. Auditory response properties in the superior paraolivary nucleus of the gerbil.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2915-2928PubMed Google Scholar, Dehmel et al., 2002Dehmel S. Kopp-Scheinpflug C. Dörrscheidt G.J. Rübsamen R. Electrophysiological characterization of the superior paraolivary nucleus in the Mongolian gerbil.Hear. Res. 2002; 172: 18-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The offset firing characteristically exhibited an intrinsic rhythm observed as multiple distinct peaks in the poststimulus time histogram (PSTH; Figure 1F, inset). The average number of APs in the offset response was 3.5 ± 0.4 (n = 65) with an interspike interval of 1.85 ms ± 0.19 ms (n = 26 cells) between the first two APs and increasing variability for the subsequent APs, as shown in the inset in Figure 1C. A subpopulation of cells (25%; Figure 1I, dotted line) fired only one offset AP; these neurons lacked the very negative ECl (see below) and possessed an IA type potassium current, suggesting that their role may differ. The differences were minor and we did not exclude these cells from the data set to avoid sample bias. The offset firing pattern will be conserved on projection from the SPN to target neurons, and confirmation of a projection to the inferior colliculus (IC) in mice was obtained by retrograde labeling of SPN neurons after fluorogold injection into the IC (Figure 1B). The ionic mechanisms underlying this offset firing were investigated by studying the conductances activated around resting membrane potentials (RMP: −59.9 ± 0.9mV; n = 82). A general characterization of the SPN neurons under voltage clamp in vitro showed that they possessed large sustained outward potassium currents in response to depolarization, including tetraethyl ammonium-sensitive Kv3 high voltage-activated currents and low voltage-activated, dendrotoxin-I sensitive Kv1 currents. Under current clamp SPN neurons had rapid time-course overshooting APs (absolute amplitude: 12.1 ± 1.5mV; half-width: 0.36 ± 0.02 ms, n = 72, see also Figure S1, available online). Sound-evoked firing in neurons of the MNTB and SPN show a reciprocal relationship. Presentation of a contralateral pure-tone stimulus at the characteristic frequency (CF) for an MNTB neuron gives continuous high-frequency AP firing for the duration of the stimulation, but firing is suppressed below spontaneous activity after the end of the sound (Figure 1D). MNTB AP firing exceeds spontaneous levels as sound intensity (0 to 80 dB SPL) passes threshold and monotonically increases until reaching a plateau firing rate (Figure 1D). The opposite occurs in the SPN; sound stimulation suppresses all firing during the sound but triggers offset firing after cessation of the sound (Figure 1E) with the number of APs continuously increasing with sound intensity (beyond threshold). Stimulation of the MNTB activated endogenous inhibition in SPN neurons in vitro, followed by offset APs (100 Hz train for 100 ms, Figure 1H, upper trace, see also Figure S2). Thus, acoustic stimulation, hyperpolarizing current injection, and electrically evoked IPSPs all resulted in similar offset firing. These results confirm the uniformity of evoked offset firing in both in vivo and in vitro recordings and support the use of in vitro methods to identify the ionic basis of SPN offset firing. IPSCs triggered by MNTB stimulation are blocked by the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (1 μM), confirming the origin and transmitter of this inhibitory synaptic projection (Figure 1G). In vivo recordings confirm that evoked glycinergic IPSPs trigger offset firing but do not exclude the possibility that EPSPs might also be involved. To test this hypothesis we used repetitive IPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the MNTB in vitro in the presence of AMPAR and NMDAR antagonists (50 μM AP5, 10 μM CNQX). Under these conditions, well-timed offset APs were generated (Figure 1H, middle trace) as the membrane potential rapidly depolarized back to resting levels at the end of the train, thus confirming that excitatory synaptic transmission was not necessary for offset firing. However, additional blockade of the glycinergic IPSCs diminished all offset firing in the SPN, identifying glycinergic inhibition as a major component of offset firing (Figure 1H, lower trace). Note that the IPSPs remain hyperpolarizing throughout the train of stimuli, including at the end of the stimulus, so the synaptic responses are not causing the depolarizing offset response. The obvious candidate for such a depolarization is the hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cation conductance, IH. Current injection into SPN neurons (under current-clamp conditions) generated hyperpolarization that clearly exhibited the characteristic slow sag of the membrane potential over a period of around 50 ms, indicative of IH activation (Figure 1C). Under voltage clamp, hyperpolarizing voltage steps from −61mV (Figure 2A ) evoked an inward current with two components: first, a small instantaneous, ZD7288-insensitive leak current (II) that exhibited some inward rectification (Figures 2A and 2B) and a mean conductance of 32.8 ± 2.9 nS (n = 40; EK = −90mV). Second, a more slowly activating and noninactivating inward current (IH) was observed. The magnitude of IH was measured by subtraction of the instantaneous current (II) from the sustained current (IS), giving a peak conductance of 19.8 ± 1.3 nS (n = 40; EH = −40mV; Figure 2B). The IH current was inhibited by application of 20μM ZD7288 (n = 6; p ≤ 0.001; Figure 2B). The voltage dependence of IH activation was estimated from the tail currents (IT, inset in Figure 2A), to which a Boltzmann function fit gave a half-maximum activation of −88.2 ± 0.9mV with a slope of 7.5 ± 0.4mV (n = 30; Figure 2C). IH activation rate was measured on stepping to −130mV (n = 30) and fit to the sum of two exponentials with respective time constants of: τfast: 26.8 ± 1.9 ms and τslow: 180.6 ± 16.9 ms (Figure 2D) of which the fast component contributed 70.6%. The activation rates slowed at more positive voltages (τfast = 108.4 ± 6.1 ms at −70mV, n = 30) with an e-fold acceleration for 25mV hyperpolarization. We postulated that the fast time course of IH was due to the expression of HCN1 subunits (Nolan et al., 2004Nolan M.F. Malleret G. Dudman J.T. Buhl D.L. Santoro B. Gibbs E. Vronskaya S. Buzsáki G. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Morozov A. A behavioral role for dendritic integration: HCN1 channels constrain spatial memory and plasticity at inputs to distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.Cell. 2004; 119: 719-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Recordings from HCN1 knockout mice (KO) showed that the peak IH current was indeed reduced to half that of the wild-type (WT; Figures 2A and 2B). The remaining IH current in the HCN1-KO activated at more negative voltages and with a much slower time-course, consistent with mediation by HCN2 subunits (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). Immunolabeling confirmed expression of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits in the SPN; HCN1 was predominantly associated with the somatic plasma membrane while HCN2 was largely expressed in the dendrites (Figures 2E and 2F; see also Figure S3). HCN3 and HCN4 were expressed at much lower levels or were absent from SPN cell bodies, but HCN4 staining was observed in trapezoid body axons (not shown). The presence of this large IH conductance with a half-activation around −88mV suggests that the role of incoming glycinergic IPSPs could be to activate this conductance. But this raises two important physiological questions: (1) is the IPSP capable of sufficient hyperpolarization to activate IH, and so in turn to generate an offset response? (2) Are any other conductances involved in offset firing? The answer to the first question is that IPSPs are capable of triggering offset firing. However, in many neurons IPSPs are rather small because ECl may be less negative than EK or, as in the immature brainstem, may be positive to the resting membrane potential. Experimental evidence supports the idea that SPN neurons have a powerful outwardly directed chloride transporter and therefore large IPSPs. First, in an elegant study that employed gramicidin-perforated patch recording, the endogenous ECl in rat SPON neurons was shown to be around −100mV and this was associated with high membrane immunolabeling of the K+Cl− cotransporter, KCC2 (Löhrke et al., 2005Löhrke S. Srinivasan G. Oberhofer M. Doncheva E. Friauf E. Shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing glycine action occurs at different perinatal ages in superior olivary complex nuclei.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 2708-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the current study EIPSC was around −96 ± 4.2mV (n = 11) when a low chloride concentration (6 mM) was chosen for the patch pipette (Figure 3D ). We tested the idea for an outwardly directed chloride pump, by setting an artificially high ECl and observing the change in EIPSP while perfusing the chloride transporter antagonist, furosemide. A high chloride pipette solution (34.5 mM) gave a predicted ECl of −36mV, but EIPSC remained negative at −88 ± 4.8mV (n = 9, Figure 3D). Perfusion of furosemide (0.5 mM) caused a gradual shift in EIPSC toward the ECl (Figures 3B and 3C) predicted by the Nernst equation. We conclude that mouse SPN neurons also possess the powerful outwardly directed chloride transporter KCC2 (Figure 2Gii), and that this maintains ECl at very negative levels. If this is true then physiological offset firing in response to synaptic input should also be blocked/suppressed by furosemide. Furosemide indeed caused the IPSPs to decline in amplitude and now the inhibitory input was insufficient to hyperpolarize the membrane to rebound-firing threshold (−81.13 ± 1.3mV, n = 71; blue shaded area in Figure 3D) and so failed to trigger offset APs (Figures 3E and 3F). As expected, direct hyperpolarizing current injections could still trigger offset APs after furosemide application (Figures 3G and 3H). The control EIPSC is sufficiently negative for the IPSPs to activate IH and trigger offset APs. Furosemide (0.5 mM) did not block either IH currents or glycinergic IPSCs directly (Figure S4). In addition to IH, the IPSP, and ECl, contributions from other conductances were implied because the current-voltage relationship showed a region of negative slope conductance at around −50 to −30mV, suggesting large voltage-gated calcium currents in the SPN (see also Figure S1F). To measure calcium currents we used a Cs+ based patch solution that blocked the majority of K+ currents and combined this with use of appropriate voltage protocols and pharmacology under voltage clamp. From a holding potential of −54mV, and with no prior hyperpolarization, only high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents were observed on depolarization positive to −50mV (Figure 4B , gray curve); however, a conditioning hyperpolarization to −104mV for 400 ms maximally activated a transient low-voltage-activated (LVA, ITCA) Ca2+ current on stepping to −54mV (Figure 4A). The I/V relationship now showed two distinct components: a LVA Ca2+ current that peaked at around −50mV, and a HVA current that peaked at around −10mV (Figure 4B, black curve). ITCa currents were half-activated at −51.0 ± 0.3mV (Figure 4E), were half-inactivated at −72.8 ± 0.4mV, and had a conductance of 20.1 ± 2.9 nS (at −54mV; n = 7; ECa = +50mV). The activation kinetics of ITCa upon stepping to −54mV were fast (time to peak: 5.7 ± 0.7 ms; n = 7; Figure 4F). Inactivation was also fast, decaying with a single exponential (11.5 ± 1.4 ms; n = 7; at −54mV; Figure 4F). Application of the ITCa antagonist mibefradil (2μM, Figures 4C, 4D, and 4G) blocked 79% of the transient calcium current (measured on stepping to −54mV; n = 3; p ≤ 0.005; Figure 4G). These data confirm that SPN neurons have large voltage-gated calcium currents, and the voltage-dependent inactivation of ITCa (gray shaded area in Figures 4B and 4D) suggests that IPSPs would promote recovery from inactivation. So what is the more important role for the IPSP: activation of IH or deinactivation of ITCa? The combined results from our in vivo and in vitro recording demonstrate that sound activation of IPSPs hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, activates IH, and removes ITCa inactivation. Under current-clamp recording conditions, application of an IH antagonist (ZD7288, 20 μM) slowed the membrane time constant and removed the voltage “sag” (Figures 5A and 5B , red trace). This block of IH slowed the time to half-decay from 1.03 ± 0.1 ms to 7.53 ± 1.3 ms (n = 14; p ≤ 0.001; Figure 5D). Blockade of ITCa by mibefradil or NNC 55-0396 did not further influence the timing of the offset response (Figures 5A and 5B) but it reduced the number of offset APs from 3.5 ± 1.3 (control; n = 65) to 1.0 ± 0.4 (mibefradil; n = 6; p = 0.009) or 0.8 ± 0.3 (NNC 55-0396; n = 5; p = 0.008; Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D). However, even the blockade of both IH and ITCa did not further change the membrane time constant or time to half-decay (Figure 5C; n = 11; p = 0.69), consistent with the idea that IH is the dominant current for driving short-latency offset firing. The subthreshold depolarization that remained after blocking IH and ITCa was TTX sensitive (Figure 5B, green trace). As a further test of our hypothesis we developed a computational model of SPN neuron firing, in which we could test the ionic basis of offset firing and separate the relative importance and contributions of IH and ITCa. The basic Hodgkin-Huxley model could match the control firing pattern, AP waveform, and activation of offset APs in response to hyperpolarizing current injection (Figure 5E). Upon removal of IH, offset APs were evoked at longer latencies, confirming that this conductance is crucial for the fast-membrane time constant and the short-latency offset firing (Figure 5F). Removal of the ITCa conductance also compromised offset firing, in that fewer APs were triggered (Figure 5G) but their latency remained as short as in the full model. Removal of both IH and ITCA (Figure 5H) confirmed that both conductances were necessary for the full physiological offset phenotype, with IH being the dominant conductance for the short-latency offset AP, while ITCa generated a slower depolarization, which increased the number of longer-latency offset APs. To test this hypothesis in response to a physiological input, we used repetitive IPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the MNTB in vitro (Figure 5I; 100 Hz train for 100 ms) and consecutively applied ZD7288 and mibefradil. After bath application of ZD7288 (20 μM; 20 min) the membrane time constant slowed, offset firing declined, and latencies increased (Figure 5J). Additional perfusion of mibefradil (2 μM) further suppressed offset firing (Figure 5K). Changes in the number and timing of offset firing were similar to the respective changes observed with current injections (Figures 5L and 5M). IH and ITCa modify offset firing in response to either current injections or IPSP activation, confirming that both conductances are physiologically relevant. This result emphasizes that the combination of a negative chloride reversal potential, a strong inhibitory input, and the subsequent activation of intrinsic conductances are important for the physiological function of the SPN neurons in generating offset APs, marking the termination of a sound (Figure 6).Figure 6Summary Illustration of the Interactions between ECl, IPSP, IH, and ITCa in Generating Offset FiringShow full captionSound activates glycinergic inhibition in the SPN. Due to high KCC2 activity the driving force for the IPSP is large and the membrane potential approaches ECl.

After cessation of the inhibition, the depolarizing conductances generate a burst of well-timed offset APs. The output of the MNTB-SPN circuit into the auditory midbrain (IC) provides specific information for sound duration computation. Single-unit recordings in vivo show that MNTB principal neurons fire APs with short interspike intervals throughout any duration of sound stimulation and also showed that this is separated from ongoing spontaneous activity by a poststimulus suppression period of almost 50 ms (Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2008Kopp-Scheinpflug C.

Using in vivo recordings and genetic dissection, we identified the DEG/ENaC protein, DEG-1, as the major mechanotransduction channel in ASH, a polymodal nociceptor in Caenorhabditis elegans. But DEG-1 is not the only mechanotransduction channel in ASH: loss of deg-1 revealed a minor current whose properties differ from those expected of DEG/ENaC channels. This current was independent of two TRPV channels expressed in ASH. Although loss of these TRPV channels inhibits behavioral responses to noxious stimuli, we found that both mechanoreceptor currents and potentials were essentially wild-type in TRPV mutants. We propose that ASH nociceptors rely on two genetically distinct mechanotransduction channels and that TRPV channels contribute to encoding and transmitting information. Because mammalian and insect nociceptors also coexpress DEG/ENaCs and TRPVs, the cellular functions elaborated here for these ion channels may be conserved."

We have also previously reported that offspring of obese rat dams develop hepatic steatosis, mild hyperinsulinemia, and a lipogenic gene signature in the liver at postnatal day (PND)21. In the current study, we examined systemic and hepatic adaptations in male Sprague-Dawley offspring from lean and obese dams at PND21. Indirect calorimetry revealed decreases in energy expenditure (p<0.001) and increases in RER values (p<0.001), which were further exacerbated by high fat diet (45% kcals from fat) consumption indicating an impaired ability to utilize fatty acids in offspring of obese dams as analyzed by PRCF. Mitochondrial function is known to be associated with fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the liver. Several markers of hepatic mitochondrial function were reduced in offspring of obese dams. These included SIRT3 mRNA (p = 0.012) and mitochondrial protein content (p = 0.002), electron transport chain complexes (II, III, and ATPase), and fasting PGC-1α mRNA expression (p<0.001). Moreover, hepatic LCAD, a SIRT3 target, was not only reduced 2-fold (p<0.001) but was also hyperacetylated in offspring of obese dams (p<0.005) suggesting decreased hepatic FAO. In conclusion, exposure to maternal obesity contributes to early perturbations in whole body and liver energy metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be an underlying event that reduces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and precedes the development of detrimental obesity associated co-morbidities such as insulin resistance and NAFLD."

Like many proteins involved in copper homeostasis, CueO has a methionine-rich segment that is thought to be critical for copper handling. How such segments function is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of CueO at 1.1 Å with the 45-residue methionine-rich segment fully resolved, revealing an N-terminal helical segment with methionine residues juxtaposed for Cu(I) ligation and a C-terminal highly mobile segment rich in methionine and histidine residues. We also report structures of CueO with a C500S mutation, which leads to loss of the T1 copper, and CueO with six methionines changed to serine. Soaking C500S CueO crystals with Cu(I), or wild-type CueO crystals with Ag(I), leads to occupancy of three sites, the previously identified substrate-binding site and two new sites along the methionine-rich helix, involving methionines 358, 362, 368, and 376. Mutation of these residues leads to a ∼4-fold reduction in k(cat) for Cu(I) oxidation. Ag(I), which often appears with copper in nature, strongly inhibits CueO oxidase activities in vitro and compromises copper tolerance in vivo, particularly in the absence of the complementary copper efflux cus system. Together, these studies demonstrate a role for the methionine-rich insert of CueO in the binding and oxidation of Cu(I) and highlight the interplay among cue and cus systems in copper and silver homeostasis."

In this study, we first showed that the expression of these three members was significantly reduced in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells as compared with the immortalized human liver L02 cells. We demonstrated that the MC-let-7a-1∼let-7d cluster was encoded by a single polycistronic transcript driven by a 10-kb upstream promoter, with two MYC-binding sites. Importantly, MYC inhibited MC-let-7a-1∼let-7d promoter activity via binding to the noncanonical E-box 3 downstream of the transcription start sites, whereas it enhanced promoter activity by binding to the canonical E-box 2 upstream of the transcription start sites.

The present study aims to identify the factors that might contribute to up-regulation of miR-125b in human hematopoietic malignancies and its downstream targets for lineage-specific differentiation. We at first reported that CDX2, a homeobox transcription factor, binds to promoter regions of the miR-125b gene and activates transcriptional regulation of miR-125b in malignant myeloid cells. We further revealed that increasing levels of CDX2 in malignant myeloid cells activate miR-125b expression, which in turn inhibits core binding factor β (CBFβ) translation, thereby counteracting myeloid cell differentiation, at least for granulocytic lineage, and promoting leukemogenesis. Interestingly, we found that this novel pathway including CDX2, miR-125b, and CBFβ was mediated by undergoing all-trans-retinoic acid induction.

The 293T and HCT15 cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). A total of 80 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) samples including five subtypes (from AML-M1 to AML-M5) and 10 normal samples from the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were enrolled in this study. Patient characteristics were available for all patients (supplemental Table S1). Bone marrow was collected from patients by bone marrow puncture at diagnosis or at follow-up after therapy.

The transfected cells were collected for RNA or protein analysis at 48 h after transfection. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was quantified by real-time PCR in the ABI Step One Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM II (TaKaRa). Mature miR-125b was detected in total RNA using the Hairpin-itTM miRNAs Real-time PCR Quantitation Kit containing a stem-loop like RT primer and miRNA-specific PCR primers (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). U6 small RNA was also amplified as an internal control using the same system and specific primer sets. mRNA quantitation was performed in the same system using endogenous β-actin mRNA as an internal control. The primers for real time PCR are shown under supplemental Table S2. Δ-Δ Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the internal control. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce) or 1% SDS. Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore), and reacted with anti-CBFβ (Santa Cruz), anti-CDX2 (BioGenex), anti-GAPDH (Protein Tech Group), or anti-β-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL method (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ChIP was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA/protein cross-linking was achieved by incubating the cells for 20 min at 37 °C in 1% formaldehyde. After sonication, chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight with 6 μl of anti-CDX2 antibody (BioGenex) or 2 μg of normal IgG. Genomic regions of about 130 bp containing the putative CDX2 binding site and an approximately 170-bp fragment 5 kbp upstream of the miR-125b promoter as negative control were amplified by PCR using the specific primers as shown under supplemental Table S2. The nuclear extract from HCT15 cells transfected with the CDX2 expression vector was prepared using the Nuclear-Cytosol Extraction Kit (KeyGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions. Probe oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using Klenow enzyme. DNA binding reactions included labeled probe (0.07 pmol) and nuclear extract (6 μg) and were incubated with or without a competitor probe at 25 °C for 30 min following the Promega Gel Shift Assay System instructions (Promega). To perform supershifts, anti-CDX2 antibodies (2 μl) were added to the reaction and incubated for another 20 min. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the assay are shown under supplemental Table S2. For promoter analysis, 293T cells at ∼80% confluence were transfected with wild-type miR-125b or mutant promoter luciferase constructs (500 ng) and the internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (10 ng, Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In selected experiments (assays to examine the effects of transcription factors on miR-125b promoter activity), various combinations of pcDNA control vector (50 ng) and vectors encoding CDX2, C/EBPα, GATA1, or PU.1 (50 ng) were cotransfected. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). In the 3′-UTR assay, 293T and K562 cells at ∼80% confluence were co-transfected with 200 ng of the psiCHECK-2-derived reporter vectors and 50 ng of miR-125b or miR-neg expression vector. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured immediately using dual luciferase assays (Promega) at 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Except where specified, the differences between groups were analyzed using two-tailed, one-way analysis of variance Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Considerable evidence has suggested that transcription factors control the expression of miRNAs (13Fazi F. Rosa A. Fatica A. Gelmetti V. De Marchis M.L. Nervi C. Bozzoni I.

Leukemia. 2009; 23: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To identify factors that influence miR-125b expression, we first analyzed the promoter of miR-125b. The transcriptional start site for pri-miR-125b was identified 126 nucleotides upstream of the 5′ end of the pre-miRNA (17Zhou R. Hu G. Liu J. Gong A.Y. Drescher K.M. Chen X.M. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000681Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We used the TESS program, a positional weight matrices from the TRANSFAC, JASPAR, IMD, and transcription factor consensus DNA-binding motifs (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) to search for transcription factor binding sites on the promoter of miR-125b. We found that hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites are enriched on the promoter of miR-125b, including sites for CDX2, PU.1 C/EBPα, and GATA1 (Fig. 1A). To examine whether there is any contribution from the 5′-untranslated region of miR-125b to promoter expression, we next cloned the putative miR-125b promoter into the basic pGL3-luc reporter (pro-miR-125b) to study the function. As shown in Fig. 1B, the miR-125b promoter activated the expression of the downstream reporter, indicating that the predicted miR-125b promoter is a true promoter (Fig. 1B, left). We then coexpressed hematopoietic transcription factors CDX2, PU.1 C/EBPα, and GATA1, respectively, with the pro-miR-125b to test the influence of these factors on the activity of the promoter. The results showed that only CDX2 could stimulate the miR-125b promoter, whereas PU.1, C/EBPα, and GATA1 did not show contributions on transcription activity (Fig. 1B, right), suggesting that CDX2 might be the activator of miR-125b. CDX2, a homeobox transcription factor, has recently been described as aberrantly expressed in myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia and as promoting leukemogenesis. To further evaluate the consistent expression profiles of CDX2 and miR-125b, we used qRT-PCR to measure the co-expression level of CDX2 and miR-125b in clinical samples of myeloblastic leukemia and 60 AML patients were applied, including five subtypes of AML (from AML-M1 to AML-M5). Five bone marrow samples from healthy donors were analyzed as controls. AML arises from the differentiation arrest of the myeloid precursor and malignant proliferation in the bone marrow and blood. It can be divided into different subtypes based on cell type and the degree of maturity and is an excellent model for studying the genetic regulation of differentiation and cancer progression (19Tenen D.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To confirm that the primers for miR-125b cannot amplify miR-125a, which belongs to the miR-125 family, we used the primers to amplify miR-125b in the miR-125a overexpressed cells, and the results showed no increases for miR-125b expression (supplemental Fig. S1A), demonstrating that the designed primers are specifically miR-125b. We also tested the efficiency of real time PCR amplification by a dilution curve, the results showed that the efficiencies of both miR-125b and the internal control are higher than 95% (supplemental Fig. S1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of miR-125b in AML is positively correlated with CDX2 expression. Up-regulated expression of both miR-125b and CDX2 was detected in almost all of the subtypes of AML, strongly implying the relationship of up-regulation of both miR-125b and CDX2 and their contribution to the differentiation block of the myeloid cell. We also monitored the expression levels of CDX2 and miR-125b in vitro in NB4 cells under ATRA induction for 72 h (Fig. 1D). We found that the expression level of the CDX2 mRNA was decreased and positively correlated with miR-125b after the ATRA treatment, which also suggested their potential function to inhibit cell differentiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that in human AML, high expression of miR-125b is due to the activation of CDX2, and the positive correlation between CDX2 and miR-125b was found in both myeloid leukemia samples and myeloid leukemia cell line. The close correlation between the high expression levels of CDX2 and miR-125b perturbation in human myeloid leukemia let us to speculate that the initiation of high CDX2 expression levels might be a key step in the development of myeloid precursor and malignant proliferation with aberrant miR-125b expression. Two binding sites for the CDX2 transcription factor located upstream of the transcription start site were identified. These binding sites are highly conserved in mammals (Fig. 2A). To test whether the putative binding sites for CDX2 on the miR-125b promoter are responsible for its transcriptional activity, promoter-luciferase fusion constructs containing site-specific mutations were produced (Fig. 2B). The results of the luciferase reporter assay in the 293T cell line showed that these two binding sites are essential for CDX2 to activate miR-125b transcription (Fig. 2B). To establish direct binding of CDX2 to the miR-125b promoter, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a miR-125b DNA fragment containing the consensus site for CDX2. We found that incubating the labeled wild-type DNA fragment with nuclear extract from HCT15 cells transiently transfected with CDX2 resulted in the formation of a discrete protein-DNA complex, but no shift band when incubated with the mutation probe. These complexes could be effectively supershifted by inclusion of CDX2 antibodies and their formation could be blocked by the unlabeled DNA fragment (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that CDX2 can directly bind to the miR-125b promoter. To further examine whether CDX2 physically interacts with the miR-125b promoter region in vivo, we performed ChIP. DNA fragments containing the two potential CDX2 binding sites were immunoprecipitated from NB4 cells by CDX2 antibodies, suggesting that CDX2 is actually interacting with the corresponding promoter sites (Fig. 2D). No enrichment was seen in the negative control region and when mock immunoprecipitations were carried out with normal mouse IgG antibody. Next, we performed overexpression studies to test whether CDX2 could up-regulate miR-125b expression in myeloid cells. A construct expressing CDX2 and a negative pcDNA3 vector were transfected into two myeloid cell lines, NB4 and HL60, and the expression of miR-125b was analyzed by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2, cells transfected with the CDX2-expressing vector displayed obvious up-regulation of miR-125b. These results show the involvement of CDX2 in the transcriptional regulation of miR-125b, and they also suggest that miR-125b functions as an effector of CDX2 during myeloid differentiation. Collectively, these findings strongly indicate that CDX2 directly interacts with the miR-125b promoter and positively regulates miR-125b expression in the development of myeloid precursor and malignant proliferation. Given the importance of miR-125b in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies and/or to myeloid cell differentiation, the downstream targets in this regulatory pathway are of interest. Among the hundreds of predicted regulatory targets of miR-125b, most targets are oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes involved in cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis (9Shi X.B. Xue L. Yang J. Ma A.H. Zhao J. Xu M. Tepper C.G. Evans C.P. Kung H.J. deVere White R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19983-19988Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 20Le M.T. Teh C.

Lim B. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5290-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Targets for miR-125b associated with hematopoietic-specific differentiation have not yet been reported. We noticed that the core binding factor CBFβ, the chemokine receptor CCR5, and several members of the HOX gene family (which are known to be important genes involved in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation) are also predicted targets. To confirm whether the CBFβ, CCR5, and HOX genes are bona fide targets of miR-125b, the 3′-UTRs of these genes were inserted downstream of a luciferase ORF. Among them, we confirmed that CBFβ and CCR5 were repressed by miR-125b in 293T cells, with a repression rate of more than 25% as measured by the luciferase assay after transfection (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, we found that the core binding factor CBFβ had the most reduced activity, and the predicted binding sites are conserved among species (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that CBFβ is likely to be the most important target regulated by miR-125b. A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA-binding site, 3′ CBFβ-mut, was also produced as a control (Fig. 3B). Luciferase activity measurements indicated specific repression of the wild-type substrate by miR-125b and no effect when the target site was mutated (Fig. 3, B and C). Altogether, these data demonstrate that CBFβ may be the target of miR-125b and that the putative binding sites are critical for miR-125b-mediated regulation of CBFβ expression. To further confirm that the CBFβ protein is suppressed by miR-125b, we performed both overexpression and knock-down of miR-125b in NB4 cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, when NB4 cells were transfected with the miR-125b mimics, the CBFβ protein was significantly reduced. Alternatively, when NB4 cells were transfected with the miR-125b inhibitor, CBFβ protein was expression increased (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that CBFβ is an important functional target of miR-125b in malignant myeloid cells. CBFβ is a subunit of the CBF. Recent studies have revealed that CBF is essential for normal hematopoiesis and that its aberrant expression might induce leukemia (22Kundu M. Chen A. Anderson S. Kirby M. Xu L. Castilla L.H.

To analyze the physiological relevance of CBFβ in counteracting myeloid cell differentiation, RNAi against CBFβ was performed. Transfection of NB4 cells with different siRNAs against the CBFβ mRNA resulted in a strong decrease in the levels of endogenous CBFβ mRNA and protein (Fig. 4A). To test if down-regulation of CBFβ is able to block the differentiation of HL60 and NB4 leukemic cells upon chemical treatment, we performed RNAi experiments with the addition of ATRA. These experimental conditions allowed us to get predominant maturation of HL60 cells, and NB4 cells treated with ATRA underwent characteristic granulocytic differentiation. We observed that in both HL60 and NB4 cell lines, down-regula"

https://openalex.org/W2079710072,"During courtship flights, males of some hummingbird species produce diverse sounds with tail feathers of varying shapes. We show that these sounds are produced by air flowing past a feather, causing it to aeroelastically flutter and generate flutter-induced sound. Scanning laser doppler vibrometery and high-speed video of individual feathers of different sizes and shapes in a wind tunnel revealed multiple vibratory modes that produce a range of acoustic frequencies and harmonic structures. Neighboring feathers can be aerodynamically coupled and flutter either at the same frequency, resulting in sympathetic vibrations that increase loudness, or at different frequencies, resulting in audible interaction frequencies. Aeroelastic flutter is intrinsic to stiff airfoils such as feathers and thus explains tonal sounds that are common in bird flight."
https://openalex.org/W2085642554,"Two-pore channels (TPCs) have been recently identified as NAADP-regulated Ca(2+) release channels, which are localized on the endolysosomal system. TPCs have a 12-transmembrane domain (TMD) structure and are evolutionary intermediates between the 24-TMD α-subunits of Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels and the transient receptor potential channel superfamily, which have six TMDs in a single subunit and form tetramers with 24 TMDs as active channels. Based on this relationship, it is predicted that TPCs dimerize to form functional channels, but the dimerization of human TPCs has so far not been studied. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies and a mass spectroscopic analysis of the immunocomplex, we show the presence of homo- and heteromeric complexes for human TPC1 and TPC2. Despite their largely distinct localization, we identified a discrete number of endosomes that coexpressed TPC1 and TPC2. Homo- and heteromerization were confirmed by a FRET study, showing that both proteins interacted in a rotational (N- to C-terminal/head-to-tail) symmetry. This is the first report describing the presence of homomultimeric TPC1 channels and the first study showing that TPCs are capable of forming heteromers."
https://openalex.org/W2068990725,"A century of neurology and neuroscience shows that seeing words depends on ventral occipital-temporal (VOT) circuitry. Typically, reading is learned using high-contrast line-contour words. We explored whether a specific VOT region, the visual word form area (VWFA), learns to see only these words or recognizes words independent of the specific shape-defining visual features. Word forms were created using atypical features (motion-dots, luminance-dots) whose statistical properties control word-visibility. We measured fMRI responses as word form visibility varied, and we used TMS to interfere with neural processing in specific cortical circuits, while subjects performed a lexical decision task. For all features, VWFA responses increased with word-visibility and correlated with performance. TMS applied to motion-specialized area hMT+ disrupted reading performance for motion-dots, but not line-contours or luminance-dots. A quantitative model describes feature-convergence in the VWFA and relates VWFA responses to behavioral performance. These findings suggest how visual feature-tolerance in the reading network arises through signal convergence from feature-specialized cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2008386237,"CARP-1/CCAR1, a perinuclear phosphoprotein, is a regulator of cell growth and apoptosis signaling. Although CARP-1 is a regulator of chemotherapy-dependent apoptosis, it is also a part of the NF-κB proteome and a co-activator of steroid/thyroid nuclear receptors as well as β-catenin signaling. Our yeast two-hybrid screen revealed CARP-1 binding with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome E3 ubiquitin ligase component APC-2 protein. CARP-1 also binds with anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome co-activators Cdc20 and Cdh1. Following mapping of the minimal epitopes involved in CARP-1 binding with APC-2, a fluorescence polarization assay was established that indicated a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 480 nm for CARP-1/APC-2 binding. Fluorescence polarization assay-based high throughput screening of a chemical library yielded several small molecule antagonists of CARP-1/APC-2 binding, termed CARP-1 functional mimetics. CFM-4 (1(2-chlorobenzyl)-5'-phenyl-3'H-spiro[indoline-3,2'-[1,3,4]thiadiazol]-2-one), a lead compound, binds with and stimulates CARP-1 expression. CFM-4 prevents CARP-1 binding with APC-2, causes G(2)M cell cycle arrest, and induces apoptosis with an IC(50) range of 10-15 μm. Apoptosis signaling by CFM-4 involves activation of caspase-8 and -9 and caspase-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-independent loss of cyclin B1 and Cdc20 proteins. Depletion of CARP-1, however, interferes with CFM-4-dependent cell growth inhibition, activation of caspases, and apoptosis. Because CFM-4 also suppresses growth of drug-resistant human breast cancer cells without affecting the growth of human breast epithelial MCF-10A cells, elevating CARP-1 by CFM-4 and consequent apoptosis could in principle be exploited to further elucidate, and perhaps effectively target, often deregulated cell cycle pathways in pathological conditions, including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2171508711,"Paclitaxel has powerful anticancer activity, but some tumors are inherently resistant to the drug, whereas others are initially sensitive but acquire resistance during treatment. To deal with this problem, it will be necessary to understand the mechanisms of drug action and resistance. Recent studies indicate that paclitaxel blocks cell division by inhibiting the detachment of microtubules from centrosomes. Here, we demonstrate that mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), a kinesin-related protein that destabilizes microtubules, plays an important role in microtubule detachment. Depletion of MCAK altered mitotic spindle morphology, increased the frequency of lagging chromosomes, and inhibited the proliferation of WT CHO cells, confirming that it is an essential protein for cell division. In contrast, MCAK depletion rescued the proliferation of mutant paclitaxel-dependent cell lines that are unable to divide because of defective spindle function resulting from altered α-tubulin or class III β-tubulin overexpression. In concert with the correction of mitotic defects, loss of MCAK reversed an aberrantly high frequency of microtubule detachment in the mutant cells and increased their sensitivity to paclitaxel. The results indicate that MCAK affects cell sensitivity to mitotic inhibitors by modulating the frequency of microtubule detachment, and they demonstrate that changes in a microtubule-interacting protein can reverse the effects of mutant tubulin expression.

Paclitaxel is a powerful agent for treating breast, ovarian, head and neck, lung, and other forms of cancer. At the doses typically given to patients, the drug interferes with microtubule assembly, thereby prolonging the mitotic checkpoint and causing tumor cells to die by apoptosis (1Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Despite its effectiveness, resistance to paclitaxel therapy often develops and leaves patients with a poor prognosis. In an effort to understand the molecular basis for drug resistance, a number of laboratories have isolated resistant mammalian cells in culture (2Cabral F. Fojo A.T. Cancer Drug Discovery and Development: The Role of Microtubules in Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Oncology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2008: 337-356Google Scholar, 3Orr G.A. Verdier-Pinard P. McDaid H. Horwitz S.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7280-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that alterations in α- and β-tubulin could confer resistance and that the altered tubulin acted to modulate microtubule assembly in a manner that counteracted the presence of the selecting drug (4Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Schibler M.J. Cabral F. J.

These mutants shared a common set of properties. Cells selected for resistance to a microtubule-destabilizing drug such as vinblastine were cross-resistant to many other destabilizing drugs but were more sensitive to stabilizing drugs such as paclitaxel. The converse was also found to be true, i.e. paclitaxel-resistant cells were cross-resistant to epothilone A and docetaxel but were more sensitive to colcemid, vinblastine, and other microtubule-destabilizing drugs. Changes in microtubule polymer levels also followed a predictable pattern: paclitaxel-resistant cells had less polymer than normal, and colcemid- and vinblastine-resistant cells had more polymer (7Cabral F. Drug Resistance Updates. 2000; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A similar set of properties were found in paclitaxel-resistant cells created by overexpression of specific β-tubulin genes. The mammalian β-tubulin gene family contains at least seven members that differ principally in their C-terminal 15 amino acids, but they have additional sporadic differences throughout their sequences (8Sullivan K.F. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The distinctive C-terminal tails have allowed seven isotypes of β-tubulin to be described (β1, β2, β3, β4a, β4b, β5, and β6) (9Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Some of these isotypes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas others (e.g. β3, β4a, and β6) are restricted to specific tissues (10Leandro-García L.J. Leskelä S. Landa I. Montero-Conde C. López-Jiménez E. Letón R. Cascón A. Robledo M. Rodríguez-Antona C. Cytoskeleton. 2010; 67: 214-223Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, most cultured cell lines express a small subset of these isotypes; for example, CHO cell microtubules are composed of 70% β1, 25% β4b, and 5% β5 (12Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO cells with cDNAs encoding each of the different isotypes of β-tubulin has shown that altered expression of some (but not all) isotypes is capable of conferring resistance to paclitaxel. Overexpression of the β1, β4b, and β2 isotypes had no effect on microtubule assembly or cell sensitivity to paclitaxel (13Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but overexpression of β3, a brain-specific isotype, reduced microtubule assembly and conferred resistance to the drug (14Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The similar phenotypes observed in cells with overexpression of β3 and in cells with mutations in their endogenous tubulin suggest that β3 acts like a mutant form of tubulin to produce drug resistance. The close association between reduced microtubule levels and paclitaxel resistance led us to propose that any treatment able to inhibit microtubule assembly should cause a resistance phenotype. Mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), 2The abbreviation used is: MCAKmitotic centromere-associated kinesin. a microtubule motor protein that is also known as Kif2c, has been shown to catalyze microtubule disassembly and therefore provides a good test of that hypothesis (15Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that overexpression of MCAK in wild-type CHO cells reduces microtubule content and confers resistance to paclitaxel (16Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2011; 10: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that depletion of MCAK is able to reverse paclitaxel resistance caused by mutant tubulin or by β3-tubulin overexpression, and we further show that the reversal of drug resistance is associated with a reduced frequency of microtubule detachment from centrosomes. mitotic centromere-associated kinesin.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) to express shRNA. Nucleotides 657–676 from CHO MCAK (GenBankTM accession number U11790) were introduced into pBS/U6 using oligonucleotides 5′-AAT TCA AAA AGG GCC CAG AAC TCG GAA ATA ACA AGC TTG ATT ATT TCC GAG TTC TGG GCC-3′ and 5′-GGC CCA GAA CTC GGA AAT AAT CAA GCT TGT TAT TTC CGA GTT CTG GGC CCT TTT TG-3′. To allow selection of CHO cells containing shRNA, a pTOP-hygro plasmid (43Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Chang L. Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was modified by replacing its CMV with the U6 promoter to create plasmid pHygro/U6 for use as an empty vector control or with the U6 promoter plus the MCAK shRNA-encoding sequence to create plasmid pHygro/U6-MCAK. Expression of endogenous MCAK was assessed using the following primers to selectively amplify the C-terminal region of the cDNA: forward primer MCAK1733F, 5′-GGC ATA AGC TCC TGT G-3′; and reverse primer MCAK2120R, 5′-GCA GGG CTG AGA AGT GC-3′. As a control, a portion of CHO β1-tubulin was also amplified using forward primer 5′-AAT GCC ACC CTG TCT GTC C-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGG AAC TAA GTA GCC TG-3′. Cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For live cell imaging, cells were transfected with GFP-MAP4 (44Olson K.R. McIntosh J.R. Olmsted J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and grown for 16–48 h. The medium was then replaced with McCoy's 5A medium containing 25 mm HEPES (Mediatech, Inc.) and images were captured every 5 s at 37 °C using a DeltaVision Core microscope (Applied Precision, Inc.). Microtubule detachment was measured using cells in which the centrosome was clearly positioned under the nucleus to provide maximum contrast. Detachments were counted in 10–20 individual cells, each observed for 4 min. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, grown to 50–70% confluence, and rinsed in PBS. To minimize background fluorescence, the cells were pre-extracted before fixation with methanol at −20 °C by incubating them for 1 min at 4 °C with microtubule buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 4 μg/ml paclitaxel. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, incubated with 1:100 dilutions of DM1A and anti-MCAK antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C, washed again in PBS, and incubated with 1:100 dilutions of Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG that included 1 μg/ml DAPI. Cells were viewed using an Optiphot microscope (Nikon Corp.) equipped with a MagnaFire digital camera (Optronics). Cellular proteins solubilized in 1% SDS were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and resuspended in sample buffer containing 0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The proteins were then separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 2% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-MCAK antibody and a 1:30,000 dilution of anti-actin monoclonal antibody C4 (Chemicon) for 1 h, followed by 1:2000 dilutions of Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs (Invitrogen). Bands were detected by fluorescence emission using a Storm imager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of differences between groups was determined using Student's t test. To deplete CHO cell MCAK, we designed a 21-nucleotide sequence that would produce a shRNA and cloned the sequence into the pHygro/U6 vector. Cells transiently transfected with this vector were depleted of MCAK mRNA as detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). MCAK protein was also depleted (Fig. 1B) and resulted in a loss of the centromere and spindle pole immunostaining (Fig. 1C, long arrows) that is normally seen in untransfected mitotic cells (Fig. 1C, arrowheads) (17Ems-McClung S.C. Walczak C.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An interphase cell lacking MCAK staining was also present (Fig. 1C, short arrows), but it is unclear whether it represents a transfected cell depleted of MCAK or a cell in early G1 phase, which would also be expected to have little, if any, MCAK staining because the protein is degraded at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (18Ganguly A. Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3187-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MCAK depletion did not cause major disruptions in CHO spindle morphology, but it did result in more abundant and pronounced astral fibers that were 1.5–2-fold longer than the controls (Fig. 2A), a condition previously called “hairy spindles” (19Kline-Smith S.L. Walczak C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2718-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, a large increase in the frequency of lagging chromosomes (Fig. 2B, arrow) was seen in cells depleted of MCAK. Quantification of these changes is summarized in Fig. 2C. The lagging chromosomes caused a time-dependent increase in cells with abnormal nuclear morphologies, ranging from 3% in untransfected cells to 10% at 12 h and 50% at 2 days following transfection with shRNA. The extent of multinucleation underestimates the effects of MCAK depletion because the transfection efficiency was only 70%, but the results nonetheless confirm studies in other cell lines indicating that MCAK is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis (20Kline-Smith S.L. Khodjakov A. Hergert P. Walczak C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1146-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cells selected for resistance to paclitaxel frequently have mutations in tubulin that reduce microtubule assembly (5Schibler M.J. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In more extreme cases, these mutations perturb microtubule assembly to such an extent that the cells are unable to divide unless a microtubule-stabilizing agent such as paclitaxel is present in the growth medium, thus producing a paclitaxel-dependent phenotype (21Barlow S.B. Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3469-3478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cabral F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We reported recently that paclitaxel-dependent cells have a greatly elevated frequency of microtubules detaching from centrosomes and spindle poles and that paclitaxel suppresses the detachment frequency at the same drug concentrations that rescue cell division (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also reported recently that overexpression of MCAK increases the frequency of microtubule detachment in WT cells and makes the cells resistant to paclitaxel (16Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2011; 10: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the basis of those observations, we predicted that cell division in paclitaxel-dependent cells might be rescued by depleting MCAK. To test that hypothesis, we examined two paclitaxel-dependent CHO cell lines. Tax 11-6 is a cell line with an E77K substitution in α-tubulin that was shown previously to have reduced microtubule polymer and an elevated frequency of microtubule detachment (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HAβ3-3 is a cell line that was created by transfecting wild-type CHO cells with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged β3-tubulin, an isotype whose expression is normally restricted to brain (10Leandro-García L.J. Leskelä S. Landa I. Montero-Conde C. López-Jiménez E. Letón R. Cascón A. Robledo M. Rodríguez-Antona C. Cytoskeleton. 2010; 67: 214-223Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were found to have reduced microtubule polymer and to be paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-dependent (14Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether MCAK depletion would rescue cell division in these two cell lines, wild-type, Tax 11-6, and HAβ3-3 cells were transfected with a control vector or with a vector that would produce shRNA to deplete MCAK. The transfected cells were then plated at low density to monitor colony formation. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type cells transfected with the control vector formed numerous colonies, but the shRNA-transfected cells formed significantly fewer colonies that grew poorly, as would be expected for the loss of a protein that is essential for normal cell proliferation. In contrast, the paclitaxel-dependent cell lines transfected with the control vector had difficulty forming colonies when paclitaxel was omitted from the growth medium, but the shRNA-transfected cells produced robust colonies, suggesting that MCAK depletion had reversed the paclitaxel-dependent phenotype. The results further indicated that tubulin mutations or expression of β3-tubulin can compensate for the loss of MCAK and allow the cells to survive the loss of an essential microtubule-interacting protein. To confirm that MCAK had been depleted, endogenous MCAK levels were compared in the paclitaxel-dependent cell lines before transfection and after survival in paclitaxel-free medium following transfection with MCAK shRNA (Fig. 3B). A partial reduction of MCAK was seen in HAβ3-3 cells, and a more complete reduction was seen in Tax 11-6 cells. This result is consistent with the observation that the paclitaxel-dependent phenotype is less severe in HAβ3-3 cells, but to rule out the possibility that some of the HAβ3-3 cells survived without paclitaxel because they lost expression of HA-β3-tubulin, we also probed the cell lysates with an antibody specific for the HA tag (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the reduction observed for MCAK, there was no loss of the HA-β3-tubulin. We thus conclude that both mutant cell lines were rescued from their paclitaxel dependence by the decrease or loss of MCAK. Previous studies showed that Tax 11-6 cells have an elevated frequency at which microtubules detach from centrosomes and spindle poles and that similar concentrations of paclitaxel are able to suppress detachment and rescue cell division (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether paclitaxel dependence in HAβ3-3 cells is also associated with elevated microtubule detachment, live cell imaging studies were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4A, frequent examples of microtubules detaching from centrosomes were seen in these cells. To determine whether MCAK depletion reduced detachment in addition to reversing the paclitaxel-dependent phenotype, the detachment frequencies of control and shRNA-transfected cells were compared. The results indicated that both mutant cell lines transfected with the control vector had an elevated frequency of microtubule detachment compared with wild-type cells, but those frequencies returned to near-normal levels in cells that were able to proliferate in paclitaxel-free medium following MCAK depletion (Fig. 4B). Thus, paclitaxel dependence conferred by a tubulin mutation or by expression of β3-tubulin was similarly associated with an increased frequency of microtubule detachment, and a treatment that reduced the frequency of detachment by depleting MCAK allowed both cell lines to divide without paclitaxel. The results strongly indicate that an elevated frequency of microtubule detachment forms the basis for the paclitaxel-dependent phenotype and that MCAK is likely to be at least one of the proteins involved in the mechanism of detachment. Paclitaxel-dependent cells are extreme examples of paclitaxel-resistant cells, i.e. their tubulin alterations decrease microtubule assembly to a greater extent, and the cells have less sensitivity to paclitaxel compared with cells that are resistant to, but not dependent on, the drug (7Cabral F. Drug Resistance Updates. 2000; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The loss of drug dependence would therefore suggest that the cells should have gained increased sensitivity to paclitaxel. To test this prediction, we made use of the observation that defective spindle function in CHO cells causes missegregation of chromosomes and inhibits cytokinesis but the cells slip past the mitotic checkpoint and reenter G1-phase as large multinucleated cells (24Abraham I. Marcus M. Cabral F. Gottesman M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Cabral F. Barlow S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Using the appearance of multinucleated cells as a readout for problems encountered during mitosis, we monitored the effects of MCAK depletion on the sensitivity of the mutant cell lines to paclitaxel. Approximately 3% of the wild-type CHO cells were found to be multinucleated during normal growth, but the percentage increased dramatically when paclitaxel reached a concentration that interferes with cell division (Fig. 5, filled circles). In contrast, the percentage of multinucleated cells was high for HAβ3-3 cells (Fig. 5B, filled triangles) and higher still for Tax 11-6 cells (Fig. 5A, filled squares) when the cells were cultured without paclitaxel. Multinucleated cells became much less abundant in both mutant cell lines when paclitaxel was present at normally toxic concentrations, indicating that normal cell division was rescued; but the percentage of multinucleated cells rose again at higher drug concentrations, indicating that the increased amount of drug had again become toxic. The rightward shift in the toxicity portion of the curve compared with wild-type cells reflects the paclitaxel resistance of the drug-dependent cell lines. On the other hand, mutant cells treated with shRNA to deplete MCAK behaved much more like the wild-type cells. Both HAβ3-3 (Fig. 5B, open triangles) and Tax 11-6 (Fig. 5A, open squares) cells had a much lower percentage of multinucleated cells in the absence of paclitaxel, but this percentage increased at the higher toxic drug concentrations. The leftward shift in these curves relative to the untransfected cells with normal levels of MCAK indicates that MCAK depletion made the cells more sensitive to the toxic effects of paclitaxel on cell division. This is especially noticeable for HAβ3-3 cells, which became even more drug-sensitive than wild-type cells following depletion of MCAK, a result that is consistent with the weaker drug-dependent phenotype of this cell line (14Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells presents a major barrier to successful chemotherapy. To deal with this problem, it is essential to understand the mechanisms by which resistance arises and to devise strategies to prevent or mitigate its occurrence. A particularly effective class of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy affects microtubule assembly and thereby blocks cell division. These drugs fall into two major groups: those that inhibit and those that promote microtubule assembly. Despite these differing actions, both groups interfere with mitotic spindle function, block cells in mitosis, and prevent cell division. Although the exact mechanism by which these drugs interfere with mitosis is unclear, the current consensus is that they act by suppressing microtubule dynamics (27Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nature Rev. 2004; 4: 253-265Google Scholar). Cellular microtubules are continuously nucleated at the centrosome, an organelle located near the nucleus, and extend their growing plus-ends toward the plasma membrane while their minus-ends remain embedded in the centrosome. The plus-ends have been observed to undergo stochastic episodes of growth and shortening interspersed by periods of pause, a behavior known as “dynamic instability” (28Mitchison T. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar). This behavior increases the plasticity of the microtubules, allowing them to rapidly remodel in response to cellular and environmental cues (29Kirschner M. Mitchison T. Cell. 1986; 45: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). For example, when cells enter mitosis, the cytoplasmic microtubule network is remodeled into a bipolar mitotic spindle apparatus. Spindle microtubules probe the cytoplasm and are believed to become stabilized when they bind to the kinetochore region on chromosomes. These interactions ensure the proper alignment of the condensed chromosomes and the subsequent segregation of their sister chromatids. It makes sense that microtubule growth and shortening would be needed for this “search and capture” activity and that drugs could interfere with spindle function by suppressing this activity. Despite the logic used to reach this conclusion, we demonstrated recently that drug concentrations 10-fold lower than required to block cell division were sufficient to maximally inhibit microtubule dynamics in a variety of cell types (30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, paclitaxel-dependent cell lines that require the drug for proliferation had highly suppressed microtubule dynamics at the very drug concentrations that allowed the cells to divide (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Together, these results argue that microtubule drugs do not inhibit cell division by simply interfering with dynamics. We found instead that drug concentrations able to inhibit mitosis act by altering the frequency at which microtubule minus-ends detach from centrosomes (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the process of microtubule detachment. A small number of publications have previously described this behavior, but the mechanism by which detachment occurs has yet to be deciphered (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol.

Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Detachment frequencies appear to be very low in interphase cells (30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Keating T.J. Peloquin J.G. Rodionov V.I. Momcilovic D. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, we reported recently that the frequency increases significantly during mitosis, suggesting that detachment is a cell cycle-regulated process necessary for normal spindle function and cell division (30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached by another laboratory (33Rusan N.M. Wadsworth P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the authors found that the detachment frequency was elevated during anaphase, whereas we observed stimulation of the process as early as prophase. The role of microtubule detachment in spindle function is unclear. Detached microtubules become fragments of varying size and stability that are able to translocate through the cytoplasm by an unknown mechanism, and one study found evidence that peripheral microtubule fragments become incorporated into the mitotic spindle (35Tulu U.S. Rusan N.M. Wadsworth P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1894-1899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Other recent studies have indicated that meiotic spindles are formed from overlapping microtubule fragments that may be held together by microtubule motor proteins (36Burbank K.S. Groen A.C. Perlman Z.E. Fisher D.S. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Srayko M. O'toole E.T. Hyman A.A. Müller-Reichert T. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that mitotic spindles similarly require a mixture of detached microtubule fragments in addition to continuous microtubules anchored at the spindle poles to function properly (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Gaglio T. Dionne M.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The importance of microtubule detachment is supported not only by its stimulation during mitosis but also by a number of additional observations. 1) Drugs that inhibit microtubule assembly increase the frequency of detachment, whereas drugs that promote assembly and stabilize microtubules decrease the frequency of detachment (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 2) Tubulin mutations that affect the sensitivity of cells to microtubule drugs alter the concentration of drug needed to modulate the frequency of detachment and produce microtubule fragments (30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 3) Tubulin mutations that block cell division and are correctable by the action of microtubule-stabilizing drugs (paclitaxel-dependent phenotype) have highly elevated frequencies of microtubule detachment that revert to normal following drug treatment (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 4) Overexpression of β3-tubulin causes paclitaxel dependence and also elevates the frequency of microtubule detachment (Fig. 4). The ability of drugs, tubulin mutations, and changes in tubulin composition to affect microtubule detachment indicates that the process is essential for normal mitotic progression. The observations that detachment occurs at centrosomes and spindle poles and that the process is cell cycle-regulated suggest that detachment does not simply result from mechanical stress; rather, it seems likely that specific proteins are involved in the process. MCAK is a protein that could be playing such a role. In addition to its location at mitotic centromeres, it is found in interphase centrosomes and at spindle poles (18Ganguly A. Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3187-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Maney T. Hunter A.W. Wagenbach M. Wordeman L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known to stimulate disassembly at both ends of isolated microtubules (15Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In support of a role for MCAK in microtubule detachment, we showed recently that overproduction of the protein was able to stimulate detachment, produce microtubule fragments, confer resistance to paclitaxel, and enhance sensitivity to colcemid (16Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2011; 10: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, depletion of MCAK has been shown to increase the density and length of microtubules at the spindle poles (Fig. 2A) (41Rizk R.S. Bohannon K.P. Wetzel L.A. Powers J. Shaw S.L. Walczak C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1639-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a phenotype consistent with a decreased frequency of microtubule detachment. We have now further shown that depletion of MCAK in paclitaxel-dependent cells harboring an α-tubulin mutation or expressing the β3-tubulin isotype caused a reversal of drug resistance and drug dependence. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of microtubule detachment to near-normal values and provide evidence that MCAK is involved in the process of microtubule detachment. The results summarized in Fig. 6 support a model based on the idea that functional mitotic spindles require a balance between continuous and fragmented microtubules. Changes that disturb this balance by increasing or decreasing the frequency of detachment produce an altered drug response. For example, changes such as tubulin mutations, β3 overproduction, and MCAK overproduction that destabilize microtubules increase microtubule detachment and tip the balance toward too many fragments. These changes produce resistance to paclitaxel, a drug that exerts toxicity by inhibiting microtubule detachment and reducing fragment formation (23Ganguly A. Yang H. Cabral F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, these same changes increase sensitivity to vinblastine and colcemid because these drugs also increase detachment and produce microtubule fragments (30Yang H. Ganguly A. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32242-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, other changes such as microtubule-stabilizing tubulin mutations and MCAK depletion decrease microtubule detachment and tip the balance toward too few microtubule fragments. This increases sensitivity to paclitaxel and confers resistance to vinblastine and colcemid. The model is consistent with all of the experimental observations except for the predicted vinblastine and colcemid resistance in cells depleted of MCAK, which we have not been able to verify. We suggest that this discrepancy may be explained by the fact that MCAK functions not only at spindle poles but also at kinetochores, whereas the microtubule drugs specifically act at the spindle poles to inhibit mitosis. Thus, MCAK overexpression affects sensitivity to both paclitaxel (decreased sensitivity) and vinblastine (increased sensitivity) because MCAK is present to function at the kinetochores, whereas the increased detachment at the spindle poles caused by MCAK overexpression can be compensated by paclitaxel to produce paclitaxel resistance or aggravated by vinblastine to produce enhanced vinblastine sensitivity. On the other hand, depletion of MCAK leaves insufficient MCAK at the kinetochores to allow wild-type cell survival with or without drugs. It is interesting, however, that Tax 11-6 and HAβ3-3 cells were able to survive with moderate to large reductions in MCAK, indicating that, in contrast to microtubule drugs, tubulin mutations may be able to compensate for MCAK loss, even at kinetochores.

The most frequently mutated gene was APC (68.9% of tumours), followed by KRAS (31.1%), TP53 (27.2%), BRAF (8.7%) and CTNNB1 (1.9%). Heterozygous germline MUTYH mutations in 2 patients were unlikely to contribute to the development of their CRCs. LOH at the APC locus was found in 34.3% of tumours, MSI in 24.3% and MLH1 methylation in 12.7%. Seven tumours (6.9%) were without any changes in the genes tested. The analysis yielded several findings possibly specific for the Czech cohort. Somatic APC mutations did not cluster in the mutation cluster region (MCR). Tumours with MSI but no MLH1 methylation showed earlier onset and more severe mutational profiles compared to MSI tumours with MLH1 methylation. TP53 mutations were predominantly located outside the hot spots, and transitions were underrepresented. Our analysis supports the observation that germline MUTYH mutations are rare in Czech individuals with sporadic CRCs. Our findings suggest the influence of specific ethnic genetic factors and/or lifestyle and dietary habits typical for the Czech population on the development of these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2046550076,"Ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) has been shown to activate p53 by binding to MDM2 and negating its p53 suppression activity in response to ribosomal stress. Although a mutation at Cys-305 within the zinc finger domain of MDM2 has been shown to drastically impair MDM2 interaction with RPL11 and thus escapes the inhibition by this ribosomal protein, it still remains elusive whether RPL11 inactivates MDM2 via direct action on this zinc finger domain and what is the chemical nature of this specific interaction. To define the roles of the MDM2 zinc finger in association with RPL11, we conducted hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, computational modeling, circular dichroism, and mutational analyses of the zinc finger domain of MDM2 and human RPL11. Our study reveals that RPL11 forms a stable complex with MDM2 in vitro through direct contact with its zinc finger. This binding is disrupted by single mutations of non-cysteine amino acids within the zinc finger domain of MDM2. Basic residues in RPL11 are crucial for the stable binding and RPL11 suppression of MDM2 activity toward p53. These results provide the first line of evidence for the specific interaction between RPL11 and the zinc finger of MDM2 via hydrophilic residues as well as a molecular foundation for better understanding RPL11 inhibition of MDM2 function."

In contrast to current views of retinogeniculate organization, which hold that On-center LGN neurons should become silent with APB, we find that ∼50% of On-center neurons rapidly develop Off-center responses. The time course of these emergent responses and the actions of APB in the retina indicate the plasticity occurs within the LGN. These results suggest there is greater divergence of retinogeniculate connections than previously recognized and that functionally silent, nonspecific retinal inputs can serve as a substrate for rapid plasticity in the adult.

The adult LGN is capable of rapid plasticity First demonstration of receptive field plasticity in the adult LGN Spontaneous activity is sufficient for this form of plasticity These findings challenge current views of stream specificity from retina to LGN A remarkable feature of neurons is their ability to modify their function and organization in response to changes in the activity of their inputs. This ability for neuronal plasticity is particularly robust and widespread during development, but can extend into adulthood under certain circumstances and to a more limited extent. For instance, in the visual system, where developmental plasticity has been demonstrated from retina to extrastriate cortex, adult plasticity is largely believed to be restricted to the cortex with subcortical structures losing their capacity for change after a critical period of development (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1992Gilbert C.D.

Here, we challenge this view and present evidence for a robust form of adult plasticity measured in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. A defining property of the adult visual system is the immediate segregation of On and Off channels used for signaling increases and decreases in light levels. These channels are established at the very first retinal synapse between the photoreceptor and bipolar cell and are thought to remain segregated through the LGN until converging in the primary visual cortex. Overwhelming evidence indicates On-center and Off-center LGN neurons receive stream-specific input, yet the possibility exists that these neurons may have access to information traveling in the other stream. For instance, if neurons in one stream received silent or masked input from neurons in the other stream, then this input could serve as a substrate for rapid plasticity in the adult. Consistent with this view, a small number of studies describe very weak “mistakes” in the connections made between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and LGN neurons (Hamos et al., 1987Hamos J.E.

Physiol. 1989; 93: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and examined the consequence on visual responses in the adult LGN. Our results demonstrate that On-center neurons in the adult LGN are capable of undergoing a rapid transformation in their visual physiology, whereby they experience a striking flip in their stimulus preference and develop an emergent Off-center response. Because this flip does not occur in the retina, nor is it accompanied by an increased latency indicative of polysynaptic mechanisms, our results support the hypothesis that functionally silent, nonspecific connections in the retinogeniculate pathway serve as a substrate for adult plasticity in the early visual system. To study the consequences of silencing the On pathway on LGN physiology, we used a 7-channel multielectrode array (Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany) to record the spiking activity of isolated LGN neurons in the anesthetized cat before and after silencing the On pathway with intraocular injections of APB. Figure 1A shows the spiking activity of a representative On-center LGN neuron to a repeating, spatially-uniform stimulus that alternated between gray (38 cd/m2) and white (76 cd/m2). As expected for On-center neurons, this neuron responded faithfully to stimulus transitions from gray to white prior to the onset of APB action (time 0) and became unresponsive to similar transitions following APB onset (Schiller, 1982Schiller P.H. Central connections of the retinal ON and OFF pathways.Nature. 1982; 297: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Schiller, 1984Schiller P.H.

Receptive field properties in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus in the absence of on-center retinal input.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 374-380PubMed Google Scholar). However, contrary to current views of retinogeniculate organization, which predict the LGN neuron should remain unresponsive to visual stimuli during APB action, the neuron rapidly developed an emergent Off response and, consequently, faithfully followed stimulus transitions from white to gray. The interval between time points marking a 50% reduction in On activity and a 50% of maximum increase in Off activity was 145 s (Figure 1B). Using this spatially-uniform stimulus, emergent Off responses were observed among ∼50% of On-center neurons examined (15/34) with the remaining neurons becoming visually unresponsive during APB treatment. To determine whether the emergence of Off responses from On-center LGN neurons requires visually-evoked activity from the retina, we covered the eyes for 90 min following APB injection and compared neuronal responses before APB injection and immediately following the 90 min period of darkness. As shown in Figure 1C, Off responses were clearly present immediately following the reintroduction of visual stimulation. Interestingly, the latencies of the emergent Off responses decreased progressively over the first 5–6 min following the reintroduction of visual stimulation. A long latency and sporadic On response was also evident transiently during this early period of visual stimulation, possibly reflecting the effects of APB on the Off pathway (Sugihara et al., 1997Sugihara H. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Fukuda Y. A late ON response remains in visual response of the mGluR6-deficient mouse.Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 233: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Rentería et al., 2006Rentería R.C. Tian N. Cang J. Nakanishi S. Stryker M.P. Copenhagen D.R. Intrinsic ON responses of the retinal OFF pathway are suppressed by the ON pathway.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11857-11869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar pattern for the emergence of Off responses occurred in four of seven On-center LGN neurons examined with this paradigm; the remaining neurons were visually unresponsive. These findings indicate that while visual stimulation may contribute to the On to Off plasticity, changes in spontaneous activity are sufficient to initiate the effect. Along these lines, previous studies have shown APB has a much greater effect on reducing spontaneous activity among On-center RGCs compared to Off-center RGCs (Knapp and Mistler, 1983Knapp A.G. Mistler L.A. Response properties of cells in rabbit's lateral geniculate nucleus during reversible blockade of retinal on-center channel.J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 50: 1236-1245PubMed Google Scholar, Horton and Sherk, 1984Horton J.C. Sherk H. Receptive field properties in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus in the absence of on-center retinal input.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 374-380PubMed Google Scholar). Given the unexpected finding that intraocular APB can induce a switch in the response signature of On-center LGN neurons, we wished to confirm that the LGN, rather than the retina, is the site of this rapid plasticity. We therefore stimulated the retina with the same visual stimulus shown in Figure 1 and recorded electroretinograms (ERGs) in vivo (n = 4) and single-unit responses from On-center RGCs in vitro (n = 32) before and during APB application. As shown in Figure 2, APB silenced On responses in the retina without any indication of emergent Off responses. More importantly, every On-center cell became visually unresponsive with APB, indicating APB and our injection protocol blocked visual responses in On center RGCs and the On to Off plasticity measured in the LGN did not simply follow a similar transition in the eye. Having observed a striking APB-induced flip in the response signature of On-center LGN neurons using a spatially-uniform stimulus, we next examined the effects of APB on the fine structure of LGN receptive fields by using a white-noise stimulus and reverse-correlation analysis (Figure 3; see Experimental Procedures). As expected and exemplified with the receptive field map of a representative Off-center neuron in Figure 3A, all Off-center neurons in our sample remained Off-center in the presence of APB (n = 28 cells). In contrast, >50% of On-center neurons (n = 35/52) underwent the rapid transformation in receptive field structure from On-center to Off-center, as in Figures 3C–3E. The remaining On-center neurons were nonresponsive to visual stimuli following APB treatment (n = 17). Using receptive field size and response latency to classify cells as either X or Y (Usrey et al., 1999Usrey W.M. Reppas J.B. Reid R.C. Specificity and strength of retinogeniculate connections.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3527-3540PubMed Google Scholar), we did not see a significant difference in the relative proportion of X and Y cells in the group of On-center cells that lost visual responsiveness following APB application versus those that developed Off-center responses (p = 0.9, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We next compared the size and location of the emergent Off-center receptive fields to the original On-center receptive fields. To do so, we fit the original and emergent receptive field centers to a Gaussian equation and normalized coordinate distances by the size of each neuron's original receptive field center (in space constants, see Experimental Procedures). Because intraocular injections can alter eye position and therefore the location of receptive fields, this analysis was only performed on cells simultaneously recorded with an Off cell whose receptive field served as a fiduciary marker (n = 13 cells). As shown in Figure 3F, the Off-centers of the emergent receptive fields always overlapped the On-centers of the original receptive fields, consistent with the spatial organization of On- and Off-center RGCs in the cat (Wässle et al., 1983Wässle H. Peichl L. Boycott B.B. A spatial analysis of on- and off-ganglion cells in the cat retina.Vision Res. 1983; 23: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mean displacement of emergent receptive field centers was just 0.60 ± 0.12σ (standard error of the mean [SEM]), indicating a high degree of retinotopic specificity among the emergent receptive fields. An examination of receptive field size revealed a small, but significant increase in the size of emergent receptive field centers compared to their pre-APB counterparts (mean size increase = 0.19 ± 0.06σ [SEM]; p < 0.05, ANOVA), suggesting a decrease in the relative weight of the antagonistic surround and/or an increase in the spatial distribution of inputs during APB action. To determine whether polysynaptic circuit mechanisms might underlie the On-to-Off plasticity of LGN responses, we calculated and compared impulse responses to the white-noise stimulus before and during APB action (see Experimental Procedures). Impulse responses from two On-center LGN neurons, generated before and during APB action (black and gray traces, respectively), are shown in Figures 4A and 4B. In these figures, the direction of the initial peak indicates whether the receptive field center is On or Off, as a positive peak corresponds to an increase in firing rate (above the mean) to a white stimulus (presented at time = 0) and a negative peak corresponds to an increase in firing rate (above the mean) to a black stimulus. From this initial peak, response latency was quantified as the time to reach maximum response, and response strength was quantified as the integral of the peak. Across our sample of LGN neurons (n = 80 cells), visual response latency was slightly shorter for Off cells compared to On cells (33.7 ± 1.1 ms versus 36.2 ± 0.8 ms, respectively; p = 0.06, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). While APB injection did not significantly influence visual response latency of the Off-center cells (Figure 4C, 32.7 ± 1.1 ms, p = 0.56, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), it did lead to a significant decrease in response latency of the On-center cells with emergent Off responses (Figure 4C; mean latency = 32.6 ± 1.0 ms, p = 0.006, ANOVA). This decrease in response latency provides useful information about the mechanism(s) underlying emergent Off responses. In particular, the decrease in latency for emergent Off responses indicates these emergent responses are not the result of polysynaptic inputs, such as corticogeniculate feedback, projections from the reticular nucleus, or collaterals of neighboring relay neurons (Cox et al., 2003Cox C.L. Reichova I. Sherman S.M. Functional synaptic contacts by intranuclear axon collaterals of thalamic relay neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7642-7646PubMed Google Scholar, Bickford et al., 2008Bickford M.E. Wei H. Eisenback M.A. Chomsung R.D. Slusarczyk A.S. Dankowsi A.B.

Neurol. 2008; 508: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as the number of additional synapses involved with these circuits should increase response latency following APB. Prior to APB injection, On-center and Off-center neurons did not differ significantly in the strength of their impulse responses (Figure 4D; p = 0.73, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Following APB injection, center strength decreased significantly for both populations of LGN neurons with the greatest reduction for cells initially defined as On-center. Response strength decreased on average by 30.5% for Off-center neurons (p < 0.02, ANOVA; see also Rentería et al., 2006Rentería R.C. Tian N. Cang J. Nakanishi S. Stryker M.P. Copenhagen D.R. Intrinsic ON responses of the retinal OFF pathway are suppressed by the ON pathway.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11857-11869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by 55.6% for On-center cells with emergent Off responses (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Thus, APB reduces the responsiveness of both On-center and Off-center LGN neurons. This result has important implications for the circuits underlying the visual responses of both On and Off-center LGN neurons. For On-center neurons, this result supports the proposal that APB can unmask weak or silent Off inputs from the retina. For Off-center neurons, this result is consistent with the view that APB can interfere with disynaptic inhibition provided by On-center interneurons that normally provide a “pull” to increase Off-center responses (Hirsch, 2003Hirsch J.A. Synaptic physiology and receptive field structure in the early visual pathway of the cat.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang X.

The goal of this study was to determine the consequences of selectively silencing stream-specific input from the eye on neuronal responses in the adult LGN. To do so, we made intraocular injections of APB to block visual responses in On-center RGCs and measured visual responses in the LGN. Approximately 50% of On-center LGN neurons became unresponsive to visual stimuli during APB treatment, a cellular response consistent with previous views of APB action and retinogeniculate organization (Slaughter and Miller, 1981Slaughter M.M.

The remaining On-center LGN neurons underwent a remarkable transformation in receptive field structure and rapidly acquired Off-center responses. These results not only support the hypothesis that functionally silent input from the retina can undergo rapid strengthening in the adult LGN, they also force a re-examination of current views on the specificity of neuronal circuits in the early visual system. Given the high frequency of emergent Off-center receptive fields reported here, it is reasonable to ask why past studies did not identify such an effect. Previous studies using cats and monkeys clearly demonstrate an APB-induced loss of On-center responses among neurons in the LGN (Horton and Sherk, 1984Horton J.C. Sherk H.

The connections of the retinal on and off pathways to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the monkey.Vision Res. 1984; 24: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, because APB is nonreversible during the time course of an in vivo experiment and single electrodes were used to record neuronal responses, it was not practical to record continuously from large numbers of individual neurons before and after APB treatment. Instead, data was collected primarily from separate samples of neurons before and after APB application and, following APB application, only cells with Off-center receptive fields were visually active. Key to the success of the current study was the use of a multielectrode array, allowing simultaneous recording of several LGN neurons while APB took effect. This allowed us to observe directly the On-center to Off-center plasticity in receptive field structure. APB blocks visual responses in the On pathway by selectively binding metabotropic glutamate receptors located in the synapses between photoreceptors and On-center bipolar cells (Slaughter and Miller, 1981Slaughter M.M.

If the actions of APB were selective to the mechanisms that establish the receptive field center of bipolar cells and RGCs without affecting the receptive field surround, then our finding of an emergent Off response in the LGN could simply reflect a selective loss of the receptive field center. Our results and those of past studies, however, do not support such a possibility. In particular, visual response latency is known to be longer for the receptive field surround compared the center (Enroth-Cugell et al., 1983Enroth-Cugell C. Robson J.G. Schweitzer-Tong D.E.

Consequently, if emergent Off responses were simply the result of silencing the On-center response, then the time course of the emergent Off response should be longer than the initial center response, not the same or shorter, as reported here. Moreover, and consistent with previous reports, none of the On-center RGCs in this study showed Off responses following APB application (Slaughter and Miller, 1981Slaughter M.M.

Both the time course for emergent Off responses and the timing of those responses suggest APB leads to a rapid change in the synaptic strength of functionally silent, mismatched input from Off-center RGCs onto On-center LGN neurons. Specifically, the emergence of Off responses following APB application is too quick for an anatomical reorganization of inputs. Emergent Off responses are more likely the result of changes in the synaptic strength of mismatched retinal inputs or changes in the contributions made by polysynaptic sources. Because emergent Off responses show no evidence of an increase in visual response latency, it seems unlikely that polysynaptic circuits play a major role, as these circuits should increase response latency. Moreover, extrinsic sources of polysynaptic input lack the center/surround organization seen for emergent receptive fields. Finally, current understanding of the push/pull organization of LGN receptive fields holds that local GABAergic input onto On-center LGN neurons comes from Off-center cells that provide a “pull” to reinforce, not reverse, the On response (Hirsch, 2003Hirsch J.A. Synaptic physiology and receptive field structure in the early visual pathway of the cat.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang X.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the idea of mismatched projections from RGCs to LGN neurons contradicts current models of retinogeniculate circuitry, there is evidence for the existence of these connections in the literature. In particular, studies using cross-correlation analysis to examine the response properties of synaptically-connected RGCs and LGN neurons describe a small percentage of weakly connected cell pairs mismatched in their On/Off or X/Y signature (Mastronarde, 1992Mastronarde D.N.

Synaptic circuits involving an individual retinogeniculate axon in the cat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1987; 259: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These connections were likely the result of incomplete pruning of retinal afferents during development, as LGN neurons initially receive weak input from more than ten RGCs of mixed sign, but eventually receive only one or two dominant inputs once the pathway matures (Liu and Chen, 2008Liu X. Chen C. Different roles for AMPA and NMDA receptors in transmission at the immature retinogeniculate synapse.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 629-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Blocking On activity in the retina removes a major source of excitatory drive to On-center LGN neurons. This decrease in excitatory drive likely leads to numerous changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of LGN neurons and the composition of their postsynaptic receptors. Past work in the peripheral nervous system has shown that decoupling skeletal muscle cells from their afferent input leads to an overall increase in input resistance, an increase in the number of acetylcholine receptors, and a general increase in excitability (Berg and Hall, 1975Berg D.K. Hall Z.W. Increased extrajunctional acetylcholine sensitivity produced by chronic acetylcholine sensitivity produced by chronic post-synaptic neuromuscular blockade.J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 659-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, blocking retinal activity in rat pups results in a scaling up of excitatory synaptic currents in visual cortex (Desai et al., 2002Desai N.S. Cudmore R.H. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Critical periods for experience-dependent synaptic scaling in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 783-789PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these possible mechanisms, silent synapses may also play a role in the emergence of Off responses from On-center LGN neurons (Liao et al., 2001Liao D. Scannevin R.H. Huganir R. Activation of silent synapses by rapid activity-dependent synaptic recruitment of AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6008-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that adult retinogeniculate synapses typically contain both AMPA and NMDA receptors (Esguerra et al., 1992Esguerra M. Kwon Y.H. Sur M. Retinogeniculate EPSPs recorded intracellularly in the ferret lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro: role of NMDA receptors.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 8: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If synapses from mismatched Off ganglion cells are instead silent and express only NMDA receptors, then these synapses could become rapidly activated with the insertion of AMPA receptors. In support of this possibility, Chen et al., 2002Chen C. Blitz D.M. Regehr W.G. Contributions of receptor desensitization and saturation to plasticity at the retinogeniculate synapse.Neuron. 2002; 33: 779-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar demonstrated that sustained afferent activity can lead to rapid short-term plasticity in the LGN through a process involving regulation of both AMPA and NMDA receptors and an overall desensitization of synapses. In conclusion, we have identified a robust form of plasticity in the adult LGN whereby intraocular injections of APB lead to a rapid emergence of Off-center responses from On-center neurons. Our results suggest this plasticity likely relies on a rapid strengthening of weak or silent inputs from the retina. Moreover, these results indicate that visual neurons in the adult thalamus are capable of providing visual information to the cerebral cortex in the absence of their primary afferent drive. For the On to Off plasticity identified here, cortical reorganization would likely follow thalamic plasticity for this information to prove useful for vision. Given the challenges the visual system encounters during its lifetime—challenges including injury, stroke, and disease—it is critical that we increase our understanding of the circuits capable of plasticity in the adult brain. Fifteen adult cats (>6 months old, both sexes) were used in this study. All surgical and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis. Surgical anesthesia was induced with ketamine (10 mg/kg, intramuscular [IM]) followed with thiopental sodium (20 mg/kg, intravenous [IV], supplemented as needed). Animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus where body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a thermostatically-controlled heating blanket, and they were mechanically ventilated. A craniotomy was made above the LGN, and the dura was reflected. All wound margins were infused with lidocaine. A small metal ring was glued to the sclera of each eye to minimize eye movement and to secure the eye for intraocular injections of APB. The pupils were dilated with 1% atropine sulfate and the nictitating membranes were retracted with 10% phenylephrine. The eyes were fitted with contact lenses and focused on a screen located 76 cm in front the animal. Once surgical procedures were complete, anesthesia was maintained with thiopental sodium (2–3 mg/kg/hr, IV). Animals were then paralyzed with vecuronium bromide (0.2 mg/kg/hr, IV). Proper depth of anesthesia was ensured throughout the experiment by continuously monitoring the electroencephalogram, the electrocardiogram, and expired CO2. Animals were euthanized at the end of the experiment with an overdose of Euthasol (Virbac, Ft. Worth, TX). Single-unit recordings were made from LGN neurons in layers A and A1, in vivo, using a 7-channel multielectrode array (Thomas Recording Systems, Marburg, Germany). Neuronal responses were amplified and recorded to a PC equipped with a Power 1401 data acquisition interface and the Spike 2 software package (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England). Spike isolation was based on waveform analysis and the presence of a refractory period, as indicated by the autocorrelogram. Single-unit recordings were made from RGCs, in vitro, using a 60-channel multielectrode array (MultiChannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Individual electrodes were 30 μm in diameter and arranged on an 8 × 8 rectilinear grid with 200 μm interelectrode spacing. Tissue preparation and recording procedures were similar those previously described (Sun et al., 2008Sun C. Warland D.K. Ballesteros J.M. van der List D. Chalupa L.M. Retinal waves in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the retinas were isolated and stored in buffered and oxygenated minimum essential medium Eagle (MEME, M7278; Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature. The retinas were cut into 5–8 mm2 rectangles, placed ganglion cell layer down on the multielectrode array, held in place with a piece of dialysis membrane, and superfused with buffered MEME (2 ml/min) at 37°C. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded using custom-made electrodes. The ERG signal was amplified and low-pass filtered at 100 Hz. One hundred to two hundred trials were averaged to yield the final ERG waveforms. Visual stimuli were produced with a VSG2/5 or a ViSaGe visual stimulus generator for the in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively (Cambridge Research Systems, Rochester, England). Stimuli were presented on a γ-calibrated Sony Monitor (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with a mean luminance of 38 candelas/m2 and a refresh rate of 140 Hz. Two types of visual stimuli were used to characterize visual responses: (1) a full-field, spatially uniform stimulus that stepped between two luminance levels (<1 and 76 cd/m2, or 38 and 76 cd/m2); and (2) a pseudorandom binary white-noise stimulus. The white-noise stimulus consisted of a 16 × 16 grid of squares (pixels) that were white or black one-half of the time, as determined by an m-sequence of length 215-1. Intraocular injections of DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB; 0.14 mg in 20 μl saline; Sigma-Aldrich) were made through the sclera into the posterior chamber of the eye using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) to achieve an estimated intraocular concentration of 300 μM (Horton and Sherk, 1984Horton J.C. Sherk H. Receptive field properties in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus in the absence of on-center retinal input.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 374-380PubMed Google Scholar). The Hamilton syringe was inserted through a metal ring that secured the sclera to the stereotaxic frame and injections were guided using an ophthalmoscope. In some experiments, excised patches of retina were used for in vitro recordings. For these recordings, retinal tissue was perfused with 300 μM APB. Spatiotemporal receptive field maps (kernels) were calculated from responses to the white-noise stimulus using reverse-correlation analysis. For each delay between stimulus and response and for each of the 16 × 16 pixels, we calculated the average stimulus that preceded a spike. For each of the pixels, the kernel can also be thought of as the average firing rate of the neuron, above or below the mean (the impulse response). When normalized by the product of the bin width and the total duration of the stimulus, the result is expressed in units of spikes/s. Impulse responses were calculated from responses to pixels overlapping the receptive field center and were interpolated with a cubic spline (MATLAB function “spline”; MathWorks, Natick, MA) to determine subregion strength and latency to peak response. Receptive field sizes were assessed from Gaussian fits of the receptive field centers and are reported as the size of the space constant, which is equal to the σ value.

IntroductionAsthma is a chronic lung disease with airway inflammation and abnormal airway smooth muscle contraction (bronchospasm), which is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). 2The abbreviations used are: ASMCairway smooth muscle cellHASMChuman airway smooth muscle cellreHASMCrecombinant human airway smooth muscle cellmiRNAmicroRNANS-miRnonspecific miRNACOPDchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseqPCRquantitative PCR. Airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness are characteristic features of severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clinical studies show that both hypertrophy (increase in cell size) and hyperplasia (increase in cell number) of ASMCs play key roles in airway remodeling (1Benayoun L. Druilhe A. Dombret M.C.

Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 7: 9-26PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study in bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients shows a correlation between airway hyperresponsiveness, predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and airway responsiveness to deep inspiration and the levels of selective expression of ASMC proteins, including desmin (7Slats A.M. Janssen K. van Schadewijk A. van der Plas D.T. Schot R. van den Aardweg J.G. de Jongste J.C. Hiemstra P.S. Mauad T. Rabe K.F. Sterk P.J. J. Allergy Clin.

All types of muscle cells, including ASMCs and alveolar ducts, express desmin (8Costa M.L. Escaleira R. Cataldo A. Oliveira F. Mermelstein C.S. Braz. J. Med. Biol.

Our physiologic data from desmin knock-out (Des−/−) mice show that desmin is an intracellular load-bearing protein that influences airway compliance, lung recoil, and airway contractile responsiveness (13Shardonofsky F.R. Capetanaki Y. Boriek A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 290: L890-L896Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results suggest that desmin may play an important role in modulating ASMC phenotype.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as key regulators of gene expression and are associated with many human diseases. Recently, we have shown the role of miR-26a in the induction of hypertrophy in human ASMC (14Mohamed J.S. Lopez M.A. Boriek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29336-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, whether desmin can regulate the ASMC phenotype through a miRNA-regulated pathway is unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether loss of desmin triggers induction of ASMC hypertrophy through a miR-26a-regulated pathway. Our results demonstrated that ASMCs of desmin null mice (ASMCsDes−/−) showed hypertrophy and miR-26a up-regulation. Loss of desmin in mouse ASMCs activated Erk-1/2, which up-regulated miR-26a through Egr-1 (early growth responsive protein-1). The anti-hypertrophic protein glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a target gene of miR-26a in ASMCsDes−/−. In addition, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of desmin protein in human ASMCs induced hypertrophy through the activation of the Egr-1/miR-26a/GSK-3β pathway. Overall, our data show that desmin is an essential intermediate filament for maintaining ASMC phenotype in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our data also provide novel experimental evidence that desmin intermediate filaments are important in the regulation of microRNA.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that desmin is an important intermediate filament that maintains ASMC phenotype through an miRNA-regulated pathway. ASMCs isolated from desmin null mice were hypertrophic phenotype and showed miRNA dysregulation. Loss and gain functional analyses of miR-26a showed that miR-26a up-regulation in ASMCsDes−/− induced hypertrophy through the suppression of the anti-hypertrophic protein GSK-3β. Furthermore, overactivation of Erk-1/2 in ASMCsDes−/− increased Egr-1 phosphorylation, which in turn up-regulated miR-26a expression. The loss of desmin-induced-ASMC hypertrophy by Erk-1/2-Egr-1/miR-26a/GSK-3β pathway is consistent in recombinant HASMCs, which stably suppress 90% of endogenous desmin expression. Overall, for the first time, our study uncovers that desmin is an anti-hypertrophic protein important for ASMC homeostasis and provides a new molecular link between intermediate filament and miRNA regulation.Desmin is one of the structural and intermediate proteins expressed in all muscle tissues, including ASMCs. Structural changes to airway smooth muscle due to hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia are a well known feature of chronic airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis (1Benayoun L.

In addition, in the last few years, miRNAs have been recognized as potent regulators of gene expression and as a key modulator of a variety of biological processes (21Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28978) Google Scholar, 22Plasterk R.H. Cell. 2006; 124: 877-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, miRNAs remain at a steady level, and this level is altered during pathogenesis of airway diseases (23Williams A.E. Larner-Svensson H. Perry M.M. Campbell G.A. Herrick S.E. Adcock I.M. Erjefalt J.S. Chung K.F. Lindsay M.A. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4e5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), thereby leading to changes in the protein coding gene expression. We have recently shown that miR-26a is a mechanosensitive hypertrophic miRNA in HASMC (14Mohamed J.S. Lopez M.A. Boriek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29336-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies show that mechanical stretch increases desmin and contractile protein expression in canine ASMCs (24Liu M. Tanswell A.K. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L667-L683PubMed Google Scholar) and lung undifferentiated mesenchymal cells (25Yang Y. Beqaj S. Kemp P. Ariel I. Schuger L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting a link between desmin and mechanical regulation. However, the key question of whether desmin can regulate ASMC phenotype by altering miRNA expression profile remains to be answered. Our microarray and qPCR data showed that ASMCsDes−/− up-regulated miR-21, miR-26a, miR-155, and miR-203 expressions.Our results also showed that ASMCsDes−/− or reHASMCs were hypertrophic phenotype as evidenced by increased cell size, protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio, and contractile protein expression, indicating a negative correlation between desmin and ASMC hypertrophy. This is in agreement with the previous study, which showed a negative correlation between the level of selective expression of ASMC proteins, including desmin and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients (7Slats A.M. Janssen K. van Schadewijk A. van der Plas D.T. Schot R. van den Aardweg J.G. de Jongste J.C. Hiemstra P.S. Mauad T. Rabe K.F. Sterk P.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2008; 121: 1196-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is well known that airway hyperresponsiveness is directly associated with ASMC hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia (6Terzano C. Laurendi G. Capoccetta G. Rapisarda M. Pacilio R. Petroianni A. Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 7: 9-26PubMed Google Scholar). The negative correlation between the level of desmin expression and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients may be due to ASMC hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia. However, our previous study showed that airways of Des−/− mice had hyporesponsiveness to cholinergic stimulation (13Shardonofsky F.R. Capetanaki Y. Boriek A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 290: L890-L896Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This may be due to a reduced number of ASMCs in the airways of Des−/− mice. It is well documented that cell hypertrophy occurs after cell cycle arrest. In agreement with this, the present study and our previous study (14Mohamed J.S. Lopez M.A. Boriek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29336-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) showed that miR-26a up-regulation either by loss of desmin, enforced expression, or stretch inhibited cell proliferation and then transformed ASMCs to hypertrophic phenotype. Further studies are necessary to investigate how miR-26a inhibits ASMC proliferation.Gene expression-modulating miRNAs are encoded in diverse genomic locations, including intergenic regions, introns of protein-coding genes, and introns/exons of non-coding RNA genes (26Griffiths-Jones S. Saini H.K. van Dongen S. Enright A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar). Most mammalian miRNAs lie between protein-coding genes, whereas about one-third are within the introns of annotated mRNAs (27Rodriguez A. Griffiths-Jones S. Ashurst J.L. Bradley A. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 28Saini H.K. Griffiths-Jones S. Enright A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17719-17724Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In the human and mouse genomes, two distinct genes, Ctdspl and Ctdsp2, encode different pri-miR-26a (miR-26a-1 and miR-26a-2), leading to the generation of identical mature miR-26a. In mice, miR-26a-1 is located in an intron of Ctdspl at chromosome 9, and miR-26a-2 is located in an intron of Ctdsp2 at chromosome 10. It is likely that the intronic miRNAs are processed from the same primary transcript as the precursor mRNAs, and thus, their expression levels are regulated by the expression of the host mRNA (29Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 861-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). We examined the correlation between the miR-26a expression profile and the expression profile of the host genes by qPCR. Interestingly, ASMCsDes−/− overexpressed Ctdsp2 but not Ctdspl mRNA (data not shown). These results indicate that processing of most of the miR-26a in ASMCsDes−/− is from the same primary transcript as its host gene, Ctdsp2. This suggests the existence of a strong correlation between the expression of miR-26a and Ctdsp2 mRNA, consistent with previous findings (30Cai X. Hagedorn C.H. Cullen B.R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). We determined the specific transcription factor that up-regulates pri-miR-26a in ASMCsDes−/−. Using a ChIP assay, we found that activation of miR-26a promoter in ASMCsDes−/− was completely dependent on the Egr-1 binding sites. The luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the activation of the miR-26a promoter in ASMCsDes−/− was effective only after the transfection of cells with pGL-Egr-1 construct, which contains one Egr-1 binding site. Moreover, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of Egr-1 confirmed the requirement of Egr-1 for the activation of miR-26a promoter in ASMCsDes−/−. Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor expressed in a variety of cell types, including smooth muscle cells, by a large number of growth factors, cytokines, and injurious stimuli (31Silverman E.S.

These results suggest the role of Egr-1 in cell growth. Furthermore, we found that loss of desmin in ASMCs activated Erk-1/2 but not p38 and JNK, which in turn up-regulated miR-26a through Egr1 in ASMCsDes−/−.The molecular mechanism underlying ASMC hypertrophy involves a change in the gene expression profile, mostly including the up-regulation of translation, transcription, and survival-related genes (6Terzano C. Laurendi G. Capoccetta G. Rapisarda M. Pacilio R. Petroianni A. Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 7: 9-26PubMed Google Scholar). Like miR-26a, many proteins emerged to regulate hypertrophy and promote disease upon their dysregulated expression. Among those, one of the potential proteins that regulate hypertrophy is GSK-3β. GSK-3β is constitutively active in non-stimulated cells and inactivated upon phosphorylation at Ser9 (39Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Although initially described as an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (40Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), GSK-3β was later revealed as a key signaling molecule regulating many aspects of cellular function, including protein synthesis, cytoskeletal integrity, and gene expression (41Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). More importantly, GSK-3β negatively regulates cardiac (42Antos C.L. McKinsey T.A. Frey N. Kutschke W.

These studies suggest the post-transcriptional role of GSK-3β on hypertrophy. Interestingly, our results showed that GSK-3β phosphorylation in ASMCsDes−/− was decreased due to a reduction in the total protein production, and, which induced ASMCDes−/− hypertrophy. Our experiment identified GSK-3β as a downstream target of miR-26a, which inhibits GSK-3β protein translation. A similar finding has been reported in HASMCs, in which inhibition of GSK-3β by RNAi increases cell size and protein synthesis (17Deng H. Dokshin G.A. Lei J. Goldsmith A.M. Bitar K.N. Fingar D.C. Hershenson M.B. Bentley J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10198-10207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the miR-26a-GSK-3β-mediated signaling pathway did not regulate Des−/− ASMC proliferation. This is also consistent with the previous finding demonstrating that GSK-3β does not participate in HASMC proliferation (17Deng H. Dokshin G.A. Lei J. Goldsmith A.M. Bitar K.N. Fingar D.C. Hershenson M.B. Bentley J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10198-10207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, our search for GSK-3β targets provided only five miRNAs (miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-199a, 199b, and 302a*). Because loss of desmin in ASMC did not induce any of these miRNAs except for miR-26a in ASMC, we cannot rule out the possibility that these miRNAs are not upstream targets of GSK-3β. It is well recognized that miRNAs may function according to a “combinational circuitry model,” whereby a single miRNA targets multiple mRNAs and several miRNAs may target a single mRNA (49He H. Jazdzewski K. Li W. Liyanarachchi S. Nagy R. Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Franssila K. Suster S. Kloos R.T. Croce C.M. de la Chapelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19075-19080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are required to elucidate specifically whether hypertrophic stimuli can induce the expression of these predicted miRNAs and whether miR-26a can down-regulate hypertrophic proteins of ASMCs other than GSK-3β.In summary, our results provide experimental evidence demonstrating that desmin is an anti-hypertrophic protein, which induces ASMC hypertrophy as a result of its down-regulation. Loss of desmin in ASMC activates Erk-1/2, which up-regulates miR-26a through Egr-1 activation. Molecular functional analyses indicate that GSK-3β is a target gene of miR-26a, which inhibits GSK-3β protein production. The Erk-1/2/Egr-1/miR-26a/GSK-3β pathway in the induction of hypertrophy is conserved in human ASMCs (Fig. 9).

Moreover, a recent study in bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients shows a correlation between airway hyperresponsiveness, predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and airway responsiveness to deep inspiration and the levels of selective expression of ASMC proteins, including desmin (7Slats A.M.

All types of muscle cells, including ASMCs and alveolar ducts, express desmin (8Costa M.L. Escaleira R. Cataldo A. Oliveira F. Mermelstein C.S. Braz. J. Med. Biol.

Our physiologic data from desmin knock-out (Des−/−) mice show that desmin is an intracellular load-bearing protein that influences airway compliance, lung recoil, and airway contractile responsiveness (13Shardonofsky F.R. Capetanaki Y. Boriek A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 290: L890-L896Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results suggest that desmin may play an important role in modulating ASMC phenotype.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as key regulators of gene expression and are associated with many human diseases. Recently, we have shown the role of miR-26a in the induction of hypertrophy in human ASMC (14Mohamed J.S. Lopez M.A. Boriek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29336-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, whether desmin can regulate the ASMC phenotype through a miRNA-regulated pathway is unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether loss of desmin triggers induction of ASMC hypertrophy through a miR-26a-regulated pathway. Our results demonstrated that ASMCs of desmin null mice (ASMCsDes−/−) showed hypertrophy and miR-26a up-regulation. Loss of desmin in mouse ASMCs activated Erk-1/2, which up-regulated miR-26a through Egr-1 (early growth responsive protein-1). The anti-hypertrophic protein glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a target gene of miR-26a in ASMCsDes−/−. In addition, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of desmin protein in human ASMCs induced hypertrophy through the activation of the Egr-1/miR-26a/GSK-3β pathway. Overall, our data show that desmin is an essential intermediate filament for maintaining ASMC phenotype in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our data also provide novel experimental evidence that desmin intermediate filaments are important in the regulation of microRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2030876355,"The product of the SSeCKS/GRAVIN/AKAP12 gene (""SSeCKS"") is a major protein kinase (PK) C substrate that exhibits tumor- and metastasis-suppressing activity likely through its ability to scaffold multiple signaling mediators such as PKC, PKA, cyclins, calmodulin, and Src. Although SSeCKS and PKCα bind phosphatidylserine, we demonstrate that phosphatidylserine-independent binding of PKC by SSeCKS is facilitated by two homologous SSeCKS motifs, EG(I/V)(T/S)XWXSFK(K/R)(M/L)VTP(K/R)K(K/R)X(K/R)XXXEXXXE(E/D) (amino acids 592-620 and 741-769). SSeCKS binding to PKCα decreased kinase activity and was dependent on the two PKC-binding motifs. SSeCKS scaffolding of PKC was increased in confluent cell cultures, correlating with significantly increased SSeCKS protein levels and decreased PKCα activity, suggesting a role for SSeCKS in suppressing PKC activation during contact inhibition. SSeCKS-null mouse embryo fibroblasts displayed increased relative basal and phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-induced PKC activity but were defective in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell shape change; these responses could be rescued by the forced expression of full-length SSeCKS but not by an SSeCKS variant deleted of its PKC-binding domains. Finally, the PKC binding sites in SSeCKS were required to restore cell rounding and/or decreased apoptosis in phorbol ester-treated LNCaP, LNCaP-C4-2, and MAT-LyLu prostate cancer cells. Thus, PKC-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is likely regulated by the ability of SSeCKS to control PKC signaling and activity through a direct scaffolding function."

Previous work has shown that the majority of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases express a wild type p53 gene, although the functionality of the p53 pathway has rarely been validated. In the present study, the integrity of the p53 pathway was investigated in a panel of ALL cell lines and xenografts established from direct patient explants in immune-deficient mice. A focused real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR array of known p53-regulated genes identified p21(WAF1) (CDKN1A) as the highest ranked gene to be differentially expressed between B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and T-ALL xenografts following exposure to the DNA-damaging drug etoposide. Lack of p21(WAF1) induction was observed in six of seven T-ALL xenograft lines, as well as primary T-ALL cells following irradiation exposure, despite an otherwise functional p53 response. Repression of p21(WAF1) in T-ALL cells was associated with decreased acetylated H3K9 localized at its promoter compared with BCP-ALL cells, together with increased CpG methylation within the first exon and intron. Although the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat failed to induce p21(WAF1) in T-ALL samples, the combination of vorinostat and the demethylating agent decitabine reactivated expression of the silenced p21(WAF1) gene in the Molt-4 T-ALL cell line. Considering the known anti-apoptotic function of p21(WAF1), our findings have significant implications for the responses of T- versus BCP-ALL cells to chemotherapeutic drugs that induce p21(WAF1)."

In this study, we investigated the role the ILD of the GABAAR α1 subunit plays in channel function. Deletion of the α1 ILD resulted in a significant increase in GABA EC50 and maximal current amplitude, suggesting that the ILD must be intact for proper receptor function. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a mutagenic screen of all amino acids harboring ionizable side chains within this domain to investigate the contribution of individual charged residues to ion permeation. Using macroscopic and single channel voltage-clamp recording techniques, we found that mutations within a subdomain of the α1 ILD near M3 altered GABA apparent affinity; interestingly, α1(K312E) exhibited reduced partial agonist efficacy. We introduced point mutations near M4, including α1(K383E) and α1(K384E), that enhanced receptor desensitization. Mutation of 5 charged residues within a 39-residue span contiguous with M4 reduced relative anion permeability of the channel and may represent a weak intracellular selectivity filter.

https://openalex.org/W2073180080,"The hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) and its derivatives have been successfully used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, and they frequently improve the anemia that usually accompanies these disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action remain poorly understood. In this study, we used two erythroid models, murine erythroid leukemia cells and erythroid burst-forming unit-derived erythroblasts, to show that 5-aza-CdR induced erythroid differentiation and increased the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech), thereby increasing iron uptake and heme biosynthesis. We have identified new regulatory E-boxes that lie outside of CpG islands in the TfR1 and Fech promoters, and the methylation status of these sites can be altered by 5-aza-CdR treatment. This in turn altered the binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to these promoter elements. Furthermore, 5-aza-CdR promoted the nuclear translocation of c-Myc and its binding to Max to form functional complexes. The coordinated actions of 5-aza-CdR on the methylation status of the target genes and in stimulating the nuclear translocation of c-Myc provide new molecular insights into the regulation of E-boxes and explain, at least in part, the increased erythroid response to 5-aza-CdR treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1965084380,"Cholix toxin (Cholix) is a novel ADP-ribosylating cytotoxin produced by Vibrio cholerae, which utilizes eukaryotic elongation factor 2 as a substrate and acts by a mechanism similar to that of diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A. First it was found that Cholix-treated HeLa cells exhibited caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas intestinal cells such as Caco-2, HCT116, and RKO did not. Here we investigated Cholix-induced cell death signaling pathways in HeLa cells. Cholix-induced cytochrome c release into cytosol was initiated by specific conformational changes of pro-apoptotic Bak associated with Bax. Silencing of bak/bax genes or bak gene alone using siRNA significantly suppressed cytochrome c release and caspase-7 activation, but not activation of caspases-3 and -9. Although pretreatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) reduced Cholix-induced cytochrome c release and activation of caspases-3, -7, and -9, cytotoxicity was not decreased. Pretreatment with Z-YVAD-FMK, which inhibits caspase-1, -4, and -5, suppressed not only cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-3, -7, -8, or -9, and PARP cleavage, but also cytotoxicity, indicating that caspase-1, -4, and -5 activation is initiated at an early stage of Cholix-induced apoptosis and promotes caspase-8 activation. These results show that the inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5) and caspase-8 are responsible for both mitochondrial signals and other caspase activation. In conclusion, we showed that Cholix-induced caspase activation plays an essential role in generation of apoptotic signals, which are mediated by both mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2022725013,"Resistance of carcinoma cells to anoikis, apoptosis that is normally induced by loss of cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion, is thought to be essential for the ability of these cells to form primary tumors, invade adjacent tissues, and metastasize to distant organs. Current knowledge about the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade anoikis is far from complete. In an effort to understand these mechanisms, we found that ras, a major oncogene, down-regulates protease caspase-2 (which initiates certain steps of the cellular apoptotic program) in malignant human and rat intestinal epithelial cells. This down-regulation could be reversed by inhibition of a protein kinase Mek, a mediator of Ras signaling. We also found that enforced down-regulation of caspase-2 in nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells by RNA interference protected them from anoikis. Furthermore, the reversal of the effect of Ras on caspase-2 achieved by the expression of exogenous caspase-2 in detached ras-transformed intestinal epithelial cells promoted well established apoptotic events, such as the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial factors cytochrome c and HtrA2/Omi into the cytoplasm of these cells, significantly enhanced their anoikis susceptibility, and blocked their long term growth in the absence of adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Finally, the blockade of the effect of Ras on caspase-2 substantially suppressed growth of tumors formed by the ras-transformed cells in mice. We conclude that ras-induced down-regulation of caspase-2 represents a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Ras protects malignant intestinal epithelial cells from anoikis, promotes their anchorage-independent growth, and allows them to form tumors in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2021281977,"The neutral assumption that individuals of either the same or different species share exactly the same birth, death, migration, and speciation probabilities is fundamental yet controversial to the neutral theory. Several theoretical studies have demonstrated that a slight difference in species per capita birth or death rates can have a profound consequence on species coexistence and community structure. Whether asymmetry in migration, a vital demographic parameter in the neutral model, plays an important role in community assembly still remains unknown. In this paper, we relaxed the ecological equivalence assumption of the neutral model by introducing differences into species regional dispersal ability. We investigated the effect of asymmetric dispersal on the neutral local community structure. We found that per capita asymmetric dispersal among species could reduce species richness of the local community and result in deviations of species abundance distributions from those predicted by the neutral model. But the effect was moderate compared with that of asymmetries in birth or death rates, unless very large asymmetries in dispersal were assumed. A large difference in species dispersal ability, if there is, can overwhelm the role of random drift and make local community dynamics deterministic. In this case, species with higher regional dispersal abilities tended to dominate in the local community. However, the species abundance distribution of the local community under asymmetric dispersal could be well fitted by the neutral model, but the neutral model generally underestimated the fundamental biodiversity number but overestimated the migration rate in such communities."
https://openalex.org/W1975032533,"In this study, a two-state mechanochemical model is presented to describe the dynamic instability of microtubules (MTs) in cells. The MT switches between two states, the assembly and disassembly states. In assembly state, the growth of MTs includes two processes: free GTP-tubulin binding to the tip of protofilament (PF) and conformation change of PF, during which the first tubulin unit that curls outwards is rearranged onto the MT surface, using the energy released from the hydrolysis of GTP in the penultimate tubulin unit. In the disassembly state, the shortening of MTs also includes two processes, the release of GDP-tubulin from the tip of PF and the curling of one new tubulin unit out of the MT surface. Switches between these two states, which are usually called rescue and catastrophe, happen stochastically with external force-dependent rates. Using this two-state model with parameters obtained by fitting the recent experimental data, detailed properties of MT growth are obtained. I find that MT is mainly in the assembly state, its mean growth velocity increases with both the external force and the GTP-tubulin concentration, and an MT will shorten on average without an external force. To know more about the external force and GTP-tubulin concentration-dependent properties of MT growth, and for future experimental verification of this two-state model, 11 critical forces are defined and discussed numerically.

During cell division, MTs in spindles constantly grow and shorten by addition and loss of the enzyme tubulin (GTPase) from their tips. The attached duplicated chromosomes are stretched apart (through two kinetochores) from one another by the opposing forces (produced by MTs based on different spindles). Recently, many theoretical models have been designed to understand the roles of MTs during chromosome segregation (19Hill T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One essential point, to understand how MTs help chromosome segregation during cell division, is to know the mechanism of MT growth and shortening. In this study, inspired by the mechanochemical model for molecular motors (26Fisher M.E. Kolomeisky A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7748-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and the GTP-cap model and catch bonds model for MT (8Howard J. Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton.

Electron microscopy indicates that an MT is composed of n parallel protofilaments (PFs, usually 12 ≤ n ≤ 15 and n = 13 is used in this work), which form a hollow cylinder (7Cooper G.M. The Cell: A Molecular Approach. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar, 8Howard J. Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 28Bray D. Cell Movements: From Molecules to Motility. 2nd Ed. Garland, New York2001Google Scholar). Each PF is a filament that made of head-to-tail associated αβ heterodimers. At the tip of an MT, PFs curl outward from the MT cylinder surface. The tip might be in a shrinking GDP-cap state or growing GTP-cap state. In contrast to the tip in the shrinking GDP state, the growing GTP tip is fairly straight. In other words, in a GTP-cap state, the angle between the curled out segment of PFs and MT surface is less than that in the GDP state. In this work, I will only consider the growth and shortening of one single PF. I assume that each step of growth and shortening of one PF contributes L (nm) to the growth and shortening of the whole MT. Intuitively, L = L1/n with L1 the length of one αβ heterodimer. In the numerical calculations, I use L = 8 nm/13 ≈ 0.615 nm (19Hill T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Kolomeisky A.B. Fisher M.E.

J. 2002; 83: 42-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). My two-state mechanochemical model for PF growth and shortening is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a and mathematically described by a two-line Markov chain in Fig. 1b. In this model, a PF stochastically switches between two states: the assembly and disassembly states. During the assembly state, a PF grows through two processes, 1 → 2 (i), the free GTP-tubulin binding process. The rate constant is k1 and depends on the GTP-tubulin concentration [tubulin], and 2 → 1 (ii), a PF conformation change process. During which, using energy released from GTP hydrolysis, the curled PF segment is straightened with one PF unit (i.e. one αβ heterodimer) rearranged onto the MT surface, i.e. to parallel to the MT axis approximately. During the disassembly state, each step of a PF shortening also includes two processes, (i′) 2′ ← 1′, disassociation of GDP-tubulin from a PF tip to the environment and (ii′) 1′ ← 2′, one new PF unit curls out from the MT surface (during which phosphate is released from the tip of the tubulin unit simultaneously). The communication among curved PF units in the processes 2 → 1 and 1′ ← 2′ might be explained by similar methods as in the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (30Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) or the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model (31Koshland Jr., D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). The two-state model presented here can be regarded as a generalization of the one employed by Akiyoshi et al. (27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) to explain their experimental data, which is depicted in Fig. 2a. (My corresponding generalized two-state model, including bead detachment from MT, is depicted in Fig. 2b, see “Modified Model according to Experiments, including Bead Detachment from MT” for detailed discussion). The reasons that I prefer to use this generalized model are as follows. The measurements in Refs. 32Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 33Walker R.A. Pryer N.K. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Janson M.E. de Dood M.E. Dogterom M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar indicate that the rate of catastrophe, i.e. transition from elongation to shortening, depends on the GTP-tubulin concentration of the solution. However, for the simple model depicted in Fig. 2a, the catastrophe rate kc is independent of GTP-tubulin concentration. (It is biochemically reasonable to assume that the elongation rate k1 depends on GTP-tubulin concentration,k1 = k10[tubulin], but there is no reason to write kc as a function of [tubulin].) The “Results” show that for my generalized model, the catastrophe rate does change with [tubulin] because GTP-tubulin concentration will change the probabilities of a PF being in states 1 and 2 and consequently change the transition rate from assembly state to disassembly state. At the same time, for the simple model depicted in Fig. 2a, the distribution of the catastrophe time is an exponential. However, experimental measurements under a particular situation indicate that this distribution is clearly not an exponential (34Janson M.E. de Dood M.E. Dogterom M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Certainly, from the parameter values listed in Table 3, one may find that the rates k10 and k3 are much larger than k20 and k40, so under low external force and high free GTP-tubulin concentration, the model depicted in Fig. 2a is a good approximation of my generalized model depicted in Fig. 2b. It should be pointed out that, although the model presented here looks more complex, there are only two more parameters than the one depicted in Fig. 2a. 3To keep as few parameters as possible in my two-state model, I assume that the bead only can detach from an MT from substates 1 and 1′. The reasons are as follows: in assembly state, the experimental data in Refs. 27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar and 43Dogterom M. Yurke B. Science. 1997; 278: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar (or see Fig. 3b) imply the growth speed of MT increases with external force. (Note that the definition of force direction in Ref. 27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar is different from that in Ref. 43Dogterom M. Yurke B. Science. 1997; 278: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar.) In this study, the force direction definition is the same as in Ref. 27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, i.e., the force is positive if it points to the MT growth direction), so the corresponding force distribution factor δg (see Equation 18) should be positive because the growth speed Vg = k1k2L/(k1 + k2) (see Equation 5). Consequently, the probability p¯1=k2/(k1 + k2) that an MT in state 1 (see Equation 12) increases, but the probability p¯2=k1/(k1 + k2) that an MT in state 2 decreases with external force, i.e. as the increase of external force, the assembly MT would more like to stay in state 1. Furthermore, from the experimental data in Ref. 27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, one sees the detachment rate from the assembly state increases with external force. Therefore, the more reasonable choice is to assume that the bead can only detach from state 1 but not state 2. Through similar discussion, one also can see that it is more reasonable to assume that in disassembly state the bead can only detach from state 1′. At the same time, the experimental data in Ref. 32Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar imply the catastrophe rate decreases with GTP-tubulin concentration [tubulin] (or see Fig. 4b). Because k1 = k10[tubulin], the probability p¯1= k2/(k1 + k2) decreases with [tubulin], but the probability p¯2 = k1/(k1 + k2) increases with [tubulin]. This is why I assume the catastrophe takes place at state 1.TABLE 3Model parameters obtained by fitting the expressions in Equations 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, and 17 to the experimental data mainly measured in Ref. 27Akiyoshi B.

Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and properties of MT growth and shortening are studied numerically. This includes external force and GTP-tubulin concentration-dependent growth/shortening speeds (i), mean dwell times in assembly and disassembly state (ii), mean growth or shortening length before the bead, which is used in experiments to apply external force, and detachment from MT. To know more properties of MT dynamics, 11 “critical forces” (detailed definitions will be given in “Critical Forces of MT Growth”) are also numerically discussed under “Results,” followed by concluding remarks. As the schematic depiction in Fig. 1, a PF might be in two states: the assembly (growth) state and the disassembly (shortening) state. Each of the two states includes two substates, denoted by 1, 2 and 1′, 2′, respectively. Let p1, p2 be the probabilities that a PF is in assembly substates 1 and 2, respectively, and ρ1, ρ2 be the probabilities that the PF is in disassembly substates 1′ and 2′, then p1, p2, ρ1, ρ2 are governed by the following master equation,dp1/dt=k2p2−k1p1+krρ1−kcp1,dp2/dt=k1p1−k2p2,dρ1/dt=k4ρ2−k3ρ1−krρ1+kcp1,dρ2/dt=k3ρ1−k4ρ2(Eq. 1) where k1 is the rate of GTP-tubulin binding to the tip of a PF, k2 is the rate of PF realignment with one new unit lying in the MT surface, k3 is the dissociation rate of GDP-tubulin from the tip of a PF, and k4 is the rate of curling out of one tubulin unit from the MT surface (with Pi release simultaneously). The steady state solution of Equation 1 is as shown in Equation 2.p1=[1+k1k2+kckr(1+k3k4)]−1,p2=k1k2p1, ρ1 kckrp1, ρ2=k3kck4krp1(Eq. 2) One can easily show that the mean steady state velocity of MT growth or shortening is as shown in Equation 3 (35Derrida B. J. Stat. Phys. 1983; 31: 433-450Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y. Phys. Lett.

Let p¯1, p¯2 be the probabilities that a PF is in substates 1 and 2, respectively, provided the PF is in assembly state, then p¯1, p¯2 satisfy that shown in Equation 4.dp¯1/dt=k2p¯2−k1p¯1=−dp¯2/dt(Eq. 4) One can easily show that at steady state, the mean growth speed of a MT with a PF in assembly state is as shown in Equation 5.Vg=k2p¯2L=k1k2Lk1+ k2(Eq. 5) Similarly, the mean shortening speed of a MT with a PF in disassembly state is shown in Equation 6.Vs=k3k4Lk3+ k4(Eq. 6) To know the model parameters ki, i = 1, …, 4 and kc, kr, I need to fit the model to experimental data. In recent experiments, Akiyoshi et al. (27Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S.

In their experiments, the force-dependent mean growth and shortening speeds of MTs were measured. Meanwhile, the rates of rescue and catastrophe, the force-dependent mean lifetime, during which the bead remains attached to MT, and mean detachment rates of the bead during assembly and disassembly states are also measured. Therefore, to fit these experimental data, the model depicted in Fig. 1 should be modified to include the bead detachment processes (see Fig. 2b). For the model depicted in Fig. 2b, the formulations of mean growth velocity V and mean growth and shortening speeds Vg and Vs are the same as in Equations 3, 5, and 6. In the following, I will derive an expression of the mean lifetime of the bead on MTs. Let T1, T2, T1′, T2′ be the mean first passage times (MFPTs) of a bead to detachment, when the initial substates are 1, 2, 1′, 2′, respectively, and then T1, T2, T1′, T2′ satisfy (37Redner S.

In assembly state, let Ta1 and Ta2 be the MFPTs to detachment of the bead initially at substates 1 and 2 respectively, and then Ta1 and Ta2 satisfy Equation 9.Ta1 =1k1+ ka+k1k1+ kaTa2, Ta2=1k2+Ta1(Eq. 9) One can easily show the following (Equation 10).Ta1 =k1+ k2k2 ka, Ta2=k1+ka+ k2k2ka(Eq. 10) Therefore, the MFPT to detachment of the bead in assembly state is as shown in Equation 11,Ta=p¯1Ta1=p¯2Ta2(Eq. 11) where the steady state probabilities of Equation 12 are obtained from Equation 4.p¯1= k2k1+ k2, p¯2 =k1k1+k2(Eq. 12) The mean detachment rate during assembly can then be obtained as Ka = 1/Ta = 1/(p¯1Ta1 + p¯2Ta2), i.e. as shown in Equation 13.Ka =(k1+k2)k2ka(k1+ k2)2+k1ka(Eq. 13) Similarly, the mean detachment rate during disassembly are as follows,Kd=1/Td=1/(ρ¯1Td1+ρ¯2Td2) =(k3+k4)k4kd(k3+ k4)2+k3kd(Eq. 14) with steady state probabilities ρ¯1 = k4/(k3 + k4), ρ¯2 = k3/(k3 + k4). Let Tc1 and Tc2 be the MFPTs of an MT to catastrophe from substates 1 and 2, respectively, and then Tc1 and Tc2 satisfy (see Fig. 2b).Tc1=1k1+kc+k1k1+kcTc2, Tc2=1k2+Tc1(Eq. 15) The mean rate of catastrophe is then Kc = 1/Tc = 1/(p¯1Tc1 + p¯2Tc2). The explicit expression can be obtained by replacing ka with kc in Equation 13.Kc=(k1+k2)k2kc(k1+ k2)2+k1kc(Eq. 16) Similarly, the mean rate of rescue is as follows.Kr=(k3+k4)k4kr(k3+ k4)2+k3kr(Eq. 17) From the experimental data in Ref. 27Akiyoshi B.

Because the processes 1 → 2 and 2′ ← 1′ are accomplished by binding a tubulin unit to, and releasing tubulin unit from, the tip of a PF (see FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2b), I assume that k1 and k3 are force-independent.

Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar), the external force (F) dependence of rates k2, k4, ka, kd, kr, kc are assumed to be as follows.kl= kl0eFLδl/kBT, l=2,4,a,d,r,c(Eq. 18) Henceforth, the external force F is positive if it points in the direction of MT growth. Meanwhile, the rate k1 should depend on the concentration of free GTP-tubulin in solution. Similar to the method in Ref. 26Fisher M.E. Kolomeisky A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7748-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, I simply assume k1 = k10[tubulin]. For a better understanding of the external force-dependent properties of MTs and the experimental verification of the two-state model, in the following, I will define altogether 11 critical forces. Corresponding numerical results will be presented in the next section. This is defined by Vg(Fc1) = Vs (Fc1), i.e. at Fc1, the average speeds of assembly and disassembly are the same. From Equations 5 and 6, one sees that Fc1 satisfies the following.k1k2(Fc1)[k3+k4(Fc1)] =k3k4(Fc1)[k1+k2(Fc1)](Eq. 19) At this critical value of force, the mean velocity of MT growth is zero. Formulation (3Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) gives k1kr(Fc2) = k3kc (Fc2), i.e. the following.Fc2 =kBT(δr−δc) Llnk3kc0k1kr0 =kBT(δr−δc )Llnk3kc0k10kr0[tubulin](Eq. 20) At this critical value of force, p1 + p2 = ρ1 + ρ2, i.e. the probabilities that MTs in assembly and disassembly states are the same. From expressions in Equation 2, one easily sees Fc3 that satisfies the following.kr(Fc3)k4(Fc3)[k1=k2(Fc3)]=kc(Fc3)k2(Fc3)[k3+k4(Fc3)](Eq. 21) At this critical value of force, the detachment rates during assembly and disassembly states are the same. In view of Equations 13 and 14, one can get Fc4 by Ka(Fc4) = Kd(Fc4). At this critical value of force, the mean dwell times of an MT in assembly and disassembly states are the same. Let Tg1 and Tg2 be the MFPTs of the bead to detachment or catastrophe of the MT with initial substates 1 and 2, respectively. Then, Tg1, Tg2 satisfy (see Fig. 2b and Refs. 37Redner S. A Guide to First-Passage Processes. Cambridge University Press, 2001Crossref Google Scholar and 38Pury P.A. Cáceres M.O. J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 2003; 36: 2695-2706Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Tg1 =1k1+ ka+kc+k1k1+ ka+kcTg2,Tg2=1k2+Tg1(Eq. 22) The solutions are as follows.Tg1=k1+k2k2(ka+ kc), Tg2=k1+ka+kc+k2k2(ka+ kc)(Eq. 23) The mean dwell time of an MT in assembly (or growth) state is then as follows.Tg=p¯1Tg1+p¯2Tg2=(k1+k2)2+k1(ka+kc)k2(k1+ k2)(ka+kc)(Eq. 24) Similarly, the mean dwell time of an MT in disassembly (or shortening) state can be obtained as follows.Ts=(k3+k4)2+k3(kd+kr)k4(k3+ k4)(kd+kr)(Eq. 25) The critical force Fc5 can then be obtained by Tg(Fc5) = Ts (Fc5). At this critical value of force, the mean lifetime of the bead on MT attains its maximum, i.e. T(Fc6) = maxFT(F) with T given by formulation 8. At this critical value of force, the mean growth length of MT attains its maximum. The mean growth length of an MT can be obtained by l+ = VT with V, T satisfy formulations 3 and 8, respectively. At this critical value of force, the mean shortening length of MT attains its maximum. The mean shortening length of an MT can be obtained by l− = −VT with V, T satisfy formulations 3 and 8, respectively. The rates of catastrophe and rescue are the same, i.e. Kc(Fc9) = Kr(Fc9) (see Equations 16 and 17). Under critical force Fc9, the average switch time between growth and shortening, i.e. 1/Kc and 1/Kr, are the same. This indicates that the mean duration for each growth and each shortening period is the same. At this critical value of force, VgTg = VgTs. Here, VgTg =: lg is the mean growth length before bead detachment or catastrophe, and VsTs =: lg is the mean shortening length before bead detachment or rescue. The formulations of Vg, Vg and Tg, Ts are in Equations 5 and 6 and 24 and 25. At this critical value of force, Vg/Kc = Vs/Kr. Here, Vg/Kc =: lg* is the mean growth length before catastrophe, and Vs/Kr = ls* is the mean shortening length before rescue. The formulations of Kc, Kr are in Equations 16 and 17. It needs to be clarified that the definitions for Fc1, Fc2, Fc3, Fc9, Fc11 are unrelated to bead detachment, but the definitions for Fc4, Fc5, Fc6, Fc7, Fc8, Fc10 are related. Therefore, the values of Fc1, Fc2, Fc3, Fc9, Fc11 obtained in this theoretical study can be verified by various experimental methods as described (13Grishchuk E.L. Molodtsov M.I. Ataullakhanov F.I.

https://openalex.org/W1975822702,"Global expression analysis of fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (FL HSCs) revealed the presence of unspliced pre-mRNA for a number of genes in normal FL HSCs. In a subset of these genes, Crebbp+/− FL HSCs had less unprocessed pre-mRNA without a corresponding reduction in total mRNA levels. Among the genes thus identified were the key regulators of HSC function Itga4, Msi2 and Tcf4. A similar but much weaker effect was apparent in Ep300+/− FL HSCs, indicating that, in this context as in others, the two paralogs are not interchangeable. As a group, the down-regulated intronic probe sets could discriminate adult HSCs from more mature cell types, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is regulated with differentiation stage and is active in both fetal and adult hematopoiesis. Consistent with increased myelopoiesis in Crebbp hemizygous mice, targeted reduction of CREBBP abundance by shRNA in the multipotent EML cell line triggered spontaneous myeloid differentiation in the absence of the normally required inductive signals. In addition, differences in protein levels between phenotypically distinct EML subpopulations were better predicted by taking into account not only the total mRNA signal but also the amount of unspliced message present. CREBBP thus appears to selectively influence the timing and degree of pre-mRNA processing of genes essential for HSC regulation and thereby has the potential to alter subsequent cell fate decisions in HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1995724741,"Background The Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is an InsP3 gated intracellular Ca2+-release channel. Characterization of Drosophila mutants for the InsP3R has demonstrated that InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release is required in Drosophila larvae for growth and viability. Methodology/Principal Findings To understand the molecular basis of these growth defects a genome wide microarray analysis has been carried out with larval RNA obtained from a strong InsP3R mutant combination in which 1504 independent genes were differentially regulated with a log2 of fold change of 1 or more and P<0.05. This was followed by similar transcript analyses from InsP3R mutants where growth defects were either suppressed by introduction of a dominant suppressor or rescued by ectopic expression of an InsP3R transgene in the Drosophila insulin like peptide-2 (Dilp2) producing cells. Conclusions/Significance These studies show that expression of transcripts related to carbohydrate and amine metabolism is altered in InsP3 receptor mutant larvae. Moreover, from a comparative analysis of genes that are regulated in the suppressed and rescued conditions with the mutant condition, it appears that the organism could use different combinations of pathways to restore a ‘normal’ growth state."

https://openalex.org/W2015955697,"During rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), observers often miss the second of two targets if it appears within 500 ms of the first. This phenomenon, called the attentional blink (AB), is widely held to reflect a bottleneck in the processing of rapidly sequential stimuli that arises after initial sensory registration is complete (i.e., at a relatively late, post-perceptual stage of processing). Contrary to this view, recent fMRI studies have found that activity in the primary visual area (V1), which represents the earliest cortical stage of visual processing, is attenuated during the AB. Here we asked whether such changes in V1 activity during the AB arise in the initial feedforward sweep of stimulus input, or instead reflect the influence of feedback signals from higher cortical areas.EEG signals were recorded while participants monitored a sequential stream of distractor letters for two target digits (T1 and T2). Neural responses associated with an irrelevant probe stimulus presented simultaneously with T2 were measured using an ERP marker--the C1 component--that reflects initial perceptual processing of visual information in V1. As expected, T2 accuracy was compromised when the inter-target interval was brief, reflecting an AB deficit. Critically, however, the magnitude of the early C1 component evoked by the probe was not reduced during the AB.Our finding that early sensory processing of irrelevant probe stimuli is not suppressed during the AB is consistent with theoretical models that assume that the bottleneck underlying the AB arises at a post-perceptual stage of processing. This suggests that reduced neural activity in V1 during the AB is driven by re-entrant signals from extrastriate areas that regulate early cortical activity via feedback connections with V1."
