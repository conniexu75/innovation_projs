https://openalex.org/W2034834397,"The reversal of the carbon monoxide inhibition by bands of monochromatic light was determined for the oxidative demethylation of codeine and monomethyl-4-aminopyrine and the hydroxylation of acetanilide by rat liver microsomes and for the hydroxylation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone at carbon-21 by bovine adrenocortical microsomes. Maximum reversal occurred at 450 millimicrons, the light absorption maximum of the CO compound of the CO-binding pigment of microsomes. The agreement between photochemical action spectrum and spectrophotometric difference spectrum supports the conclusion that the CO-binding pigment is the terminal oxidase of mixed function oxidase systems of mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2063041590,"When frog muscle fibers from which the sarcolemma had been dissected away were perfused with a calcium solution and then treated with oxalate, electron-opaque material, probably calcium oxalate, accumulated in the terminal sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These regions of calcium accumulation were identified with the intracellular calcium sink that controls the relaxation phase of the contraction-relaxation cycle; their proximity to tubules implicated in intracellular stimulus conduction suggests that they might also be regions from which calcium is released to trigger contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2015714550,"The addition of small amounts of a commercial heparin solution, or a synthetic polysaccharide-sulfuric ester similar in structure to heparin, to the medium in which bone tissue is cultured markedly enhances the amount of bone resorption obtained with suboptimal concentrations of parathyroid extract or other factors which stimulate bone resorption. It is suggested that heparin be considered a ""cofactor"" which stimulates bone resorption and which may play an important role in physiological or pathological resorption."
https://openalex.org/W2039344929,In germinating cotton embryos the partial inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D does not inhibit the incorporation of leucine-(14)C into soluble protein nor cause a loss of polyribosomes during the first 16 hours of germination. This suggests that the protein synthesis observed during this period is directed by messenger RNA which exists in the mature seed and which is not rapidly degraded and resynthesized.
https://openalex.org/W2026366939,"Clinically equivalent doses of hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone have progressively increasing teratogenic activity as judged by their ability to induce cleft palate in the offspring of pregnant mice treated with these drugs during the middle period of gestation. Mole for mole, dexamethasone is at least 300 times more teratogenic than hydrocortisone. The enhanced teratogenicity of dexamethasone probably does not result from its relatively decreased mineralocorticoid activity."

https://openalex.org/W1991794692,"The gibberellin content of pea seeds developing in excised pea pods cultured on a medium containing the plant growth retardant AMO-1618 was reduced in comparison with pea seeds cultured on retardant-free medium. The reduction increased with increasing concentrations of AMO-1618. However, at the lowest concentration tested (5 milligrams per liter) the growth of the seeds was not affected whereas their gibberellin content was significantly reduced. In conjunction with earlier work on the effect of growth retardants on gibberellin biosynthesis in the fungus Fusarium moniliforme, these results indicate that AMO-1618 inhibits the biosynthesis of gibberellins in tissues of higher plants in much the same manner it does in Fusarium."

When similarly exposed to the recorded echolocation pulses of another bat, presented at the same intensity as the ""moth"" sounds, they were not so affected."

https://openalex.org/W72458578,"Flavokinase, which catalyzes the formation of flavin mononucleotide from riboflavin and adenosine triphosphate, has been partially purified from rat liver by such conventional means as fractionation with ammonium sulfate and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose (2). A greater separation of flavokinase from interfering acid phosphatases which catalyze hydrolysis of FMN’ (3, 4) was deemed desirable, but more extensive purification of the kinase necessitated the development of more selective treatments. Also it has been suggested recently that pure flavokinase has a specific activity of approximately 100 mpmoles of FMN synthesized per mg of protein per hour at 30”, regardless of the sources from which the enzyme is obtained (5). The apparent homogeneity of a preparation of a bean kinase upon electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation, together with comparable specific activities of this flavokinase and those partially purified by other investigators from several sources in&ding liver, were cited as evidence for this maximum specific activity. As specific activities considerably above that suggested for “pure” flavokinase had been obtained in this laboratory with the liver enzyme, even in the presence of some contaminating phosphatase (2), it seemed that greater purification of the kinase could be accomplished and would reveal the maximum specific activity suggested by others (5) to be unrealistically low. Chromatographic techniques which utilize the specific complexing of substrate-like compounds with enzymes have found occasional use in the purification of enzymes. An example of such a technique is afforded by the work of Lerman (6), who enriched mushroom tyrosinase by passage through columns of p-azophenol-cellulose derivatives. Studies on the substrate specificity of liver flavokinase (2, 7, 8) indicate that the enzyme exhibits moderate binding to several flavin substrates and competitive inhibitors. Among variations of the side chain in position 9 of the isoalloxazine system which permit reactivity are substrates with a I’-n-ribityl or competitive inhibitors with a methyl substituent present. Considerable tolerance in size and inductive effect of 6and 7-substituents is also observed. These findings suggested the chromatographic use of 9-(l’-n-ribityl)and 9-methylflavins bearing in either position 6 or 7 an acetamido"
https://openalex.org/W1963926406,"A marked increase in synthesis or availability of messenger RNA which can accommodate eight to ten ribosomes was observed in the chick embryo lens between 11 and 12 days of development. The increase is seen in a shift from polyribosomes consisting of predominantly two to five single ribosomes to polyribosomes of predominantly eight to ten ribosomes in lens cells. Short-lived (half-life, 3 hours) and long-lived (half-life, 30 hours) messenger RNA's coexist in whole lenses on the 14th day of development."

https://openalex.org/W2036083525,"The pyramidal tract of the slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) is found in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord and extends throughout its entire length. Such a course is typical of primates. In the Malayan tree shrew (Tupaia glis) the tract occupies a position in the ventral portion of the dorsal funiculus, and in our studies it could not be traced beyond the thoracic cord. In the spinal cord of the slow loris, pyramidal fibers are distributed to the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral gray columns of both sides, while in the tree shrew they are largely restricted to the dorsal horn and do not cross to the opposite side."

https://openalex.org/W2071498472,"Purified reoviruses types 1, 2, and 3 were specifically inhibited in their hemagglutination of human erythrocytes by 250 micromoles or more of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine but not by over 20 other sugars tested. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine inhibited reovirus hemaglutination by binding to capsid virus; it did not attach to the erythrocytes. It is possible that reovirus hemagglutination involves union between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine on the surface of the red cell and the glycoprotein of the virus coat."

https://openalex.org/W2061254962,"Olive's demonstration that a bubble bursting at the basidiospore apiculus breaks the connection between spore and sterigma convincingly explains the mechanism of severance; but it does not explain spore discharge, because the bursting force is not applied in the appropriate direction. The form of the developing spore and sterigma shows that the spore is forcibly abstricted while the membrane is still fluid. If the abstricting force persists until the fracture of the sterigma, it provides a mechanism whereby the spore is reliably discharged."

https://openalex.org/W2764376923,"Mice of the C57BL strain are highly resistant to the oncogenic property of LID-1 polyoma virus, but complete thymectomy within 24 hours of birth rendered these mice susceptible. In thymectomized mice inoculated with adult syngeneic spleen cells, the capacity to resist oncogenesis was restored. The results add further weight to the concept that induction and progression of tumors by polyoma virus has an immunologic basis."

https://openalex.org/W1992838340,"Interference between two ""sex-ratio"" agents—that is, treponemalike spirochetes—of different origin, one from Drosophila willistoni and the other from D. nebulosa, was demonstrated by experiments in vivo and in vitro. When the two sex-ratio agents were combined in females of the Oregon-R strain of D. melanogaster, expression of the sex-ratio condition was temporarily interrupted. Several lines of evidence indicate that a substance produced by the sex-ratio agent of D. nebulosa may kill or incapacitate the sex-ratio agent of D. willistoni."

The method depends upon finding a range of stimulus intervals where complete mechanical fusion exists and where there is a plateau in the heat production. At 0 degrees C, and when muscles are at normal body length, activation heat represents about 40 percent of the heat in an isometric twitch."
